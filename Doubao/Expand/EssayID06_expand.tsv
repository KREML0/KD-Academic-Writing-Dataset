1	14834	6	3	There were many obstacles that the builders faced in attempting to have dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building. Safety was a significant issue with the dirigibles because of the highly flammable gas hydrogen. So, if the dirigibles were to explode over New York, many people could be killed in this very populated city. Another problem is keeping the dirigible stable so people can get off while the wind moves the back end of itself. The only way was to tie lead weights down in the back of the dirigible, but it would be extremely dangerous over the people down below. Due to these obstacles that the workers faced and were unable to overcome, they decided to make the world's highest soda fountain and tea garden for tourists in the observation area instead.
2	14835	6	3	From the start, there would have been many problems with allowing dirigibles to dock some @NUM1 feet in the air. The major problem here would be that the Empire State building was being constructed in New York City, a highly populated area. Below the mooring mast would be several other buildings where other people worked and lived. If something happened while the dirigible was attempting to dock, it could potentially take out the building and endanger the lives of the people in it. Not only that, but below were the busy city streets, where numerous pedestrians walked. In paragraphs @NUM2, the passage also talks about the stress of a heavy, steel - framed airship mooring at the top of the building. The frame would need to be very dense and, as the architects of the project discovered, it would be quite expensive. Other safety issues include the high winds that would easily drift the dirigibles off course, and the safety of dirigibles themselves. The passage mentions the Hindenburg incident, as well as the great worry the owners of the building had about such a disaster happening over such a densely populated area. All these factors made the idea of dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building highly unfeasible.
3	14836	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One significant obstacle was that the dirigible would have to be held by a single cable tether. This would add a great deal of stress to the building's frame. In order to make the frame sturdier, there were extensive modifications to the building's framework which cost over sixty thousand dollars. Another obstacle the builders faced was the dirigible's use of hydrogen which is highly flammable. Since New York was a densely populated area, an accident involving a hydrogen - filled dirigible would not work out well at all. The dirigibles would also have to be weighted down in the back with lead weights. In order to do so, the lead weights would end up dangling high above pedestrians on the busy street which was a major safety issue. One last obstacle the builders faced was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made it completely illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or approach the area. Due to these insurmountable obstacles, the plan to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was ultimately abandoned.
4	14837	6	3	"In the passage The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in the building of the Empire State Building and in allowing dirigibles to dock there. One reason is that Al Smith (four - term governor of New York who headed efforts to construct the Empire State Building after his years in office) had made the tower tall. The height of the building was 1,250 ft. But after almost losing the title of world's tallest tower, he announced that there would be a top or hat put on the tower. Another reason is the tower was made for Dirigibles (blimps) that could transport people from New York to New Jersey. Smith wanted a place where dirigibles could dock off. But it never happened because the German dirigible ""Hindenburg"" was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey. On May 6, 1937, the owners of the State building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it was over New York. In the 1930's, the idea was dropped after another dirigible was trying to perform a stunt. As a result, the Empire State Building never got to fulfill what it was originally intended for."
5	14838	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle they faced was the existing law against airships flying too low in urban areas. This strict law made it completely illegal for the dirigible to tie up on the building. Another obstacle faced in allowing dirigibles to dock was safety. Most dirigibles used hydrogen which was highly flammable. If a dirigible caught fire over the densely populated area of New York, there would be a very high chance that many people would be seriously hurt. A final obstacle faced was ""nature itself."" The winds on the top of the Empire State building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even though a dirigible would be attached to the mooring mast, the back of it would move around the mooring mast in a dangerous and unpredictable way. Many obstacles were faced by the workers of the Empire State Building in order to allow a dirigible to dock there, and these obstacles ultimately made the idea of dirigible docking at the building unworkable."
6	14839	6	3	Soon after its conception, the Empire State Building's mooring mast was doomed to fail. In the early stages, the engineers quickly identified the issue of added stress on the building's frame caused by the weight of a moored airship. This was a significant concern as it could potentially compromise the structural integrity of the entire building. However, they managed to fix this problem through structural modifications to the building's frame. Although this was an expensive endeavor, it was a fairly straightforward procedure that involved reinforcing key load - bearing components. One of the most significant blows to the project was the advent of the Hindenburg disaster. This tragic event was at the forefront of a sharp decline in the popularity and viability of airships. As a result, airplanes emerged as a safer, faster, and more appealing form of transportation. In addition to the Hindenburg disaster, it soon became clear that mooring an airship at @NUM1' or higher was not feasible. The surging winds at such heights were so strong that they would not allow the airship to maintain its course, causing the ship to be blown erratically around the mast. The final nail in the coffin for the mooring mast was a law prohibiting airship travel over urban areas. These multiple factors effectively disallowed any possibility of successful airship travel in the future, leaving the mooring mast as a relic of an unfulfilled vision.
7	14840	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building were faced with numerous obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The architects carefully analyzed the situation and realized that they could not simply put the mooring mast on top of the building without first modifying and strengthening the steel frame. The stress of the dirigible's load, combined with the powerful wind pressure, would add an excessive amount of weight to the framework. This additional stress could potentially cause the framework to collapse, endangering the entire structure. To address this, they strengthened the framework from the very bottom of the building all the way to the top. They took great care in ensuring that every part of the structure could withstand the added forces. Only after this extensive strengthening process did they put the shiny glass and chrome - nickel stainless steel tower on the top of the building. Despite facing these significant obstacles, the builders were successful in completing their goal of constructing the mooring mast. Although the mooring mast is not used as a docking station today, it is still looked at as the final piece that makes the Empire State Building stand out above all buildings in downtown New York City, a symbol of the building's ambitious and forward - thinking design.
8	14841	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, many complications occurred during the plans and construction of the attempted docking mast. One major obstacle was that dirigibles were just too heavy. The weight of these large airships would place an enormous strain on the metal frame of the building, so the frame would have to be modified to support the load. After painstakingly repairing and reinforcing the framework of the Empire State Building, two trial runs were conducted. The @ORGANIZATION3 dirigible ""Los Angeles"" and the Goodyear blimp ""Columbia"" were used to test the feasibility of the docking system. The results of the experiment were disappointing. The wind current, in reality, was so strong that it physically didn't allow the blimp to come close enough to the building to dock. Also, ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban cities"" was an obstacle they could not surpass. This law was in place to ensure the safety of the people living in urban areas. Within years of postponing their efforts, airplanes made way and dirigibles, as a form of transportation, were long forgotten, leaving the docking mast project as a failed attempt in the history of aviation and architecture."
9	14842	6	3	The obstacles the builders faced were great. They first explained how most dirigibles from outside the @LOCATION1 use a different gas called hydrogen, which is highly flammable. This was a major safety concern, especially in an urban environment. Following that, they informed @LOCATION1 about the Hindenburg disaster in 1937. The Hindenburg, which used hydrogen, was engulfed in fire, a terrifying sight that demonstrated the extreme danger of using this gas. They realized that if such an incident had happened in an urban area, the consequences could have been far worse, potentially causing widespread destruction and loss of life. Another obstacle they faced was the wind. If the dirigible was parked at the mooring mast, the violent wind speeds at that height would make the blimp shift constantly. This shifting would cause stress on the building's steel frame, which could gradually weaken the structure over time. The greatest obstacle, however, was the law passed. The law clearly stated that no airships could fly too low in urban areas. This strict regulation would keep blimps from landing there, effectively putting an end to the builders' plans for a functional mooring mast.
10	14843	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building had a great idea. They wanted to be able to tether dirigibles, or blimps, to the top of the building, envisioning a new era of urban air transportation. However, there were many problems with this idea. First of all, blimps themselves were not very sturdy. The strong winds in the urban skyline could easily blow dirigibles trying to dock into the spires of other buildings. This posed a significant risk not only to the blimps but also to the surrounding structures. Dirigibles also started to use hydrogen gas rather than Helium. Hydrogen gas is extremely flammable, and even the smallest sparking could set the whole blimp ablaze. This was a major safety hazard, especially in a densely populated area like New York City. The docking system itself was also a problem. The only way to keep a dirigible level was to hang lead weights off the side. One major concern was that a weight could fall off and plummet into the densely populated city below. This could have proved very disastrous, causing property damage and potentially harming innocent people. These multiple issues made the idea of tethering dirigibles to the Empire State Building unfeasible, leaving it as an interesting but ultimately failed concept.
11	14844	6	3	The Empire State Building's docking zone was a truly magnificent and innovative idea when it was initially conceived. It held the promise of revolutionizing air travel. However, it turned out to be extremely difficult to implement. Al Smith, who led the operation, was overly eager to complete it. In his rush, not enough time was dedicated to researching the risks and the structural requirements of the dock. As a result, the plan to mount it on top of the Empire State Building was bound to fail from the start. Even before the construction began, problems started to emerge. The building simply couldn't withstand the stress of the @DATE1 - foot long dirigible. The shock to the building would have transferred a tremendous amount of pressure to the foundation. So, the roof would have to be completely re - done to ensure it was structurally sound. After spending many months and @NUM1 dollars, the construction of the landing dock could finally commence. Life is of utmost value, and the landing dock was far too volatile and dangerous to be used. The architects made a crucial oversight by not considering that most foreign dirigibles were made of hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable. In @LOCATION1, the Hindenburg, which was constructed using hydrogen, caught fire and killed hundreds of people. There was even a law stating that aircraft could not be suspended so close to an urban area. The idea was indeed ostentatious and showy, but due to the hasty approach, necessary precautions were not taken. The numerous obstacles that the docking station faced were insurmountable, so eventually, the plan to erect it was abandoned.
12	14845	6	3	"During the construction of the Empire State Building with the aim of allowing dirigibles to dock, the builders constantly encountered a series of obstacles. Architects found it impossible to place a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building. The @NUM1 ft dirigibles would impose significant stress on the building's framework. As a result, the architects had to modify the framework, which would cost them an additional @MONEY1 for these modifications. Moreover, the architects were uncertain whether these modifications would actually be effective. Safety was another major concern. Foreign dirigibles typically used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. For instance, ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place over a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" The architects also had to worry about @ORGANIZATION2 and the continuous shifting of the winds caused by violent air currents. As described, ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" Usually, @CAPS1 dirigibles land in open fields where they are weighed down to prevent drifting. However, it is impossible to weigh down a dirigible in the air. They dangle high above pedestrians on the streets, making it extremely unsafe. There is also a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to a building or even approach the area."" There were two attempts to dock on the building. The first attempt was in December 1930, when the @ORGANIZATION3 dirigible Los Angeles tried to dock but couldn't get close enough due to high - velocity winds. ""By the late 1930s, the idea of using the mooring mast for dirigibles and their passengers had quietly faded away."" Airplanes became the future of transportation."
13	14846	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles while trying to construct this remarkable building to accommodate dirigible docking. One significant obstacle was ensuring that the stress from the dirigible on the building was properly transferred to the foundation rather than the top or middle, which could potentially cause the building to collapse. As stated in the text, ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. Over @MONEY1 worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" In fact, @CAPS1 the building had to undergo extensive changes in multiple aspects to make it stable enough for dirigible docking. Another major obstacle was the weather conditions above the building, which featured strong winds and air currents. This meant that the dirigible would be ""dangling high above pedestrians on the street,"" and having highly flammable hydrogen floating around above millions of people was extremely unsafe. Additionally, an obstacle related to these dirigibles was the significant amount of time and effort required to learn how to safely install a mooring mast. This involved people consulting professionals such as those from the Navy to find out the proper installation methods. In conclusion, the mooring mast on the Empire State Building presented many challenges that hindered the goal of allowing dirigible docking."
14	14847	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced a multitude of obstacles in their efforts to enable dirigibles to dock at the mooring mast. Al Smith, the architect and the driving force behind the idea of the Empire State Building, was in a competition with the maker of the Chrysler building to construct the world's tallest building. In order to make the Empire State Building taller than the Chrysler building, Smith planned to build something that, as John Tauranac stated, ""Would be equipped for an age of transportation that was only the dream of aviation pioneers."" That dream was to travel by blimp. The Empire State Building was going to have a mooring mast at its top for airship docking. However, it was far from being as simple as the concept. The architects couldn't just place a mooring mast on the roof because it would put excessive stress on the building's frame. The most crucial reason the mast would never fulfill its intended purpose was safety. As the excerpt mentions, ""Most dirigibles used hydrogen,"" and hydrogen is highly flammable. There was also a law ""against airships flying too low over urban areas."" After numerous attempts and various modifications, it became clear that the idea was unfeasible, and it was ultimately shelved."
15	14848	6	3	The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in their attempts to allow dirigibles to dock there included the lack of a suitable landing area. A mooring mast was to be added to the top of the building, which would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or servicing, and to facilitate the boarding and disembarking of passengers. The electric winch was designed to haul in a line from the front of the ship and then tie it to the mast. Once tethered, the body of the dirigible could swing gently in the breeze, and passengers could safely get on and off the dirigible by walking down a gang @CAPS1 to an open observation platform. To address these complex requirements, the builders of the Empire State Building consulted with experts. They even took tours of the equipment and mooring operations at the U.S. Naval Air Station in Lakehurst, New Jersey, hoping to gain valuable insights and knowledge. Despite these efforts, the challenges remained significant, and the feasibility of the docking plan was still in question.
16	14849	6	3	In Marcia Amidon L¸sted's excerpt, The Mooring Mast, many complex obstacles had the engineers of the Empire State Building earnestly looking for a new and effective way to dock dirigibles. One significant obstacle they had to face was the steel work of the building. The constant and intense pressure of the wind and the heavy load of the dirigibles had cost the company a substantial amount, specifically @MONEY1. Secondly, they had to carefully design a few special floors for the passengers of the dirigibles. One floor would be dedicated for storing baggage and suitcases, while a well - structured special observation deck was set up to allow passengers to safely exit or enter the ship. Lastly, the building would now be 102 floors and would need to be extremely durable. So, special high - quality materials were needed to be brought in and skillfully used to create the building. All in all, the Empire State Building engineers had to overcome many arduous obstacles when constructing the 1,250 ft. building, which stands as a testament to their perseverance and engineering prowess.
17	14850	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Buildings had numerous problems in allowing dirigibles to dock there. Issues such as the strong wind, the actual complex docking process, and ensuring the people could get off safely were major concerns. The actual docking was highly impractical as it would be nearly impossible to precisely connect the winch. The wind was the main culprit for the fate of the mast. First, the wind current was so extremely strong that the pilot would have an incredibly difficult time getting close enough to the mooring mast. For instance, the captain of the ""Navy dirigible Los Angeles"" approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of the forceful winds. Also, even if it could tie up, the back of the dirigible would swing around fiercely, endangering both the dirigible and the building. So, the builders were dealing with an almost insurmountable and impractical task, which ultimately led to the non - functionality of the mooring mast."
18	14851	6	3	The first significant obstacle that it faced was having to painstakingly reconstruct the body frame so that it could firmly support the mooring mast. The second issue is that dirigibles from other countries commonly used hydrogen, which is highly flammable, instead of the safer helium. This posed a great fire risk in a populated area like New York City. The third reason, which should have been apparent from the very start, was a strict law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law was in place to protect the safety of the people on the ground. The last reason is the harsh wind conditions at that high altitude made it utterly impossible for the dirigibles to land there without the tail swaying violently in the wind. In conclusion, these multiple obstacles combined made it unfeasible for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
19	14852	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there included significant stress to the building's frame. The stress resulting from the dirigible's heavy load and the powerful wind pressure would have to be effectively transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. This required a careful and comprehensive assessment of the building's structural integrity. The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be meticulously modified and significantly strengthened to accommodate this new and demanding situation. Over sixty thousand dollars worth of detailed and high - cost modifications had to be made to the building's framework. These efforts, while showing the builders' determination, also highlight the magnitude of the challenges they faced in making dirigible docking a reality at the Empire State Building.
20	14853	6	3	"The @CAPS1 The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, vividly shows the thoughtful, intelligent, yet obstacle - filled ideas of attaching a landing dock to the Empire State Building. The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building had to overcome were quite daunting. The wind speeds where the dirigibles would land were extremely strong and would violently whip the balloon around like a rag doll. To counter this, they would ""have to use lead weights"", which would pose another serious problem, raising questions about the foundation of the building. The combined weight of the building and the lead weights might potentially collapse the structure. The gases they use, ""hydrogen and helium"", make the balloon fly, but hydrogen ""is highly flammable and can't be used in populated areas"", presenting a significant safety hazard. There was also ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"". These are the insurmountable obstacles and the reason ""the mooring mast of The Empire State Building was destined never to fulfill its purpose"", leaving it as a well - intended but ultimately unworkable feature."
21	14854	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous challenges as they tried to enable dirigibles to dock there. One of the major hurdles was creating a mooring mast that wouldn't endanger the building's structure. To achieve this, the builders had to carefully modify and significantly strengthen the frame of the Empire State Building. As stated in the excerpt, ""over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the framework."" Another significant obstacle was safety. Given the height of the Empire State Building, it would have been illegal to land a dirigible. At that time, dirigibles were filled with hydrogen, a highly flammable gas. If a dirigible were to explode, it would pose a serious threat to the hundreds of pedestrians on the streets of New York City. In conclusion, these obstacles made it extremely difficult for the builders to realize the goal of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building."
22	14855	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. As described, ""The stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" The strong wind currents at such a height would cause the dirigible to drag the building with it, as the wind force was very powerful. The combined weight of the dirigible and the pressure of the wind might even cause the building to collapse. Al Smith, realizing that he was close to losing the title of the world's tallest building, on December 11, 1929, announced that the Empire State Building would now reach the height of 1,250 feet. He didn't want to lose the title, so he decided to make the building taller. However, the taller the building got, the stronger the wind currents became, adding more stress to the building. Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe. Dirigibles are best landed in wide - open areas where there is no risk of harm to the blimp, citizens, and passengers. The gases used to inflate the dirigible to make it lighter than air are highly flammable. These are some of the challenges the builders of the Empire State Building had to overcome."
23	14856	6	3	"In the reading ""The Mooring Mast"" written by Marcia Amidon Lusted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced a significant obstacle when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. At that time, dirigibles were considered the transportation of the future. As stated, ""The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area"" (@NUM1). This quote clearly shows that the dirigible would need to find a proper landing area, and the existing space was insufficient. Moreover, ""some were as long as one thousand feet, the same length as four blocks in New York City"" (@NUM2). The extreme length of the dirigibles made it evident that there was not enough space. It also raised the question of how the architects could come up with a plan to make it fit properly. Therefore, the lack of a suitable area was a major obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building had to deal with. In conclusion, this shortage of space severely hampered the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building."
24	14857	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced difficult circumstances and many obstacles during the task of designing a brand - new Empire State Building to accompany this new means of travel. Their mission was to design the top of the Empire State Building to accommodate the mooring of blimps over one thousand feet in the air. The first obstacle was designing a landing area. This was a challenging task because the required architecture had never before been created or even attempted in the past. A second obstacle was ensuring that the Empire State Building could withstand the stress created by the blimp. Paragraph @NUM1 says ""The stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" The difficulty with this obstacle was having to refurbish the steel frame at the Empire State Building, which took a great deal of time, hard work, and over sixty thousand dollars. As the text mentions, ""The greatest obstacles to successful mooring was nature itself."" There were violent wind currents at the top of the building, and the blimps were never very stable. With many pedestrians under a moored dirigible, this was a very dangerous situation. Lastly, the pre - existing laws of airships flying low over urban areas posed a new problem. Even if the architecture was successful, the laws disallowed the blimps in the first place. Planes were also becoming more popular, further complicating the situation. In conclusion, these multiple obstacles made it extremely difficult for the builders to achieve the goal of allowing blimps to moor at the Empire State Building."
25	14858	6	3	"In building the Empire State Building, the builders faced some problems in allowing dirigibles to dock there. One of the obstacles was creating a way for dirigibles to dock at about 1,250 feet above the ground. The strong air currents and the changing wind directions made it difficult for the pilots to steer the dirigibles close enough to the mast for docking. The wind could suddenly change direction, pushing the dirigible away from the intended docking point. A final problem that the builders faced was a law that ""airships flying too low over urban areas"" (@NUM1). This meant that if a dirigible were docked at the Empire State Building, it would be too low over an urban area, which was against the law. In conclusion, these problems, including the docking difficulty and the legal restrictions, made it a great challenge for the builders to enable dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building."
26	14859	6	3	The idea of mooring dirigibles to the top of the building that soared 1,250 feet above the bustling streets of downtown New York was a truly fascinating and amazing concept. This innovative idea held the promise of bringing New York into a whole new “age of transportation” (@NUM1). Unfortunately, this wonderful idea had a few flaws in the plans. Later, the architects constructing the mooring mast discovered that their vision was not going to be realized. The idea had too many significant obstacles to overcome. The fact that “most dirigibles outside the U.S used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable” (@NUM2). If any mishap were to occur, it would be catastrophic considering the highly populated streets below. Also, “the greatest obstacle was nature itself” (@NUM3). There was simply too much unpredictable wind to keep the aircraft steady and under control. In conclusion, the reality was that the idea to moor dirigibles sounded great, but there were far too many risks to carry out the plan.
27	14860	6	3	In the excerpt “The Mooring @CAPS1”, by Marcia Amidon @CAPS2, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered numerous obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. The Empire State Building was ultimately destined to never fulfill its intended purpose due to a multitude of reasons and challenges. One of those reasons was that most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. Furthermore, the biggest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting because of violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mast. Using dirigibles at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe. Another obstacle was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area, although two dirigibles did attempt to reach the building. Eventually, the entire idea was dropped. In conclusion, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many difficult obstacles that made the plan unfeasible.
28	14861	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many significant obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One major obstacle they faced was the safety issue. As stated in paragraph @NUM1, most foreign dirigibles used the highly flammable element hydrogen rather than helium. A fire involving a hydrogen - filled dirigible would be extremely deadly in a densely populated area like downtown New York. Another obstacle the builders encountered was the wind. In paragraph @NUM2, it says, “The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents.” This would cause the untied back of the dirigible to thrash around and even “swivel around the mooring mast.” When a dirigible is moored in open fields, it can be weighted down with lead weights. However, doing this in open air above the Empire State Building would be extremely unsafe due to the pedestrians below. The final obstacle the builders faced was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. In paragraph @NUM3, it says, “This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area...” In conclusion, this is why the mooring mast for dirigibles of the Empire State Building never served its intended purpose.
29	14862	6	3	Based on the excerpt “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, there were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced when trying to allow dirigibles to land there. One of the major obstacles was the safety problems. The dirigibles had to come close enough to the Empire State Building so that they could tie the dirigible down. This put the dirigibles dangerously close to the people on the ground. There was a law that stated that airships couldn't fly too low over urban areas. There was a well - known disaster that happened in Lakehurst, New Jersey, and the authorities were trying to prevent a similar incident from occurring in New York (paragraph @NUM1). Another problem the builders faced was that the strong and erratic winds of nature did not allow dirigibles to get close enough to tie down to the mast. In conclusion, there were so many obstacles that the builders had to face that, in the end, it was not worth making the Empire State Building a dirigible dock.
30	14863	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many challenges in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock. The steel frame of the building needed to be carefully modified and significantly strengthened to create a suitable place for dirigibles to dock. Moreover, over sixty thousand dollars worth of detailed modifications had to be made. The last obstacle the builders had was that a thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building would add a substantial amount of stress to the building's frame. It was no easy task for the builders to build a mooring mast on top of the highest building, which stood at one thousand two hundred fifty feet. However, the architects managed to reach their goal by skillfully designing the mooring mast. In conclusion, although they overcame the design hurdle, the numerous obstacles still made the practicality of using the building for dirigible docking questionable.
31	14864	6	3	While building the Empire State Building, workers faced numerous obstacles when attempting to make it possible for dirigibles to dock there. A dirigible attached to the mast and the building would impose extra stress on the structure. So, builders had to carry out over sixty thousand dollars worth of reconstructions to reinforce the building's framework. Dirigibles typically dock with a line running from the front of the ship to the mast. Although they planned for the blimp to be able to sway in the wind, it was highly unrealistic for any ship to attach to the building during high - wind conditions. Other challenges in letting dirigibles dock at the building included safety hazards. The hydrogen used in most dirigibles from outside of the U.S. is extremely flammable. Moreover, builders did not take into account the pre - existing law against airships flying too low over urbanized areas, making it illegal for a dirigible to tie to the building. In conclusion, the task of having dirigibles attach to the Empire State Building was an impossible one right from the start.
32	14865	6	3	There were many reasons why architects had problems allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. One of the problems was that most dirigibles were @NUM1 ft long, and having such a large object dock would be too much for the building. There would only be a single cable tether, and this would add significant stress to the building's frame. As a result, the entire steel frame would have to be modified and strengthened, which would cost over sixty thousand dollars. The greatest reason why the mooring mast would never fulfill its purpose is safety. Most dirigibles from the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable, posing a serious risk. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring was nature itself. The winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to the violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around. Dirigibles are meant to land on open playing fields, but using them at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians, was clearly not safe. In conclusion, the idea of dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building faced insurmountable challenges.
33	14866	6	3	The obstacles the builders went through included the use of hydrogen, which is highly flammable. This flammability posed a great risk to the building and the surrounding area. Another obstacle was that the wind on the top of the building was constantly shifting due to violent air currents. These shifting winds made it extremely difficult to control the docking of dirigibles. The third issue was that when a dirigible was attached to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mast, making the docking process unstable. Last but not least, there was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made it illegal for dirigibles to approach the building for docking. In conclusion, these multiple obstacles made it nearly impossible for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
34	14867	6	3	There were many obstacles that builders had to face in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One significant obstacle was the wind. At higher elevations, the wind is much more powerful and unpredictable. This would make it very difficult to actually get the dirigible close to the mast as the strong wind could easily push the dirigible off - course. Also, the structure of the Empire State Building was a problem. The framework was not built to withstand the amount of weight that would be on top of the building when a dirigible was docked. Builders had to spend over @MONEY1 on fortifying the framework to make it more capable of handling the additional load. These are some of the major obstacles that builders had to face in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. In conclusion, these challenges made the goal of dirigible docking at the building a very difficult one to achieve.
35	14868	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Although the builders thought it to be a brilliant idea, they did not carefully consider the safety hazards they may have encountered, and how unrealistic the idea truly was. One of the greatest reasons the mooring mast was destined to be unable to fulfill its purpose was because of safety concerns. In paragraph @NUM1 it states ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen... and hydrogen is highly flammable."" When a dirigible was destroyed by fire in New Jersey, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse an accident like that would be if it occurred over a place as densely populated as downtown New York. Another very practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the top of the building was, as stated in paragraph @NUM2, ""there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This law would make it impossible for a dirigible to even approach the area, let alone be able to tie up to the building. In conclusion, it is very apparent that the builders of the Empire State Building faced many insurmountable issues in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock."
36	14869	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building seem completely oblivious to all the potential dangers that would stem from the mooring mast. One huge and significant factor in the danger was the extremely violent winds prevalent at that high elevation. The blimp, once attached, would be forcefully swung around on the tether leading to the building. This erratic movement could either cause substantial damage to the building's structure itself or severely damage the blimp. Also, if the blimp was in motion, it's a real puzzle how passengers would safely get on and off. They could easily fall off the loading dock, whether they were boarding or disembarking from the blimp. Moreover, passengers could even be blown off the open - air floor of the Empire State Building due to the strong winds. Another concerning factor was the high population density of New York City. If something like debris had fallen down to the busy streets, it could very likely kill a few unsuspecting pedestrians walking below. I would strongly think that the architects should have thoroughly considered all these factors before attempting to start the project, as overlooking them could lead to disastrous consequences.
37	14870	6	3	In the excerpt, “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the construction of the Empire State Building encountered numerous problems. One of these notable problems is that the governor of New York, Al Smith, had a strong desire for the building to be the tallest in the world. In order to achieve this lofty goal, a mast was required to break the existing height record. However, the mast made the building vulnerable to nature's forces because of the violent air currents at that height. The air currents could exert excessive pressure on the mast and the building structure. Another reason why the Empire State Building's plan to accommodate dirigibles failed is that there was a strict law banning airships from flying too low over urban areas. This law came into effect because of a tragic incident where a German dirigible caught on fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey. Those were just some of the many problems the dirigibles faced while passing by the Empire State Building. These issues ultimately made the use of dirigibles at the building unfeasible.
38	14871	6	3	Builders of the Empire State Building faced significant obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. A massive one - thousand - foot dirigible, attached to a single cable tether, would impose a great deal of stress on the building's frame if it were placed at the top of the building. To handle this additional stress, the building's frame would have to be comprehensively strengthened and carefully modified to accommodate the situation. Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications would have to be installed into the framework, which was a substantial financial burden. Some other obstacles the builders faced were related to safety. The dirigibles ran on hydrogen, which is highly flammable. A small spark could lead to a catastrophic explosion in a crowded city like New York. Another obstacle was the unpredictable weather. The winds at the top of the Empire State Building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. These shifting winds made docking extremely difficult. One last obstacle was an existing law that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas. Due to these insurmountable obstacles, the idea of a dirigible docking at the Empire State Building quietly disappeared, as it was neither practical nor safe.
39	14872	6	3	Although Al Smith had expected the mooring mast of the Empire State Building to be both unique and practical, builders faced a multitude of obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First, in order for the building to withstand the stress that the large dirigibles would add to the building's frame, the framework of the building had to undergo significant modifications. These modifications were not only complex but also costly, amounting to over sixty thousand dollars. In addition, dirigibles used hydrogen, a highly flammable gas. In a densely - populated area like New York City, an accident involving a hydrogen - filled dirigible could be extremely fatal, endangering countless lives. Also, there were violent winds at the top of the building. These winds would make docking a dirigible an extremely difficult task and could possibly blow a dirigible forcefully into the side of the building, causing it to be punctured and potentially leading to an explosion. Finally, an existing law strictly prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas; it would be completely illegal for a ship even to approach the building's area. Given all these insurmountable obstacles, the plan to use the mooring mast for dirigible docking was ultimately abandoned.
40	14873	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many difficult and challenging obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. The greatest obstacle regarding the use of a mooring mast was the wind. At the top of the Empire State Building, the winds were constantly and rapidly shifting due to the violent air currents in that high - altitude area. These strong and erratic winds would cause the back of the dirigible to swivel around the mooring mast in an uncontrolled manner. This swiveling could damage the dirigible and also pose a threat to the building's structure. Another reason the dirigibles would not be able to operate at the Empire State Building is that there is a well - established law that says airships cannot fly low in urban areas. This law was put in place for the safety of the people living in the city. This would make it completely illegal for the dirigible to approach or dock at the Empire State Building. Due to these insurmountable obstacles, the plan to use the building for dirigible docking had to be scrapped.
41	14874	6	3	Based on the story, it all started when they built the Empire State Building. The workers should have known that the building was too large for the wind climate up in the sky. Moreover, when constructing a building like that, one has to ensure it's strong enough to maintain balance. They faced problems such as when the U.S. tried to make a deal with them to use the top of the building as a dock for civilians to access the deck. After a law was made stating that no more blimps could land on the dock, a blimp still attempted to land there. In the end, these issues highlighted the challenges and miscalculations in the building's initial plans.
42	14875	6	3	Obstacles the builders faced were that if they put a Mooring Mast at the top of the building, it would add stress to the structure. As a result, they would have to modify the building to support the mooring mast. Another concern they encountered was safety. Most dirigibles are filled with hydrogen, which is highly flammable. If there was a fire, it could endanger a large number of people due to the fact that it's a densely - populated area. Nature itself also posed a challenge as the winds above the building were extremely violent. Then there's the law where airships can't fly too low above urban areas. These combined obstacles made it very difficult for the builders to achieve their goal.
43	14876	6	3	"In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there are described. One significant obstacle was that most dirigibles were highly flammable. In paragraph @NUM1 it clearly states, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" If a dirigible caught on fire near the Empire State Building, the accident would have a wide - reaching impact on many people since it's a densely populated area. Another obstacle the builders faced was the winds of nature itself. Even if a dirigible was docked, it would still swivel around too much, making it unstable. In paragraph @NUM2 it says, ""... they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe."" One more obstacle they faced was an existing law. In paragraph @NUM3 it says, ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" The architects faced many complex obstacles while trying to bring their idea to reality. It's always better to plan thoroughly and consider every potential obstacle before bringing grand ideas to life, as this can save a lot of time, effort, and resources."
44	14877	6	3	The builders had a very difficult time because of the building's location and the way the dirigible was supposed to dock. Their first problem was that since the building was so tall, it was extremely hard to work on. The height made transportation of materials and equipment challenging, and the workers had to deal with harsh conditions at great heights. Another problem was that the blimp would be pulling on the building when docking, so the building's structure had to be reinforced. This required additional time, materials, and engineering expertise. The final problems that made the dirigible docking an unreliable choice were the wind conditions and the fact that the tail end of the blimp could swing freely. These factors all contributed to making the mast on the Empire State Building a bad and unfeasible idea.
45	14878	6	3	"From the excerpt, The Mooring Mast, the architects building the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. An obstacle they faced in allowing the dirigibles to dock was the strong winds. As it says in the excerpt, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around..."" This meant the dirigible would not be stable, which was a major safety concern. Another obstacle they faced was that to weigh it down, they'd have to use lead weights, but it wouldn't be ""practical nor safe"" as the weights would be dangling high above people in @LOCATION1 on the street. Overall, the architects faced a great deal of obstacles for docking the dirigibles, most of which made the plan either impractical or unsafe, ultimately showing the difficulty of realizing such an ambitious idea."
46	14879	6	3	There were numerous challenges associated with enabling dirigibles to land atop the Empire State Building. During the design phase of the mast, engineers realized that the significant weight of the dirigible would subject the building's frame to substantial stress. They also discovered that dirigibles from other countries predominantly used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen, being highly flammable, posed a severe safety risk. An uncontrollable factor in building the mast was nature. The winds at the building's summit were constantly in flux, making it difficult for dirigibles to maintain a stable position. Law was yet another hurdle when it came to constructing the mast. There was a strict law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas. Considering the factors of weight, gas, nature, and law, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles, ultimately making the idea of dirigible landings unfeasible.
47	14880	6	3	"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, it is revealed that the original intention of the mast on top of the Empire State Building was to serve as a landing spot for dirigibles (blimps). The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles. One major issue was the tremendous stress that the mast would impose on the building. To address this, they installed a comprehensive framework around the entire building's structure. Another crucial obstacle was safety. Firstly, the strong winds at the top of the Empire State Building were so powerful that any blimp would be tossed around and struggle to stay aloft in mid - air. Additionally, there was a high risk of the blimp either popping on the spikes or exploding due to the hydrogen it carried, which would be extremely dangerous over a densely populated area like New York City. In conclusion, while the concept of the mast on the Empire State Building seemed promising on paper, once natural elements were taken into account, it became evident that the mast had too many flaws to be a practical solution for dirigible landings."
48	14881	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building encountered numerous obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the initial challenges was modifying and strengthening the building's frame. It is reported that over @NUM1 thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework to accommodate dirigibles. However, after these modifications were completed, the builders were confronted with a new set of more serious obstacles. The first was ""safety."" The tragic destruction of the Hindenburg in @LOCATION3 raised significant concerns about using dirigibles in a densely populated area such as New York. Another obstacle was ""nature."" The strong winds and violent air currents on the top of the Empire State Building made dirigibles ""neither practical nor safe."" The third obstacle was ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This law made it ""illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" The Los Angeles and Columbia dirigibles made a few attempts, but they were unsuccessful. By the late 1930s, the idea of dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building faded away. These were the various obstacles that the builders faced in their endeavor to enable dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building."
49	14882	6	3	"Based on the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"" by @PERSON1, the builders of the Empire State Building faced a series of obstacles while trying to allow dirigibles to dock at the top. The most significant obstacle was nature itself. @PERSON1 noted that ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents,"" which made it extremely unsafe for dirigibles to be docked there. The wind would cause the dirigibles to swivel around the mast, and it was also unsafe for the builders to hang lead weights on the dirigibles as they would dangle above the pedestrians on the street. Another obstacle that prevented dirigibles from mooring at the Empire State Building was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas or cities. This existing law made it illegal for dirigibles to tie up to the building or even approach it because the area was too low over the city. @PERSON1 mentioned that ""although two dirigibles did attempt to reach the building before the entire idea was dropped."" These two dirigibles failed to get close enough to tie up or deliver their cargo safely due to the forceful winds and the lack of certain mooring equipment that should have been installed. Due to these insurmountable obstacles, dirigibles were never able to moor at the building, and the plan was ultimately abandoned."
50	14883	6	3	"In ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, it is evident that the builders of the Empire State Building endured many challenges when attempting to dock dirigibles. The concept of a mooring mast originated when former governor of New York, Al Smith, was determined to make the Empire State Building the tallest in the world. When the Chrysler Building surpassed it in height, Smith is reported to have announced, ""... The Empire State would now reach the height of 1,250 feet"" (Mooring Mast). Despite the enthusiasm surrounding the plan, there were numerous obstacles before dirigibles could dock there. The first problem was stability. If a thousand - pound dirigible was connected to the building by a single tether, it would add significant stress to the building's frame, which would have required the builders to completely overhaul the building's structure. Another major concern was safety. At that time, most foreign dirigibles used hydrogen, a highly flammable substance, instead of helium. This posed a great hazard considering the large number of people below. However, the most significant obstacles for the future of dirigibles at the Empire State Building were natural factors. Above the building, there were wild wind currents that caused the back of the dirigible to swivel. When the builders were unable to find a practical solution to all these obstacles, it became clear that for the safety of all New York City inhabitants, dirigibles would not be kept there."
51	14884	6	3	"In the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"" written by @PERSON1, there were several obvious obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building were faced with even before they built the mast. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" As stated in ""The Mooring Mast"", at the top of the building, the winds were constantly shifting due to violent air - currents. Moreover, if the dirigibles were tethered, the back of them would move around erratically while being high above the city with people watching below. This situation was extremely unsafe for many. Additionally, ""An existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" meant that it was illegal for a ship to tie up with the building or even approach such an area. These issues, including nature - related problems and the risk of law - breaking, should have been brought to the builders' attention right from the start. In conclusion, overlooking these obstacles was a significant oversight that could have affected the viability of the mooring mast project."
52	14885	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced a lot of obstacles. Here are three key points to consider. First, they needed to formulate very difficult and complex plans. Building the mooring mast required them to create the right skeleton that would fit the rest of the building. They had to make significant changes to the existing plans to ensure the mast's proper installation. This involved careful calculations and adjustments to maintain the building's structural integrity. Second, the Blimps and @CAPS2 could cause an accident. Blimps fly at about @NUM1 miles per hour, and they could approach the mast at a speed that was too fast, potentially destroying it upon impact. Third, the mast was very high. It would be extremely hard for blimps to reach the height of the mast. Irving Clavan said, ""... Such a height made it desirable to postpone to a later date for the landing gears."" In summary, the builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous challenges, including difficult plans, the risk of blimp - related accidents, and the high height of the mast."
53	14886	6	3	"Some of the major obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were mainly related to weather and safety. In paragraph @NUM1, the author states, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This indicates that because of the ever - changing wind and air currents, the dirigibles would be extremely difficult to control during docking. Another significant obstacle they faced was safety. Also in paragraph @NUM1, the author mentions, ""Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights... where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street..."" What this means is that having something heavy dangling above people is a very bad idea. If the weight were to disconnect from the dirigibles, there is a high possibility that somebody could get seriously injured. In conclusion, these weather - related and safety - related obstacles were significant challenges that the builders of the Empire State Building had to deal with when trying to allow dirigibles to dock."
54	14887	6	3	"Throughout the process of attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, the builders faced many obstacles. The first obstacle they encountered occurred during the actual ""building"" process. Since the mast would add too much stress to the frame of the building if simply attached to its flat roof, the builders had to reconstruct the steel frame of the building. This was a very expensive and time - consuming project as they had to ensure that the new frame could safely support the mast on top. Another obstacle was related to nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting, causing the back of the ship to swivel around the mooring mast, which was a very unsafe situation. Additionally, the laws against airships flying too low over urban areas also proved to be an obstacle because the ships would never be able to actually approach the area legally. In conclusion, the builders faced a multitude of challenges during construction for the dirigibles, which ultimately made the project of allowing dirigibles to dock quite difficult."
55	14888	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were substantial. A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add a great deal of stress to the building's frame. This was an obstacle because if the workers were up there working while the dirigible was in place, it would have been an extremely difficult and challenging situation. They would have to be very cautious to ensure their safety and the integrity of the building. Another obstacle was the wind pressure. When the thousand - foot dirigible was only hung on by a single cable, the strong wind blowing hard made it a difficult situation to manage. Moreover, over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework. This was a challenging obstacle because they had to do a large amount of work that would take a long time to complete. All this work on the framework required careful planning and execution. In conclusion, these obstacles, including the added stress, wind pressure, and costly framework modifications, made the task of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building a very difficult one.
56	14889	6	3	"In the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the readers learn that there were significant obstacles for the builders of the Empire State Building when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. In paragraph @NUM1, the readers learn that the architects were deeply worried about the load of the blimp and the intense wind pressure that was transmitted all the way to the building's foundation. To address this, the architects would have to strengthen and carefully modify the Empire State Building to adapt to this new situation. The architects also saw problems with foreign dirigibles which used hydrogen rather than helium, as stated in paragraph @NUM2, ""Most dirigibles from outside the U.S used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" One of the biggest obstacles was that the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting. So, even if the dirigible was tethered to the mast, its back would still swivel around. Later on, the architects' idea for a mooring mast faded away, and it was then repurposed for observation."
57	14890	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced some notable obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Some of these obstacles had relatively easy solutions, but some of them were extremely hard to solve. One obstacle they had was that a dirigible on top of the building, held by a cable tether only, would cause substantial stress to the building's frame. In order to solve this problem, they needed to make structural modifications that would cost around six thousand dollars. This wasn't the only problem; there was a strict law that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas. This law made it illegal to get close to this area or even attempt to tie up to the building. Adding to this, the most difficult obstacle the architects faced was nature, and this problem was not only hard to solve but also hard to control. All these obstacles they faced led them to give up for the time being and wait to see if, later with more advanced technology, they could finally make this dream come true.
58	14891	6	3	"When they built the Empire State Building, they encountered several obstacles. One major obstacle was that they wanted to make it as high and as safe as possible. The way the architects intended to make it the tallest building in the world was by putting a mooring mast on the top of the building. A mooring mast is basically a specialized dock for dirigibles (blimps). However, this was a dangerous concept. It was because at such a high altitude, the mast could snap and plummet to the ground or snap and dangle precariously high above the busy street. ""... The Government people in Washington are figuring on some way of mooring airships to this mast,"" says Al Smith, a four - year term governor of New York. Although it may seem visually appealing, it's clearly not the safest idea."
59	14892	6	3	"There were numerous obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. For one thing, the builders couldn't simply place a mast on top of the Empire State Building, because the building would surely collapse under the additional stress. ""A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the Empire State Building, held by a single cable tether, would add significant stress to the building's frame"". To change and fix this problem, over sixty thousand dollars would be required for the necessary modifications. Another obstacle the builders failed to anticipate was the actual construction of a modern - day dirigible. The dirigibles, ""used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"". If the dirigibles were to ever explode while docking, the situation would have been catastrophic over a densely populated area of New York. Lastly, the greatest obstacle of the building was nature itself. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around"". This would be extremely dangerous. The dirigible could potentially crash over pedestrians on the streets, meaning it was not safe at all. In conclusion, these three obstacles effectively prevented the Empire State Building from allowing dirigibles to dock there."
60	14893	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders faced significant obstacles such as figuring out how the dirigibles would stay securely tied to the mast. They were uncertain as to how they could keep the dirigible from swiveling due to the strong air currents. As said in paragraph @NUM1, ""A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add considerable stress to the building's framework."" Another serious problem they faced was that the use of hydrogen in the dirigibles made them highly flammable, posing a great risk to the building and the surrounding area."
61	14894	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building, with the aim of fulfilling Al Smith's goal of realizing the ""dream of aviation pioneers,"" encountered numerous hurdles in their bid to enable dirigibles to dock at the building. One significant issue was the stress a dirigible would impose on the building. When a large dirigible was moored to the building via a single cable tether, the building had to endure the weight of the dirigible and the wind pressure that would spread throughout the entire structure. As a result, the builders had to spend over @MONEY1 on modifications to strengthen the frame of the Empire State Building. Moreover, dirigibles from outside the United States presented a danger as most of them were filled with highly flammable hydrogen. The tragic destruction of the German dirigible by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, clearly demonstrated the risks of such an accident occurring above the densely populated city of New York. Additionally, the strong winds on top of the Empire State Building were a problem. Even when tethered to the mooring mast, the rear of the ship would constantly sway around it, posing a threat to the citizens of New York below. Furthermore, there was an existing law that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, which made it illegal for a dirigible to tether itself to the Empire State Building. All these factors ultimately made it impossible for the builders to achieve their goal of allowing dirigibles to dock there."
62	14895	6	3	"In @PERSON1's excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast,"" the builders of the Empire State Building had to deal with multiple obstacles when trying to make it possible for dirigibles to dock there. Even though dirigibles were a modern mode of transportation, they were extremely dangerous. As stated in paragraph @NUM1, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the U.S used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" Along with the ""violent air currents"" mentioned in paragraph @NUM2, these were two key risks that the builders had to take into account. The builders needed to come up with a safe way for dirigibles to dock to ensure no one would get hurt. Another obstacle was the law passed, which stated that it was ""against airships flying too low over urban areas,"" as explained in paragraph @NUM3. The excerpt clearly shows the difficulties the builders had to face and consider during the construction of the Empire State Building. In conclusion, the numerous obstacles they encountered made it a challenging task for the builders of the Empire State Building to allow dirigibles to dock there."
63	14896	6	3	"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"" by @PERSON1, the builders of the Empire State Building faced a host of obstacles when attempting to permit dirigibles to dock at the building. The most prominent obstacle was the constantly changing winds caused by the air currents. These unpredictable winds made it extremely difficult for dirigibles to safely approach and dock. Another reason dirigibles were not allowed to dock on the Empire State Building was that many dirigibles from outside the @LOCATION3 used hydrogen, which is highly flammable. If a dirigible were to explode like the one in Lakehurst, New Jersey, a large number of people in the area would be affected. Additionally, using lead weights to weigh down the back of the blimp was not an option as it would pose a danger to the people below. The sharp spires of the other buildings in the vicinity also presented a risk. If a Navy captain was worried about his blimp getting punctured, it was clear that docking dirigibles there was not safe. Finally, there was a law stating that airships could not fly too low over urban areas. Due to these insurmountable obstacles, the builders were unable to achieve their goal of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building."
64	14897	6	3	"In the short story ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1, the builders had an obstacle to overcome. Building the top of the Empire State Building was a difficult task because the dock part of the tower lacked stability. Moreover, the frame of the building was unable to support the dirigible. As described, ""a dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" To address this, the designers came up with a new tower design. It was a shiny glass and chrome - nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from the inside. The winches and controlling machinery would be housed in the base of the shaft itself. They also added an observation deck, which allowed more passengers to wait for the dirigible. However, there was a law that prohibited aircrafts from getting too close to urban places. Overall, it was a painstaking and costly design process for the builders, and despite their efforts, the challenges remained significant."
65	14898	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many problems that should have been apparent before its construction. One of the issues they faced was that many dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. This fact made the owners of the building worried about the safety of the numerous civilians living in downtown New York. Another problem was that the winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. In landing fields, blimps could be weighted down with lead weights, but this was not possible at the Empire State Building. Many dirigibles would also be unable to reach the building because of the winds. Additionally, it was against the law to have airships fly too low over urban areas. This law made it illegal for a ship to tie up to the building or even approach the area. All these factors led to the disappearance of the idea of using the mooring mast for dirigibles and passengers, as it was simply too risky and unfeasible.
66	14899	6	3	There are many obstacles that the builders face when creating the Empire State Building. First off, the height of the building came into question quite a bit, and there were numerous discussions about the top of the building. The Empire State Building's initial goal was to be the future of the city; they wanted to ferry people onto blimps. Another problem was that there really was no way to get the blimp steady enough to attach to the building, and large aircrafts are not supposed to fly too close to the building because there are other buildings around. In conclusion, they did face many problems, which made the construction and the intended function of the building quite challenging.
67	14900	6	3	There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced. One of the greatest being safety. As stated in paragraph @NUM1, most dirigibles from outside of the U.S used hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable, and in the context of a building in a densely - populated area, a hydrogen - filled dirigible catching fire could lead to a major disaster. Also, another issue was presented in paragraph @NUM2, this was nature itself. The winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered down, the back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast. Yet another obstacle as to the reason why dirigibles couldn't dock at the Empire State Building was in paragraph @NUM3, this was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. These obstacles made it nearly impossible for the Empire State Building to serve its original purpose, and the builders had to accept that the initial plan for the building's use was unfeasible.
68	14901	6	3	The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. There were high, violent air currents causing the building to constantly shift. These shifting air currents made it difficult to maintain a stable connection between the dirigible and the mooring mast. It was neither practical nor safe to attempt to dock dirigibles under such conditions. In the end, these natural factors effectively put an end to the idea of using the mooring mast for its intended purpose.
69	14902	6	3	There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building had to face while trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. One reason is the dirigibles were unsafe. This is because dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen, which is extremely flammable. If the dirigible caught on fire in a densely populated place like the area around the Empire State Building, then many people could die from it. Another obstacle the builders faced was nature itself. This is because the winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting so the back of the dirigible would swivel back and forth. They could only fix the problem by putting weights on the back of the ship, but to do that was impractical and unsafe. This is because the weights are dangling high above pedestrians, so if one broke, it could kill someone. The third obstacle is that there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas, so it would be illegal for the ships to tie up to the building. The final obstacle was the wind could have pushed the ship onto sharp spires, which could puncture the ship, so the pilots wouldn't be able to get the mooring equipment properly attached. These are the obstacles the builders faced, which caused the mooring equipment not to be installed, and the original plan of dirigible docking had to be abandoned.
70	14903	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Safety reasons, weather conditions, and government laws defeated the purpose of the mooring mast on top of the building. For example, many of the dirigibles used at the time contained hydrogen instead of helium, ""hydrogen is highly flammable... above a densely populated area."" (@NUM1). The builders realized that having a highly flammable gas - filled dirigible near a busy city building was not a smart idea. Furthermore, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" (@NUM2) This created a dangerous situation because the ship would swing around the mast, making it hard to control and increasing the risk of damage to the dirigible and the building. Lastly, the most obvious obstacle was a government law prohibiting a ship to even approach the building. ""...an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" .(@NUM3) The whole idea that was built up to something great had slowly dwindled. The builders of the Empire State Building faced these obstacles, and many more, in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there, and ultimately had to admit that the original vision for the mooring mast was unachievable."
71	14904	6	3	"In the article ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, numerous obstacles of building the Empire State Building as a docking station for dirigibles are described. John Tauranac, the man who conceived the plan to dock dirigibles on the top of the Empire State Building, overlooked some very crucial factors. First, the entire building would need significant modification because, as stated, ""A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame"" (paragraph @NUM1). This stress could potentially compromise the building's long - term structural integrity. The second problem that demanded a solution was the safety of the city. Many ""dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" (paragraph @NUM2). If an accident similar to that of the German dirigible Hindenburg occurred, the densely populated area around the Empire State Building would face a disaster that would be ten times worse. Lastly, the ""violent air currents"" (paragraph @NUM3) would be one of the most formidable obstacles. The U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles attempted to tie up but couldn't get close enough due to ""forceful wind."" (paragraph @NUM4). The numerous obstacles of converting the Empire State Building into a mooring mast presented challenges that were insurmountable, ultimately making the plan unfeasible."
72	14905	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building encountered a multitude of obstacles. Allowing dirigibles to dock on the top of a building was an unprecedented feat. They were required to add over sixty thousand dollars worth of framework. This framework was essential to ensure the building could withstand the additional forces exerted by a moored dirigible. Then, once the mast was designed, and the building had been framed up to the 85th floor, the roof had to be completed meticulously. This was because a stable roof was a prerequisite for starting the framing of the mast. Only after these steps could they hope to make the building a viable docking station for dirigibles. However, these complex requirements and challenges made the task extremely difficult, highlighting the many hurdles the builders had to overcome.
73	14906	6	3	"Builders faced numerous problems with allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. First of all, in @CAPS1 @NUM1, the author explains that ""A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would only add stress to the building's frame"". To address this, builders would have to construct the building in a way to make it more stable. This might involve reinforcing the existing structure or using specialized building materials. Also, there were cases where outside the United States, dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable, and considering that New York is a densely populated city, it would pose a significant threat to pedestrians. The risk of a fire or explosion could lead to a large - scale disaster. Seeing these issues, it becomes evident that builders had to deal with far too many problems arising from what seemed like an ""easy"" concept. In the end, these problems made the plan of dirigible docking at the Empire State Building highly impractical."
74	14907	6	3	"The obstacles to allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building were far too great, a fact that should have been obvious before construction began. One major reason was safety. Most dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is extremely flammable. After the tragic ""Hindenburg"" accident in Lakehurst, which was a well - publicized disaster, the idea of using dirigibles for docking at the Empire State Building was quickly shot down. The public and authorities were understandably wary of repeating such a catastrophe in a densely populated urban area. Another reason why it didn't work was the wind current at the top of the Empire State Building. The winds would be so strong that dirigibles would find it nearly impossible to safely dock. There was already a law restricting airships from flying too low over urban areas. A dirigible approaching the building would violate this law. All these factors combined effectively ended the idea of proceeding with the plan, as the risks and legal issues were simply too high."
75	14908	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. In paragraph @NUM1, the excerpt reveals a huge issue. It states, ""A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of a building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building frame."" Due to this potential stress, over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework. These modifications were necessary to ensure the building could support the weight and forces of a moored dirigible. Another setback is described in paragraph @NUM2. It states, ""The greatest obstacle... was nature itself."" The violent air currents caused the back of the ship to swivel around the mooring mast. Tethering the mooring mast would offer little assistance in stabilizing the dirigible. Lead weights, which might seem like a solution, could not be used. As paragraph @NUM2 states, ""dangling weights high above pedestrians..., was neither practical nor safe."" All of these obstacles clearly demonstrated to architects that the project, at that time, was an impossible endeavor due to the insurmountable challenges."
76	14909	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles. In the excerpt, it clearly stated that ""the mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to fail."" A somewhat unseen obstacle was the fact that ""most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen instead of helium."" Hydrogen is a much more unstable gas, and if a dirigible caught fire and went down over New York, many civilians would be killed or wounded. Another significant obstacle the builders faced was that ""the winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting."" This would make it extremely difficult to anchor a dirigible down to the mast. As the excerpt said, they could not use lead weights hanging from the underside of the dirigible because they would be hanging over citizens below. These were the key problems faced by the builders of the Empire State Building, which ultimately influenced the feasibility of the mooring mast."
77	14910	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles, and these obstacles were not easily fixed. First, the steel frame of the Empire State Building had to be carefully modified and strengthened to accommodate the ""new situation."" This involved detailed engineering work and additional materials to ensure the building's integrity. Another major obstacle was safety. Since the building is located in such a densely - populated area, having an accident would be extremely detrimental to many people's lives. Also, the strong and unpredictable winds made the whole situation very dangerous, posing risks to both the dirigibles and the building itself. Lastly, there was an existing law stating that airships could not fly too low over urban areas. These challenges made the goal of allowing dirigibles at the Empire State Building extremely difficult to achieve."
78	14911	6	3	"The obstacles that the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles included making its speed go up. They needed to find ways to optimize the dirigible's propulsion system to increase its speed safely. Another obstacle that the builders faced was the landing area. The landing area had to be designed precisely to accommodate the size and characteristics of the dirigibles. It required proper markings and a stable surface. The last obstacle that the builders faced was making sure that the passengers get on and off safely. As it says in paragraph six, ""passengers could safely get on and off the dirigible by walking down a gangplank..."", but ensuring the gangplank's stability and safety in various weather conditions was a crucial task. Overall, these obstacles made the project of allowing dirigibles at the building quite challenging."
79	14912	6	3	"There were plenty of problems engineers at the Empire State Building faced when they wanted to dock dirigibles. Well for starters, the winds up that high were over - powering. As it says in paragraph @NUM1, ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" These shifting winds made it very difficult to control the dirigibles during docking. Also, there was the issue of the dirigibles themselves that caused a problem. For they were filled with hydrogen, which is very flammable. A small spark could lead to a disastrous explosion. One other problem was air laws. They state that dirigibles, in urban areas, were not to fly too low. It is because of these multiple problems that destroyed Al Smith's idea that the building could dock airships, as they made the docking operation both dangerous and illegal."
80	14913	6	3	"With any public transportation unit, many challengers are expected and some are problems unable to be solved. Based on the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, builders of the Empire State Building faced plenty of obstacles in attempts to allow dirigibles, or blimps, to dock there. In regards to docking these dirigibles, they were breaking ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This made the builders' procedure illegal from the start. Also, not only was it a danger for the citizens of New York City, but due to the harsh weather conditions, it was dangerous for passengers and workers on the dirigible. L¸sted states that ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This clearly goes to show that any project, especially one involving public safety and complex operations like dirigible docking, should be thoroughly checked for safety precautions at all times to avoid potential disasters."
81	14914	6	3	Al Smith's grand dream of having airships dock atop the Empire State Building was unfortunately cut short by the harsh realities of the situation. The idea failed partially due to the sheer impracticality of docking a 785 - foot balloon filled with highly flammable gas to a city - building. The colossal size of this airship was truly astounding and it brought about numerous problems. Firstly, the wind conditions atop a skyscraper are extremely strong and inconsistent. This was clearly evident when the Los Angeles tried to dock in 1930. The balloon was unable to dock because of the potential damage it could cause to itself and the surrounding city infrastructure. Moreover, the blimps were kept afloat by Hydrogen, which, due to its chemical nature, is extremely flammable. Blimps had a history of explosions, like the tragic Hindenburg disaster. Engineers were well - aware that if a similar accident occurred at the Empire State Building, it would result in substantial damage to both the city and the building itself. These practical difficulties, combined with the increasing preference for airplanes over blimps, ensured that no blimps would ever be docked to the Empire State Building.
82	14915	6	3	Builders of the Empire State Building faced a multitude of obstacles in their ambitious attempt to allow dirigibles to dock on the mooring mast. One significant issue was that most dirigibles outside the U.S. relied on Hydrogen to stay afloat. This made them highly flammable and extremely unsafe. In the event that a blimp were to be damaged while hovering over New York, a large number of innocent people could be seriously hurt. Additionally, nature itself presented a major challenge, making docking an extremely difficult task. The powerful winds in the area made the blimps very unstable. If a blimp were tied to the mast, the strong winds could wrap the mooring line around the mast, leading to a potentially dangerous situation. Another significant obstacle was the existing law that strictly prohibited aircrafts from flying at such low altitudes over urban areas. This legal restriction made it completely illegal for any dirigible to even approach the mast, effectively putting an end to the docking plans.
83	14916	6	3	Al Smith and his dedicated team of builders encountered several formidable obstacles when they set out to enable dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building. The first major problem with docking dirigibles was related to the building's structure. The steel frame and foundation of the Empire State Building simply could not support the immense stress that would be exerted by a dirigible attached to it. When the builders reflected on past dirigible accidents, such as the well - known Hindenburg disaster, they quickly realized that if a similar accident were to occur at the Empire State Building, countless lives would be at stake. Furthermore, there were strict laws in place that limited how low a dirigible could fly over urban areas. As a result, it would be illegal for a dirigible to dock at the Empire State Building because it would be flying at an altitude that was too low. Finally, and according to the builders, most importantly, the most significant problem with docking dirigibles to the Empire State Building was the unpredictable force of mother nature. The winds at the top of the building were very high and changed in an unpredictable manner. This effectively turned a docked dirigible into a disaster waiting to happen, making the docking idea unfeasible.
84	14917	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced a plethora of obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock. This included the inability to install a mooring mast at the top of the building. They were worried that since the dirigible was to be held by a ""single cable"", it ""would add excessive stress to the building's frame."" Considering the large size of the dirigible and the powerful wind forces, the building's frame would not be strong enough to withstand the pressure and would have to be ""modified and strengthened."" Another major obstacle in getting the dirigibles to dock was the wind. The building was located at a great height, and the wind currents were highly volatile and ""constantly shifting."" As a result, the back of the dirigibles ""would swivel around and around the mooring mast"", making docking extremely difficult and dangerous. Yet another obstacle faced by the builders was that they were trying to build the mooring mast in an urban area with other buildings in close proximity. The dirigible could easily be pierced by these nearby structures, and it would also pose a significant danger to the pedestrians in the city."
85	14918	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building were confronted with multiple problems regarding their vision for the building's use. The first problem for the builders emerged in relation to the building's frame. A thousand - foot dirigible perched at the top of the building, held by only one cable, would exert far too much stress on the building's frame. The combined load of the massive dirigible and the powerful wind forces would have to be transferred to the building's foundation, which was located a great distance below. To make the building capable of withstanding this stress, it would have to be modified, and these modifications would cost over sixty thousand dollars. The architects made the necessary changes to the building to meet these requirements. However, they were once again presented with a problem. The mast of the building would lead to issues that should have been identified by the architects long before the construction began. The most significant problem was related to safety. Most dirigibles outside the country used hydrogen, which is highly flammable. There had already been an explosion, and the thought of a similar incident occurring over New York was too catastrophic to even consider.
86	14919	6	3	In order to allow dirigibles to dock on the roof of the Empire State Building, the workers would have to meticulously go through a series of crucial tasks such as strengthening the steel frame to a high - standard and designing a truly sturdy mast that could withstand various forces. If the frame were not strong enough, then the entire building would simply collapse under the weight and stress exerted by the dirigible. More than sixty thousand dollars was carefully spent on restructuring the frame to ensure its durability. Also, with high - speed winds constantly buffeting the area, the mast would have to be incredibly sturdy. Otherwise, the dirigible would not stay in one place, which could lead to dangerous situations. After the Hindenburg disaster, people clearly realized how unsafe these dirigibles really were, and so the idea was found not only unsafe but also illegal. In conclusion, not a single blimp would ever be docked on the Empire State Building, nor will one ever be due to these insurmountable issues.
87	14920	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many challenging obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. Firstly, the thousand - foot dirigible would attach to the buildings by a single cable, which would add significant stress to the frame of the building. The builders were then forced to carefully modify and strengthen the foundation to comprehensively address the issue of stability. Similarly, builders had to deal with the ever - changing issue of wind pressure which was constantly shifting at heights of over @NUM1 feet in the air. The load of the dirigible swinging in the breeze would transmit substantial pressure and stress onto the building's foundation. This was a high - level safety concern, and it was pivotal to the decision that dirigibles could not dock at the Empire State Building. Lastly, builders were forced to face the strict law against airships flying too low over urban areas, making it completely illegal for dirigibles to even attempt to land on the mooring mast. The builders faced significant obstacles such as building weakness, safety, and law enforcement, that made attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State's mooring mast, virtually an impossible feat.
88	14921	6	3	"In The Mooring Mast, by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many complex obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Al Smith had a grand vision and wanted to add a ""top"" or a ""hat"" to the Empire State Building that would function as a well - designed docking station for dirigibles. However, the dream was not meant to be. The first of many problems was getting the mooring mast, the docking station, on top of the building. As accurately stated, ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" A dirigible would only be held by one cable. The dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way down the building, which required a lot of engineering expertise. There were also serious safety problems. A lot of dirigibles used hydrogen. Hydrogen is highly flammable, and it is also very windy around the Empire State Building. The dirigibles would have to hang sandbags by ropes, and these would hang above the unsuspecting people below. The mooring mast was a good idea in theory, but the builders faced too many problems. The project was never completed, and the dream of dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building faded away."
89	14922	6	3	"Though in theory the idea of the mooring mast seemed attainable, in reality there were many difficult obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. An initial problem was faced during the painstaking process of adding the mooring mast to the building. As stated in the article: ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. ... The steel frame... would have to be carefully modified and strengthened to accommodate the new situation."" This modification, which was necessary to overcome the obstacle of attaching the mooring mast, consumed over @NUM1 thousand dollars and a great deal of time and effort. A second obstacle which interfered immensely with safety was ""nature itself."" The violent winds at the top of the building would cause tethered dirigibles to ""swivel around and around"" the mooring mast in an unpredictable manner. Dirigibles moored in airfields could be weighted down by lead weights, but this idea could not be executed because ""... using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street was neither practical nor safe."" Such problems as these created many insurmountable obstacles for the builders of the Empire State Building, and the project of allowing dirigibles to dock there remained unfulfilled."
90	14923	6	3	In this excerpt, the builders faced many obstacles with the Empire State Building in an attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. Some of those problems included weather, height, and the gases used to fuel the dirigible. The weather was a tough force to beat. If the dirigibles were to dock at the building, the wind at that height was more extreme, and it could cause the dirigible to swerve erratically, endangering both the craft and the building. The next contributing factor was height. In the excerpt, it stated that law ordered a limit. If the dirigibles were too low to urban areas, it would be extremely unsafe. At any moment, something could cause the dirigible to fall and crash on buildings and innocent pedestrians. The last obstacle is the type of gas used. Apparently hydrogen is highly flammable compared to helium, and a fire or explosion could occur, which could also cause great harm to the passengers. In conclusion, weather, height, and the type of gas used, were all among the many significant obstacles that the Empire State Building would face when allowing dirigibles to dock there, making the endeavor a very risky and ultimately unfeasible one.
91	14924	6	3	"The architects of the Empire State Building believed that dirigibles were able to dock on the building if there was a mooring mast. However, there were many significant obstacles to overcome to allow this to happen. If a dirigible landed on the mast, it would force a substantial amount of pressure on the building as it swayed in the wind. ""A thousand - foot dirigible moored... would add stress to the building's frame."" And as nature played a crucial role, the strong wind could swing the body of the dirigible, possibly causing the frame of the building to break and the building to collapse. Another major obstacle that the architects faced was the issue of danger. American dirigibles used helium, while dirigibles from other countries used hydrogen, which is highly flammable. ""... the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey..."" The architects realized that the Hindenburg explosion would have been far worse if it occurred on the Empire State Building ""... above a densely populated area..."". In conclusion, these obstacles made the idea of dirigibles docking on the Empire State Building extremely unfeasible."
92	14925	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring @CAPS1"" by Marcia Amidon lusted, there were a great many problems when trying to add a dock for dirigibles at the top. One significant problem or obstacle was the safety of the dirigible itself. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly inflammable."" (@NUM1). This inflammability posed a huge risk. Another obstacle was nature itself. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" (@NUM2). These unpredictable winds made docking very difficult. The last problem was the existing law against airships flying too low over cities or urban areas. ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" (@NUM3). These are three clear reasons why, in the excerpt ""The mooring @CAPS1"" by Marcia Amidon lusted, there were a lot of problems when trying to add a dock for dirigibles. In summary, these combined issues made the project of adding a dirigible dock almost impossible."
93	14926	6	3	"Through the excerpt The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION2, we learned that the builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the summit of the building. Some of the significant obstacles that the builders faced in this engineering challenge are; @CAPS1 the builders had to figure out how the Empire State Building was going to be able to support the substantial weight of these long aircrafts. We learned this in paragraph @NUM1 when the author states ""A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building... would add stress to the building's frame."" To overcome this problem, ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened (@NUM2)."" It is later said that these modifications would cost over sixty thousand dollars, which was a significant expense. Another problem that the builders faced was how safe docking a blimp would be in a highly populated area. In paragraph @NUM3 we learned that most dirigibles are made of hydrogen, which is highly flammable. After ""the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey... The owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" All in all, in the excerpt The Mooring Mast, we learned that the builders of the Empire State Building faced many insurmountable obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the peak of the building. In conclusion, these challenges made the docking plan unworkable."
94	14927	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building could not dock dirigibles because of the building's structure, the strong winds pushing the dirigibles, and public safety. The structure of the building could not handle the swaying dirigible because of the powerful winds pushing on the back side. The constant movement and force exerted by the dirigible due to the wind would put excessive stress on the building's frame. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used Hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This quote clearly shows how extremely dangerous it would be to put a large flammable dirigible over New York and the people in New York. In conclusion, these factors combined made it impossible for dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building."
95	14928	6	3	In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1, it was explained why there is a landing area on the Empire State Building called the Mooring Mast. The first major obstacle the workers faced was that there was absolutely no proper landing space on the top of the Empire State Building. This meant that dirigibles could not land at all. To fix the problem of not having a landing area, they decided to add the Mooring Mast. The Mooring Mast was built with wenches that would hold the dirigibles, but it would put an excessive amount of stress on the building. The workers spent a large sum of money to make the building so that it wasn't stressed when the dirigibles were held to the Mooring Mast. After all that got fixed, they unfortunately forgot one crucial thing, the wind. The wind was so violent that the dirigible couldn't maneuver properly to get on top of the Empire State Building. When the workers figured that out, they finally gave up. Marcia Amidon @CAPS1 explained what the workers tried to do to get a dirigible to land on the Empire State Building in the excerpt The Mooring Mast. In conclusion, the challenges of landing space, stress on the building, and the wind made it an impossible task for dirigibles to land on the Empire State Building.
96	14929	6	3	Most of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building had were due to the unpredictable weather. If New York ever had a particularly windy day, the large dirigible would strongly pull at the mast. The mast is firmly attached to the roof of the building, and such a pull might affect the frames or the overall structure of the building. Another reason is the significant danger it would bring to all of New York. If a dirigible ever hit something or something went seriously wrong, the dirigible would crash on top of New York. With all the heavy traffic of New York, you would most likely not want a burning dirigible falling overhead as it could cause widespread chaos and destruction.
97	14930	6	3	Builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The builders could not simply just drop a mooring mast on the roof without careful consideration. It would add excessive stress to the building's frame, potentially compromising its structural integrity. Another problem that faced the builders was that hydrogen is extremely flammable. If a dirigible had been caught on fire and exploded over downtown New York, then numerous lawsuits would be made due to the potential harm to people and property. Another problem that faced the builders in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building were the strong winds at the top of the building. There were constantly shifting winds due to violent air currents, and these winds would make it extremely difficult and dangerous for dirigibles to dock safely. The last obstacle was the fact that there was a strict law against aircraft flying too low over urban areas. In conclusion, these multiple obstacles made it very challenging for the builders to realize the goal of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
98	14931	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced a few significant obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One problem was related to the height and altitude of the Zeppelin. Even if they managed to dock, the back of it would be moving around wildly everywhere from the strong wind, making it unstable and difficult to control. Another reason was that on May 6, 1937, the Hindenburg was completely burned to the ground after takeoff. This incident clearly showed that dirigibles using hydrogen instead of helium were very flammable. All these factors raised serious safety issues that needed to be thoroughly sought out and resolved before dirigibles could safely dock at the Empire State Building.
99	14932	6	3	The builders of the Empire State building faced many substantial obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Dirigibles were quite long; some were as long as one thousand feet, which is an extremely large size. Dirigibles were docked by an electric winch, which carefully hauled in a line from the front to the back. The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the building without proper assessment. A one - thousand - foot dirigible held by only a single winch would be far too heavy for the building's frame. In order for it to work safely, the building would have to be strengthened to accommodate the one - thousand - foot dirigibles. This would be a costly process worth over sixty thousand dollars, just for the framework alone. Another obstacle was safety. Dirigibles out of the United States often contained hydrogen, meaning they were highly flammable. If an accident would occur like in Lakehurst, New Jersey, then a lot more people would be harmed considering downtown New York was densely populated. Other obstacles were also present for the builders of the Empire State building, which clearly proves that it was not a practical or good idea to dock dirigibles there.
100	14933	6	3	"The builders faced many challenging obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. One was that they had to find a way that would not make the building too unstable. As an expert noted, ""A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building... would add significant stress to the building's frame."" Another obstacle was that the winds would be too strong and not safe for the dirigible to be up there. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, creating a hazardous environment for docking. A third example would be that it was too dangerous to have the dirigible up there because the gases within were extremely flammable. Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used Hydrogen, and Hydrogen is highly flammable, posing a great risk of explosion. The final obstacle the builders would have to face was that there is a strict law that does not allow airships to come too close to the ground in urban areas. So in conclusion, we can see that even though it was an innovative and good idea to port dirigibles at the Empire State Building, it was not a practical one due to these multiple insurmountable obstacles."
101	14934	6	3	"In this excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous and significant obstacles to enable dirigibles to dock there. The first major problem they encountered was the need to meticulously redesign the building's original sturdy skeleton to precisely fit the unique needs of the mooring mast. This can be clearly shown when the excerpt states, ""over sixty thousand dollars' worth of careful modifications had to be made to the building's framework"" (paragraph @NUM1). The diligent workers had to painstakingly change their initial well - thought - out design to meet the strict mandatory requirements for the mooring mast. The workers also had to confront the harsh reality that overall, the mooring mast was extremely dangerous to use. This can be firmly proven when the excerpt says, ""The greatest reason was one of safety... hydrogen is highly flammable"" (paragraph @NUM2). The dirigibles used outside of the United States employed a gas that created a very real and dangerous risk for potential accidents. Another arduous battle the builders had to face was the powerful and unpredictable strong winds. This can be shown when the excerpt quotes, ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself"" (paragraph @NUM3). The winds caused the dirigible to sway and move too much, making it highly unsafe to use. In the end, the builders of the Empire State Building were severely challenged with many insurmountable obstacles while they made attempts to allow dirigibles to dock there, which unfortunately thwarted their initial plans."
102	14935	6	3	"There were many different and quite challenging obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in their earnest attempt to allow dirigibles to dock. For example, the wind on top of the building was constantly and erratically shifting due to the violent and turbulent air currents. Because of the harsh and unpredictable weather conditions themselves, it caused them to be unable to build the mooring mast properly. Another significant reason is that ""using the Empire State Building where the dirigibles would be dangling high above unsuspecting pedestrians on the busy street was neither practical nor safe"". It could easily lead to a tragic situation where it might kill people that were casually roaming around. Lastly, they could not dock dirigibles at the Empire State Building because ""It was an existing strict law against airships flying too low over urban areas"". These multiple obstacles combined made it nearly impossible for the builders to achieve their goal of having dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building."
103	14936	6	3	During the painstaking construction of the mooring mast atop the towering Empire State Building, the builders faced several formidable obstacles. The greatest and most unyielding obstacle was undoubtedly Nature. The winds at this great height are shifting far too frequently, causing the dirigible to be roughly tossed around the mast, making it extremely unsafe for passengers to board. Another significant obstacle was the method of weighing dirigibles down with heavy lead weights. Having these lead weights at such a great height was extremely risky because they could unexpectedly plummet down upon the unsuspecting people below on the busy streets. The third and equally challenging obstacle was a strict law against the airships flying too low in urban areas. This made it absolutely impossible for any dirigible to dock or even come close to the Empire State Building. These numerous and insurmountable obstacles forced the builders to reluctantly shelf the mooring mast construction, putting an end to their initial ambitious plans.
104	14937	6	3	"Obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in their determined attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there were some of the following. They needed an extremely precise and accurate way of getting everything absolutely perfect for the complex job. The whole building process for this demanding job was very intricate and complicated and required the very best and most specialized expertise. In paragraph @NUM1, Al Smith's insightful quote greatly backs up my point. He says ""one set of highly - skilled engineers here in New York is trying to carefully dope out a practical, workable arrangement and the Government people in Washington are laboriously figuring on some safe way of mooring airships to the mast"". It clearly tells just how many dedicated people are working hard on this challenging job. In conclusion, this was a highly complicated job. They weren't certain if the mast would even be able to firmly stay in place. They also weren't positive if the fluids inside would pose a significant problem factor, which ultimately made the task of allowing dirigibles to dock a very uncertain endeavor."
105	14938	6	3	"In the piece ""The Mooring MAst,"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, it describes in detail what the mast on the Empire State Building was really intended for. There were many troublesome obstacles that the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the mast. One major problem they faced was that when the dirigible landed on the roof, it would add a substantial amount of stress to the building's already - burdened frame. The stress and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way down to the very foundation of the building. This meant that the building would have to undergo extensive modifications and be significantly strengthened. Safety was also a huge and ever - present issue for the mast. Because the dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen, it could easily catch on fire and be completely destroyed over a densely populated area, posing a great threat to the people below. Another obstacle was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly and rapidly shifting. This made the back of the ship swivel around wildly. Lastly, it was not successful because of the strict law against airships flying too low. Before the constructors built all this extra structure to the building, they should have carefully thought of all the potential defects it could have. In the end, these various obstacles made it impossible for the dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building as originally planned."
106	14939	6	3	Al Smith was a highly competitive individual. One of the significant challenges Al had to face was competing with another building project. He was determined to make his building taller than the Chrysler building. In that particular situation, if by the specified date (@DATE1) he didn't manage to make his building taller, he would have lost the title of having the tallest building in New York. This intense competition drove Al to push the boundaries of construction.
107	14940	6	3	Although the idea for turning the mast at the top of the Empire State building into a docking area for dirigibles was a highly clever concept, it was not a very safe one at all. One key reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law strictly against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law effectively rendered the idea of the mast a failure even before construction began. Unfortunately, the workers failed to notice this law during the planning phase. Another obstacle that added significant difficulty to the construction was the additional pressure that having the dirigibles moored to the building placed on its base. This issue required another substantial amount of money (@MONEY1) to be spent in an attempt to fix it. A third factor that made the idea of setting up a mast even more challenging came straight from nature itself. The strong winds at that high altitude off the ground made maneuvering the dirigible in such a small space extremely difficult. This was clearly proven when, in December 1930, the U.S Navy Dirigible 'Los Angeles' approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of the forceful winds. In the end, these multiple challenges made the idea unfeasible.
108	14941	6	3	There are many things in life that seem like they could be brilliant ideas but, in reality, there are numerous flaws associated with them. One such idea is using the Empire State building as a mooring mast for dirigibles. This is what Al Smith, the governor of New York at the time, discovered in an excerpt from The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted. In this excerpt, the builders of the Empire State building had to face some serious obstacles to allow the docking of dirigibles. During the process of building the Empire State building, many of the blueprints had to be extensively changed. One crucial thing that had to be altered was the skeleton of the building. They needed a reliable way to support the dirigibles if they were to dock safely. The original skeleton they had in place put too much stress on the top half of the building, which would have ultimately resulted in it breaking. Another issue that the builders had to deal with was the safety of the people in the vicinity (@LOCATION1). If the highly flammable helium inside the dirigibles were to ignite, it would be putting thousands of people's lives in jeopardy. Finally, the builders had to contend with the violently shifting winds. This too put significant stress on the frame of the building since the winds were so strong at that height and there was also a fear that it would blow the blimp into the pointed mast and break the blimp. Overall, there are many valid reasons why the Mooring Mast never became a reality, as these obstacles were too great to overcome.
109	14942	6	3	The idea of docking dirigibles on top of The Empire State Building was a grand one. It seems as though the dream of dirigible transportation was on its upward trajectory. However, the architects were blinded by their excitement. Al's highly competitive nature not only pushed the building to an unprecedented 1,250 ft., but also combined transportation in new, fashionable, and effective ways. This not only made the public and architects extremely excited but also placed a great deal of expectations on the building. Al Smith did not foresee all the obstacles ahead that would halt his dirigible plans. One of the obstacles was that the swaying of the dirigible would add considerable stress to the frame of the building. Although the necessary precautions were taken, this obstacle was a foreshadowing of the others to come. When the dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire due to the hydrogen gas, people became skeptical. They worried about what would happen if it were to blow up over a crowded New York city street. Also, an existing law against aircrafts flying too low over urban areas prohibited the dirigible plans. The numerous obstacles proved to be too much for the plan to go through. Though the plans were merely postponed, by the late 1930s, the idea of dirigibles atop the Empire State Building had completely disappeared, as the challenges were insurmountable.
110	14943	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"", by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1, the builders of the Empire State Building faced several significant obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The builders of the Empire State Building failed to realize that building the mast would create too many problems and safety risks. Without thoroughly thinking about the obstacles, the mooring mast also had inherent problems on its own. According to the excerpt, one of its greatest obstacles was that ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This situation resulted in a major problem because the dirigible could drift anywhere, failing to land in the mast properly and causing potential damage. With this problem also came risks for pedestrians who were on the streets below. The dirigibles ""...could be weighted down in the back with lead weights"" because they typically used open landing fields. This was not a good idea to implement at the Empire State Building. Another thing the builders should have carefully considered was that there was a law in place already that strictly prohibited ""...airships flying too low over urban areas."" All in all, there were a lot of crucial things that the builders should have taken into account before attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, as these issues made the plan unworkable."
111	14944	6	3	"Based on the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" written by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State building faced numerous obstructions in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. One significant problem was that the architects couldn't simply place a mooring mast on the flat roof of the Empire State building. They needed to make specific modifications to ensure it was safe for a dirigible to land. The most substantial obstacle was nature. L¸sted described it well in paragraph @NUM1, ""The winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to the violent air - currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mast, making the docking process extremely precarious."" The final challenge the builders faced was that even if they managed to install the mooring mast, there was a law stating that it was illegal for dirigibles to land there. L¸sted said in paragraph @NUM2, ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area..."". Clearly, from these examples, the builders of the Empire State building encountered many hurdles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there, ultimately making the endeavor unfeasible."
112	14945	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced were primarily related to the weather. Nature itself would disrupt the building's time - frame. The winds would shift erratically. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around continuously due to the strong and changing wind forces. Another challenge the builders ran into was that dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building because of an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law was in place to safeguard the safety of the people on the ground, and it effectively put a halt to the plans of using the building for dirigible docking.
113	14946	6	3	The builders of the Empire State building faced many challenges in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the mooring at the top of the building. The main challenge was caused by nature itself. The winds above the building were constantly blowing and changing direction. This would cause any dirigible attempting to dock to swing around and sway in the wind, which posed many safety risks for passengers boarding and disembarking from the zeppelin. The dirigible could also puncture its frame on nearby structures while attempting to dock, endangering people on the building and on the ground. Having a zeppelin attached to the building also made it structurally unstable, and the builders had to make modifications to the building's frame to provide more support. However, these efforts were in vain. In the end, the idea was dropped because it was unworkable and unrealistic, given the multiple and insurmountable challenges.
114	14947	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced several difficulties while trying to dock dirigibles. One obstacle was nature. At the top of the building, the winds were constantly changing due to violent air currents. This would make a ship swivel around dangerously. Even if it was tied to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would move uncontrollably. As L¸sted wrote, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigibles were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel."" Another obstacle was safety. Foreign ships used hydrogen, an extremely flammable gas. In fields, they used lead weights to weigh them down. If an accident happened with either the hydrogen or the lead weights, it would be extremely fatal. A flaming dirigible or a falling metal object at extreme heights would cause serious injuries as the landing area was above a highly populated city. L¸sted also noted, ""Dirigibles from outside the @LOCATION1 use hydrogen... is highly flammable."" and ""Could be weighted down by lead weights, but using these at the Empire State building, where they would be hanging high above pedestrians on the street."" Additionally, a law forbids ships to fly in low urban areas, so even if the mooring worked, it couldn't be used. These factors led to the quiet disappearance of the idea in the late 1930's, as the risks and legal restrictions made it an unviable option."
115	14948	6	3	"Throughout the passage, the builders were faced with many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State building. Al Smith had the visionary idea to have dirigibles be a new form of transportation. The concept sounded appealing as dirigibles could move at a rate of seventy - five miles per hour and cover thousands of feet without needing to be refueled. Anxious and eager, Al Smith was quite uncertain about when everything would be completed, stating, ""It's on the level, all right. No kidding. We're working on the thing now."" However, it simply wouldn't be possible for the architect to place the huge mooring mass on the building's flat roof. Another major problem was the violent wind currents that made docking a dirigible extremely difficult. As a result, the fate of the dirigible as a docking option at the Empire State building faded out. Airplanes became a more suitable choice for passengers compared to dirigibles, as they were less affected by the wind and other challenges faced by dirigibles, ultimately ending the hope of using the Empire State building for dirigible docking."
116	14949	6	3	Based on the excerpt I just read, these are some of the obstacles that the @ORGANIZATION1 faced. One of the obstacles was the balloon because it had helium and it was also flammable. This flammability presented a significant risk during operations. The second obstacle was that one couldn't control the balloon easily; it would be at the mercy of the winds and other environmental factors. The third obstacle the Empire State Building had was a flat roof, which made docking and securing the balloon more difficult. And these are the obstacles that the @ORGANIZATION1 had to deal with in their attempt to work with the balloon at the Empire State Building.
117	14950	6	3	There were several obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first problem they faced was they would have to change and fix the @CAPS1 of the Building in order to compensate for all the stress there would be on the Building when the dirigibles landed. This stress could potentially damage the structure over time, so proper reinforcement was crucial. After they constructed and built the landing, there were several more problems. The first problem was that the hydrogen in the balloons is very flammable. This is a problem because New York is densely populated and with a flammable substance above their heads, it poses a significant threat, especially in case of an accident. The second problem was the dirigible itself. It can easily blow in the wind and would constantly wave in the wind, and unlike in a field, weights could not be tied to the back of it because of the crowds below. This lack of stability made docking and mooring extremely challenging. The third and final problem they dealt with was the law: airships are not allowed to fly low over urban areas. The Empire State Building was too low in an urban area for anything to fly over it. Several of these problems led to the failure of the original idea and left the Empire State Building with a tall post of no purpose, ultimately rendering the docking plan unfeasible.
118	14951	6	3	"Dirigibles, also known today as Blimps, used to dock at the Empire State Building. The Empire State building was used as a docking ground for dirigibles, which are enormous steel - formed balloons filled with hydrogen and helium, which made them lighter than air. These gases provided the necessary buoyancy for the dirigibles to stay aloft. They had a top speed of @NUM1 mph for thousands of miles, allowing them to cover long distances relatively quickly. ""Al Smith saw an opportunity for the Empire State building: A moor added to the top of the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers on and off."" As stated in the excerpt. The dirigibles were docked by an electric winch which stopped the big balloon from going anywhere and tied it to the mast. This winch was a crucial component in the docking process. Al Smith was successful when building the moor because it was good for dirigibles, providing them with a convenient stop - over point during their flights."
119	14952	6	3	Some of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was that it wouldn't be able to tie cable tether, because it adds stress to the building's frame. This additional stress could compromise the structural integrity of the building over time. Also, in the story, they tell you how the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate to the new situation. Strengthening the frame was a complex and costly process, but it was necessary to ensure the safety of both the building and the dirigibles during docking operations. These obstacles made the plan to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building a challenging one to execute.
120	14953	6	3	"In ""The Mooring Mast"", many of the builders faced obstacles for attempting dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. Many of the reasons had to do with safety. Although the idea to dock dirigibles to the building sounded good, many things could have gone wrong. The Empire State Building was an enormous structure for its time, even though it looked ideal for the mast to go on. However, ""winds"" would be too dangerous for even the most skilled pilots to maneuver the dirigibles. The strong winds around the building could push the dirigibles off - course and make docking nearly impossible. Also, most of the dirigibles from other countries such as @LOCATION2 used ""hydrogen"" in their blimps. Although the dirigibles were ""hailed"" as the transportation of the future, too many safety precautions had to be taken because of the densely populated area of New York City. A hydrogen leak or explosion could have catastrophic consequences for the people below. For the dirigibles at the time, they were a sound and good idea for transportation, but even though the structure of the Empire State Building looked good, they still had to be careful with the building and the people below. And for the German hydrogen - filled blimps, they were not a good option in terms of safety over a populated city, ultimately making the docking plan unviable due to safety concerns."
121	14954	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced several significant obstacles in their attempts to allow dirigibles to dock there. One major hurdle was the unpredictable changes in wind current. Although dirigibles did have steering systems and could be tethered, the powerful wind could easily overpower these systems. This would cause the dirigible to lose control and potentially crash, endangering both the passengers on board and the people below. Another substantial obstacle was the lingering fear of another “Hindenburg” accident. On May 6, 1937, the Hindenburg, a dirigible filled with hydrogen (a highly flammable gas), was ignited and burned down. While the casualties were mainly the men and women on board, if such an incident were to happen above the highly populated New York City, the number of deaths would undoubtedly increase due to the countless pedestrians on the streets below. These challenges ultimately made the idea of dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building unfeasible.
122	14955	6	3	Some significant obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there are safety and nature. Safety was a major concern because most dirigibles from outside the U.S. used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is extremely flammable, and it was not safe at all as it could have easily caught fire, just like the “Hindenburg” did in 1937. The owners of the Empire State Building witnessed the disaster and realized how unsafe it would be for the public and the building itself if a similar incident were to occur. Nature is another formidable obstacle. The wind currents on the top of the building kept shifting continuously because of the violent air currents. These unpredictable wind changes made it extremely difficult and dangerous for dirigibles to approach and dock safely. In conclusion, these safety and nature - related issues were significant roadblocks for the builders in their attempt to have dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building.
123	14956	6	3	Although high expectations were conceived for the Empire State Building, the builders faced numerous and complex obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, as explained in the excerpt from The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lusted. The dream of having a mooring mast to dock new airships was quickly halted when architects first discovered the substantial stress that a dirigible, held by a single cable tether, would add to the building's structure. As a result, “the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would...be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation...nearly eleven hundred feet below” (paragraph 3). Consequently, architects had to carefully reinforce the building's framework to accommodate the tremendous amounts of stress that the docking of dirigibles would generate. Secondly, the owners of the Empire State Building found that a law concerning airships became an insurmountable obstacle as well. The law clearly stated that airships could not fly too low over populated urban areas. This law became another practical reason why dirigibles could not moor atop the miraculous building. Finally, architects had also discovered the greatest obstacle to their success to be nature itself. The winds atop the building were described to be extremely violent, forcefully blowing, and highly unpredictable. As a result, mooring dirigibles to the mast “where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe” (paragraph 4). Moreover, the violent winds made it extremely difficult for dirigibles to approach the mooring mast. In December 1930, the captain of the U.S. Navy dirigible “Los Angeles” feared that “the wind would blow the dirigible into the sharp spires of other buildings in the area, which would puncture the dirigible's shell” (paragraph 5). In effect, the idea of using the mooring mast to dock dirigibles atop the Empire State Building quietly faded away. As described by Marcia Amidon Lusted in the excerpt from The Mooring Mast, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many insurmountable obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there, and these obstacles ultimately led to the abandonment of the plan.
124	14957	6	3	The Top of the Empire State Building would serve a purpose that was more than just ornamental. It was not merely a spire or dome or a pyramid added to the building for aesthetic reasons. Instead, it was intended to add a desired few extra feet to the height of the building, which would have been a significant achievement in the world of architecture at that time. Additionally, it could have been used to mask certain structural elements or equipment on the top of the building. However, due to various challenges such as safety concerns and practical difficulties, the full - fledged purpose of the top of the building in relation to dirigibles docking was never realized. In conclusion, while the top of the Empire State Building had grand aspirations, it faced limitations that prevented it from fulfilling all of its intended functions.
125	14958	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were quite substantial. Firstly, most dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. This posed a significant fire risk. A single spark could cause a massive explosion and fire, endangering the lives of everyone on board the dirigible and the people on the ground below. Another major reason was the wind. The winds on top of the building were “constantly shifting due to violent air currents.” These unpredictable wind patterns made it extremely difficult for dirigibles to approach and dock safely. It was not only a matter of the dirigible's stability during docking but also the potential for it to be blown off - course and collide with the building or other structures. Moreover, it will not be safe for the pedestrians below the Empire State Building. A crashing or out - of - control dirigible could cause serious harm to those on the streets. In conclusion, these safety and wind - related issues made it almost impossible for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
126	14959	6	3	"In Marcia Amidon L¸sted's excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"", it focuses on the Empire State Building, which was built to be the tallest building. There were numerous ways in which the builders faced challenges when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. In the excerpt, it states, ""Most dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium (hydrogen is more flammable)"". This fact proves how it's likely to destroy the entire Empire State Building with fire. Another instance that portrays how builders faced difficulties when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there is when it states, ""Dangling high above pedestrians on the street was neither practical nor safe"". This situation raises concerns about the safety of the people walking on the street and what if they get hurt. Finally, another example that portrays the obstacles the builders faced is when it states, ""... blow the dirigible onto the sharp spires of other buildings"". This scenario proves that if the dirigibles cause an issue at the Empire State, it's not the only building in danger; others around it are too. All these factors made it extremely challenging to achieve the goal of dirigible docking at the Empire State Building."
127	14960	6	3	"In the non - fiction article ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, it gives information about the potential problems from the Mast. In the text, specifically in @CAPS1 @NUM1, it says ""The steel Frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened."" This clearly shows that at first, the building was not strong enough to hold the heavy weight of dirigibles or blimps. Another significant problem was nature. The workers had to take nature into full effect. If they had a dirigible or a blimp up there, the strong wind could potentially harm the dirigible. There was also a strict law in place that forbade aircraft to fly that low. Finally, workers had to make the height of the building exceed any other height that was taller. In @CAPS1 @NUM2, it says ""In December 11, 1929, he announced that the Empire... would reach 1,250 feet..."" John Tauranac also followed by saying ""Their top they said would serve a higher calling."" The builders had a lot to take into account. They had height issues, frame issues, and law issues that they had to sort out to make the dirigible docking possible at the Empire State Building."
128	14961	6	3	"In the novel, ""The Mooring Mast"", by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the obstacles that the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were mainly engineering challenges. A major problem with the docking was that the building was already complete before the idea of dirigible docking came to mind. A second significant problem was that the whole skeletal structure of the building had to be changed in order for dirigibles to be able to dock. Then, there was the question of how the airships, dirigibles, would stay next to the building steadily. These problems became even harder to solve after it was made illegal to have dirigibles be close to buildings. Plus, the fact that if they crash, dirigibles are highly flammable and could kill people. All these facts combined made it extremely difficult for the Empire State Building to build a dirigible dock as described in the novel, ""The Mooring Mast"", by Marcia Amidon L¸sted."
129	14962	6	3	"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1, there is a significant obstacle that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. This idea would not work because the dirigibles are way too heavy, and that would cause more pressure towards the Empire State Building. When there is a massive amount of pressure on the building, it would collapse. As stated, ""The dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which is nearly eleven hundred feet below."" Another obstacle is that it was very expensive to build the docking facility. ""Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" In New York, there are many places and people are tightly packed. There isn't any space that is big enough for the dock. ""Some dirigibles were as long as one thousand feet, the same length as four blocks in New York city."" These are the main obstacles that made it nearly impossible for the Empire State Building to allow dirigibles to dock."
130	14963	6	3	"Based on the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"", by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to let dirigibles dock there. One major obstacle they faced was that the building's frame would have to be modified. This was because the dirigible would add a significant amount of stress to the frame of the building when docked on it. These modifications would cost over sixty thousand dollars, which was a huge expense. Another obstacle the builders faced was that it would be too difficult to keep the dirigibles still. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This made it extremely dangerous for passengers as well as pedestrians on the street and prevented the dirigible from getting close enough to tie up. A third obstacle the builders faced was that there was an existing law that said airships could not fly too low over urban areas because it was very dangerous. Although it seemed like a good idea to have dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building, there were too many obstacles and dangers involved, making it an unfeasible plan."
131	14964	6	3	There were numerous obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building encountered when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the most apparent problems was that it was an urban area filled with a large number of pedestrians walking on the streets. People didn't want dirigibles flying so close overhead without knowing what was going to happen. Another significant issue was that the German dirigible had been destroyed by fire. They had to consider how much worse the situation could have been if it had occurred on the mooring mast, potentially resulting in the loss of lives and the complete destruction of the building. Additionally, they had to think about how much more construction work and money it would take for the Empire State Building to be able to hold a dirigible. There were many problems they didn't think about during the process, which is why the mooring mast wasn't as successful as planned. In the end, these unforeseen and challenging obstacles led to the failure of the dirigible - docking plan.
132	14965	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced a multitude of obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. One major problem was the structural stress. A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by just a single cable, would add a substantial amount of stress to the building's frame. To strengthen the frame to withstand this stress, it would cost over sixty thousand dollars, which was a significant financial burden. Another challenging aspect was the combination of the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure. The wind could push and pull the dirigible in various directions, further increasing the stress on the building. The last and perhaps most crucial obstacle was safety. If an accident were to take place in downtown New York, with its high population density, the consequences would be truly devastating. Due to these insurmountable obstacles, the plan to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building had to be abandoned.
133	14966	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The @CAPS1 Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. One significant obstacle that the builders faced was safety. In paragraph @NUM1, it was clearly stated that ""most dirigibles from outside of the @CAPS2 used hydrogen rather than helium"". Hydrogen is highly flammable, which posed a great risk to the building and the surrounding area. In paragraph @NUM2, it states that ""if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around"". This situation is neither practical nor safe. For a tethered ship, the back should be stable to ensure the safety of passengers and crew. The last obstacle that the builders faced was a law against airships flying too low. In paragraph @NUM3, it is evident that ""this law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"". Although some ships did attempt to reach the building, there was no success. In conclusion, these safety and legal obstacles made it impossible for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building."
134	14967	6	3	"When the idea of making a mooring mast atop the Empire State Building was first conceived, the builders did not fully realize the numerous obstacles that they would have to overcome. One major obstacle was ""nature itself"". The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. This means that if a dirigible were to be tied up for loading and unloading, it could be moved around freely in the sky. This movement would make it extremely dangerous for passengers to be on or around the dirigible. An example of the dangerous winds was in 1930, when the ""U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds"". A significant concern for safety was that ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"". If something were to go wrong, such as a fire or explosion, there could be catastrophic consequences for the heavily populated downtown of @LOCATION2. A third and final obstacle that occurred was ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"". Due to these insurmountable obstacles, the idea to have dirigibles dock at the top of the Empire State Building seemed impossible from the start and was ultimately never accomplished."
135	14968	6	3	Now, people clearly recognize what a ludicrous idea it was to have dirigibles dock on top of the Empire State Building. However, in the @DATE1's and @NUM1's, people were completely unaware of the many potential failures and the numerous obstacles that the builders would face. One of the major obstacles was the use of fuel. Most of these dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is extremely flammable, which put the entire city at a high risk of a major disaster. Another significant obstacle was nature. The winds on top of the Empire State Building were so strong and unpredictable that it was extremely difficult to bring the dirigibles even remotely close to the mast. The wind could push the dirigibles off - course and make docking almost impossible. Yet another obstacle facing the builders of the mast was a law that strictly prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas like New York City. Overall, the idea could not be transformed into a real - life, visual reality because of the many obstacles faced by the builders of the mast. Nowadays, people have airplanes and well - equipped airports to dock the planes, so there is no practical use for the mast on top of the Empire State Building in the context of aviation.
136	14969	6	3	"Builders had to face numerous obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. The biggest obstacle was the safety risk. Having a dirigible dangling over the city and thousands of pedestrians was extremely unsafe. The dirigibles would be held by a single cable tether, and this would add a great deal of stress on the building's frame, potentially compromising its structural integrity. Another major obstacle they faced was nature. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents,"" making it very difficult to control the dirigible during docking. Moreover, over @MONEY1 would be needed for all the necessary modifications and safety measures to make this docking possible. In conclusion, these significant obstacles made the idea of dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building a very challenging and perhaps unfeasible proposition."
137	14970	6	3	"Allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building caused a multitude of obstacles. One of these prominent obstacles was the use of hydrogen. Dirigibles outside the @PERSON1 commonly used hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable, and the builders were well - aware of the extreme danger it posed. In the excerpt, it says, ""The owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" Another obstacle people had to deal with was nature. As described in the excerpt, the air currents were ""violent,"" and this made it extremely difficult to control the dirigible during approach and docking. Finally, dirigibles mooring at the Empire State Building would be illegal. It says, ""An existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" Due to this law, @CAPS1 the dirigibles could not dock over a heavily populated city like New York City. In summary, these many obstacles made it very challenging to dock dirigibles on the Empire State Building."
138	14971	6	3	"In building the dirigible docks on the Empire State Building, builders faced an onslaught of problems that, in hindsight, should have been easy to anticipate. Everyone got caught up in the hype, in my opinion. Outside of the U.S., other dirigibles used hydrogen, which is highly flammable, instead of helium. After the Hindenburg disaster, ""... the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" This realization highlighted the grave danger of having hydrogen - filled dirigibles dock at the building. Winds also presented a major obstacle in the construction. ""... the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast,"" making it nearly impossible for the dirigibles to tie to the dock and stay stable because of the violent air currents. There was also a law holding airships from flying too low in urban areas. ""The law would make it illegal for an airship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area..."". Finally, as times changed, planes became the new fad for air transport, effectively ending dirigibles' run as the main provider. In conclusion, these multiple problems and the change in the aviation landscape made the dirigible docks on the Empire State Building an unviable project."
139	14972	6	3	"The builders ran into quite a few serious problems when they attempted to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. As stated in paragraph @NUM1, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium; and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This would mean that if a docked dirigible filled with hydrogen were to catch on fire, it would not only burn down the Empire State Building but also much of the surrounding city, and the resulting explosion would kill many people. Another main obstacle, as stated in paragraph @NUM2, was nature. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" These unpredictable winds would make it almost impossible for a dirigible to reach the mast and actually dock. Moreover, once the dirigible was tied to the mast, it would be swinging around violently, endangering both the dirigible and the building. The third major problem was the law against aircraft flying low over urban areas, as stated in paragraph @NUM3. ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" With such a law in place, no one would even want to attempt the docking. In conclusion, these three major problems presented insurmountable challenges when building the mast for dirigible docking."
140	14973	6	3	"The Empire State Building builders had to face hard obstacles in various aspects, such as ""accommodating passengers,"" establishing new routes, and dealing with nature itself. When it came to accommodating the passengers, they had to bring them to the existing trans - atlantic routes because the new routes weren't made yet. The reason was that the building needed to be taller. So, they added more structures on the top of it. They aimed to make the State Building suitable for dirigible docking, but nature was a huge hurdle. The building was affected by @CAPS1 shifting due to ""violent air currents."" Also, the dirigible was more accustomed to open fields for mooring, and the conditions at the building were far from ideal. Additionally, the State Building was weighted down by lead weights, which might have further complicated the docking process. In conclusion, these multiple obstacles made it very difficult for the Empire State Building to become a successful dirigible docking site."
141	14974	6	3	There are a few obstacles the builders faced when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. One was the violently changing wind currents at the height where the docking was to take place. These strong and unpredictable wind currents would vigorously move the blimp and possibly send it crashing into another building, puncturing the side of the balloon. Continuously docking dirigible after dirigible would put a significant amount of stress on the building itself. This stress would disrupt the frame and possibly affect the building as a whole. Also, most dirigibles outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable, as clearly seen in the tragic Hindenburg disaster. Due to all these reasons, the mooring mast never saw a docked blimp, making the idea of dirigibles docking on the Empire State Building unfeasible.
142	14975	6	3	"According to the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, engineers encountered several obstacles when they attempted to allow dirigibles to dock in the Empire State Building. As stated in paragraph number nine, the major problem was ""the stress of the dirigible's load."" With all this substantial weight being transmitted to the building's foundation, the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be carefully modified and significantly strengthened to accommodate its new situation. This was very expensive to do. A sum of sixty thousand dollars was necessary. Another problem was that the blimps would not stay still while docked. The strong winds would toss it around wildly. A proposed solution was putting weights at the back of the landing fields, but as explained in paragraph @NUM1, the weights ""would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street,"" posing a great risk. Due to these insurmountable obstacles, the plan to have dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building was ultimately abandoned."
143	14976	6	3	"When building the Empire State Building, builders were faced with several obstacles in their attempts to have dirigibles dock there. The builders first had to ensure that the building was going to be able to firmly support the dirigible. After they completed this, issues relating to safety arose. It was very dangerous because some air balloons were made out of hydrogen, which is highly flammable. If there were any issues, New York's large population could be in grave danger. The wind also was an issue. Since it was so shifty, a dirigible would be heavy in the back. Having lead weights dangling above New York was very dangerous. The last complication that affected the idea of docking the dirigibles was ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban area."" Because of the law, safety and nature complications, builders were never able to successfully reach their goal of allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, leaving the mooring mast unused for its intended purpose."
144	14977	6	3	"In the excerpt, The Mooring Mast, by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, there were many obstacles in the construction of the Empire State Building in allowing dirigibles to dock there. The author states ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" That law made it illegal for a ship to approach the area and to get tied up to the building. Another obstacle was the lack of sufficient landing area. It was a great challenge to expand in the densely - populated New York City, causing it extremely hard to land dirigibles. The greatest obstacle was nature itself. The ever - changing weather would cause the dirigibles to swivel around the mooring mast uncontrollably. The author states, ""Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights... dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe."" Due to these multiple obstacles, the plan to have dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building could not be realized."
145	14978	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State building faced many difficulties in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One difficulty they faced was when they were designing the mast. They ""could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof..."" (∂ @NUM1) because it ""would add excessive stress to the building's frame"". (∂ @NUM1) This was a significant difficulty because the Empire State Building's frame had to be carefully modified and substantially strengthened to accommodate it, resulting in @MONEY1 in modifications. Another difficulty faced by the builders was in regards to nature. As dirigibles use ""hydrogen instead of helium"" (∂ @NUM3), there was a great risk of a large - scale fire; always a major problem above a densely - populated city like New York. The wind was also a problem. The winds on top of the building were ""constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (∂ @NUM4). The back of the ship would have to be weighed down by lead; again, not a feasible solution in a busy city like New York. A final difficulty the builders faced were existing air laws. The builders faced the issue of an existing law against airships ""flying too low over urban areas."" (∂ @NUM5) This made it ""illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" (∂ @NUM5) Some of the many difficulties faced by builders of the Empire State Building were mast designs, nature and existing air flights laws, which ultimately prevented dirigibles from docking there."
146	14979	6	3	Some of the problems they faced when building the Empire State Building was the height. Constructing a building that high up and also expecting it to serve functions such as boarding dirigibles was quite challenging. The impact of the dirigible against the building could cause it to collapse. That's why the contractor had to reshape the skeleton of the building to enhance its stability and withstand potential forces from the dirigibles.
147	14980	6	3	"In the passage, ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1, there were a lot of conflicts that the builders ran into while trying to let the dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building. One problem was safety. Unlike regular balloons, dirigibles were made of hydrogen. Hydrogen is highly flammable. This would have been a serious problem if it was above people on the street and the building, as a small spark could lead to a large - scale disaster. Another problem was nature. The winds, where they would have docked, would have been way too strong. As the passage says ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" (@NUM1). These shifting winds made it extremely difficult to safely dock the dirigibles. One last reason is because there was a law against aircrafts from flying too close to neighborhoods. All in all, the dirigibles ran into a lot of difficulties, making the docking plan unfeasible."
148	14981	6	3	"Al Smith, a former governor of New York, had a brilliant idea to make the Empire State Building, the tallest building in the world. He would put a mooring mast on the top to attach dirigibles to the top so the dirigibles could let passengers off here. This concept seemed innovative at the time. But, this plan had many drawbacks. ""The stress of the dirigible's load into the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation"". This is a problem because if the mast was just placed on the building, it would destroy itself as the building might not be able to handle the extra stress. Another problem is that ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States use hydrogen."" Hydrogen is a very flammable gas, and would put the whole section of the city underneath the Zeppelin at risk of a major fire. The third reason was an existing law which prevented airships from flying too low in urban areas. Due to these issues, the plan to use the building for dirigible docking was not practical."
149	14982	6	3	"In the excerpt from ""The @CAPS1 Mast"" by Marcia Amidon @CAPS2, many obstacles are described from the construction of the Empire State Building in New York City. Thousands of dollars were spent on hopeless modifications to the building, in efforts to add a mooring mast to the top for the docking of dirigibles, or blimps. These efforts however were unsuccessful. Two main obstacles builders faced during construction were safety and nature. After a 1937 dirigible fire in New Jersey, owners of the Empire State Building ""...realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" (@NUM1, @CAPS2). This realization made them aware of the high - risk nature of the project. And an existing law forbade low - flying airships in urban areas. Also, the unpredictable winds provided workers with a very risky, dangerous situation. In the end, although builders faced many obstacles during construction, dirigibles were never docked on the building, showing that the challenges were insurmountable."
150	14983	6	3	The Empire State Building faced several major problems in making a station for dirigibles to dock. One is, that at that time there was a law prohibiting airships of any kind landing/docking in a residential area, never mind a densely populated city. This legal restriction was a significant roadblock to the plan. There were also many issues with practicalities with the mast, if it was even constructed. It would have been a huge hassle to get the huge airships docked, as they required precise maneuvering in the often - windy conditions at the building's height, and keeping them there would have been equally difficult. Never mind the extremely flammable hydrogen gas zeppelins were often filled with. The presence of this gas made the whole docking idea a safety hazard. All these problems combined made it impossible to establish a successful dirigible docking station at the Empire State Building.
151	14984	6	3	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were for many different reasons. One of them is the weather. As described, ""the greatest obstacle to successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"", which made it extremely difficult to keep the dirigibles stable. The second one is that there was a law against airships. Specifically, ""there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"", which restricted the dirigibles' approach to the building. Another problem is that if the dirigible were to dock, it would be dangling high above people. As stated, ""...they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, which was neither practical nor safe"". These are some of the problems that they had, and they ultimately made it unfeasible for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building."
152	14985	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building had to face the obstacle of safety, ensuring that everyone could get on the dirigible safely without any form of danger. This involved considering factors like boarding procedures and the stability of the docking area. Another obstacle is arranging the dirigibles so that they are able to board passengers from there. As @PERSON1 said, ""the height made it desirable to postpone to a later date the final installation of the landing gears"", indicating the challenges posed by the building's height. People didn't want to try it, which was another significant obstacle. If people didn't want to try it, then the docking facility would become just a decoration, and that's not what Al Smith wanted. The last obstacle would be that it wouldn't hold for long, as said in the excerpt, ""The mooring mast on the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed."" In other words, the architects didn't think far enough ahead into the future to see if the mooring mast would even be used. These are some of the obstacles that the builders had to face, and they hindered the successful implementation of the dirigible docking plan."
153	14986	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles while constructing a mast that would make it possible for dirigibles to dock. The greatest obstacle of all was nature itself. It was unrealistic to have a dirigible tied by a single cable tether to remain intact when the winds on top of the building were constantly changing due to violent air currents. These strong and unpredictable winds could cause the dirigible to sway and twist. The back of the ship would swivel around the mast, which was hazardous for pedestrians below. There was nothing the builders could do to alter nature, so their ideas soon became unrealistic. Another obstacle the builders faced while constructing the building was that the dirigible's weight would add too much stress (especially with added wind pressure) to the building's frame. The extra load could potentially damage the structure. They then decided the only way to fix that problem was to shift the weight to the building's foundation, which required significant engineering adjustments. These obstacles made it very challenging to achieve the goal of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
154	14987	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One problem was attaching a mooring mast to the top of the building. Because of the height of the Empire State Building, they were unable to just drop the mast onto the roof as it would have interfered with the building's overall frame. In order to keep the mooring mast atop the roof, the architects spent thousands of dollars on modifying the framework of the building to ensure its stability. Another obstacle for the docking of dirigibles was the preservation of the safety of the public below. Dirigibles were inflated with highly flammable hydrogen, creating the risk of a massive explosion over New York and endangering countless lives. This risk had to be carefully considered and mitigated. Lastly, a very important obstacle for the builders was the danger of nature. Violent air currents filled the winds above and around the Empire State Building. Even if a dirigible were strung to the roof, the back of the ship would continue to swivel, causing even more danger to citizens below the building. Those were some obstacles that builders faced and prevented the making of a mooring mast to let dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building, highlighting the complexity of the project.
155	14988	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was the frame of the building. In @LOCATION1 @NUM1, it explains that attaching a dirigible to the building would add stress to the building's frame. They had to modify the whole frame of the building to a stronger material for the mooring mast to work, which was a costly and time - consuming process. One of the biggest obstacles was safety. Most dirigibles use hydrogen to power them, and hydrogen is highly flammable. There is a great risk of the dirigibles catching on fire when flying over such a densely populated area as New York, which could lead to a catastrophic event. Another obstacle in the way of the mooring mast was the conditions at the top of the building. At the top of the Empire State Building, there are violent winds that would cause the dirigibles to swivel around the mooring mast, making docking and staying in place extremely difficult. Lastly, an obstacle the builders faced was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. As explained in @LOCATION1, because of this law, it is illegal to even fly up to the Empire State Building. With all of these obstacles, it is clear why the mooring mast wasn't used, as they presented insurmountable challenges to the project.
156	14989	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous problems while trying to allow the dirigibles to dock there. They couldn't simply allow the dirigibles to land on the building's flat roof, as the dirigible weighed too much and would add significant stress to the building's frame. The plan never came to fruition for several reasons. A major issue was safety. The dirigibles used hydrogen, a highly flammable substance. Having this dangerous material floating above New York was too risky. The greatest challenge was the wind. The wind direction and intensity were constantly changing due to air currents. The dirigible could be tethered down, but it would be floating in the air above pedestrians, posing a threat. Ultimately, the plan to build a mooring mast on the Empire State Building to allow dirigibles to dock there was a failure.
157	14990	6	3	"While building the Empire State Building, Al Smith believed he had found a solution to the problem of dirigibles having nowhere to land. However, making the building a docking place for dirigibles turned out to be much more difficult than it initially seemed. First, the balloon of the dirigible would cause excessive stress to the building's frame. As the author states, ""The stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation..."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). Moreover, since this frame would need to be modified, a substantial amount of money would be required. The author notes, ""Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework"" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). It was too risky to invest in such an uncertain project. Additionally, they realized how dangerous any accidents could be over such a densely populated area. The author explains, ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used Hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (@CAPS1 @NUM3). If an accident occurred, a large part of New York could have suffered. Although the plan of creating a mast for dirigibles was impressive, it was neither financially logical nor safe."
158	14991	6	3	During the building of the mast, the builders encountered many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there. The primary obstacle was the building itself. By adding the mast, a great deal of stress would be added to the building's frame, and thus, strengthening modifications had to be carried out before the mast was erected. Another problem was how to tether the blimp properly. Usually, blimps are landed in wide - open fields, where weights can be placed at the front and back of the blimp to secure it properly. But since the blimp was going to be attached to a mast, there was no way to secure the back of the blimp, and therefore, no safe way to tie it down. Finally, the last problem the builders faced was how to even get the blimp docked. Due to the strong winds on top of the building, there was no practical way to dock the blimp unless the weather was perfect. In the end, all these problems meant that the mast could never be used for its intended purpose.
159	14992	6	3	Many obstacles stood in the way of docking the dirigibles on the Empire State Building. One obstacle the builders faced was the law that stated airships couldn't fly too low over urban areas. This restricted the dirigibles' approach and made docking more difficult. Additionally, the builders would have to reinforce specific parts of the building to support the stress that the dirigibles would place on the frame. This required time, effort, and resources. Lastly, nature was a major hindrance. The violent winds on top of the building would shift the back of the dirigible, causing it to sway wildly. These conditions made it impossible to safely dock the dirigibles. All these obstacles ensured that dirigibles could not be docked at the Empire State Building.
160	14993	6	3	The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were significant. The dirigibles would add a large amount of stress to the frame of the building. The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be carefully modified and strengthened to handle this situation. Over sixty thousand dollars were needed to make the necessary adjustments to the structure of the building. The greatest obstacle was nature itself. The winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. These unpredictable winds made it extremely difficult to safely dock the dirigibles. These were some of the insurmountable obstacles that prevented the builders of the Empire State Building from successfully allowing dirigibles to dock there.
161	14994	6	3	"The obstacles that builders faced in making the Empire State Building a docking point reached the greatest problems. Obstacles come in all forms, depending on the size of the goal. The goal of making the building a docking point was immense, so the range of obstacles was at its greatest. The problems were related to law, nature, safety, and the very concept of docking. Firstly, the main problem was the location. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" This would have not only torn down the entire building but sent it crashing down onto pedestrians within the range of eleven hundred feet in the direction it was hauled. Secondly, instead of helium, dirigibles used hydrogen instead, ""and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This posed a significant safety issue, especially over a highly populated urban area like New York. Thirdly, the building was so high that it intercepted higher forces of wind. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This could have made a dirigible strain against the building or crash against the mooring point. Lastly, the law prevented all ""airships flying too low over urban areas."" As high as the Empire State Building was, it was still too close to the public. Overall, the builders were perhaps over - ambitious, and that created obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. They made the goal so large that it caused the obstacles to reach their peak of difficulty. The purpose of making the Empire State Building a docking point may be a failure, but it still stands as the tallest building constructed at that time."
162	14995	6	3	"In the short story, ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when building the mast. The entire steel frame of the Building would have had to be strengthened to hold the weight of the mast. The mast, which towered at over @NUM1 feet tall, would have stressed the steel frame of the Building, gradually making its foundation weaker. To hold the mast, ""Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" This meant that the builders had to carefully and thoroughly think through the process of how they were going to get the mast to not bend the steel frame. Another obstacle the builders faced was a new law that forbid airships from flying too low over urban areas, such as New York. Therefore, ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the Building or even approach the area."" Because of this law, the mast was very rarely used. Regardless of what they tried, the builders would have to make big and well - planned changes to the Empire State Building's framework in order to have the mast. However, the new law prevented airships from docking there, so the mast was not used as often as originally projected. The mast did help make the Empire State Building the largest building in the world at 1,250 feet, but it forced strengthening and fixing of the building's framework, and the mast was not used as much as the builders had initially thought. In the end, despite the efforts, the mast's intended function was largely unfulfilled."
163	14996	6	3	"The builders came across many obstacles while trying to build the Empire State building for dirigibles to dock. One obstacle was just having ""... a single cable tether."" which they went on to say it would add significant stress to the building, so they had to fix that. They chose to carefully modify the frame and strengthen it as well to withstand the potential forces. Another obstacle was having to get the right equipment. They had to go to the @ORGANIZATION2 air station to obtain some crucial information. The last obstacle would be that the dirigibles were filled with oxygen instead of Helium. This had meant it was very highly flammable, which was a major safety concern that they must seriously consider. While trying to make this work for the dirigibles, they came across building - related problems, safety issues, and dangerous situations. In conclusion, these multiple obstacles made it extremely challenging for the builders to achieve their goal of making the Empire State Building a suitable docking point for dirigibles."
164	14997	6	3	When the Empire State building was built, the workers were trying to find new and innovative ways to @CAPS1 the structure. They suddenly had found some problems, one being the top of the empire state building. Workers had tried to figure out how they were going to place a Dirigibles on top of the building so that they could be able to pick up people and drop them off up there. However, there were different problems such as the structural integrity to support the weight of a dirigible, the wind conditions at that height, and the safety of passengers during take - off and landing. In the end, these problems made it difficult to realize the idea of using the top of the Empire State Building for dirigible operations.
165	14998	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building's mast were confronted with many obstacles to overcome. Firstly, the builders had to compensate for the stress a docked airship would place on the building. According to @CAPS1, ""the stress... would be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" As a result, the building's steel frame would need to be carefully and precisely modified to accommodate the load. Another obstacle faced by the builders were the weather conditions at that height: ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Any airship attempting to dock there would be violently buffeted around by the wind, making docking extremely difficult and dangerous. Finally, there was the obstacle of safety. As @CAPS1 states, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is extremely flammable."" The very real possibility of a Hindenburg - type accident over a densely populated area gave pause to the builders. In conclusion, the builders had to face several huge and complex obstacles, which combined eventually doomed the project of making the mast a successful docking point for airships."
166	14999	6	3	In order for the Empire State Building to dock dirigibles (blimps), many significant obstacles had to be overcome by the architects. One of those major obstacles was the Empire State Building's frame. If a thousand - foot dirigible was moored on top of the building with just a single cable tether, it would add tremendous stress to the foundation of the building due to the dirigible's heavy load and strong wind pressure. This stress could potentially compromise the structural integrity of the entire building. Another obstacle that the architects faced was safety. Because dirigibles in the @LOCATION2 used hydrogen, a highly flammable gas, instead of helium, there was a high risk of the dirigible exploding, and threatening the dense population of downtown New York City. A single spark could lead to a catastrophic event. Possibly the greatest obstacle that the architects had to face was high winds. On top of the Empire State Building, the winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if lead weights could be used to weigh down and control the docked dirigible, they would still be unsafely dangling about the pedestrians of the streets below. Those are some of the challenging obstacles that the architects of the Empire State Building faced in an attempt to dock dirigibles.
167	15000	6	3	"In the passage, ""The Mooring Mast,"" by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1, a myriad of complex obstacles had faced the builders of the Empire State Building in terms of allowing dirigibles to dock there. First was the problem of constructing a mooring mast on top of the building's flat roof. Because, ""a thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame,"" the building would be unable to support the stress of both the heavy dirigible and strong wind pressure. This stress could cause long - term damage to the building's structure. Next, safety became a crucial issue. After the discovery that, ""most dirigible's built outside the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"", owners of the Empire State Building realized the great hazard involved when having a highly flammable object fly over a densely populated area. This was brought to their attention when a German dirigible was destroyed by a fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey. An additional problem was nature itself. The winds on top of the building posed the problem of having the dirigibles back end swivel around the mooring mast, seeing as weights could not be used to weight the back down since they would be dangling above pedestrians on the street. Lastly, there was, ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" @CAPS2, it would be illegal for a Ship to be tied up to the building or approach the area. In light of the aforementioned reasons, it is evident that the builders of the Empire State Building faced many difficult obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there."
168	15001	6	3	"Ambitious for its time, the idea of allowing dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building was doomed from the start. The engineers and builders of the mooring mast were faced with many significant obstacles that could potentially inhibit safe docking at the top of the building. The first major obstacle was finding a way to tether the dirigible to the dock. As described in paragraph @NUM1, ""A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held on by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" Modifications would have to be made to the entire building, which would be a costly and time - consuming process. Another obstacle the engineers were faced with was stabilizing the dirigible once it was tethered to the building. As described in paragraph @NUM2, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This would make it nearly impossible for passengers and crew to get on or off the dirigible safely. These challenging obstacles baffled engineers and builders of the Empire State Building until the project was abandoned entirely."
169	15002	6	3	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigible to dock there were many and at the end the dock could not happen. One of the major obstacles was that the building's foundation had to be modified. In the story it says, ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" This meant that extensive and complex engineering work would be required. Being so high, the dock would be moved around because of the strong winds. Also, the blimp itself could not even attach itself to the dock because the winds wouldn't let it. The wind force would make it extremely difficult for the dirigible to approach and connect to the dock. In the end, the dock wasn't meant to happen as it came with a lot of problems for the builders and even the architects."
170	15003	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted there are many obstacles that the builders stumble across. Many people would have a hard time with creating the docks for the dirigibles for the Empire State Building. One major obstacle that the builders had was ""The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area."" This lack of a proper landing area made it difficult to safely dock the dirigibles. Another obstacle that they could come across is that the dirigibles could take too long to fuel up and could cause a jam with other dirigibles. A long fueling time would disrupt the flow of air traffic. Even though they had this huge obstacle they managed to get their way and they found a way to actually use the dirigibles without any types of problems."
171	15004	6	3	"From the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1, she describes the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Three of the main obstacles they faced were that there was a lack of a suitable landing area. The rooftops were not designed to accommodate the large dirigibles, which are enormous steel - framed balloons with envelopes of cotton fabric. They are also filled with hydrogen and helium to make them lighter and float more easily. Due to their large size, some over one thousand feet long, there was really no proper place for them to land. ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof, as it would add too much stress to the building's frame"" (paragraph @NUM1). Another obstacle being faced was that they would have to spend over sixty thousand dollars on reconstructing the building's framework just so the building could support the dirigible. The third obstacle faced was there was a law against it. The law claimed that there would be no airships flying too low over urban areas. So even if they did build a landing area and spend the sixty thousand dollars on the building's framework, they wouldn't be able to use them because of the law. Even though the idea of having a dirigible dock on the Empire State Building was interesting, the obstacles to face were too great for the builders, with the lack of a suitable landing area, the need for framework reconstruction, and the law against aircraft flying too low. In the end, the plan to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building had to be abandoned."
172	15005	6	3	There were significant obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. A practical reason why was a law against airships flying too close over urban areas like New York. This law was in place to ensure the safety and order of the city. It would make it completely illegal for a dirigible to even approach the building. The greater reason was the issue of safety. If a ship came in to dock using hydrogen (a highly flammable gas), an explosion was a very real possibility, which would harm everyone below. The greatest obstacle were the shifting winds from air currents. These winds were unpredictable and strong. Even if the ship was tethered down, it would swivel around the tower, getting tangled in the process. In conclusion, the idea had to be dropped, though some ships have tried to dock there unsuccessfully, and it's clear that the combination of legal, safety, and environmental factors made the plan unfeasible.
173	15006	6	3	"I've been to the Empire state building before, right up to the top. The top - floor was not opened, but several windows were, and the thing that still stays with me is how amazingly windy it is up there. The wind gusts were strong and constant. Trying to park a blimp on top of the building would be like trying to park a car in a flood, simply impossible. I was waiting for that factor to come up the whole story, and it finally did. ""The winds on top of the building are constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). In addition to the difficulty of parking the blimp, the passengers would have to get off on a swaying gang - plank, which would not be a pleasant experience at all. Another problem they faced was the law. There was ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" (@CAPS1 @NUM2). I would think that before spending @MONEY1 on an already unrealistic project, they would at least have made sure they were cleared law - wise. When I read this essay, it seems the project was doomed from the start, and it's evident that the combination of the harsh wind conditions and legal restrictions made the plan unworkable."
174	15007	6	3	In the excerpt, The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was the lack of a suitable landing area. The building's rooftop was not configured to handle the large dirigibles. So Al Smith thought putting a mooring mast at the top of the building would allow dirigibles to dock there for several hours. This would allow the dirigibles to refuel or get serviced and let passengers on and off. Another obstacle would be how the dirigible would be moored. It would be held by a single cable tether, which would add significant stress to the frame of the building. The stress of the load and wind pressure would have to be transferred all the way to the foundation of the building, which was about eleven hundred feet below. This transfer of stress could potentially damage the building's structure. Third obstacle would be using hydrogen or helium. If they used hydrogen, it is highly flammable, and the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire, which serves as a tragic example of the dangers. Those are some of the obstacles the builders had to face in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, and it's clear that these challenges made the plan very difficult to execute.
175	15008	6	3	"In ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, she talks about The Mooring Mast, also known as the Empire State Building, and how it was built and the original purposes of the building. During the making of the Empire State Building, builders faced issues in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there such as architectural problems, different gases, and the law. The builders faced a problem with the architecture of the building. The rooftop was flat, as it says ""the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" This meant that the heavy dirigible would add excessive stress to the building's frame, potentially compromising its structural integrity. Another issue they faced was the gas some dirigibles used. @CAPS1 dirigibles were filled with different gases, and ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This meant that the building could catch on fire, and the fire could spread throughout downtown New York. They also faced an issue with the law saying ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"". It explains it would be illegal to tie a dirigible on the building. In conclusion, these multiple obstacles made it nearly impossible for the builders to achieve the goal of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building."
176	15009	6	3	"The excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted elaborately explains the construction of the iconic Empire State Building in New York. It details the step - by - step process of building the skyscraper as well as the numerous obstacles and challenges that the determined builders faced. The ambitious architects of the Empire State Building had a grand vision of allowing dirigibles to dock there. However, they were overly enthusiastic and did not thoroughly take into account the myriad of problems that could come with such a large - scale and complex project. The mastermind behind the plan to build a docking mast on the Empire State Building was Al Smith. Al Smith was so brimming with excitement to build the mast that he completely overlooked the complications associated with his so - called ""master"" plan. Due to the significant stress of the dirigible's load and the powerful wind pressure, it became necessary for the building's sturdy frame to be further strengthened, which ended up costing over sixty thousand dollars. The most critical obstacle for the builders was a matter of safety. Most dirigibles at that time used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen was well - known to be extremely flammable. If a disastrous accident like a fire were to occur over a densely populated area such as downtown New York, the consequences would be catastrophic. Another major obstacle was nature. The winds on top of the towering building were constantly shifting erratically due to the violent air currents. Moreover, there was an existing strict law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This excerpt clearly shows that before embarking on a large and challenging endeavor, one should carefully look ahead and take into full account the potential obstacles that may lie in the way."
177	15010	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the magnificent Empire State Building faced in their ambitious attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there were numerous and formidable. One of the most concerning issues was the high risk of accidents occurring over densely populated areas. In the event of a mishap, such as a fire or a crash, a large number of innocent people in the bustling city below could be severely injured or even lose their lives. Another significant challenge was the presence of violent air currents that were constantly shifting. These unpredictable air movements made it extremely difficult, if not impossible, to safely dock a dirigible on the proposed mast. The constant change in wind direction and strength would cause the dirigible to sway and move uncontrollably, posing a great threat to both the vessel and the building. These obstacles ultimately made it clear that the plan to dock dirigibles at the Empire State Building was fraught with difficulties and was not a feasible idea.
178	15011	6	3	"The idea to put a mast on top of the majestic Empire State Building initially seemed like a brilliant and revolutionary concept. People were captivated by the thought of docking a dirigible on the mast, especially because, as the saying went, ""New York City was in the lack of suitable landing areas."" However, it is easy to quickly realize how the mooring mast would never be able to effectively dock dirigibles. One glaring reason this could never come to fruition is that the fuel tanks of these dirigibles contained hydrogen in them, which is highly flammable. ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was tragically destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey... the Empire State Building authorities realized how much worse that accident could have been."" Countless people would perish if such a disaster happened over a highly populated area like New York City. Another significant reason that the mast would never be able to be used is that there was, ""an existing law against airships flying too low or over urban areas."" Even if everything was meticulously set up correctly, they would be blatantly breaking the law by flying their dirigibles too close to the city. But the most obvious and insurmountable reason is that the weather would be far too unpredictable above the Empire State Building. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The mooring mast would simply be an utterly unstable place to dock these large and delicate dirigibles, making the whole idea unworkable."
179	15012	6	3	"In their bold attempt to allow dirigibles to dock on the illustrious Empire State Building, the architects encountered a multitude of complex problems. One of the primary issues was related to the building's frame. The existing frame of the building was not designed to support the additional weight and stress of a docking mast and a docked dirigible. As a result, it needed to be carefully modified and significantly strengthened to accommodate the new and ambitious addition. Another huge and insurmountable obstacle was safety. In paragraph @NUM1, the author clearly states, ""hydrogen is highly flammable."" If a dirigible were to suddenly go up in flames, not only would the unsuspecting passengers on board be in immediate and grave danger, but also everybody on the crowded streets below the towering building would be at risk. The winds at such a high altitude also posed a significant threat. Paragraph @NUM2 explains that the violent air currents would cause the back of the ship to swivel wildly all over the place, making it extremely difficult for passengers to safely unload. These were just some of the many daunting problems that the dedicated builders faced while attempting to make the dream of dirigible docking at the Empire State Building a reality."
180	15013	6	3	In the excerpt, the eager builders had a grand aspiration of having dirigibles dock at the top of the world - famous Empire State Building. However, they soon discovered that this was an unachievable goal. The powerful winds at the top of the building would mercilessly push the dirigibles in all different directions. These winds were not only strong but also highly unpredictable, constantly changing their direction and intensity. This made it nearly impossible to safely maneuver and dock a large and cumbersome dirigible. And also, there was a strict law in place that stipulated that air crafts had to maintain a certain height in the air. This law was put in place to ensure the safety of the people living in the urban area below. Even if the builders managed to somehow overcome the wind problem, they would still be in violation of the law if they tried to dock dirigibles at the top of the Empire State Building. In the end, it became clear that the combination of the unruly winds and the strict law made it completely unfeasible for dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building.
181	15014	6	3	When the Empire State Building was initially conceived, it was meticulously planned to stand as the world's tallest building, surpassing even the new Chrysler Building that was actively under construction at the intersection of Forty - second Street and Lexington Avenue in New York. The top of the Empire State Building was intended to be more than just ornamental, not merely a spire, dome, or pyramid. This was the age of dirigibles. In the United States, the navy took the lead in the research and development of dirigibles. Due to this, the architects couldn't simply place a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. Once the architects had carefully designed the mooring mast and made necessary changes to the existing plans for the building's skeleton, they were ready to move forward with this unique addition.
182	15015	6	3	The significant obstacles the builders faced were that they couldn't just casually drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. The stress caused by the dirigible's load and the powerful wind pressure would have to be effectively transmitted all the way to the building's foundation. The steel frame of the Empire State Building would need to be carefully modified and significantly strengthened to adapt to this new and challenging situation. The most crucial reason was safety: most dirigibles from outside the United States used highly flammable hydrogen rather than helium. The winds on top of the building were constantly changing direction due to violent air currents. As a result, the back of the ship would spin around and around the mooring mast. Additionally, there were existing laws that strictly prohibited airships from flying too low. Considering all these factors, the builders had a complex task ahead to ensure the viability of the mooring mast.
183	15016	6	3	Some of the notable obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building encountered were the strong and unpredictable winds in the high altitudes. These winds could pose a serious threat to the docking of dirigibles. Moreover, there were laws in place that didn't allow airships to be in such close proximity to an urban area, which added a legal constraint to the project. The safety of the passengers on board the dirigibles was of utmost importance, as any mishap could lead to serious injuries or even fatalities. Also, the safety of the pedestrians below the building had to be considered, as a falling dirigible or any related accident could endanger their lives. Given these multiple challenges, the builders had to find innovative solutions to overcome them.
184	15017	6	3	The building was impressively big, with its towering height and large footprint dominating the skyline. It was also truly beautiful, featuring elegant architectural details and a harmonious design. The combination of its grand scale and aesthetic appeal made it a remarkable landmark. Its size not only provided ample space for various activities but also made it a symbol of human achievement. The beauty of the building, with its well - proportioned facades and decorative elements, attracted people from far and wide. In conclusion, the building's bigness and beauty made it a standout structure in the city.
185	15018	6	3	It was both unrealistic and extremely unsafe for engineers to assume that they could have dirigibles dock on the building. One major issue with this idea was that the dirigible would exert significant stress on the building's frame. The weight of the dirigible, combined with the strong wind pressure, would undoubtedly cause problems for the building's foundation. Another critical aspect was that dirigibles were filled with highly flammable hydrogen. If one of them were to explode, it would result in a catastrophic disaster for downtown New York, endangering countless lives and causing extensive damage to the surrounding area. Given these numerous and serious drawbacks, it is clear that the idea is neither practical nor safe, and thus should not be pursued.
186	15019	6	3	"Based on excerpt, ""The Mooring @CAPS1,"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced certain formidable obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, such as the violent air currents, and the safety of pedestrians. One significant obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building faced was the violent air currents. According to the excerpt, the winds on the top of the building were constantly and unpredictably shifting. So if a dirigible happened to get caught in this turbulent situation, they would be dangling precariously high above pedestrians. An example of this would be, ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring @CAPS1, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" (@NUM1) Another crucial obstacle was the safety of pedestrians. When owners heard about the German dirigible, Hindenburg, was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, they decided that it would be even worse if it had taken place in a heavily populated place like New York. An example of this would be, ""owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" In conclusion, the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"", written by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, clearly shows that the builders of the Empire State Building faced certain insurmountable obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, such as the violent air currents and the safety concerns for city pedestrians."
187	15020	6	3	The Empire State building, being an extremely tall and prominent structure, faced many significant obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. This building being so tall, and large and sudden wind shifts were a constant worry. Wind shifts, which is when the direction of the wind shifts suddenly, can be quite unpredictable. One minute it's @LOCATION1, the next it's @LOCATION2. On May 6, 1937, when the German dirigible Hindenburg caught on fire, people couldn't help but think, what would have happened if that was over the Empire State Building. Over New York, with such a large and concentrated population, it would have been an absolute chaos. Moreover, airships weren't allowed to fly that low anyways, which further complicated the situation. In the end, these multiple obstacles made it nearly impossible for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
188	15021	6	3	"The task of trying to allow dirigibles to dock 1,250 ft. above ground over the bustling city of New York, not shockingly, posted a few substantial obstacles for the builders of the Empire State Building. Before the dirigibles could even try to dock on the mast, the builders had to make extensive modifications to the whole building due to the significant stress and pressure on the building from the dirigibles. The modifications cost over sixty thousand dollars to strengthen the building. Once the builders finally had all the modifications and building work done, they were faced with a whole new set of challenging obstacles. Most of the dirigibles from out of the United States were filled with highly flammable hydrogen. ""The German dirigible @CAPS1 was destroyed by fire in @LOCATION3, New Jersey"". This tragic accident worried @CAPS2 greatly. Also, they faced persistent problems with the shifting winds and air currents that made it extremely difficult to dock the dirigibles. Another obstacle was the fact that strict laws existed against airships flying too low to the ground. Due to these unforeseen and difficult - to - overcome obstacles, the idea of docking on top of the building gradually disappeared as it became unfeasible."
189	15022	6	3	Based on the information given in the excerpt, there are multiple insurmountable obstacles that couldn't have been overcome by the builders of the Empire State Building. Between the strong winds, problems with anchoring, high risk of fire and sharp spires on nearby buildings, there were also complex legal issues that would first have to be bested. One thing the builders of the Empire State Building hadn't fully considered was the powerful wind current. Because the dirigibles were primarily huge propelled balloons, the wind could easily push them around. And at 1,250 Feet, there isn't very much around to slow or block the wind, making it a very dangerous situation. They also didn't think about the fact that hydrogen, a key gas involved with lifting dirigibles, was very flammable. If one was to ascend in @CAPS2, dozens or maybe even hundreds of people below would be in great danger. More problems the architects faced were the sharp spires atop many of the buildings around. If a pilot were to lose control of the blimp, then it would cause @MONEY1 of damage to the city. Lastly, a new law was undergoing a legislation process. It strictly prohibited the flying of any air travel below a certain height in residential areas, adding another layer of difficulty to the plan. In conclusion, these numerous obstacles made it impossible for the builders to achieve the goal of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
190	15023	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many daunting obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock atop it. One major and obvious obstacle was safety. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the [@LOCATION2] used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"". The owners quickly realized how extremely dangerous an accident would be ""above a densely populated area such as downtown New York"", where a large number of people would be at risk. The second major obstacle was nature. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". A thousand - foot dirigible moored atop the building would add an enormous amount of stress to the frame of the building, potentially causing structural damage. In the end, these two major and seemingly insurmountable obstacles would be too great. Times were changing, and with the airplane taking over modern travel, the dirigible and the mooring mast were ultimately doomed as a practical option for the Empire State Building."
191	15024	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous challenges when attempting to enable dirigibles to dock on the mooring mast of the building. They initially had to modify the building's top to serve as a mooring mast, and the steel frame of the structure had to be adjusted to support the weight and forces exerted by the dirigible. Additionally, they needed to create a docking and ticketing area, which incurred significant costs. There was also the risk that the dirigible might hit something or catch fire due to its hydrogen gas. Nature presented the most significant hurdle as the winds near the building were extremely violent. Moreover, there was a law stipulating that dirigibles or airships could not fly too low over urban areas. If the dirigible's shell were to break, it could cause harm to many people. Given these multiple and substantial challenges, the plan to have dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building ultimately faced insurmountable obstacles.
192	15025	6	3	When building a structure as large as the Empire State Building and aiming to have it accommodate a dirigible docking at its top, it is inevitable that there will be numerous challenges. For a dirigible to dock safely, the stress from the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would need to be effectively transmitted all the way down to the building's foundation. This means that the building would have to be thoroughly reinforced and its structural design optimized. All these problems must be carefully taken into consideration during the planning and construction process. Implementing the necessary modifications and improvements would require a significant amount of additional resources, which translates to spending more money. Due to these constraints, achieving the goal of dirigible docking at the Empire State Building became a highly challenging endeavor.
193	15026	6	3	When the builders of the Empire State Building were trying to make it possible for dirigibles to dock there, they had noble intentions but encountered several obstacles. This task was far from easy and not as straightforward as it might seem at first glance. If the builders were to add a thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by just a single cable tether, it would place a substantial amount of stress on the building's frame. All this stress would then be transferred all the way to the building's foundation. As a result, they would have to modify and strengthen the steel used in the building's construction. This modification work would cost over @MONEY1, which is a considerable sum. The most significant obstacle was nature itself. The wind at the top of the building was constantly changing direction, which made the docking process extremely unsafe. There was also a law that prohibited airships from flying too low, which hindered their ability to dock. Additionally, since many dirigibles from other countries used hydrogen instead of helium, there was a high risk of fire. The primary concern for the builders was safety. With so many potential unsafe outcomes, it was simply too risky to proceed with the construction for dirigible docking. In the end, the plan had to be abandoned.
194	15027	6	3	One of the significant obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced was that constructing the mooring mast, due to its height, would add extra stress to the building. The architects, however, were quite resourceful. They managed to design a special type of stainless steel that would not only be illuminated from the inside, creating an aesthetically pleasing effect, but also provide the necessary support to withstand the added stress. Another major issue was that dirigibles typically used hydrogen instead of helium. Having an airship filled with such a flammable gas in close proximity to a populated area like New York was deemed highly unreasonable. As a result, a law was passed that prohibited the transportation of dirigibles close to the public. Nature also posed a significant challenge to the architects. High - speed winds at the top of the building would attempt to forcefully pull the dirigibles from the sky, even when they were weighed down with lead weights, creating a serious safety hazard. In the end, due to these multiple and complex issues, the mooring mast on the Empire State Building was never put to use.
195	15028	6	3	There were numerous obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building encountered when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. They were well aware that the mooring mast design was far from perfect. There were several reasons for this, but the most crucial one, according to them, was safety. The hydrogen used in dirigibles is highly flammable. After the tragic accident in New Jersey in 1937, where a dirigible caught fire, they realized just how much more dangerous it would be if a similar incident were to occur right in the heart of New York. The potential for widespread destruction and loss of life was simply too great. As a result, they decided to abandon the idea. Instead, they shifted the focus of transportation to airplanes, which were considered a safer alternative. In this way, the plan to have dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building was shelved due to safety concerns.
196	15029	6	3	"There were several obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One major problem was the stress added to the building's frame when the dirigible was moored at the top of the building. The weight of the dirigible, along with the force exerted during docking maneuvers, put a significant strain on the structure. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" This meant that they would have to carefully rearrange the frame to make it work. However, such modifications were complex and costly. Consequently, the workers were never able to accomplish the goal. Safety was a major factor in the failure to dock dirigibles at the Empire State Building. Dirigibles were highly flammable which could have caused a serious accident to occur. A single spark could have led to a catastrophic explosion, endangering the building and the people nearby. However, the ""greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" Since there were heavy air currents above the building, it would cause the dirigible to ""swivel around"" when attached to the mooring mast. This made docking extremely difficult and dangerous. There was also an existing law that prohibited planes to fly low over city areas, which made it impossible for dirigibles to reach the building. As a result of all these obstacles, the main goal to dock dirigibles was not achieved."
197	15030	6	3	"Obstacles that the builders had faced involved safety for those below the dirigible and those on it. One problem they faced was that if something happened to the dirigible, similar to the tragic incident of the Hindenburg, then the pedestrians below could get hurt if the zeppelin came crashing down. The large size and weight of the dirigible meant that a crash could cause extensive damage and endanger the lives of people on the streets. It was also a problem with passengers because in a city environment, they could easily crash. The presence of buildings and other structures increased the risk of collisions. It tells how when the ""Los Angeles"" tried to get close enough to dock, it couldn't because the strong winds so high up could have knocked it into a different building. The unpredictable nature of the winds made it difficult to control the dirigible's movement. Other obstacles builders faced were nature and the law. When high up, wind currents can be very strong and constantly changing. It talked of how if the dirigible were tethered, the wind would cause the back of the ship to keep swiveling around the mooring mast. This made docking unstable and dangerous. The final obstacle builders would have to overcome was the law. There were already laws in place preventing dirigibles to fly low in urban areas. If ships had tethered to the building, then they would have been doing so illegally. Due to these insurmountable obstacles, the plan to dock dirigibles at the building could not be realized."
198	15031	6	3	"There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The higher calling for which the mooring mast was built was to put New York on the forefront of modern travel; the builders then, needed to solve some obstacles that were on their way. First was that the building itself needed to get stronger in order to support ""a thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building"". The additional weight and forces exerted by the dirigible required a significant upgrade to the building's structure. As a result, the frame of the Empire State Building needed to be carefully modified and strengthened to accommodate the problem. According to the excerpt, a substantial amount of @MONEY1 worth of changes had to be made to the building's framework. These changes involved reinforcing key structural elements and redistributing the load. Another problem was that of the stress of the wind pressure. The wind pressure acting on the dirigible and the building during docking and while it was moored would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation. This was also solved, at least they thought, by making a few changes to the skeleton of the building. These changes aimed to improve the building's ability to withstand the wind - induced forces. Lastly, was that the building needed a space to provide for passengers that were to come from the ""blimps"". To solve the problem, they built a shaft to bring passengers down to the @NUM1 floor, where baggage and ticket areas would be located. This shaft needed to be designed to ensure the safe and efficient movement of passengers. The builders had to face many problems even before attempting to build a mast for dirigibles to dock at, and these challenges ultimately made the realization of the docking plan very difficult."
199	15032	6	3	"Various obstacles came up in this excerpt. This building of the mooring mast simply went from a dream to more of a way to win a record for the world's tallest building. The greatest obstacle they faced was the issue of safety. In paragraph @NUM1 it reads ""Most dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" As a result, an obstacle faced was the danger of the dirigible being destroyed by fire while trying to dock on the Empire State Building which would cause a large amount of destruction in New York. A fire on a dirigible could spread rapidly and cause damage to the building and the surrounding area. The builders, also faced the problem of nature itself. The violent air currents at these heights would cause the dirigible to swerve around the mooring mast. These air currents were unpredictable and made docking extremely challenging. The builders also faced a legal issue stating in paragraph @NUM2 ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"". Therefore, the dirigibles were never going to be allowed to fly so close to the Empire State Building anyway. These were the insurmountable obstacles faced by the builders, which ultimately led to the failure of the plan to use the mooring mast for dirigible docking."
200	15033	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. In paragraph nine it states ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" This obstacle was massive because in order to accommodate the new station, over sixty thousand dollars worth of work would have to be made to the building. This included structural modifications to ensure the building could support the weight and stress of the dirigible. Another reason as stated in paragraph @NUM1 ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This shows this was another major obstacle for the builders. The law was in place to protect the safety of people on the ground. Another obstacle for the builders is nature as stated in paragraph @NUM2 ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This could be very dangerous. If the back of the ship was dangling over the streets surrounding the Empire State Building, there could be many safety hazards. The shifting winds made it difficult to control the dirigible during docking and could cause it to collide with the building or other objects. These obstacles were the main challenges the builders had to face if the Empire State Building would be a landing dock, and unfortunately, they were too difficult to overcome."
201	15034	6	3	"Based on the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast,"" by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1, the builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous and significant obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there, such as safety, nature, and legislation. First and foremost, it would be extremely difficult to safely allow foreign dirigibles to dock. In paragraph @NUM1, it clearly states, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This clearly displays that the risk of fire, and therefore safety, was a major obstacle. Next, air currents presented a great challenge as they made it difficult for dirigibles to dock safely. The air near the top of the building was strongly affected by air currents, causing the conditions to be quite unstable, so it was really difficult for pilots to land accurately. Also, ""using [lead weights] at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe."" There was simply no way to work with or combat the uncertainty of the wind, so nature was an undeniable obstacle. Finally, there were strict laws about aircrafts flying too close to the city. In paragraph @NUM2, it says, ""[There] was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building."" The very purpose of the moor would be against the law, so it would be nearly impossible for a dirigible to ever tie up to the Empire State Building. Due to these multiple and insurmountable challenges, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many difficulties regarding the moor, and its opening was never successful as a result of them."
202	15035	6	3	"In the short excerpt, The Mooring Mast By Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced a variety of obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. One significant obstacle they faced was the limited space. As an example, it is stated that ""The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area."" @CAPS1 indicates that it was going to be quite hard finding a proper place for the dirigibles to land. Although that may have been one of their problems, it was not the only one; safety was also a major concern. The excerpt mentions that ""the mooring mast added to the top of the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service and to let passengers off and on."" This meant that it would have taken a long time just for the landing and fueling processes, which increased the risk and complexity. Another obstacle was the need for the dirigibles to be thoroughly tested during the testing of the mast. Considering all these challenges, it became clear that the plan to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building faced many hurdles that were difficult to overcome."
203	15036	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced a few significant obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The biggest and most pressing obstacle was finding a truly safe way to do it. New York City is a very densely populated area, and any type of accident would have extremely horrific consequences, as the owners realized in @CAPS2 @NUM1. ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as @CAPS1."" This incident served as a stark reminder of the potential dangers. Another obstacle was nature itself. The wind at the top of the building was too strong and unpredictable. As it says in @CAPS2 @NUM2, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast."" This made it very difficult to ensure a stable docking. Clearly, safety was the biggest concern for the builders, and these obstacles made it extremely challenging to achieve the goal of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building."
204	15037	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced included a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made it completely illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building, as there was a legitimate fear that the wind would blow the dirigible onto the sharp spires of other buildings in that area. Such an incident would cause significant harm to the dirigible's shell. Then, another dirigible attempted a publicity stunt where it would tie up and deliver a bundle of newspapers to the Empire State Building. However, the yet - unsolved problems of mooring airships to a fixed mast at such a great height made the whole idea unfeasible. The highest open observatory dock, which was originally intended for disembarking passengers, has never been open to the public because of these insurmountable challenges. In conclusion, the combination of legal restrictions and technical difficulties prevented the successful implementation of the plan to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
205	15038	6	3	"The builder's main problem revolved around safety. Most blimps that aren't made in @LOCATION1 are filled with hydrogen, which is highly flammable. If a disaster like the Hindenburg accident happened while the blimp was moving towards the tethers at the Empire State Building, the outcome would have been far more disastrous considering the densely populated area below. Another significant obstacle is the strong winds. According to the excerpt, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents... the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" This made it extremely difficult to control the blimp during docking. One final and crucial obstacle was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building."" The builders faced many complex and challenging obstacles when attempting to allow blimps to dock at the Empire State Building, and these obstacles ultimately made it very difficult, if not impossible, to achieve this goal."
206	15039	6	3	"There were numerous obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. For example, the excerpt states, ""A mooring mast added to the top of the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers off and on."" This clearly shows that the builders had to construct a sturdy mooring mast to provide sufficient time for refueling or servicing and to ensure that people could get off and on the dirigible safely. Another example from the excerpt is when it mentions, ""The body of the dirigible could swing in the breeze, and yet passengers could safely get on and off the dirigible by walking down a gangplank to an open observation platform."" This indicates that the builders built a well - designed gangplank so that people could walk up or down it safely from the dirigible. In conclusion, these examples highlight the complex challenges the builders had to overcome to make dirigible docking a possibility at the Empire State Building."
207	15040	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building were faced with many different and significant obstacles. One major concern was the building itself. It is one of the tallest buildings in the world, so even a single construction plan that went wrong could be tragic for all the people below on the busy streets. When they started the construction on the mooring mast, they were aware that there was some risk, but they perhaps didn't think it through thoroughly. All this was introduced because Al Smith, with great ambition, wanted the Empire State Building to be the biggest and most remarkable. However, he didn't carefully consider that if a blimp was to dock on the mooring mast, they would have to worry about various factors such as the unpredictable weather, strong winds, and also the strength of the building's foundation. Also, they would have to be extremely cautious about the blimp itself. Back then, dirigibles were filled with highly flammable hydrogen, and if something was to go wrong and the blimp over downtown New York was to catch a spark, it could burn four city blocks, endangering countless lives. In conclusion, these unforeseen and complex issues made the plan of blimp docking at the Empire State Building extremely risky.
208	15041	6	3	The builders of the Empire State building faced many serious problems when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Some of the problems stem from the fact that some blimps are filled with hydrogen, which is highly flammable. If a blimp with hydrogen in it were to explode over New York City, that would have extremely dire consequences for the people in the city. Those innocent people could lose their lives. Also, when one blimp exploded in New Jersey, it was found that the blimp had hydrogen in it. So, after that incident, they thought a great deal about the docking station and decided to only allow blimps with helium, a much safer gas, in them to dock there. In conclusion, the flammability of hydrogen in blimps was a major deterrent to the docking plan, and the decision to restrict to helium - filled blimps was a necessary safety measure.
209	15042	6	3	The idea of allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building was fraught with problems ranging from natural preventions to pre - existing laws. During the era of frequent dirigible travel around the world, a well - known German dirigible called the Hindenburg was destroyed in New Jersey due to a serious complication with fire. This catastrophic event revealed to the workers a problem they had previously overlooked. Most foreign dirigibles were inflated with highly flammable hydrogen gas. The mere thought of a problem like the Hindenburg disaster occurring over one of the most densely populated cities in the world immediately ruled out the idea. The workers of this project also failed to take into account the laws against airships flying too low over urban areas. Although the Empire State Building was anticipated to be the tallest building in the world, the soon - to - be - created mast would still be too close to the millions of people in the city. After test runs were conducted to try out the new mooring system, it became evident that dirigibles were not even able to get close enough to the mast due to the strong and unpredictable winds. The idea that these same winds would blow the dirigible into another building's spire put great fear into the minds of the people. The combination of this wide variety of problems ultimately put an end to the idea of using a mooring mast atop the Empire State Building. In conclusion, these multiple and insurmountable issues made the dirigible docking plan unfeasible.
210	15043	6	3	"Al Smith and the builders of the Empire State Building faced several significant obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first and crucial obstacle was designing and installing strengthening beams to the frame and foundation to support the extra stress caused by the dirigible's heavy load and the strong wind pressure. The second major problem was that the gases used in some dirigibles were extremely unsafe. As stated, ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (L¸sted, @NUM1). Due to the inefficiency of these gases, the violent air currents would either cause the dirigible to spin out of control, or they would have to add lead weights which would, as described, ""... be dangling high above pedestrians"" (L¸sted, @NUM2). Among all of these problems, there was also an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, as mentioned: ""... was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (L¸sted, @NUM3). Therefore, not only was it unsafe or impractical to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, but it was also clearly illegal. In conclusion, these multiple obstacles made the plan of dirigible docking at the building impossible to execute."
211	15044	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many arduous obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first significant problem that the hard - working workers faced was that a ""thousand - foot dirigible... would add substantial stress to the building's frame"" (@NUM1). This meant that the already - constructed frame would have to be carefully strengthened to bear the extra load. Another major obstacle they came across was that there was a ""law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (@NUM2). Therefore, it would be blatantly illegal to dock a ship on the building, because the airship would be positioned too low down. Finally, the most difficult and persistent obstacle they encountered was that ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (@NUM3). This made the docking operation unsafe and unpractical because the dirigibles would be hovering above the bustling pedestrians on the street. Due to all of the complications and challenges that faced the workers who were trying to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, the project was ultimately never completed."
212	15045	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1, the determined builders of the Empire State Building faced several formidable obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of these prominent obstacles was that it was extremely unsafe. It was unsafe because the dirigibles typically used more hydrogen than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable, posing a great risk of explosion. In the excerpt, it clearly states that the greatest obstacle was nature itself. This is because the winds at the top of the towering building were constantly shifting, and as a result, the back of the airship would swivel around uncontrollably. Another significant obstacle was an existing law strictly against airships flying too low over the urban areas. These are the various obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building had to face, which ultimately hindered the project's success."
213	15046	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building were confronted with numerous daunting problems when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. One main and insurmountable reason was that it was blatantly illegal for dirigibles to dock. As stated, ""Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"", @CAPS1 @NUM1. Also, mother nature posed a major challenge and prevented dirigibles' ability to dock there. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"", @CAPS1 @NUM2. However, despite these difficulties, some dirigibles still attempted to dock. In 1930, the U.S. Navy's Los Angeles airship tried to dock, but due to the severe, gusty winds, it could not. New York was a very densely populated area, and having explosive hydrogen floating low over the busy city could cause a huge and catastrophic threat. ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey."" This tragic incident clearly showed the builders and owners of the Empire State Building that it was extremely dangerous for dirigibles trying to dock there. A main set of complex problems the builders faced was making the building itself strong enough to allow dirigibles to dock. The builders had to painstakingly modify the frame of the Empire State Building and design a specialized, custom mooring device. In conclusion, the builders were faced with a multitude of legal and safety problems when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, which led to the failure of the docking project."
214	15047	6	3	"The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted explains the elaborate plans for adding a mast to the top of the Empire State Building that would have been capable of securely anchoring blimps to the top of it. This innovative idea was very complex; however, the forward - thinking architects of the time (@DATE1's) believed that it was quite feasible. What they didn't seem to fully realize was just how many unforeseen problems and obstacles there were to get in the way of the mast's success. One minor yet significant setback was that the mast (and the blimp attached to it) would add great amounts of stress to the frame of the building. This problem was carefully taken care of with relatively little stress by simply modifying and strengthening the building's foundation and frame. The largest and most persistent obstacle standing in the way of the mast's success was the heavy winds at the top of the building, which were ""constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". However, the absolute greatest and most critical issue that was faced was the safety of the public. Most foreign blimps at the time were filled with highly flammable gas, which was ultimately the main reason why the mooring mast was never a success. In the end, despite the initial optimism, the project had to be abandoned due to these insurmountable challenges."
215	15048	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many tough obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Throughout the excerpt, the author states that ""dirigibles were being hailed as the transport of the future"" (paragraph @NUM1). This means that the dedicated builders had to work even harder and come up with innovative ways to get this to work. The architects and engineers actively talked with well - known experts about the specialized equipment needed to build the dirigibles. The author also mentions that they asked experienced people to test the dirigible thoroughly. They had to painstakingly work on the mooring mast in order to get the dirigible to operate properly. Getting the mooring mast to work was an extremely difficult task for the builders. In paragraph @NUM2 it says ""the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" By the 1930's, due to these overwhelming challenges, dirigibles were basically given up on as a viable option for docking at the Empire State Building."
216	15049	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there were highly challenging. They dealt with the complex frames and unique shapes of the structure, but there were also other reasons that were not so physical. One of the greatest obstacles they faced to allow dirigibles to dock on the building was nature itself. At the very top of the building, the winds were constantly and unpredictably shifting due to the violent air - flow patterns and air currents. Using the Empire State Building, where the blimps would be dangling high above the pedestrians walking on the lower level of the busy street, was simply not safe. Another particular obstacle they faced was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This strict law made it illegal to ever tie up the blimp to the Empire State building itself. Moreover, the blimps couldn't land on the flat roof of the Empire State building. In conclusion, the builders of the Empire State Building had a multitude of obstacles in front of them. Not just physical objects to make it easier for the dirigibles to land, but the forces of politics and nature as well.
217	15050	6	3	"In this excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon, there were a large number of examples of obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle that the builders faced was the significant weight and intense pressure of a Dirigible concentrated on just one tether at the very top of the Empire State building. This was a major concern because all the stress and pressure exerted on the rope would pull on the building, sending the pressure all the way down to the bottom of the building, a full one thousand feet below. Another obstacle that the workers faced was nature itself. This was a serious problem because of the high - speed winds at the building that were shifting all the time. If a Dirigible was to be tethered at the top by only one rope in the front, the back of it would be free to move wildly in the wind. This would allow the back to be blown by the wind, having the real possibility of hitting the building. In conclusion, there were many obstacles that the builders had to face to attempt this ambitious project, and these challenges were substantial enough to make the task extremely difficult."
218	15051	6	3	"In the excerpt ""THE MOORING MAST"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, there were many significant obstacles that the workers had to face to allow Dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State building. One of the many obstacles the workers faced was that they could not simply drop a mooring mast on the top of the Empire State building without careful consideration. Also, the thousand - foot dirigibles moored at the top of the Empire State building presented a problem. A single cable tether held the dirigible, and this would add a great deal of stress to the building's frame, potentially affecting its structural integrity. The biggest obstacle the workers would face was the mooring mast on top of the building, where all the winds were constantly shifting due to the violent air currents. Another obstacle was that dirigibles were typically moored in open fields and were weighted down in the back. However, when moored at the Empire State building, they were dangling high above the pedestrians walking on the busy street. In conclusion, these were the numerous and challenging obstacles the workers faced in their attempt to make the Empire State building a docking place for dirigibles."
219	15052	6	3	"In ""The Mooring Mask"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the obstacles that the builders of the Empire State building faced were nature, safety, and the law. Al Smith, the governor of New York and the person who headed the construction of the Empire State Building, was extremely determined to make it the tallest building ever. This would be impossible without a mooring mast, which would serve as a docking station for Dirigibles. In building the mooring mast, several obstacles emerged. One obstacle was nature. There were extremely violent wind speeds at the very top of the building, which would cause the dirigible to sway back and forth in an unstable manner. Lead weights were typically used to keep dirigibles from swaying, but if used here, the lead weights would be dangling @NUM1 ft above the heads of the pedestrians on the streets below. This leads to safety being another obstacle. Many dirigibles were filled with hydrogen, a gas that is highly flammable. If ignited, it could cause the possibly largest accident to occur in New York City. The final obstacle is the law. There is a well - established law that states ""airships may not fly too low over urban areas."" Which would make the mooring mast's intended purpose illegal. Today, the mooring mast is nothing more but a decorative element on the building."
220	15053	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many formidable obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its intended purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before construction ever took place. The main reason for this was safety. First, there was a real and significant chance that it could catch on fire. For example, most dirigibles are made of hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. The builders realized how much catastrophic damage it could do if it caught on fire in a densely populated area, such as downtown New York. Secondly, they had another obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast, which was nature itself. For example, the wind on top of the building was constantly and erratically shifting due to the violent air currents. Lastly, dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building because there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This strict law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach it. Instead of becoming the transportation of the future, the idea had disappeared because they faced too many obstacles that could not be overcome."
221	15054	6	3	They ran into a few problems when it came to building this. Specifically, they realized after that it wasn't that smart or that safe to have a dirigible hanging by a 102 - floor building just by one cable tether. This single - tether setup left the dirigible vulnerable to swaying and instability. Another problem they ran into was the fact that they couldn't control mother nature. If it was a really windy day out, the strong gusts would make it extremely hard to keep the dirigible steady. And if there wasn't enough support on the building frames, the extra stress from the dirigible could potentially cause the building to collapse. In conclusion, these issues made the construction and operation of the dirigible - building setup quite challenging.
222	15055	6	3	The builders of the Empire State building faced multiple potential problems in allowing dirigibles to dock there. For instance, the strong winds up above the city streets could have caused the dirigible's back end to blow sideways. This sideways movement could then lead to the dirigible puncturing on the tops of other nearby buildings. On top of that, many dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium, which made them highly flammable. A single spark could have led to a disastrous explosion. Also, the added stress of a dirigible moored on the Empire State Building could have easily cracked the building's structure or even caused its foundation to collapse. Luckily, the builders and engineers behind the mooring mast had enough sense to cease production of the mast. This was because it was merely an excuse to cover up the competitive nature of the building's designers. In conclusion, it was a wise decision to abandon the idea of dirigible docking at the Empire State Building.
223	15056	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles trying to allow dirigibles (blimps) to dock there. Lack of a suitable landing area was a tough obstacle. The small and elevated space on the building was not ideal for a safe landing. Moreover, it is against the law for airships to fly low over urban areas. Having a dirigible dangling high above people would not be safe as it could pose a risk of falling debris or sudden crashes. The way the dirigibles stay up in the air is by using hydrogen instead of helium, yet hydrogen is extremely flammable. A small fire hazard or electrical spark could lead to a massive explosion. To have a dock for the dirigibles on the Empire State Building would not be safe, and the builders would have to think of a new plan. Therefore, there would be many obstacles to overcome before making dirigible docking possible. In conclusion, the current situation made it clear that significant changes were needed to achieve this goal.
224	15057	6	3	During the [specific decade]'s, technology and engineering wasn't quite as advanced. So it's safe to say builders of the Empire State Building had some obstacles. One of them was, how were they going to dock the dirigible safely and keep it stable? They had no idea. Back then, they did not have the necessary knowledge or technology to handle the complex task of docking a dirigible at such a height. The lack of advanced equipment and understanding of aerodynamics made it a nearly insurmountable challenge. In conclusion, the limitations of the era's technology made the goal of dirigible docking at the Empire State Building very difficult to achieve.
225	15058	6	3	"There were many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. One problem that was addressed was the fact that dirigibles all over the world were mostly filled with hydrogen, which was highly flammable. This was a major concern because on May 6, 1937, a dirigible was destroyed by fire. The owners of the Empire State building realized ""how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place over a densely populated area."" (Reference details) Another potential problem were the strong wind currents on top of the building, as described in (Reference details). The concern was that these strong currents would prevent a dirigible from docking smoothly. They could also blow the dirigible into another building, which could puncture the dirigible's material and cause a horrifying accident. The final obstacle that prevented dirigibles from docking on the Empire State Building was the fact that it was against the law. The law stated that ""airships flying too low over urban areas"" was prohibited. There were many obstacles that prevented dirigibles from docking on the Empire State Building, making it an unfeasible plan. In conclusion, these various obstacles made it clear that dirigible docking at the Empire State Building was not a practical option."
226	15059	6	3	"In this @CAPS1 ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION1, the builder of the Empire State Building faced many @CAPS2 challenges during the building of the Empire State Building. The most significant @CAPS3 obstacle would be the wind. Because the building was so high, and the higher up they went, the more air and wind they encountered, which made it difficult to stop the landing or drop - off of the dirigible. A dirigible is also a type of balloon or blimp, but they are different because dirigibles can be controlled by propellers. Another reason was the @CAPS4 inadequate equipment. They didn't have the right equipment to dock the dirigible properly. So they decided @CAPS5 against letting them dock there ever again. They also had @CAPS6 a strong incentive to stop it because there were hundreds of civilians below, and if something went @CAPS4 wrong, the balloon could fall on the civilians. Those are the reasons why in the @CAPS1 - ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION1, the builders had to face problems with docking balloons."
227	15060	6	3	"There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One notable example is that ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" The owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse an accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York. When the builders became fully aware that hydrogen is flammable, they had to thoroughly rethink the construction plans because if there was a fire, it would be much more dangerous in a populated area like New York. The chances of people getting hurt or injured were significantly higher. Another major obstacle was that ""dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building [because] of an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This law would make it completely illegal for dirigibles to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. This was a major obstacle because the builders would have been blatantly violating a law, and it would also be extremely dangerous. In conclusion, these obstacles made the idea of dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building unfeasible."
228	15061	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in order to attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. One issue was that the winds at the top of the building were very dramatically shifting because of the complex air currents. Because of this, the end of the dirigible would swivel around the top of the building erratically. Another issue was the people walking on the @CAPS1 streets of New York below the building. To stop a dirigible, heavy lead weights had to be used. This was problematic because one of the weights could very easily come loose and fall onto the pedestrians below @DATE1. The law that prohibited a flying airship from lingering too low over a city would be broken if a dirigible had been stationed at the Empire State Building. Due to these multiple and significant obstacles, the plan to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building faced insurmountable challenges.
229	15062	6	3	"Builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Safety was a prominent and non - negotiable issue; if human lives are at risk, an idea is not likely to be successful. Most foreign dirigibles contain hydrogen, an element that is ""highly flammable"" (paragraph @NUM1), and this posed a clear and present threat to not only the passengers on the dirigibles but also the people at the docking station as well. Another potential and very real obstacle was the violent winds at the top of the building. These winds would cause the back of the dirigible to blow around freely with the wind, making docking extremely difficult. Even the proposed solution of weighing down the rear of the dirigible with lead weights was fraught with danger; lead weights would be left ""dangling high above pedestrians"" (paragraph @NUM2), posing a serious risk of injury. A final and very obvious obstacle for the builders of the Empire State Building was the pre - existing law prohibiting airships that fly ""too low over urban areas"" (paragraph @NUM3). Even with a theoretically safe docking station, landing would be illegal. Although it may have seemed like a feasible plan at the time, the idea of dirigibles docking on the top of the Empire State Building was neither a safe nor a practical one. In conclusion, these obstacles combined to make the plan unworkable."
230	15063	6	3	"While the construction of the Empire State Building was in progress, the builders faced many obstacles in trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. At first, people were overly optimistic and thought it was going to be wonderful and lead to the ""transportation of the future"". One obstacle the builders faced was the fact that a large dirigible moored to the roof would have negative and long - term effects on the building's frame. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" The builders would have to pay a substantial @MONEY1 to fix this problem. Another problem that was present was also the lack of safety. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" Also, even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the violent winds would cause the back of the ship to swivel around and around the mooring mast. Even if the back of the dirigibles were weighted down with lead, it would not be safe; as the lead would be ""dangling high above pedestrians on the street."" There was also a law stating that airships could not fly too low above urban areas. Nature itself presented many more problems, such as winds blowing the dirigible onto the ""sharp spires of other buildings."" As numerous problems became clearly apparent after the building was finished, the idea of dirigibles being the ""future of transportation"" was sensibly dropped."
231	15064	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the structure intended for dirigibles to dock faced numerous obstructions. They found that allowing dirigibles to dock presented a multitude of challenges. As Irving Clavan stated, ""the as yet unsolved problems of mooring airships to a fixed mast at such a height made it desirable to postpone"". This clearly shows that the height factor led to many unsolved issues, making the docking process extremely difficult. Moreover, most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium. Since hydrogen is highly flammable, in the event of a mishap, a crashing dirigible would pose a huge threat to one of the most populated cities in America. These significant obstacles ultimately made it very tough for the builders to achieve their goal of enabling dirigible docking."
232	15065	6	3	In The Mooring Mast, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered a series of substantial obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One major concern was the flammability of hydrogen. They realized that hydrogen, commonly used in dirigibles, was extremely dangerous. For instance, when a German dirigible caught on fire, the builders vividly imagined how much more catastrophic the situation would be if such an incident occurred over a densely - populated area like New York. Another significant hurdle was related to the mooring mast. The winds at the top of the building were incredibly harsh due to the unique location and building structure. These strong winds made the landing process for dirigibles extremely difficult. Additionally, there was a law in place that prohibited airships from flying low over urban areas. Considering all these challenges, the builders of the Empire State Building finally came to the conclusion that using the mooring mast for dirigibles was not a viable option.
233	15066	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building confronted a variety of obstacles while trying to enable dirigible docking. One notable problem was the stress on the building's frame. If a thousand - foot dirigible was moored at the top of the building by a single cable tether, it would put excessive stress on the building's structural framework. This could potentially compromise the long - term stability of the building. Another major issue was the fuel used in dirigibles. Most dirigibles from outside the United States relied on hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen's high flammability was a huge safety risk, especially when considering the building's location in a densely populated area. However, the most challenging obstacle was nature. The winds on top of the building were constantly in a state of flux because of violent air currents. Even if a dirigible managed to be tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around the mast due to the unpredictable winds. These multiple obstacles made it extremely difficult for dirigibles to dock successfully on the building.
234	15067	6	3	There seemed to be a plethora of problems emerging during the attempt to create a docking facility for dirigibles. Initially, the natural structure of the Empire State Building was not capable of bearing the weight of a dirigible. To address this, architects designed and constructed a stainless - steel tower. However, even after this modification, new issues arose. They discovered that both helium and hydrogen, commonly used in dirigibles, were highly flammable. This posed a significant fire risk. Additionally, the airwaves at the top of the building were extremely violent. The strong and unpredictable air currents made it almost impossible to safely dock a dirigible. Given the high probability of possible accidents, such as fires or crashes, the idea of using the building for dirigible docking was eventually abandoned.
235	15068	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced a series of formidable obstacles in constructing a mooring mast for dirigibles to dock on. The first issue was the building's inadequate framework. With a mooring mast on top, a great deal of stress would be added to the building. It is reported that ""over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework"". This not only presented a technical challenge but also a significant cost problem. Secondly, building a mooring mast for dirigibles over densely populated New York City was a major safety concern. Dirigibles from foreign countries used hydrogen to stay afloat, and as we know, ""hydrogen is highly flammable"". After the Hindenburg disaster of 1937, it was clear that any fires above heavily populated New York City would have catastrophic consequences. Next, the most troublesome obstacle was the winds. The winds were ""constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". Trying to tether a one - thousand - foot - long dirigible to the top of the Empire State Building would be extremely unsafe because the winds would blow the back of the dirigible, causing the ship to swivel around the mast. Finally, there was ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"". Even if the mast was successfully built, this law would prevent its practical use. All these insurmountable obstacles ultimately led to the failure of the mooring mast project."
236	15069	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building were faced with multiple significant obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Although some of these obstacles were identified and fixed early on, others were not brought to the builders' attentions until later in the construction process. The first obstacle that the builders encountered were the necessary modifications that were needed to be done to the building's framework. As noted, ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" (@CAPS1 nine). In fact, the Empire State Building would not have been able to support the mooring mast without having these essential modifications done. This modification process costed an extra sixty thousand dollars. The second obstacle that the builders faced had not even been brought up until after the building had been fully completed. The wind factor at the height of the building had made it nearly impossible to be able to safely dock any dirigibles. As described, ""Even if the dirigibles were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). With all the pedestrians located on the ground below, this factor made the docking extremely unsafe. The final obstacle that was faced was with the law. Under already existing law, airships were strictly prohibited from flying too low over urban areas. Blimps docking at the mooring mast would clearly be violating this law. The architectures and engineers of the Empire State Building clearly did not thoroughly look into what was necessary to building the mooring mast, and these obstacles ultimately made the docking of dirigibles unfeasible."
237	15070	6	3	When architects and engineers initially planned on building the mooring dock for blimps on the Empire State building, they didn't fully realize all the potential problems that could occur. One of these problems was a major safety issue. Most blimps used hydrogen instead of helium at that time. Hydrogen is extremely flammable. If a blimp were to catch fire while docked on the Empire State, considering the building's location in a highly populated area, it would end in a disastrous situation. Another significant obstacle was nature. The wind at the height of the building was unpredictable and often very strong. The dirigibles would just be swinging wildly in the wind. If the wind got too strong, it could add a substantial amount of stress to the building's structure and there was a risk that it could collapse. One last reason was an actual law. The law clearly stated it was illegal for airships to fly too low over urban areas. Given these insurmountable problems, the mooring dock on the building would have never worked as intended.
238	15071	6	3	When attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, the builders had many substantial obstacles to face. Most of the dirigibles used at the time were from countries other than @LOCATION1, so they commonly used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is very flammable, and if it were to catch on fire while the dirigible was near the Empire State Building, it would go down in a very populated area of New York City, causing a potentially catastrophic event. Another obstacle was at that high height of the building, the wind was very strong and violent. When the dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the dirigible would be easily caught by the wind and swing around the mooring mast in an uncontrolled manner. The last obstacle was there was a law clearly stating that dirigibles can not fly too low over urban areas. This legal restriction made it completely impossible for a dirigible to ever come close to the building for docking purposes. Due to these combined obstacles, the plan to have dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building was unworkable.
239	15072	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced a number of significant obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was one of safety. Most blimps outside the U.S. used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. In the event of a fire, with the building located in a densely - populated area of New York, it could lead to a major disaster. Another obstacle the builders faced was nature itself. The winds on top of the building are always changing because of dangerous air currents. These unpredictable winds would cause the rear end of the blimp to move around and around the mooring mast in a dangerous and uncontrollable way. A third obstacle they faced was a law that aircrafts couldn't fly too low over pedestrian - filled areas. This law makes it completely illegal to tie up a dirigible to the Empire State Building. Considering these multiple obstacles, the idea of dirigibles docking at the building was doomed to fail.
240	15073	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many formidable obstacles, including nature, safety, and the law, when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The builders' first immediate concern was for the structure of the building. When moored, the dirigible ""would add stress to the building."" To counteract this added weight and ensure the building's stability, the building would need to be carefully modified and strengthened. The builders were also deeply worried about safety after a well - known German dirigible was destroyed in a fire. Since the gas used to keep dirigibles aloft is highly flammable and downtown New York is so densely populated, they realized this could pose a very serious and dangerous threat. The greatest obstacle was the high winds on top of the building that, ""were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" With the dirigible tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would be swiveling in the wind in an erratic manner. While lead weights could be used in open landing fields to stabilize the dirigible, these would be neither safe nor practical when hanging above pedestrians on the busy streets below. Lastly, there was an existing law stating that airships could not fly too low over urban areas. This legal restriction would make it absolutely impossible for a dirigible to even approach the building. The combination of these insurmountable obstacles made it completely impossible for dirigibles to ever dock at the Empire State Building."
241	15074	6	3	"In the excerpt, there were a few notable obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The most significant issue with permitting the dirigibles to use the building as a mooring site was safety. It is mentioned in paragraph @NUM1 that the German dirigible, the Hindenburg, was tragically destroyed by a fire in New Jersey. This incident brought on serious concerns about a similar disaster happening at the Empire State Building. If a dirigible were to catch fire while attached to the building, there would be a high death rate due to New York City being densely populated. Another major obstacle would have been keeping the dirigibles from swiveling around the mooring mast. In paragraph @NUM2, it is pointed out that having lead weights at the back of the ship would be quite dangerous with so many pedestrians on the street below. Yet another reason why trying to moor the dirigibles to the building was not practical was because of ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (paragraph @NUM3). This law made it illegal for the ships to tie up to the building, let alone get close enough to attempt it. Tying all of these reasons together is the fact that the wind was too strong at the top of the building for anything to happen safely and without some sort of injury. In conclusion, these multiple obstacles made it extremely difficult, if not impossible, for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building."
242	15075	6	3	The obstacles the builders had to face were rational, but there are some crucial things you should think of first, such as people's safety, aircraft height limits, and the impact of wind. They also needed to consider how to dock the dirigibles properly and how to get the passengers safely to the landing area. What they did work on was smart though. They had the device that connects the dirigibles to the dock, the electric winch, and they also set up a baggage and ticket area. However, they should have prioritized the other safety - related aspects first. In conclusion, while their efforts in some areas were intelligent, the oversight of key safety factors made their plan less feasible.
243	15076	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous challenges when attempting to put a dock for dirigibles on top. In order to make New York City the most modern city for travel, Al Smith attempted to put a dirigible dock on top of the Empire State Building. They did manage to finish constructing the mooring mast, although they had to strengthen the steel frame of the building. The stress of the people boarding the dirigible could potentially cause damage to the original framework. Once it was finished, there were @NUM1 attempts to board passengers onto the blimps. Unfortunately, both attempts ended in failure. The builders were not able to overcome the obstacles of the severe winds and laws. The strong winds could blow the blimp astray into another building. Also, if a dirigible made of hydrogen was used, it could cause a fatal accident due to the high flammability of hydrogen. Finally, there was an existing law that prohibited airships from flying close to urban areas. The architects of the mooring mast were not able to overcome these challenges. In conclusion, despite their efforts, the combination of natural and legal obstacles prevented the successful implementation of the dirigible dock.
244	15077	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were significant. The biggest obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. Al Smith saw an opportunity in his Empire State Building. One set of engineers and government people in Washington were trying to figure out some safe way of mooring airships to this mast. The greatest obstacle itself was mother nature. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. These shifting winds made it extremely difficult to control the dirigibles during docking. These are some of the many obstacles the Empire State Building faced while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. In conclusion, the combination of the lack of a proper landing area and the unpredictable winds made it very hard for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
245	15078	6	3	The following are significant obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced. They were worried about the hydrogen and the helium being highly flammable, especially considering the disaster of The Lakehurst Fire in New Jersey. This well - known fire incident served as a stark reminder of the potential dangers. They were also worried about the back weight of the ship, as it could affect the stability of the dirigible during docking. And they feared that the wind would blow the dirigible into the spires of the building, which would puncture the blimp shell. In conclusion, these concerns about flammability, weight, and wind - related damage made it very challenging for the builders to make the Empire State Building a suitable docking site for dirigibles.
246	15079	6	3	Many significant obstacles approached the builders of the Empire State Building as they attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there. The builders wisely put reality before theory in order to carefully pick the safest route in docking a dirigible. Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used Hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly Flammable. When the German dirigible Hindenburg was tragically destroyed by fire in New Jersey, the builders quickly realize how extremely dangerous it could be putting that risk in such a densely populated area such as New York. The greatest obstacle in being able to dock safely was nature. The winds on top of the Empire State Building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. This would vigorously sway the ship around the Mooring @CAPS1, becoming extremely dangerous. The Mooring @CAPS1 project came to a halt in the late 1930s, in order to effectively keep the people of downtown New York City safe. In the end, the practical concerns and safety risks made it clear that dirigible docking at the Empire State Building was not a feasible option.
247	15080	6	3	There are numerous reasons Why the builder's faced many substantial obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. In paragraph @NUM1 the excerpt clearly states that most dirigibles from outside of the United states use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. The hydrogen can easily cause a fire and potentially destroy the Empire State building and can also destroy downtown New York. Another crucial reason why the builder's faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there is because it was against the law. In paragraph @NUM2 the excerpt states there was an existing strict law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This could be extremely dangerous to the citizens of downtown New York. Overall, these factors combined made it nearly impossible to proceed with the dirigible docking plan.
248	15081	6	3	The builders of the empire state building faced a multitude of obstacles in the idea of docking a dirigible to a building of such great height. Dirigibles, mostly outside of the U.S., were made with hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is an extremely flammable gas which was very dangerous above a highly populated area such as downtown @LOCATION2. Safety was a major and legitimate concern as an accident like Hindenburg was something they definitely did not want to risk. The ability of docking a lightweight flyer was also very difficult. With strong and unpredictable winds, after the tether cable was attached, the back end of the aircraft would be violently blown around making the aviator of the blimp extremely hard to control. Also, a law clearly stating aircrafts may not fly too low to the buildings was stated especially after the incident of Hindenburg in New Jersey. A blimp could possibly hit a spire of another building. The reality of docking these lightweight aircrafts was a major safety and difficult concern. These obstacles are what builders of the empire state building faced, ultimately making the dirigible - docking idea unworkable.
249	15082	6	3	"The original plan for the Empire State Building was to be the tallest building in the world, at @NUM1 feet. Everything was progressing smoothly until the competition. The Chrysler Building, posed a serious threat to steal the title. When Al Smith announced that he was going to put a mooring mast at the top of the Empire State Building, this obviously and significantly changed the architects' designs. ""The architects designed a shiny glass & chrome - nickel stainless steel tower that would be beautifully illuminated from the inside, with a stepped - back design that imitated the overall shape of the building. The rocket - shaped mast would have four wings at its corners... and would rise to a conical roof that would house the mooring arm."" (L¸sted). Two months after the workers started with the new plan, they celebrated because they successfully finished framing the entire building. ""The Empire State building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed. The greatest reason was safety."" (L¸sted). In conclusion, despite the efforts and changes, safety concerns ultimately thwarted the building's original purpose."
250	15083	6	3	"There were many significant obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One major obstacle was the building's frame was not adequately prepared for it. In paragraph @NUM1 it says ""A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add excessive stress to the building's frame."" The frame of the building simply could not handle a docked dirigible. To fix this problem, over sixty thousand dollars worth of extensive modifications would have had to be made. Another significant obstacle faced by the builders was that most countries other than the United States use hydrogen instead of helium to make their dirigibles fly. Hydrogen was very flammable and builders reasonably figured that if an accident like the Hindenburg occurred over a densely populated area like New York, it would be utterly devastating. The greatest obstacle faced by the builders were the winds on top of the building that were constantly shifting. The shifting winds were caused by very violent air currents. While the dirigibles were tethered to the mast, the back of it would just keep spinning around in circles. They could not use lead weights to help hold the zeppelin steady because it was completely unfeasible to dangle heavy lead weights over New York City. From the beginning, the idea of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was clearly ridiculous and unfeasible."
251	15084	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced some significant obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle they encountered was the need to modify and strengthen the building's steel frame. This was essential because the stress from the dirigible's load, along with the wind pressure, would have to be effectively transmitted all the way to the building's foundation to ensure stability. Another challenge they had to overcome was adding more floors to the building, bringing the grand total to 102 floors. The 101st floor was designed as a glassed - in observation area, while the 102nd floor featured an open observation platform. Despite these difficulties, the builders persevered in their ambitious plan.
252	15085	6	3	"The builders attempting to build a dock on the Empire State Building had to face numerous obstacles. First, dirigibles were similar to huge balloons as they were composed of hydrogen and helium. As noted in the expert source, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (pg @NUM1). This meant that if a dirigible caught on fire while stationed near the Empire State Building, there was a high risk that the building itself could also catch fire, creating a hazardous environment for employees and passengers. Next, attempting to tie down a dirigible to a building was illegal. The expert states, ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" Disobeying this law would result in punishment, thus presenting a new obstacle for the builders. Last but not least, the idea of docking airships to a building was extremely unsafe. ""The @CAPS2 Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted gives an excellent third reason, ""Fearing that the wind would blow the dirigibles onto the sharp spires of other buildings in the area, which would puncture the dirigible's shell."" In the event of a disaster, many lives would be lost or severely injured. Finally, the builders and architects would have an extremely hard time convincing high - level government officials to allow airships to dock on the Empire State Building because the potential negative consequences clearly outweighed the benefits."
253	15086	6	3	There are a lot of obstacles when trying to come up with the idea of a building that can accommodate dirigible docking. The builders had to ensure that the structure of the building was robust enough to withstand the high winds it would be exposed to. They needed to carefully analyze the wind patterns and design the building's framework to resist the forces exerted by the wind. Plus, they also had to make sure the top of the building was safe enough for dirigibles to dock there. This involved creating a stable and secure area where dirigibles could land without causing harm to any people inside the building or to the building itself. Overall, the task of designing such a building was a complex one that required careful planning and consideration.
254	15087	6	3	"In ""The Mooring Mask"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, in order to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, the builders had to face several obstacles. First, there was ""the lack of a suitable landing area."" They had to clear and prepare enough space for the huge dirigibles to land safely. Second, they had to deal with the issue of ""add stress to the building's frame."" To address this, they had to make the structure of the building stronger so that it wouldn't break under the additional load and forces. Lastly, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting."" If they were going to make this docking idea work, they needed to find a way to calm the wind around the tower, perhaps through some form of wind - deflecting design. In conclusion, the builders of the Empire State Building had to overcome these significant obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there."
255	15088	6	3	"In the passage ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there are clearly presented. The author points out that ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" At the height of the building, the climate and winds were constantly changing. This caused the back of the dirigibles to swivel, which was extremely dangerous. Also, the builders had to take into account the fact that ""most dirigibles... used hydrogen rather than helium, & hydrogen is highly flammable."" Since the Empire State Building is located in the middle of New York, a highly populated state, the explosion of a dirigible at the top of the building would be catastrophic, resulting in a significant loss of lives. The builders of the Empire State Building underwent many challenges in their arduous attempt to allow dirigibles to dock, and these challenges ultimately made the task extremely difficult, if not almost impossible."
256	15089	6	3	As the Empire State Building was being constructed with the intention of allowing dirigibles, or blimps, to dock there, the workers encountered several significant problems in trying to achieve this goal. The first of these obstacles that occurred to the workers was the building's framework. The structure needed to be robust enough to withstand the forces exerted when a blimp docked, especially considering the harsh winds that constantly pushed the blimp in different directions. Without a proper and well - engineered framework, it would be extremely perilous to attempt docking. The next major obstacle for docking was the hydrogen gas that powered the dirigibles. Hydrogen is highly flammable, and there had been previous tragic accidents involving hydrogen blimps. The workers were well - aware that an accident with an exploding blimp in a densely populated area like the vicinity of the Empire State Building would have catastrophic consequences. The final hurdle the workers faced was the strong wind currents at that high altitude. The winds were so powerful that the blimps couldn't even approach close enough to dock safely. The workers proposed weighing down the blimp with lead weights, but they quickly realized that having weights dangling high above pedestrians on the street was neither practical nor safe. Initially, the idea of allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building seemed promising. However, as time passed, the multitude of obstacles became insurmountable, and eventually, the idea had to be abandoned.
257	15090	6	3	Based on the excerpt, there are a few key obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced when considering allowing dirigibles to dock. One significant concern was the safety of the people inside the dirigibles and those below them on the ground. Safety was of utmost importance because if a docking system was not safe, it simply could not be put into use. There were numerous potential hazards, such as the blimp hitting a spire on the building, which could result in the death of people below. The greatest obstacle, however, was nature itself. If the dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast, there was a high risk of it getting wrapped around the building. Additionally, the strong winds made it extremely difficult for the dirigible to even reach the mooring mast. Overall, the concept of the mooring mast on the Empire State Building was not a practical idea. It was merely a thought conceived to compete with another building but was not thoroughly thought through with regard to safety aspects. In the end, it became clear that this idea was unfeasible due to these significant obstacles.
258	15091	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many challenges in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. One important issue they had to grapple with was the Mooring Mast. As stated by @ORGANIZATION2, ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" (paragraph @NUM1) This indicated that a more sophisticated and well - planned installation was required. Another problem was related to the dirigible's load. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" (para. @NUM1) This meant that the entire building's structure had to be able to handle these forces. One of the main oversights of the architects was not fully considering the building's frame. ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation.""(para. @NUM1) This modification would involve significant engineering work and resources. In conclusion, the numerous obstacles faced by the builders made it clear that allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was a far - more complex task than initially thought."
259	15092	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. One prominent obstacle was the lack of a suitable landing area. Dirigibles were quite large, often as long as one thousand feet, which is equivalent to the length of four blocks in New York City. This size made it difficult to find a proper space for them to land on the building. Another challenge was the weight of a mooring mast. ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened,"" which entailed modifying the entire frame to bear the weight of the mooring mast. This modification was estimated to cost over sixty thousand dollars. Safety was also a major concern. Most dirigibles outside the United States used hydrogen, which is extremely flammable. If a fire were to break out in a highly populated area like downtown New York, the consequences would be far more severe. Additionally, ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Because of these winds, the dirigible would swivel around the mooring mast when attempting to dock. Given these numerous and significant obstacles, it became evident that allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was an unviable proposition."
260	15093	6	3	Allowing dirigibles was seen as the new way of transportation back in the 1920s. However, there were many problems associated with having a mooring dock on top of the Empire State Building. One of the main issues was the flammability of the gases used in dirigibles. The helium and hydrogen gases that provided the lift for the dirigibles were highly combustible. Even the smallest spark could cause the entire dirigible to burst into flames in an instant. For example, the Hindenburg, a German zeppelin, exploded in New Jersey on May 6, 1937. If such an explosion were to occur in a more densely populated area like downtown New York, the resultant disaster would be far more devastating. Another problem with the dirigibles was the wind. Strong air currents could cause the dirigible to swivel around the mooring mast when it was docked. Also, the dirigible was often weighed down by lead weights. Having these weights dangling over pedestrians on the street was a significant safety risk. In light of these numerous and serious problems, it became clear that the idea of using the Empire State Building as a docking station for dirigibles was not practical and had to be discarded.
261	15094	6	3	Based on the excerpt from The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered numerous obstacles while constructing the mooring mast. For instance, there was a specific law that directly prohibited what the builders intended to do. This law clearly stated that airships were not allowed to fly at low altitudes over city areas. The mooring mast on the Empire State Building would blatantly violate this law when the airships came in to dock. Another significant problem the builders faced was the high - risk environment surrounding the airships that were supposed to dock there. The airships, known as dirigibles, resembled giant balloons. Their structure was such that they could easily pop if they made contact with something sharp enough. The Empire State Building was surrounded by other extremely tall buildings, and most of these buildings had long, pointed spires on their tops. So, if a dirigible accidentally bumped into one of these spires, it could burst and come crashing down to the ground. This presented yet another serious issue. Had an airship popped in the bustling city of New York, it could have caused a large number of casualties, not only among the passengers inside the airship but also among the people on the ground. During the construction period, the Hindenburg crashed in fields, resulting in the death of all its passengers. The builders then thought about the far - reaching consequences if such a disaster had occurred in the city. This was the final blow for the builders, and they had no choice but to abandon their ambitious goal due to the overwhelming number of problems. In the end, these insurmountable obstacles made it impossible for the mooring mast to serve its intended purpose.
262	15095	6	3	"In the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced a multitude of obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. The fabric used for dirigibles is extremely light. Specifically, it is a cotton fabric that is filled with a combination of hydrogen and helium. This filling makes the dirigibles lighter than air, enabling them to float. However, this also poses certain risks. There are implications in the text that the architects perhaps did not put in sufficient effort to solve the problems. As the text states, ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose..."". Despite the potential of dirigibles docking at the building, the various issues related to the fabric, safety, and the overall feasibility made it an unachievable dream. In conclusion, these factors combined led to the failure of the plan to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building."
263	15096	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building encountered several obstacles in their attempt to have a dirigible dock at the building. Firstly, the dock would break existing laws. These laws were put in place to ensure the safety and order of the airspace and the area around the building. Secondly, the dock would pose a significant danger to the people below. If a dirigible were to have an accident during docking or while it was moored, it could cause harm to the individuals on the ground. Additionally, having a dirigible dock at the building would put a great deal of stress on the frame of the building. The structure of the Empire State Building was not originally designed to handle the forces and weight associated with a docking dirigible. All these factors made it clear that allowing a dirigible to dock was not a viable option. In conclusion, due to these insurmountable obstacles, the plan to have a dirigible dock at the Empire State Building had to be abandoned.
264	15097	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring @CAPS1"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the major obstacles was the terrible winds. The excerpt vividly describes how fierce the winds are in that area. For example, when the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles attempted to dock, the extremely strong winds prevented it from getting close enough to the building. The captain was extremely worried that the powerful wind would blow the dirigible into a sharp spire on one of the nearby buildings, which could puncture the dirigible's shell. Another significant reason was an existing law. This law clearly stated that airships were not allowed to fly too low over urban areas. This made it completely illegal for any dirigible to tie up to the building or even approach it. The last and most concerning obstacle was the fear of crashing. Most blimps from outside the country used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable, which made these blimps extremely dangerous. After hearing about the blimp fire in New Jersey, the builders realized how much more catastrophic an accident like that would be in a densely populated area such as downtown New York City. In summary, the huge wind gusts, the restrictive law, and the high risk of a disastrous crash were the main obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there."
265	15098	6	3	When constructing a building, workers often face tough challenges, especially when it comes to the iconic Empire State Building. In their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock at the building, Al Smith and other architectural builders had to deal with many problems. As clearly stated in paragraph @NUM1, dirigibles were prohibited from mooring at the Empire State Building because there was an existing law. This law strictly prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for dirigibles to approach or tie up to the building. Also, as mentioned in paragraph @NUM2, the winds on top of the building were constantly changing due to violent air currents. These strong and unpredictable winds made it extremely difficult, if not impossible, for dirigibles to safely dock. Both of these obstacles were the primary reasons that explained the failure of the mooring mast. Despite the builders' efforts, they were ultimately not successful in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. In conclusion, these insurmountable challenges made it clear that the plan to have dirigibles dock at the building was not feasible.
266	15099	6	3	"Builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles. The first problem was the material of the dirigibles. Dirigibles ""were actually enormous steel - frame balloons with envelopes of cotton fabric filled with hydrogen and helium to make them lighter than air."" The thin cotton fabric material of the dirigibles could easily be broken if they happened to fly into a sharp area of the building, and the ""violent air currents"" around the skyscraper did not help. Since the dirigibles could not be properly weighted down at the Empire State Building, it would be extremely dangerous to have them ""dangling high above pedestrians on the street."" Another obstacle was the fact that the dirigibles were filled with hydrogen. Although dirigibles from the United States were filled with a mix of hydrogen and helium, ""most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" With these significant obstacles that the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, the theory of dirigibles docking at the building did not work out in reality."
267	15100	6	3	"Although thousands of dollars and countless hours were spent on the Mooring Mast, certain serious obstacles prevented dirigibles from docking atop the Empire State Building for safety reasons. First, these dirigibles were not safe to fly over populated areas. Some of them contained the highly flammable gas hydrogen, which could lead to catastrophic fires if ignited. Also, a well - known German dirigible called the ""Hindenburg"" burst into flames in New Jersey. As stated in paragraph @NUM1, ""the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" The winds at the peak of the Empire State Building were extremely violent. It is stated in paragraph fourteen that ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting."" These erratic and powerful winds made it impossible to safely dock a dirigible on the Empire State Building, and thus, the idea of dirigibles docking there had to be abandoned."
268	15101	6	3	"In the excerpt of ""The Mooring Mast,"" many obstacles created problems for the builders of the Empire State building and their goal of allowing dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle that came across the builder's minds was that they ""could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building's flat roof,"" (paragraph @NUM1) because the large amount of pressure pulling on the structure would severely damage the building. The second problem that the architects faced was safety. Past events, such as the disaster of the Hindenburg, were caused by the use of ""hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable...the owners of the Empire State building realized how much worse the accident could've been."" The next problem that came up was nature itself, specifically dangerous winds. An event occurred when ""the U.S. Navy dirigible, Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of the forceful winds."" Additionally, there were legal issues, as existing law was strictly against airships flying too low over urban areas, making it completely illegal to dock dirigibles at the Empire State Building."
269	15102	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State building faced the problem of how to keep the back end of the blimp from swaying violently in the wind. They were unable to solve this problem, as we see in paragraph @NUM1 where it says: ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" This constant swaying would not only be a nuisance but also a safety hazard. Another problem with docking blimps on the Empire State building was a law that strictly stopped dirigibles from flying too low over populated areas. There is proof of this in paragraph @NUM2 where it says ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" One more problem with mooring dirigibles on the Empire State was that it was extremely hard for pilots to dock their ships on the mooring. An example of this is in paragraph @NUM2 where it says ""The U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of the forceful winds."" Due to these multiple problems, the idea of dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building was unfeasible."
270	15103	6	3	The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Obstacles they faced were the strength of the framework, safety of the dirigibles, along with nature, and a law. The first obstacle, the framework, wasn't too difficult to overcome, but it cost @MONEY1 to strengthen it in order to support the mast and a blimp. The second obstacle was safety. On May 6, 1937, the German dirigible Hindenburg was completely destroyed by fire due to the highly flammable gas hydrogen which is commonly used in dirigibles. This accident could have been much more disastrous if it had occurred above a highly populated area like New York. The third obstacle was nature. The violent air currents on top of the Empire State Building made it almost impossible to dock a dirigible to the mast. Using lead weights to weigh down the back of the blimp would be neither practical nor safe when hanging high above pedestrians. The final and fourth obstacle builders faced was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it completely illegal to even attempt docking a dirigible to the mast. Considering all these obstacles, the plan to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was ultimately unworkable.
271	15104	6	3	While attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the mooring mast, the Empire State Building faced many obstacles. One significant problem they encountered was the use of hydrogen in dirigibles rather than the use of helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable, and in fact, it once caused a dirigible to be completely destroyed by a massive fire. Also, the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air - flow patterns in the upper atmosphere. These shifting winds made it extremely difficult for a dirigible to stop swiveling around, which was a clear safety hazard for pedestrians walking below on the busy streets. Lastly, it was strictly illegal for aircraft of any sort to fly so low over urban areas. At first, the idea of the mooring mast was well - liked as it seemed innovative, but in the end, it had too many problems and proved to be an impractical solution.
272	15105	6	3	In the 1930's, the world was rapidly evolving, and new technologies were coming of age. One of these emerging technologies was the Dirigible, and some forward - thinking people thought to expand its use. One of these ideas was the mooring mast on the Empire State Building. This was initially a great idea, but the numerous issues that stood in its way made it impossible to implement. A major problem was safety, considering the mooring mast was 1,250 feet up in the air. Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. If this large airship caught on fire, everyone inside would burn to death or crash into the ground and kill many people under it. Another huge problem was the winds and the ease with which they could push the dirigible off course. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. These strong and unpredictable winds made it simply impossible for dirigibles to safely dock at the mast. One problem that should have been looked at from the beginning was the law. The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. Although this mooring mast was a fantastic idea, there were too many things standing in its way, making it an unfeasible concept.
273	15106	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted, it describes the complicated obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the initial obstacles was intense competition. It was planned as the world's tallest building, taller even than the new Chrysler Building. Al Smith realized that he was close to losing the title of world's tallest building. There was a fierce competition as to which building would hold the title of the tallest between the Empire State Building and the Chrysler Building. Another significant obstacle was related to the safety of dirigibles. When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by a massive fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York. The owners didn't want to risk an accident that could cost people's lives, as it would have been very bad publicity for them. The obstacles that the builders went through were actually a positive thing, as they made them more cautious and open their eyes to potential risks."
274	15107	6	3	"There are many obstacles faced because of letting the dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building. First, ""the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" This means that the winds on top of the building were extremely strong. These powerful winds would cause the dirigible to swivel around the mooring mast if it were tethered, making the docking process extremely dangerous. Also, ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it completely illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the areas."" This clearly shows that it was a waste of time thinking ships could moor at the State Building because there is a well - defined law against it. There still are many obstacles you have to overcome for any project, and in this case, nature and the law were insurmountable barriers."
275	15108	6	3	"Based on the excerpt from The Mooring Mast, there are three main obstacles that prevented the Mooring Mast on the Empire State Building from being used in the way it was intended. The first obstacle was that it lacked safety. Dirigibles are highly flammable machines when used with hydrogen, and a large - scale fire in the heart of New York City would be a tragic disaster. Another obstacle that the Mooring Mast faced was nature. The mooring was designed to attach to the dirigibles with an electric winch, allowing the dirigibles to move freely. When the strong winds of the upper atmosphere were to blow in this situation, the dirigibles would ""swivel around & around the mast"" as described. This constant swiveling would cause tension to build on the building's frame and lead to a very unsafe environment. The last reason was that there was a law created that stated it was illegal for a ship to fly too close to urban areas for safety reasons, leaving the whole Mooring Mast to be unusable. In conclusion, these three major obstacles made it impossible for the Mooring Mast to serve its intended purpose."
276	15109	6	3	Based on the excerpt, the obstacles the builders faced while attempting to build the dirigible dock at the Empire State Building were: finding a practical way to make this building taller than the Chrysler Building. Designing the mast and reconciling it with the reality was also a challenge. Al Smith, driven by the desire to outdo the Chrysler Building, needed a way to make his building bigger. He came up with the idea of putting a mooring mast on the building. At first glance, the idea seemed great. However, while designing the mast, architects realized they couldn't simply place the mast right on top of the building. They'd have to modify the foundation. After carefully changing the skeleton of the building, construction went on as planned. Two months later, the mast was finished. But unfortunately, the architects forgot that most dirigibles use hydrogen, which is highly flammable. All the work the architects put in was ultimately for nothing because the mooring mast was never used.
277	15110	6	3	There are always challenges when you are trying something innovative. There are various obstacles like getting official approval, gaining widespread support, and ensuring that the project is structurally sound. Al Smith and the rest of these architects faced all of these difficulties. During the 1920s, dirigibles were hyped to be the future of travel. Al Smith had the ambitious goal of being able to dock a dirigible on top of the Empire State Building. Other than convincing people to go along with the plan, he had other significant problems. The wind at that high altitude is extremely violent. Dirigibles were not designed to fly that close to the city as it is dangerous, and some of them were highly flammable. In conclusion, there were too many large and insurmountable obstacles to overcome, making the plan unfeasible.
278	15111	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, there were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. ""Hydrogen is highly flammable."" The dirigibles ran on hydrogen rather than helium, and if it were ever to catch on fire, there would be numerous pedestrians everywhere below that would be in grave danger. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" Because the dirigible would be docked so high with little back control, the fierce winds would pose a huge problem. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" If a dirigible were to dock there, it would also be breaking existing laws. There was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The builders faced a lot more obstacles dealing with the docking of dirigibles than just architectural ones, making the plan extremely challenging to execute."
279	15112	6	3	"The obstacles that builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there included the need to build a higher and taller building. They also encountered difficulties during the construction process, which forced the workers to postpone the completion dates. Another major obstacle they had trouble with was the mast. As stated, ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose."" The workers were not initially planning on having these many unforeseen obstacles; they simply wanted to complete the job efficiently. In the end, these challenges made it very difficult to achieve the goal of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building."
280	15113	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced included trying to make sure the building didn't fall down. This involved ensuring a solid foundation and proper structural integrity. They had to account for various factors such as the weight of the building, potential natural disasters like earthquakes, and the effects of wind and weather over time. Through careful design and construction techniques, they aimed to create a stable structure. However, it was a continuous challenge to maintain the building's stability throughout the construction process and in the long - term. In conclusion, ensuring the building's stability was a crucial and difficult obstacle that the builders had to overcome.
281	15114	6	3	Some problems that the builders faced when building the mast on the top of the building were that they couldn't simply drop the mast onto the building's flat roof. If they did, the wind would exert stress on the frame because the blimps could be hanging there. The steel frame of the building would have to be carefully modified and strengthened to support the mast. The cost for these modifications was yet another problem for them. These challenges made the mast - building process quite difficult, but the builders had to find solutions to ensure the stability of the structure.
282	15115	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The main obstacle was that the builders couldn't directly put the mooring mast on the Empire State Building, as it had a flat roof. The mooring mast would exert pressure on the building's frame, potentially causing structural issues. To overcome this obstacle, the architects had to meticulously modify and strengthen the frame. More than sixty thousand dollars were spent on the modifications of the framework. The greatest obstacle, however, was nature, and there was nothing the builders could do about it. The violent air currents caused the winds on the top of the building to constantly shift direction. In open fields, dirigibles could be weighted down in the back using lead weights, but with pedestrians around the building, it wouldn't be practical nor safe. Without being weighted down, the dirigibles would swivel around uncontrollably, making docking extremely dangerous. In the end, these challenges made the goal of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building very difficult to achieve.
283	15116	6	3	"In constructing the Empire State Building, builders faced multiple obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock atop the building. One obstacle that constructors faced was related to modifications. As stated, ""The stress of the dirigibles load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the foundation."" With this obstacle, contractors would need to thoroughly reinforce the structure of the frame and the foundation to ensure stability. Another significant obstacle, as stated from the excerpt, is that ""most dirigibles from outside the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, which is flammable."" Given that hydrogen is flammable, it would be extremely dangerous if a dirigible exploded over the streets of New York. These obstacles presented major challenges during the construction of the Empire State Building, making the process of enabling dirigible docking a complex task."
284	15117	6	3	"In the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles. The reason why the builders faced obstacles was because ""architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" An example is that ""A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" The stress of the dirigible mooring would gradually make the building's frame bend and become weak over time. This is just one of the many obstacles that the builders faced. Other factors such as wind conditions and potential structural limitations also contributed to the challenges. Overall, these obstacles made the task of enabling dirigible docking at the Empire State Building a difficult and complex endeavor."
285	15118	6	3	The builders faced many obstacles while building the Empire State Building. One obstacle was that Al Smith had competition with the Chrysler building, which was forty - six feet taller than the Empire State. This led to Smith making the State Building reach the height of 1,250 feet. This height increase then led to another obstacle. He wanted to add a mooring mast at its top for docking the new airships. However, this didn't work due to the lack of sufficient landing space. A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether would cause significant stress to the building's frame, potentially compromising its structural integrity. In conclusion, I have just explained the various obstacles that the construction of the Empire State Building faced in the context of its height competition and the attempt to enable airship docking.
286	15119	6	3	While building the Empire State Building, the architects were faced with many obstacles when the decision was made to use the building to talk, load, and refuel dirigibles. How to dock a dirigible to the side of a building was one of the biggest concerns, as dirigibles are large and cumbersome. But the amount of stress this would cause to the building's structure was an even bigger worry. The building needed to withstand the forces exerted by the docking and movement of the dirigibles. However, the greatest obstacle to this project was the wind, nature itself. The fear was that the strong wind would blow the dirigible into a neighboring building, endangering both the dirigible and the surrounding structures. Tethering the dirigible was not an option for safety reasons, as it could cause additional instability. Due to the architect's inability to overcome these obstacles, the Empire State Building was never used for its original purpose of dirigible docking.
287	15120	6	3	The first obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. Some dirigibles were as long as one thousand feet, which is the same length as four blocks in New York City. Finding a space large enough and properly configured for these massive dirigibles to land safely was extremely difficult. The second obstacle was that these dirigibles had hydrogen in them, and hydrogen was highly flammable. The people involved realized how much worse an accident could have been if it had taken place in New York, because this is where they were located. New York City is densely populated, and a hydrogen - related accident could have had catastrophic consequences. They had to re - think about their plan. Another obstacle was that the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. These unpredictable wind conditions made it nearly impossible for dirigibles to approach and land safely. In light of these insurmountable obstacles, the plan for the expanded use of dirigibles in New York City had to be abandoned.
288	15121	6	3	"Builders of the Empire State Building faced challenging obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. ""The greatest obstacle was nature itself."" This was a huge problem for the mooring masts because the strong winds made it impossible for dirigibles to get close enough to the building to land. The wind forces were so powerful that they could easily push the dirigibles off course. Secondly, there was an ""existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This meant that because there were so many people in a small area of downtown New York, it was too dangerous for dirigibles and other aircrafts to be flying at low altitudes. The risk of an accident causing harm to the large number of pedestrians below was unacceptable. Lastly, dirigibles from outside of the state used hydrogen rather than helium. ""Hydrogen is highly flammable."" After the German Hindenburg had an accident with fire, it was clear that taking the risk of an accident like that happening above the heads of thousands of pedestrians was a bad idea. The obstacles, which were noticed too late, before the construction, are why dirigibles are not allowed to land on the Empire State Building to this day."
289	15122	6	3	"The obstacles that needed to be overcome to create the idea of a docking platform on top of what was going to be announced as ""The tallest building"" were going to be tough. The steps taken to make this idea come to life began with consulting with experts in the field of airship docking. They took detailed tours of the equipment and mooring operations at the @ORGANIZATION1 in New Jersey to gain practical knowledge. When it was time to start constructing, the issue of the stress the building would intake from the mass of the Dirigibles became a problem. The weight and movement of the dirigibles could potentially damage the building's structure. So, they modified the building's frame to accommodate the new situation, reinforcing certain areas. They also designed a stainless - steel tower with a stepped - back design that imitated the overall shape of the building, which not only added to the aesthetic but also had functional benefits. Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications were made to achieve the goal of ""The Mooring Mast"". Despite these efforts, unforeseen challenges later emerged that ultimately affected the viability of the docking platform."
290	15123	6	3	"There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was that a lot of dirigibles outside the @LOCATION4 use hydrogen over helium. The problem was that hydrogen is highly flammable. ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York City."" @CAPS1 can only imagine the chaos and destruction that would have ensued. Thousands of people could have been injured or killed, and the damage to the city's infrastructure would have been immense. Another obstacle the builders faced was nature. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. That would've meant that these dirigibles could just have got swept back, making it impossible for them to approach and dock safely. In conclusion, there were several insurmountable obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, which led to the abandonment of the docking plan."
291	15124	6	3	"In paragraph @NUM1 it states, ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed."" These reasons include one related to flammable gases, a second due to nature itself, and the last being an already existing law. As said in paragraph @NUM1, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium."" Considering how flammable hydrogen is, they didn't want that above a highly populated area. Paragraph @NUM3 now states, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting."" As a result, the dirigible would not be stable enough. Finally, as I said in paragraph @NUM4, ""There was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" Given these factors, there was never a chance of a dirigible being able to dock there, as stated above, and thus the mooring mast remained non - functional."
292	15125	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The builders had to be extremely cautious about safety, which played a crucial and significant role with the dirigibles. Many dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen instead of helium. Since hydrogen is highly flammable, they wouldn't want the bustling city to be destroyed and at risk of a massive, uncontrollable fire. Another problem was nature itself. There were violent air currents above the building, and these air currents could pose a danger to the local pedestrians of New York. The final obstacle builders faced when trying to pursue the dirigible idea was a law that strictly prohibited airships flying too low over urban areas. They would be breaking the law to even allow it within the area of the building. With so many issues occurring in the development of the dirigible plan, the idea of using them quietly and gradually disappeared as it became unfeasible.
293	15126	6	3	Some obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced were how to build the mooring mast properly and how to attach the mooring mast securely to the frame of the Empire State Building. They needed to ensure that the construction of the mooring mast was structurally sound and that its attachment to the building's frame could withstand the forces that would be exerted during the docking of a dirigible. After careful consideration and planning, they realized that these were indeed challenging tasks that required innovative solutions.
294	15127	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"", builders of the Empire State Building face significant obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The main and most obvious obstacle was the lack of a suitable landing area. Dirigibles need a large, open area to land safely. Al Smith proposed adding a mooring mast to the top of the building, which would allow a dirigible to land for several hours. During that time of landing, the dirigible could get ""refueling or service, and to let passengers on and off."" Passengers could get off and on the dirigible safely by walking down a gangplank to the open platform. Architects had great trouble putting a mooring mast on the top of the Empire State Building's flat roof because they were afraid that the load of the dirigible and the wind pressure would have to be properly transmitted. Dirigibles had trouble with safety; most of them used hydrogen instead of helium, but hydrogen was highly flammable. The greatest obstacle of the mooring mast was nature itself. Winds were high due to violent air currents, and it would not be safe for dirigibles. The practical reason why dirigibles weren't allowed to moor at the Empire State Building was a law against airships flying too low. The idea of dirigibles was given away to airplanes. In the end, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were insurmountable, and the plan was abandoned."
295	15128	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, the workers faced a lot of obstacles in attempting to allow the dirigibles to dock there. In paragraph @NUM1 the architects say that ""they could not simply drop a mooring mast on the top of the Empire State building."" The reason for this is because the top of the roof is held together by just one cable tether. The effect of landing something as heavy as a dirigible on the roof would add excessive stress to the building's frame. In order to allow the dirigibles there, they would need to strengthen and modify the building's framework, and this would cost at least over @MONEY1. Rather than incurring such high costs, the architects designed a glass, chrome and stainless - steel tower that was accessible from inside. This would ""rise a conical roof that would house the mooring arm."" - paragraph @NUM2. Elevators would also be inside to help the passengers board the dirigibles, providing a more practical and cost - effective alternative."
296	15129	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles while constructing it. One significant obstacle they encountered was that dirigibles couldn't dock there because there was no mooring mast. When the architects and engineers designed the building, they included a flat roof, on which the mooring mast could not be placed. They determined that the frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to address this situation. Another hurdle was that they couldn't use a rope to hold the mooring mast up because the dirigibles wouldn't be able to support it. These were some of the obstacles the architects had to overcome during the construction process.
297	15130	6	3	"Some obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock were that the winds at that height were always changing, making it extremely difficult to land a dirigible. The high - altitude winds were highly unpredictable, constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Also, dirigibles were highly flammable because they used hydrogen rather than helium. As the text states, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The project was a bad idea from the start. ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" They even made an attempt before giving up. ""In December 1930, the @ORGANIZATION2 dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but couldn't get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds."" It was clear that the building was not designed to accommodate such a task, so it simply wouldn't work."
298	15131	6	3	The obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were too many to predict. These obstacles were due to many variables such as climate, the surrounding buildings, and most of all, the dirigibles themselves. The climate, as mentioned in paragraph @NUM1, presented dangerous and uncontrollable winds. The reason for these erratic winds was the Empire State Building itself. The urban areas around the building consisted of sharp hull - breaching spires, and due to the strong winds, it made a hull breach @NUM2 times more likely. Finally, there was the construction of the dirigibles. Dirigibles were made with a steel frame wrapped in cotton and filled with hydrogen to make them lighter. Unfortunately, the hydrogen was highly flammable, which added another major risk to the docking attempt. In the end, these combined factors made it nearly impossible for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
299	15132	6	3	"In order to let dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building, many changes had to be made. Both the builders and planners faced numerous obstacles. First of all, to even consider the idea, they had to ""consult with experts."" This involved taking detailed tours of relevant facilities and conducting in - depth research. They had to find a ""safe way of mooring airships to this mast."" The next obstacle, as mentioned in paragraph @NUM1, was that docking a dirigible to the building would put significant ""stress"" on the building's frame. The builders had to carefully ""modify and strengthen"" the frame to withstand this stress. One of the last obstacles they had to face was designing the tower. The builders eventually decided on a rocket - shaped mast with four wings at the corners to house the mooring arm. They also had to find a proper place to house the machinery needed to winch the dirigible. Overall, the builders had to make drastic changes and spend a large amount of money, all for something that was ultimately not safe."
300	15133	6	3	"While constructing the top of the Empire State Building, the builders faced many challenges. According to the excerpt, the architects couldn't simply place the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's roof. Moreover, having a thousand - foot dirigible at the top of the building while being held by a single cable would impose excessive stress on the frame of the building. To maintain the dirigible in place, it would require a significant financial investment. Quoting the article, ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation... the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened... sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications."" The complex technical requirements and the high financial costs made it extremely difficult for architects to build a mooring mast on the top of the Empire State Building, ultimately making the idea unfeasible."
301	15134	6	3	"The builders faced a few problems when trying to let dirigibles dock there. One significant problem was related to the gas used in dirigibles. As stated on page @NUM1, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This posed a major safety risk during the docking process. Additionally, lead weights were used to lower the dirigibles down, but this too could set a risk for people, as also mentioned on page @NUM1. Due to these safety - related issues, docking dirigibles there was a challenging task."
302	15135	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered numerous obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock at the mooring mast. The architects had to accommodate a variety of factors to make the docking possible. For example, in @CAPS1 @NUM1, it clearly states that ""The steel - frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" This shows the extent of structural changes required. Also, in @CAPS1 @NUM2, it mentions that ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" These factors, along with many others, led to the mooring mast never being put to use because of safety concerns and existing laws."
303	15136	6	3	"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders faced numerous obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One prominent reason was safety. Paragraph @NUM1 from the excerpts elaborately explains that, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This indicates that if an accident were to occur on the mast above a densely populated area like downtown New York, the consequences could be extremely severe. Another major concern was nature itself. Paragraph @NUM2 describes that the, ""winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This was yet another safety issue as the dirigibles would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street. A third significant obstacle was the existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. As clearly seen, these were the key obstacles that the builders had to confront."
304	15137	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building encountered several obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. One crucial obstacle was related to whether the dirigibles were suitable to dock at the Empire State Building. Another significant issue dealt with the mast itself. These obstacles ultimately led to the failure of this construction plan, as the author states, ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed"" in @CAPS1 thirteen. First of all, @CAPS1 five reveals that the dirigibles were actually enormous steel - framed balloons, with envelopes of cotton fabric filled with hydrogen and helium to make them lighter in the air. @CAPS1 six further states that, ""Some were as long as one thousand feet."" One can't help but wonder how a blimp of that size could ever manage to land on the Empire State Building. Also, @CAPS1 nine points out that ""A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" This @CAPS1 also mentions that ""The stress from the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" These were just a few of the many obstacles the builders had to face. The fate of the mast, as mentioned in @CAPS1 @NUM1, ""was neither practical nor safe."" The architects seemed blind to the potential problems of the mast. In the end, the mast was a great attempt, but unfortunately, it was indeed a failure."
305	15138	6	3	"The architect of the new building had three significant problems with allowing dirigibles to moor at the top. The first problem stemmed from the harsh wind at that high altitude, which made it extremely arduous to dock the dirigible. As described, ""Fearing that the wind would blow the Dirigible onto the sharp spires of other buildings in the area, which would puncture the dirigible's shell, the captain could not even take his hands off the levers."" This shows the great difficulty in the docking process. Secondly, the back of the dirigible would not be tied down. This problem would lead to serious safety hazards for people getting off the dirigible. ""The winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" This effect would also make taking off a challenging and perilous task. The last reason was that it is illegal to fly aircraft so low over the city, which already eliminated the possibility of allowing dirigibles to moor on top. Overall, this idea was not well - thought - out and was rushed so that it would be the first building in the world to have a dirigible mooring mast, but it was ultimately unfeasible."
306	15139	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered numerous obstacles while trying to make it suitable for dirigibles to dock. One major issue was that most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable, which posed a significant safety risk. Another challenge was the constantly shifting winds at the top of the building due to violent air currents. Even when the dirigible was tied to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would spin around it. Additionally, the wind could blow the dirigible onto the sharp spires of nearby buildings, puncturing its shell. There was also a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. Even without this law, attempting to dock a dirigible at the building would be extremely dangerous for the people below and the building itself. In conclusion, these multiple obstacles made it unfeasible for dirigibles to regularly dock at the Empire State Building."
307	15140	6	3	The obstacles the architects and engineers of the Empire State Building faced while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were centered around the safety of the people below. As stated in the relevant source, there is an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law was a significant hurdle as it restricted the ability of dirigibles to approach the building. Another main reason, also mentioned in the source, is the violently shifting wind currents. These unpredictable winds made it difficult to safely maneuver and dock the dirigibles. In conclusion, the combination of the law and the challenging wind conditions made it very difficult to achieve the goal of having dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building.
308	15141	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in making it suitable for dirigible docking included the fact that the balloons of the dirigibles were made of flammable material. This flammable nature posed a high - risk of fire and explosion during the docking process. Additionally, the wind at the building's location was strong enough to blow the dirigible around erratically. This made it extremely difficult to control the dirigible's movement and position for a safe docking. In conclusion, these two major obstacles, the flammable material of the balloons and the strong winds, made it very challenging to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
309	15142	6	3	"There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, as described in the excerpt ""The Mooring Mask"" by @PERSON1. The architects and engineers of the Empire State Building were highly competitive and aimed to make the building very tall. However, they did not have a well - thought - out plan. They wanted the building to have an impressive top and be useful, so they considered having dirigibles dock there. But after looking into the history of airship accidents, they realized it was not a good idea. In a densely populated city like New York, any accident would have serious consequences. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, causing the back of the ship to swivel around the mooring mast. They felt it would be unsafe for many reasons, such as the risk of the dirigible crashing into the building or other structures. This is why the builders went through many obstacles in this endeavor. In conclusion, the lack of a proper plan and the challenging wind conditions made it nearly impossible to achieve the goal of dirigible docking at the Empire State Building."
310	15143	6	3	According to the relevant source, both the engineers and the architects came across several obstacles when it came to building an area where blimps could land, making this project unfeasible. One of the primary reasons that this project failed was due to the air laws. These laws made it illegal to fly too low in urban areas, which severely restricted the approach of blimps to the building. An additional conflict was the fact that strong winds could push the tail of the blimp into the sharp spires of neighboring buildings. This would pop the dirigible as easily as a balloon, causing a dangerous situation. In conclusion, the combination of legal restrictions and the threat from the wind - related hazards made it impossible to successfully build an area for blimps to land at the Empire State Building.
311	15144	6	3	In the excerpt The Mooring Mast, I have witnessed how the builders of the Empire State Building encountered obstacles while trying to enable dirigibles to dock there. The Empire State Building was already standing, and the architects decided to renovate it and create a dock for dirigibles. The architects working on this project had to strengthen the building's frame to withstand the additional stress. They also had to install winches and control machinery for the dirigible mooring to ensure proper handling. Moreover, the architects needed to install housed elevators and stairs to bring passengers down to the base floor and back up efficiently. After the renovations were completed, the Empire State Building had 102 floors. However, after the building was finished, the owners discovered that they could not let dirigibles onto the building as it would violate the law of airships flying too low in urban areas. So, the Empire State Building was completed, but it could not be used for dirigible docking.
312	15145	6	3	Al Smith announced on December 11, 1929, that the Empire State Building would reach the new height of 1,250 ft. His plan was to construct a mooring mast at the top of the building to make it equipped for modern travel. The builders faced three main obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle was safety. Most dirigibles from outside the @LOCATION2 used hydrogen, which is highly flammable. When the Hindenburg was destroyed in a fire, the owners of the Empire State Building became concerned that a much worse accident could occur in New York. The second and most significant obstacle was nature. The winds at the top of the building constantly shifted due to the complex air currents, which would cause the back of the dirigible to swivel around the mast. The only proposed solution was using lead weights, but this was neither practical nor safe. The final obstacle was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas, which made it illegal for the dirigibles to tie up to the building. In conclusion, the three main obstacles that the builders faced, namely safety, nature, and the law, ultimately prevented the successful implementation of dirigible docking at the Empire State Building.
313	15146	6	3	The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were numerous. Firstly, there wasn't a lot of room for them to land as the length of dirigibles was equivalent to four blocks in New York City. To address this, they needed to consult with experts and take detailed tours of the equipment. They conducted numerous experiments and tests on dirigibles to find possible solutions. It was also extremely dangerous to have them land there. Additionally, it was bad for the environment because hydrogen, which is highly flammable, was used. Dirigibles couldn't dock there because the docking area wasn't stable, and this instability made it unsafe for people. In summary, these multiple obstacles made it unfeasible for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
314	15147	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was getting the mooring mast on top of the building. As stated, ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building's flat roof. A thousand - foot dirigible mounted at the top of the building... would add stress to the building's frame."" To overcome this, the architects carefully modified the building's framework to ensure it could bear the extra load. Another problem was wind. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Since there was only one wire connected to the front, the dirigible would spin round and round as the back was exposed to the winds. Despite efforts, this problem was never fixed. In conclusion, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles, and while some, like the mooring mast installation, were overcome through modification, the wind - related issue remained unsolved, resulting in the ultimate failure of the mooring mast."
315	15148	6	3	Al Smith had a great and innovative idea. He envisioned having a dirigible station dock on top of the world's tallest building, the Empire State Building. He had great creativity and aimed to use his building to its full potential. However, although there were many problems with this idea. One major issue was the urban area below. Many people lived in downtown New York City, and it would be against the law to have zeppelins flying above the densely populated area. Another important problem was the intense winds that were harsh and made it extremely difficult to dock dirigibles on the building. These strong and unpredictable winds posed a significant challenge to the docking process. In conclusion, there were many obstacles in the way of fulfilling Al Smith's dream of having the Empire State Building dock dirigibles on its top, ultimately preventing the realization of this ambitious plan.
316	15149	6	3	"Some of the things they faced were significant safety hazards. Like when they mentioned in @CAPS1 @NUM1 about the time the Hindenburg was destroyed, they stated, ""The owners of the empire state building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it was over New York."" Another major obstacle they faced, as noted in @CAPS1 @NUM2, was ""Nature itself."" The strong winds would make an airship @CAPS3 around uncontrollably like crazy. The last problem was the strict law stating that airships cannot @CAPS3 that low above urban cities. All these factors combined made the operation extremely challenging."
317	15150	6	3	"In the @DATE1's, dirigibles were widely considered the transportation of the future. Trying to make New York the forefront of modern travel, the ambitious architects and dedicated builders of the Empire State building eagerly rushed to take on the challenge of building a mooring mast. However, they failed to recognize the numerous obstacles that lay ahead. As the architects carefully designed the mast, they quickly realized that the frame of the building was not adequately equipped to handle the weight on top of its flat roof. Making those necessary adjustments had cost the builders a significant amount of additional time and New York City a great deal more money. In addition, the workers had not thoroughly considered wind currents. In this excerpt, the writer says, ""the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds."" Clearly, the workers should have carefully considered possible obstacles before embarking on something as large a project as a mooring mast."
318	15151	6	3	"Al Smith, a well - known four - term governor of New York and a prominent leader of the Empire State Building's construction, had a grand vision. His vision was to create a two - hundred fifty foot mooring mast at the top of the Empire State Building. Not only would this make it the world's tallest building, but it would also allow for docking passengers and delivering goods through the use of dirigibles or blimps. Unfortunately, there were many significant @CAPS1 facing the builders of the Empire State Building regarding the allowance of docking dirigibles on its mast. The main concerns the builders faced were the materials that dirigibles are made out of, the unpredictable forces of mother nature, and strict airship laws. The first obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building faced concerning the docking of dirigibles on its mast was the materials dirigibles are made from. According to the article, ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, ""Most dirigibles... used hydrogen... highly flammable..."" The builders quickly realized this posed as a huge safety threat, especially over a densely populated city. The second obstacle the builders faced regarding the docking of dirigibles on its mast was mother nature herself. The article states, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents... neither practical nor @NUM1). The construction workers realized that having passengers moving on and off the mast, could be very dangerous in harsh weather conditions. The final obstacle the construction workers faced was an overlooked airship law. The story says, ""... an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas,"" (@ORGANIZATION2). The workers realized that it was against the law to even tie up an airship to a building. In conclusion, the three main @CAPS1 the builders of the Empire State Building faced in regards to the allowance of docking dirigibles on its mast were the materials that dirigibles are made of, nature, and airship laws, which ultimately made the docking plan unfeasible."
319	15152	6	3	"In this project to construct a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building, there were some serious problems. The idea of the mooring mast was to be able to dock dirigibles to the top of the Empire State Building and be able to have passengers get on and off the dirigible from and into the building. The big problem that it faced was the extremely high wind speeds that high up in the air. At nearly @NUM1 feet in the air, the powerful wind would be whipping around even a massive, steel, docked dirigible. When New York governor, Al Smith put forth ideas to construct this mast, nobody realized until after that it was a somewhat ridiculous task. In paragraph @NUM2, it states, ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed."" After it was ruled impossible, people started to realize that everyone was just caught up in the new modern travel idea and failed to come down to reality. In the end, it became clear that the project was not well - thought - out."
320	15153	6	3	In the excerpt, it talks about the effort to make the empire state building the tallest in New York. It was the tallest building until the skilled architects built the Chrysler building. The Chrysler building stood 1,046 feet, a full 46 feet taller than the empire state building. So Al Smith, a shrewd and determined figure, realized he was going to lose his title for having the tallest building. Then he came up with the creative idea of adding a top or a hat to the building. The idea Al Smith came up with was adding a landing spot for blimps or dirigibles. Al Smith knew it wasn't going to be easy, so he carefully thought of possible reasons why it wouldn't work. He had to design another sturdy figure that would be able to hold the mass of the blimps. He also had to think about the practical issue of how passengers would get on and off the blimp. He also remembered that most blimps use hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. For example, the German blimp Hindenburg was tragically destroyed by fire in Lakehurst. All these factors made his idea a challenging one to implement.
321	15154	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced several arduous problems in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One critical problem was strengthening the building's frame. Since the added pressure of the dirigible's heavy load and the strong wind needed to be safely transmitted all the way down to the foundation, this was an absolute necessity. The existing skeleton of the building had to be carefully edited. In fact, these meticulous edits cost over sixty thousand dollars. Another significant problem builders faced was constructing the mast itself. To give it a truly unique look, architects made the tower out of high - quality glass and chrome - nickel stainless steel. They had to precisely place the machinery at the base of this tower. The builders also had to ensure it was conveniently accessible to passengers; they made sure that both luggage and people could smoothly go to and from the aircraft. These are two of the major challenges builders faced in constructing the Empire State Building. Despite the mast being unused in the present day, the remarkable design makes this building one of the most well - known and iconic buildings in the world.
322	15155	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many formidable obstacles when they attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there. One major obstacle the builders faced was the harsh winds. The Empire State Building is extremely tall, and at such heights, the winds were very fast. Moreover, the winds would constantly change direction due to the violent air currents. This erratic wind behavior made it extremely difficult to dock the dirigibles safely. Also, another significant obstacle was the pedestrians and other buildings around. Most balloons were filled with hydrogen, which is highly flammable. If a dirigible got caught on fire or crashed, a great deal of damage would be inflicted on the city and its people. The structure of the building also proved to be a challenging obstacle. The dirigibles were so large that the building's structure was at risk of failing and destroying the building. The final obstacle the building faced was the strict law that made it illegal for a ship to ever tie to a building or even fly that low in an urban area. Although there were a few attempts, unfortunately, the Empire State Building never was able to have dirigibles dock on it.
323	15156	6	3	"In the excerpt, there were numerous obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The problems were that the dirigible, being ""held by a single cable tether, would add significant stress to the building's frame"", and the wind pressure wouldn't alleviate the situation either, as clearly stated in @CAPS1 @NUM1. Another crucial issue was that, as mentioned in @CAPS1 @NUM2, ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium"", and ""hydrogen is highly flammable"". Also in the @CAPS1 @NUM2, ""The owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse"", an accident could be ""if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York. These are the major problems the builders faced, which ultimately hindered the plan of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building."
324	15157	6	3	In the excerpt The Mooring Mast, written by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many complex problems with their ideas. The builders thought they would be able to create a successful landing dock for dirigibles. They had carefully planned everything, but when it came time to test it, it simply didn't work. There were quite a few problems with their idea of using the Empire State Building as a landing dock for dirigibles. One reason that this was not successful was because the dirigibles weren't able to get close enough to attach to the building. In order for the dirigible to be anchored, a rope would need to be tied to something. But the balloons weren't able to get too close to the building because the pointed structure at the top of the building was making it extremely difficult. If it got too close to the point, it could puncture the balloon, which would be disastrous because the gas that holds it up would come out and the balloon would fall. There is one more major reason their plan did not work. The other major reason would be because of the wind. The wind would get so wild that the back of the blimp would sway back and forth vigorously, making it extremely dangerous for passengers. They wouldn't be able to weigh it down with weights as it would be dangerous for the pedestrians down in the city. These are the major reasons why the plan to dock dirigibles at the Empire State Building would not work.
325	15158	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in order to allow dirigibles to dock there. To start off, there was a severe lack of a suitable landing area. This was a tough obstacle because the builders needed to come up with a place where extremely large dirigibles could land in a crowded place like New York City. They had to consider the limited space and the surrounding buildings. Next, was figuring out a safe way of getting the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building. This was another tough obstacle because if the mast was just carelessly placed on the top of the building, it would add excessive stress to the building's frame, which is extremely dangerous. Lastly, and most importantly, was the problem of nature. At the top of the building, there were constantly shifting winds due to the violent air currents. This was an extremely dangerous obstacle because the winds could cause the dirigibles to be constantly moving and shaking violently. Also, if they were weighted down by lead weights to prevent them from being affected by the wind, the weights would be dangling precariously above pedestrians on the street. To allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many different and challenging obstacles.
326	15159	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, builders faced numerous challenges in enabling dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. First, safety was a major concern. Back then, most dirigibles relied on hydrogen, a highly flammable gas, instead of helium for power. This meant that in the event of a malfunction like a fire, not only would the dirigible burst into flames, but the iconic Empire State Building could also be at risk of catching fire. Another obstacle builders had to deal with was nature. According to paragraph @NUM1 of the reading, the location of the Empire State Building experiences ""violent air currents"" with shifting winds. This issue would make it difficult for the dirigible to remain stable. Although solutions such as hanging lead weights from the back of the dirigible were proposed, this only led to more problems. If the lead weight were to fall, it could land in the streets of @ORGANIZATION2, potentially harming pedestrians. The final hurdle builders would have had to overcome if they continued their plans for the dirigibles was a law. The law stated (as per the reading) that airships were not allowed to fly too low over urban areas. So, in reality, all the plans the builders had for this project had to be abandoned due to the government's law. In conclusion, many problems emerged during the planning stage, and the plans to create the ""Dirigible dock"" had to be put to rest."
327	15160	6	3	The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were significant. The architects couldn't simply place a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof because a thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would impose substantial stress on the building's frame. The stress from the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would need to be transferred all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications to the framework were required. The greatest obstacle of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. As a result, the back of the dirigible would swivel around and around the mooring mast, making it extremely difficult to keep the dirigible stable. In the end, these challenges made it nearly impossible to achieve the goal of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
328	15161	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. First, the stress of ""A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether,"" was a significant problem. So, the steel frame of the building had to be carefully modified and strengthened to support the dirigibles. Next, they had to deal with the fact that dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable, and ""when the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the Owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse the accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" Moreover, the greatest obstacle was the winds on top of the building that changed due to violent air currents. If a dirigible was moored and weighted down with lead weights above pedestrians, it could lead to a disastrous situation. In attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, builders came to the realization that too many obstacles stood in the way, and it was simply not feasible."
329	15162	6	3	"In the excerpt ""the Mooring Mast"", the author @ORGANIZATION2 explains some of the difficulties that the builders had to face in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock on the mast of the Empire State Building. First of all, the dirigibles were large and heavy and required ample space to land. @ORGANIZATION2 stated that ""some were... the same length as four blocks in New York City."" If the builders wanted to accommodate dirigibles on top of the building, they would need to create a large landing platform to ensure a safe landing. Secondly, they decided that they couldn't land dirigibles on a flat roof and instead chose to tie it with a cable tether. The author says ""the architects could not simply drop the mooring mast on top of the... flat roof."" They realized that the weight of the dirigible would distort the building's structure and that the strong winds could cause damage all the way down to the foundation of the building. In conclusion, the workers faced a multitude of obstacles in their efforts to accommodate dirigibles on top of the Empire State Building."
330	15163	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles while trying to construct a dock for dirigibles. One major problem was safety. While American dirigibles used helium, dirigibles from other countries were filled with highly flammable hydrogen. If a dirigible were to catch fire in a heavily populated area like New York City, the consequences would be extremely deadly. Nature also posed significant problems for the mooring mast. The winds above the building were too strong and constantly changing, which could potentially destroy the dirigibles. Finally, federal laws stipulated that an aircraft could not dock that close to a building. These three factors combined made it completely impossible for dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. In summary, the combination of safety concerns, natural elements, and legal restrictions put an end to the idea of dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building.
331	15164	6	3	Throughout the process of building the Empire State Building to enable dirigibles to dock there were numerous complications. At the onset, the building was unable to simply install a mooring mast on top. The roof was flat, and if a dirigible docked, it would add significant stress to the building. They would need over a substantial amount of money, specifically @MONEY1, to modify the building framework. Then they discovered that most dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable, and having a hydrogen - filled dirigible docked on the building would pose a great safety risk. They also ran into a problem with nature. At the top of the Empire State Building, the winds constantly shifted due to the violent air currents. Even if they were to tether the mooring mast, the back of the ship would spin around and around the mooring mast. With people bustling on the streets in @CAPS2, this was neither feasible nor safe. There was also an existing law against flying airships too low over urban areas. All these issues led to the failure of using dirigibles for docking, but it did pave the way for the development of airplanes, so even though dirigibles didn't work, it had a silver lining in promoting other forms of air travel.
332	15165	6	3	The builders of the Empire State building faced many significant obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. One major obstacle was that most countries other than the United States used hydrogen rather than helium in their dirigibles. Hydrogen is highly flammable, and if a hydrogen - filled dirigible were to catch fire above a densely populated city like New York, the results would be truly disastrous, endangering countless lives and causing extensive property damage. Another problem was the height of the building. At such a high altitude, the winds would blow the back of the dirigible around erratically. The winds could push the dirigible into nearby structures or cause it to sway uncontrollably. Perhaps the most obvious obstacle in allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building was the law that strictly prohibited airships from flying below a certain height over cities. All of these obstacles combined made the project of having dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building impractical and impossible, ultimately leading to the abandonment of the idea.
333	15166	6	3	"Back in the roaring @NUM1's and @NUM2's, New York City was a vibrant and popular place that needed to adapt to the changing ways of modernizing travel. A new and fashionable form of travel was the blimp, or the dirigible. These large, gas - filled @ORGANIZATION2 balloons had nowhere to dock in the bustling @ORGANIZATION2, and finding a solution to this problem was much harder than expected. Al Smith, the architect of the Empire State Building, decided that he could use the top of the tower as a mooring mast for these dirigibles. After making extensive adaptations to the entire building for this change, Smith ran into a few serious problems. The first major @ORGANIZATION2 issue surfaced when a German dirigible exploded in New Jersey. This incident made Smith realize that it would be a very bad idea to allow any @CAPS1 blimps near the building as most non - American crafts were filled with ""hydrogen [which] is highly flammable,"" creating a high possibility for a catastrophic event. Another snag was the ""winds on top of the building... shifting due to... air currents"" which would cause the dirigibles to freely and dangerously sway in the wind. With the strong wind, they could crash into nearby towers and ""would be dangling above pedestrians,"" posing a great threat to the safety of people below. @CAPS2 valves also came into play as there was a preexisting law against airships flying too low over urban areas, which would make any dirigible activity with the Empire State Building completely illegal. In the end, these issues made the plan of using the building for dirigible docking unfeasible."
334	15167	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State building faced many difficult obstacles in building a mooring mast for airships to dock at the top of the building. The stress and pressure exerted by a thousand - foot dirigible docked at the top of the building were too great for the building's original framework to support. So, they had to reinforce and strengthen the framework and base so that the pressure would be effectively transmitted to the building's foundation. Another major obstacle was that most dirigibles from outside the @LOCATION2 were filled with hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is much more flammable, as demonstrated by the tragic incident when the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed in a fire. The builders didn't want such a catastrophe to happen over New York's large population. The final obstacle was the violent and shifting air currents over the building. Even if the front of the dirigible or ""mast"" was tied to the mooring mast, the back would swivel around the mooring mast in an uncontrolled manner. With the wind, it could crash into the building or other nearby structures. The many unseen obstacles of the mooring mast made it an impractical docking point for dirigibles. In the 1930s, after airplanes became more popular and dirigibles gradually disappeared, the ticketing & bagging rooms that were originally intended for dirigibles were turned into areas for tourists and sight - seers, repurposing the space for a different type of visitor."
335	15168	6	3	"When the builders of the Empire State Building were in the process of building the docking station, they ran into many significant @CAPS2. One of these major @CAPS2 was the air currents at the top of the building. The dirigible would be unable to stay still and safely let off its passengers. Evidence to support this claim comes from the article itself when it says, ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This means that the unpredictable winds would make it extremely difficult for a dirigible to dock safely. Another obstacle the builders faced was the law. This law strictly prohibited airships from flying low in a populated area. Therefore, an airship trying to dock at the Empire State Building would be breaking the law. This was explained in paragraph fifteen of the article when it said, ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area..."" Moreover, it became very dangerous to dock these dirigibles in a populated area or near a building because there was the threat of them bursting into flame, just like the dirigible Hindenburg in 1937. The article explains that the builders realized this new threat, ""... the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse the accident could have been..."" These multiple @CAPS2 plagued the construction of the docks, ultimately leading to the failure of the docking station project for dirigibles."
336	15169	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous significant obstacles in their ambitious attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. The unforeseen and critical safety issues ultimately lead to the downfall of this creative use for the building. ""The greatest reason was one of safety. Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (@CAPS1). They witnessed some of the dangerous effects of hydrogen when the German dirigible the Hindenburg was tragically destroyed in a massive fire. ""Owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse the accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York"" (@CAPS1). Other problems that the builders of the building faced were those stemming from mother nature. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (@CAPS1). This made it extremely hard for the dirigible to dock to the mast safely. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast"" (@CAPS1). Not only was nature playing against the builders, but the law was also a major hurdle. This is almost negligence on the builders' part to not realize that they would be breaking a law by constructing this mooring mast. ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"" (@CAPS1). Although the idea for a dirigible mooring mast on top of the Empire State building seemed innovative and practical, it was ultimately irrelevant due to the many insurmountable obstacles that obstructed the builders of the Empire State Building. In the end, the combination of safety concerns, natural challenges, and legal restrictions made the plan unfeasible."
337	15170	6	3	"By attempting to construct a mast on the Empire State Building, the builders encountered all sorts of complex problems. The purpose of this mast was to allow dirigibles, or blimps, to dock conveniently. Many of these problems, however, were directly related to the nature of the dirigible itself. In paragraph thirteen, line @NUM1, the author talks about some of the significant dangers of the dirigible, ""Most dirigibles... used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This flammability posed a serious threat to the safety of the building and the surrounding area. Another major obstacle is the location of the building. It was thought to be very unsafe because if a blimp caught fire, it would land right in the middle of New York City, not some remote cornfield where the damage could be minimized. And finally, the winds changed frequently at that high altitude. It was an extremely unwise decision to dock at this area if the dirigible would be blown around the building, as it could cause collisions and other accidents. In conclusion, the combination of the dirigible's fuel type, the building's location, and the unpredictable winds made it nearly impossible to achieve the goal of safe dirigible docking."
338	15171	6	3	Al Smith was a determined guy who had a bold idea of making the world's tallest building, and he didn't give up easily. On December 11, 1929, he officially announced that the Empire State building's goal height would reach an astonishing 1,250 feet. He also had a vision of incorporating transportation into the building's functionality. The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were quite challenging, with the lack of a proper landing area being a major issue. Al Smith thought he could add a mooring mast to the top of the building and allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or necessary service, and also let passengers on and off smoothly. One of the greatest obstacles to let the dirigibles dock there was the unpredictable weather. The dirigibles moored in open landing fields could weigh down, and when placed high above pedestrians on the busy street, it created a significant safety risk. Moreover, there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, which further complicated the plan. In the end, despite Al Smith's innovative thinking, the combination of weather - related challenges and legal restrictions made it difficult to realize the dream of dirigible docking at the Empire State Building.
339	15172	6	3	"Through life, many people plan to make or build an amazing object but have to accomplish amazing feats in order to do this. In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, @ORGANIZATION1 has the ambitious plan of building the tallest building in the world. However, in order to do this, he has to overcome many obstacles that you and I may never even think of. On December 11, 1929, the Empire State building was officially announced as the world's tallest building. In the process of making this huge building, there were numerous obstacles. One of the significant obstacles was allowing dirigibles to dock on the building. ""The greatest obstacle was nature itself. The winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This quote clearly shows that it may be extremely unsafe to allow dirigibles to dock due to the strong and unpredictable winds. Another quote that shows an obstacle of having dirigibles docking at the Empire State building is, ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"". This quote indicates that it might be illegal to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State building. In life, we often strive to defeat great obstacles, but sometimes we are unable to overcome the challenges we face. The attempt to have dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building is a prime example of how nature and the law can pose insurmountable barriers to our plans."
340	15173	6	3	In The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, it describes the various and significant obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. In paragraph @NUM1, they described that the greatest reason was one of crucial safety because most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. This flammability presented a severe risk to the building and the people in the vicinity. In paragraph @NUM2, they also describe another major obstacle was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast in a dangerous manner. Even dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighed down in the back with lead weights, which could be extremely dangerous for pedestrians below. In paragraph @NUM3, they describe another reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made it clearly illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. These are some prime examples of the insurmountable obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in allowing dirigibles to dock there. In conclusion, the combination of safety risks, natural challenges, and legal constraints made the plan of dirigible docking at the Empire State Building unworkable.
341	15174	6	3	The Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Some of these obstacles severely affected the building's attempt to serve as a dirigible dock. For instance, the Empire State Building is situated in a highly dense urban location. At that time, most dirigibles outside the United States used hydrogen instead of helium. The key difference between the two is that hydrogen is far more flammable than helium. So, if the hydrogen from the dirigible were to ignite, a catastrophic fire would break out. The effects could be as devastating as the Hindenburg disaster, which occurred when it ignited over Lakehurst, New Jersey on May 6, 1937. The outcome of the Hindenburg accident compelled the architects and engineers to seek a safer, alternate solution. Explosive gases were not the only problem, though. Strong, gusty winds were present at the top of the Empire State Building. If the winds were to blow a docking dirigible off - course, the outcome would be deadly. If the dirigibles caught fire or were blown off - course while docking, the pedestrians on the ground level could be seriously injured. In the end, these multiple obstacles made the idea of dirigible docking at the Empire State Building unfeasible.
342	15175	6	3	"Dirigibles, or blimps, were regarded as the transportation of the future. In order to add height to the building and yet serve a practical purpose, the architects of the Empire State Building decided to construct a mooring mast upon the building to accommodate ""aviation pioneers."" Although the mast was built and gave the building its desired height, its usage as a docking station for dirigibles would never be realized. The obstacles that the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock included the height of the building, wind speeds, and the safety of civilians. The building soared to a height of 1,250 feet, resulting in violent shifts in air currents. The winds on top of the building were constantly changing due to these violent air currents. Even if the dirigibles were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would spin around and around the mooring mast. Dirigibles also used hydrogen for fuel and lead weights to stay weighed down. However, using the mast, along with the hydrogen and lead weights, presented a safety hazard to civilians below. The builders had created the mooring mast with the intention of docking dirigibles, but this idea caused numerous problems and was ultimately never fulfilled, highlighting the challenges in making this vision a reality."
343	15176	6	3	There were many significant obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. One of the reasons was that if a dirigible were to hang by one cable tether, it would add excessive stress to the building's frame. This stress would gradually cause the building's foundation to crack. To address this obstacle, the architects had to strengthen the foundation, which cost them over sixty thousand dollars in modifications. Another obstacle was that they had to construct an additional floor that would be used for passengers. This floor would allow elevators to bring the passengers to the eighty - sixth floor, where their baggage and ticket area would be located. These observation areas were intended to double as the boarding area for dirigible passengers. Once this was completed, they then had to finish the roof before the framing for the mooring mast could commence. Another obstacle was nature itself. The winds at the top of the building were always shifting, and dirigibles, which usually land in open fields, could be weighted down with lead weights. However, these lead weights could not be used at the Empire State Building, as the dirigibles would be hanging over pedestrians on the streets. Additionally, there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This would make it illegal for a dirigible to tie up or even approach the Empire State Building. All these numerous obstacles led to the demise of the ideas of dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building and the associated mooring mast.
344	15177	6	3	"The builders' attempt to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was a futile effort. They tried a large number of different ways to approach this idea. There were a few different theories on what would be the best approach and how to develop the Mooring Mast, as proposed by Al Smith and John Tauranac. Each man had a distinct thought on how the whole structure would turn out. The architects designed a new glass and chrome - nickel stainless steel tower that extended from the bottom to the top of the Empire State Building. This structure helped support the mooring area, where the dirigibles were supposed to be docked. But the fate of the Mast was not promising. ""The Mooring Mast of the Empire State Building was never destined to fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed."" This statement is completely true and shows that the work of the architects was not fully planned and was overlooked in terms of making the Mast durable. In the end, the unfulfilled potential of the mooring mast demonstrated the miscalculations in this ambitious plan."
345	15178	6	3	Based on the excerpt, the obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were as follows. One obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. The city's dense urban environment made it difficult to find an area that could safely accommodate the large dirigibles. The greater obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast, it couldn't do much. The back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast, making it extremely difficult to maintain a stable position. These combined obstacles made it nearly impossible for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, effectively putting an end to the idea.
346	15179	6	3	The installation of a mooring mass on top of the Empire State building would have made the building, as well as the city of New York, incredibly important to modern travel in the 1930s. Alas, many difficult obstacles made the mast impossible to complete. First, to get the mast to the top, the building's frame had to be strengthened and reinforced. This involved painstakingly adding additional steel supports and bracing, which was not only time - consuming but also extremely expensive. Second, the builders had to deal with the possibility of the blimps exploding. The hydrogen used in dirigibles was highly flammable, and a single spark could lead to a catastrophic explosion. Another obstacle the builders faced was nature. With constantly shifting, violent winds at the top of the building, the zeppelin would sway and swivel around the mast, making it difficult and dangerous to unload passengers. In high winds, the zeppelin could even detach from its mooring and fall onto the city below, potentially killing hundreds. Lastly, the builders failed to take into account the law that forbade dirigibles to fly too close to urban areas. This law made it illegal for any blimp to get near the Empire State Building, let alone dock on it. The thought of a mooring mast on the Empire State Building was a fantastic idea, albeit one destined to fail from the beginning, as the combination of technical, safety, and legal issues were insurmountable.
347	15180	6	3	"The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION2 is mainly about builders and architects attempting to put a mooring mast on the top of the Empire State Building in New York. At first, the main idea of the mooring mast was to allow dirigibles to dock at the mooring mast to drop off and bring on passengers. The mooring mast was needed because ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the @ORGANIZATION1 flat roof. A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame. The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" (paragraph @NUM1). One reason why this plan did not work out was because it was not safe. The hydrogen that dirigibles use is highly flammable, and a small spark could cause a serious fire that would endanger the passengers and the building itself. Also, if it was a windy day, the dirigibles could get pushed around by the winds. To stop this, they have lead weights to weight them down, but they cannot use these with all of the people and other buildings around. Moreover, dirigibles could not fly too low over these kinds of areas due to safety regulations. Although the plan did not work, it was better to have everyone be safe, as the potential risks were far too great."
348	15181	6	3	Builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, both during construction and after. During the creation of the mooring mast, the architects had to figure out how to place it on top of the building. A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top, held by a single cable tether, would add significant stress to the building's frame. The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation. So, instead of simply placing the mast on the roof, they had to modify and strengthen the steel frame of the building. Builders also wanted the mast to be aesthetically pleasing, so they designed it with shiny glass and chrome - nickel stainless steel, rising to a conical roof and illuminated from inside. After the creation of the mooring mast, more difficulties arose. The safety of the mast was an issue, as the hydrogen - using blimps outside the U.S. were highly flammable, as evidenced by the tragic incident when the German dirigible Hindenburg caught fire. The winds at the top of the building, too, created danger. The constantly shifting violent air currents would cause the dirigibles to swivel around the mooring mast. Another obstacle was the law forbidding airships from flying too low over urban areas. It would be illegal, therefore, for a dirigible to tie up to the building or even fly too close to the area. In the end, these multiple challenges made the idea of dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building unfeasible.
349	15182	6	3	"In ""The Mooring Mast"", by @ORGANIZATION2 it revealed many problems with docking dirigibles on top of the Empire State Building. Al Smith, the Architect working on the Empire State Building, initially thought the mooring mast would go up with no problems. However, architects soon realized that the mooring mast would add stress to the building's framework. They estimated that it would cost @MONEY1 in modifications to reinforce the structure and ensure it could handle the additional load. After seeing what happened to the German dirigible ""Hindenburg"" in Lakehurst, where it burst into flames due to the highly - flammable hydrogen it used, architects soon realized that having dirigibles filled with this dangerous gas over the densely populated New York City wasn't a good idea. Nature itself would not allow the mooring mast to be built. There were such violent air currents at the one thousand and fifty - foot tall @ORGANIZATION1 altitude that made architects aware that this idea couldn't be upheld. The dirigible would swivel around because it couldn't be weighed down like in open landing fields. They couldn't use these weights because having weights suspended over pedestrians' heads was neither practical nor safe. There is also a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This would make it illegal to try and dock a dirigible on top of the Empire State Building. In the end, the idea of having dirigibles dock on the Empire State Building and become the new way of modern transportation was soon abolished as the risks and legal hurdles were too great."
350	15183	6	3	While attempting to let dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building, the builders faced many obstacles. For one thing, there wasn't a whole lot of landing room in New York City for them. The limited open space and the presence of other tall buildings in the vicinity ultimately made things tougher. Also, they were forced to put more work into the building by strengthening and modifying the steel frame of it to accommodate the new situation. This involved carefully analyzing the existing structure, identifying weak points, and then adding extra steel beams and supports. A lot of money was spent on these new renovations, over sixty thousand dollars. This was done mainly to reduce stress on the building's frame, ensuring that it could withstand the additional load of a moored dirigible and the wind pressure. But overall they managed to get it all done, and make their way through these tricky obstacles, showing their determination and engineering skills, although other issues would later surface to prevent the successful docking of dirigibles.
351	15184	6	3	Al Smith had an ambitious plan to erect his Empire State Building right on top of New York City. He vividly envisioned the towering skyscraper serving as a dirigible port and a future transport hub. However, technical limitations eventually proved insurmountable. First, dirigibles had to grapple with the challenge of docking in a bustling urban area. Dirigibles typically dropped lead weights to secure their landings, but this would be highly impractical when there were people walking on the streets below. Wind was also a major headache because it made the blimp extremely difficult to stabilize in the air. The wind would be even more problematic in the city, as if a dirigible hit a building, it would puncture and come crashing down into New York City. Neither of the dirigibles that attempted to moor could do so because of the strong wind and the presence of other buildings. As stylish as landing in the middle of the city would have been, the safety problems could not be resolved, and there were far too many people around to take such a risk. In the end, the plan had to be abandoned due to these insurmountable challenges.
352	15185	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced were quite significant when they were planning to construct a mast for the dirigibles. When they first attempted to build it, they discovered that the structure of the Empire State Building was not strong enough to hold the mast. The building had to support both the mast and the dirigibles that would dock there. The engineers carefully analyzed the load - bearing capacity of the building, but it became clear that the existing design could not handle the additional stress. After conducting numerous calculations and simulations, at the end of the arduous process, they concluded that there was no feasible way to make it work. That was one of the major obstacles that forced them to abandon the idea of using the building as a dirigible docking site.
353	15186	6	3	"Whenever architectural work is put into action, careful thoughts of the potential consequences should be thoroughly considered beforehand. In ""The Mooring Mast,"" the builders of the Empire State Building faced several formidable obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. The blimps consist of dangerous chemicals, and as stated, ""most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium,"" and hydrogen is extremely flammable. A single spark could lead to a catastrophic fire that might result in a ruined building, and even worse, a destroyed city. The potential for such a disaster was a constant concern. Although fires were a significant problem to consider, ""the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" This building stands extremely high in the sky, where the winds can get quite brutal. If a blimp was tied to the mast, the back of the ship would continuously swivel and gradually ruin the fabric of the aircraft. Given these circumstances, a mooring mast was simply not a bright idea for a large and densely - populated city like New York. The population was too large, and the area was too crowded. The obstacles the architects faced were serious, and they ultimately helped the team to abandon the idea of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, as it was simply too risky."
354	15187	6	3	"Many obstacles were faced by the builders of the Empire State Building as stated in the article ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2. These obstacles primarily included safety and availability. The idea of being able to dock a dirigible to a building in the middle of a densely populated city such as New York was extremely unsafe. The explosive tendencies of hydrogen, which was commonly used in dirigibles, posed a huge threat. Coupled with the unmanageable winds, the situation became even more perilous. With the strong winds, the dirigible would continuously move around the mast, creating an extremely unsafe environment for everyone in the vicinity, including the people on the ground and the crew on the dirigible. Availability would also be put into question. In paragraph fifteen, @ORGANIZATION2 tells about the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles attempting to dock but being unable to do so due to the unavailable route of safe entry. The complex urban layout and the presence of other buildings made it almost impossible to find a clear and safe path for the dirigible to reach the mooring mast. The obstacles in the mooring mast, namely availability and safety, were so significant that they effectively halted the plan of using the Empire State Building as a dirigible docking point."
355	15188	6	3	There are many obstacles with the docking of the dirigibles. For example, in the text, it talked about how if an accident had taken place over New York City, it would have been a lot worse because New York is a highly populated city. The large number of people on the streets and in the surrounding buildings would be at great risk in case of a dirigible accident. Another obstacle was the height, as mentioned in the text. At that great height, the weather conditions can be extremely unpredictable. Strong winds can make it difficult to control the dirigible during docking, and any sudden gust could cause the dirigible to collide with the building or other structures. Also, the thin air at that altitude can affect the performance of the dirigible's engines. Any malfunction or unexpected event at that height could have disastrous consequences. So, these are some of the major obstacles in the way of the docking of the dirigibles, and they make it a very challenging and risky endeavor.
356	15189	6	3	"In the article, The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION1 was determined to make the Empire State Building the tallest building. To make the Empire State Building taller than the Chrysler building, Smith decided to create a ""mooring mast"" where dirigibles could land and become ""transportation of the future."" However, the dirigibles never landed, because there were numerous obstacles in landing a dirigible on the Empire State Building. Many Dirigibles that are from outside the United States use hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable, and since the Empire State Building is located in the heart of New York City, it would be extremely hazardous for a hydrogen - filled dirigible to land in such a densely populated area. Another significant obstacle is the weather at the top of the Empire State Building. The winds up there are much stronger than down on the streets. If the dirigible were able to land, the powerful winds would blow the dirigible all around and render it out of control. Finally, it is illegal to have airships flying too low to the ground and near people. By having a dirigible land on the mast, it would clearly break the law. Due to these insurmountable obstacles, Al Smith's idea to make the dirigible landing a reality never came to fruition."
357	15190	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced several challenges in building a dock for dirigibles. They couldn't simply place a mooring mast on the flat roof of the Empire State Building. A thousand - foot dirigible held by a single cable would make the frame very unstable. With the substantial weight of the dirigible and the wind pressure it generates, this force would have to be transmitted all the way down to eleven hundred feet, where the foundation is. To withstand such stress, they would need to reinforce the frame, which would cost over sixty thousand dollars. In the end, the mooring mast was never constructed because of safety concerns, the unpredictable nature of the situation, and the law itself. It was unsafe as the highly flammable dirigibles would put the densely populated region in great danger. The winds at the top of the building would shift constantly and violently, making it extremely difficult to control the dirigible. Also, the law that prohibits airships from flying too low over urban areas would have made it illegal for dirigibles to land. Ships would not be able to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. Overall, the numerous obstacles made it an impossible task for the engineers to build a mooring mast.
358	15191	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced a number of different obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to land there, the most difficult of which were the urban location, money, and the weather. The urban location was a major obstacle for the builders. There are strict laws against airships flying too low over a densely populated area. Moreover, you can't weight the airship down like you could if it was on the ground because the weights would be dangling over the city, posing a serious threat to the people below. The second obstacle was money. As they worked on making the mooring mast a reality, it was becoming increasingly expensive to pay for all of the necessary modifications. The third and most dangerous obstacle was the weather. Wind and other various kinds of storms can have a strong influence on the airship, making it difficult for it to dock safely at the Empire State Building. Given these challenges, the obstacles of the urban location, money, and the weather made it virtually impossible for the mooring mast to be constructed.
359	15192	6	3	The dirigibles were not able to dock on the mast of the Empire State Building for obvious reasons. When the construction workers were building the mast, they didn't fully realize how dangerous it would be to have a dirigible land on the top of the building. There were a few serious concerns that the workers later came to recognize. First off, if the dirigible catches on fire, similar to the tragic incident in Lakehurst, New Jersey, then a large number of people would be at risk because New York City is such a big city with a massive population. Another reason they realized after was that it was far too dangerous for the dirigible to land there due to the high - speed swirling winds. If they attempted to land but the violent winds prevented them, it would be extremely unsafe for both the passengers and the building. These are the ways in which the workers of the Empire State Building faced insurmountable obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there.
360	15193	6	3	"There Are @CAPS1 things that Are worrisome about dirigibles docking there. One of them was the fact that ""The dirigibles would sway in the wind as the passengers walked down a gangplank"". This would be highly unsafe because as it sways, it has the potential to knock the passengers off the plank and cause them to fall from a great height, resulting in serious injury or even death. Due to this inherent risk, it becomes clear that there are significant safety concerns regarding dirigibles docking at that location."
361	15194	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were: The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents that swirled around the tall structure. Even if the dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast, making it difficult to keep the dirigible stable. Moreover, the United States used hydrogen rather than helium in dirigibles, and hydrogen is highly flammable, posing a significant safety risk. These factors combined made it extremely challenging to use the mooring mast for dirigible docking.
362	15195	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced were that their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. Al Smith, seeing a great opportunity, envisioned his Empire State Building as a solution. A mooring mast added to the top of the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers off and on. Dirigibles were docked by means of an electric winch, which hauled in a line from the front of the ship and then tied it securely to a mast. However, despite this innovative idea, there were still many challenges to overcome for successful dirigible docking.
363	15196	6	3	"The main obstacle in allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State building's Mooring Mast was safety. ""Most dirigibles... used hydrogen... and hydrogen is highly flammable."" The Hindenburg disaster was a stark reminder of this danger. ""The owners... realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above downtown New York."" If an accident were to happen with a dirigible, it would be putting hundreds of people's lives at risk, including those on the ground and in the building. That is why this idea was unpractical and unsafe. Another obstacle in allowing dirigibles to moor at the Empire State Building's mast was nature itself. ""The winds on top were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" These unpredictable winds would cause the back of the ship to swivel around the mast. Lead weights could be used to try to stabilize the dirigible, but that was neither practical nor safe as they would be dangling high above pedestrians, posing a potential hazard. In conclusion, the combination of safety risks and natural challenges made dirigible docking at the Empire State Building's mooring mast an unfeasible concept."
364	15197	6	3	"In the excerpt, The Mooring Mast by [Organization Name], the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were significant. One obstacle was that dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium. This was a major problem because as it says in paragraph [Number], line four, ""hydrogen is highly flammable."" A single spark could lead to a catastrophic explosion. The greatest obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock was nature itself. Nature itself would be an obstacle because ""dirigibles moored in open fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using them at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe."" Pedestrians below would be at risk of being hit by falling weights. These were some of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, making the idea ultimately unworkable."
365	15198	6	3	Based on the excerpt, the builders faced many obstacles trying to attempt dirigibles to be allowed to dock on the Empire State building. The builders faced obstacles like the lack of land area in New York as said in [Document Name] 6. In [Document Name] [Number], it says that a big problem they faced was that they could not just land right on the flat roof. Some other problems they faced in this [Document Name] were that the cable at the top of the building added stress to the building eleven hundred feet below the building, and some of this work cost over sixty thousand dollars. Problems with safety included the lead weight dangling high above pedestrians on the street, which was neither practical nor safe. And another unsafe thing is in [Document Name] [Number], they said that hydrogen in these dirigibles was highly flammable, which is very unsafe. In [Paragraph Number], it says that there was an existing law against flying airships above urban areas. All these factors combined made it extremely difficult for the builders to achieve their goal of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
366	15199	6	3	"The Empire State Building was truly an incredible building even without the ambitious idea of attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. However, with the addition of this mooring mast concept, it brought up numerous obstacles, particularly regarding the safety of the public. L¸sted states ""Most dirigibles outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) This statement clearly proves that if a dirigible were to catch fire, similar to the tragic accident in Lakehurst, New Jersey, then the lives of the citizens of New York would be at great stake. This significant safety hazard is one of the major problems faced by the builders. These architects faced many challenges with this mooring mast idea, including the dangerous factor of nature. L¸sted states ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This is extremely dangerous because the dirigibles start to move erratically around the building while docked, causing hazardous maneuvers and putting pedestrians' lives at risk. Considering all these factors, for this mooring idea, it is simply too dangerous for the public and the city of New York, ultimately making it an unfeasible concept."
367	15200	6	3	In the process of building the dock for dirigibles, builders faced several notable obstacles. The first obstacle builders faced was the lack of a suitable landing area. If there was no proper area to land, there was simply no valid reason or practical way to build the docking facility. Moreover, the builders would have to extensively remodel the whole building. After the building was framed up to the 85th floor, they couldn't build the mast until the roof was completely done, which further delayed the process and added to the complexity. The greatest obstacle the mast dealt with was nature itself. The winds on the tops of the buildings were constantly shifting due to the strong and unpredictable air currents, so there was no reliable way for a dirigible to land or stay in place without the risk of crashing. The final obstacle builders faced was a strict law against airships flying too low to the urban areas. This law made it illegal for a ship to ever tie up or even approach the building. As you can see, there were many insurmountable obstacles, and unfortunately, the mast wasn't useful. It was indeed a great idea in theory. But in my opinion, it was ultimately a waste of time and money, as the challenges were too significant to overcome.
368	15201	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were quite substantial. First, it was extremely windy at the top of the building, which made it incredibly hard for the dirigibles to precisely hook up to the docking gear. The strong and unpredictable winds would push and pull the dirigibles, making the docking process a highly challenging task. Another major obstacle was that the dirigibles were very flammable. Most dirigibles outside the U.S. used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is highly combustible. This meant they were a serious danger to the city if they were to catch on fire. A single spark could potentially lead to a catastrophic event, endangering the lives of the people in the surrounding area. One other reason was that there was an existing law that made it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. This legal restriction completely undermined the feasibility of the docking plan. Considering all these obstacles, it becomes clear that the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was fraught with difficulties and ultimately an unviable idea.
369	15202	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced several significant obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One prominent obstacle was safety. Outside the U.S, dirigibles were commonly using hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. This posed a huge risk as a single fire incident could have devastating consequences for the building and the surrounding city. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting because of the violent air currents. These unpredictable winds made it extremely difficult for dirigibles to land safely and stay in place once docked. One more obstacle was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The law clearly stated that it was illegal for a ship to approach or even be tied up to a building. All these obstacles combined made it nearly impossible to implement the plan of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, highlighting that it was an unfeasible idea despite the initial enthusiasm.
370	15203	6	3	"In the excerpt from ""the mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION1, the builders faced many significant obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State building. First, they risk having the dirigibles from places outside the U.S cause a fire. @ORGANIZATION1 states ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (@CAPS1. @NUM1). This would become a big and potentially catastrophic issue because they will run the risk of having other dirigibles pass through our highly - populated and dense airspace and cause a fire inadvertently. By building a loading dock, they are potentially harming the area of downtown New York, putting countless lives and properties at risk. Second, another obstacle that would get in the way of building the dock is nature. Builders say ""The wind on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (@CAPS1. @NUM2). Even if they attempt to tie down the dirigibles, there is a high chance that the dirigibles will move around uncontrollably. Given the idea that the winds would be too much to handle, they brought up alternatives like lead weights, but these weights would become a hazard for pedestrians walking below. Finally, there was a law that prevented any airships to fly too low. The article reads ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"" (@CAPS1. @NUM3). This law made it extremely hard for the builders to achieve their goal. The overall idea was to make the airship land on the building, and this obstacle made it an even bigger problem. The idea of a dock gradually vanished as it was simply too much of a risk to do it. Nevertheless, the excerpt by @ORGANIZATION1, ""The Mooring Mast"", effectively describes the numerous challenges put upon builders to build a dock, showing that the plan was ultimately unworkable due to these insurmountable obstacles."
371	15204	6	3	The obstacles of getting the dirigibles to be able to dock at the empire state building was, they couldn't put the fuel on top of the building. This was because the logistics of transporting and storing fuel up there were extremely complex. Putting a mooring mast on top of the roof would make it very unstable and put a lot of pressure on it. The structure of the building was not originally designed to bear such additional stress. For this to happen they had to modify the structure of the roof, which ended up costing over @MONEY1. After successfully building that they had another obstacle. It was trying to figure out how the dirigibles wouldn't move around with so much wind currents. The strong and unpredictable winds made it nearly impossible to keep the large dirigibles stationary. They never figured out how and the idea just disappeared as it became unfeasible.
372	15205	6	3	"From the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast,"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First, the designing as well as the cost of this project could encounter problems. Such as, ""add stress to the building's frame."" If the mass of the mooring setup and the dirigibles interfered with the frame of the building, then changing the material of the building could cost ""over sixty thousand dollars!"" This high - cost factor made the project economically challenging. In addition, safety was a major component when trying to construct the mooring mast. For example, ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen...and hydrogen is highly flammable."" New York is a very populated area, which means when building a mooring mast, safety must be considered into perspective. The risk of a hydrogen explosion in a densely populated city was a huge concern. Lastly, there were restrictions on airships flying too close to cities. As it states in the excerpt, ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" Overall, when constructing the mooring mast, many builders were blind to the potential problems, making the project ultimately unsuccessful."
373	15206	6	3	One of the obstacles they faced were the strong winds. Because of the violent air currents, the winds were constantly shifting in direction and intensity. The dirigible, being a large and lightweight structure, would constantly be moving around. They couldn't even weigh it down, because there would be people far below them, and the weights could fall and cause serious harm. A second obstacle they faced were the laws against it. There were existing laws about airships flying too low over the city. These laws were in place to ensure the safety of the urban population. It was illegal for the airships to even come into the city. Those two obstacles stopped them from using the dock for dirigibles, making the idea of dirigible docking at that location unworkable.
374	15207	6	3	"Based on the article ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced to allow dirigibles to dock there were, the strong wind currents, which were erratic and made it difficult to control the dirigibles. The fact that dirigibles were very flammable, especially when using hydrogen as a lifting gas, posed a significant safety risk. And that they were very large and hard to keep still. In paragraph @NUM1 it states that the use of hydrogen rather than helium should have stopped the project. The high flammability of hydrogen made any docking operation extremely dangerous. Also in paragraph @NUM2 it states that the biggest obstacle was nature itself. The unpredictable wind patterns were a major challenge. For the reasons above, those are some of the obstacles builders faced in attempting to have dirigibles dock there, and these challenges ultimately made the project very difficult to achieve."
375	15208	6	3	"During the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, builders faced many obstacles. One obstacle builders faced was the building's @CAPS1. ""A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the [Empire State Building] held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" The additional weight and forces exerted by the moored dirigible could potentially damage the building's structure. Another obstacle in the way was nature itself. The reason was that the winds on top of the Empire State Building were always changing because of violent air currents. This was dangerous because ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" @CAPS2, there is a law in the United States against airships flying too low over urban areas. This would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the [Empire State Building] or even approach the area. Many more obstacles were faced during the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State @CAPS3, but that didn't stop the workers from doing their job. Despite these challenges, they persevered in their efforts."
376	15209	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many formidable obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" (@NUM1) Specifically, the winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, and this erratic movement caused the dirigible's back to swivel around the mooring mast, making docking extremely difficult. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen... hydrogen is highly flammable."" (@NUM2) @CAPS1 Take the Hindenburg which blew up as a prime example. If a Blimp blew up over downtown New York, countless tons of lives would be lost, posing a huge risk to the mooring mast concept. ""Was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" (@NUM3) This strict law would prevent dirigibles from docking at the mooring mast legally. All of those significant obstacles contributed to the mooring mast being used only for show and contributing to the world's tallest building, ultimately dooming the docking idea."
377	15210	6	3	In the excerpt, the @CAPS1 were faced with multiple complex issues regarding their theory. It took a considerable amount of time for people to gradually begin realizing the harsh reality. For example, airships had a strict law preventing them from getting too low to urban areas, which was a major hindrance. Also, they realized that wind would play a negative role. The strong wind would cause the @CAPS2 to swing around wildly when docked. They initially thought to weigh down the rear of the ship, but soon realized that this was unsafe with so many people below. They had heard of a @CAPS2 in New Jersey that was destroyed by fire, due to its highly flammable hydrogen. This was also extremely unsafe in New York with such a large @ORGANIZATION1 population. Overall, they began to clearly realize the safety issues and how unpractical it was to carry out all of this, thus abandoning the idea.
378	15211	6	3	"The idea of allowing dirigibles to dock on top of the Empire State building was unrealistic because there was a severe lack of identification of possible flaws in this plan. As a relatively new form of transportation, dirigibles were far from safe. This was vividly proven true when the German dirigible, ""Hindenburg"", exploded in 1937, causing a great deal of destruction and loss. In addition, a more significant obstacle that was not adequately addressed when the plan was created was the problem with its location. In the crowded and bustling streets of New York City, suspending flammable dirigibles above a large population is inherently unsafe. This location is also an obstacle because of the equipment needed to land the dirigible: lead weights. The use of lead weights to weigh down the dirigibles is unimaginable with the numerous possible dangerous situations it could create, such as accidental drops. The creators of this idea solely designed this system on top of the Empire State building to incorporate a futuristic form of transportation to make the building more unique. The Empire State building builders encountered many insurmountable obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there because the concept was far past the capabilities of their age, and it was bound to fail."
379	15212	6	3	Some of the significant obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced are that dirigibles use hydrogen to float. Hydrogen is a highly flammable gas, and if it was ignited, it would cause a great deal of property damage, endangering nearby buildings and people. Also, at 1,250 ft above the ground, there is a lot of strong wind. The dirigible would blow around the building uncontrollably, causing unnatural stress to the building's structure. This stress could potentially lead to long - term damage to the building. It would be very difficult, if not impossible, to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, and these issues made the docking idea unfeasible.
380	15213	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. In designing the mast, the steel frame of the State Building would have to be thoroughly modified and strengthened to accommodate this new and challenging situation. @MONEY1' worth of detailed modifications were made to the building's framework. Rather than simply building a utilitarian mast without any ornamentation, the architects designed a shiny glass and chrome - nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from inside, with a stepped - back design that carefully imitated the overall shape of the building itself. However, the mooring mast failed. Most dirigibles from outside of the @ORGANIZATION2 used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable, posing a huge safety risk. Weather, such as violent air currents, were the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mast, making it impossible to achieve the desired docking functionality.
381	15214	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced were related to making the building suitable for dirigibles. The architects aimed to have the Empire State Building accommodate dirigibles, so they planned to place a thousand - foot dirigible at the top of the building, which would be held by a cable tether. However, the dirigible had to endure the wind pressure at about eleven hundred feet below. To handle this, the frame of the Empire State Building needed to be strong. In fact, it cost more than sixty thousand dollars for the modification to strengthen the building's framework. Facing these challenges, the architects changed the design and came up with something new. But overall, the difficult task of making the Empire State Building suitable for dirigibles presented a major obstacle for the architects. In the end, despite their efforts, these challenges proved to be quite daunting.
382	15215	6	3	"During the construction of the dirigible dock at the Empire State Building, architects and builders were confronted with numerous obstacles. Before the mooring mast was installed at the top of the building, it became clear that ""the stress of the dirigible's load... would have been transmitted all the way to the building's foundation"" (paragraph @NUM1). This indicated that substantial changes would need to be made in the framework to support the weight of the dirigible. In addition to the structural issue, safety, weather, and legal problems emerged. Since dirigibles were filled with flammable gas, there was always a high risk of a dirigible catching fire. In an urban area with a large population, the damage from such an accident would be extremely severe. The winds at the top of the building were also a significant danger. The air currents were ""violent"" and ""even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around"" (paragraph @NUM2). Usually, the ships would be weighted down, but this was not feasible in a city environment. The last major issue the builders faced was the law ""against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (paragraph @NUM3). Although the law was clearly stated, two dirigibles attempted to dock. Both attempts ended in failure, and it became evident that the Empire State Building would not be able to serve as a dirigible landing site, due to these insurmountable challenges."
383	15216	6	3	The builders of the Empire State building encountered many obstacles in enabling dirigibles to dock. For instance, the building had to be reframed because its initial frame was not capable of supporting the weight of a dirigible placed on top of it. This required significant structural modifications. Also, the materials inside dirigibles are highly flammable. In a highly populated urban area, an accident involving a dirigible could have been extremely costly and potentially fatal. Another major obstacle was the wind. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. As a result, the dirigible would be swiveling around and highly unstable. All these factors combined made the idea of docking dirigibles on top of the Empire State Building both impractical and unsafe. In conclusion, these obstacles effectively ruled out the possibility of using the building as a dirigible docking location.
384	15217	6	3	The dirigibles faced several problems when attempts were made to dock them at the Empire State Building. The first and obvious reason was that flying an airship that low over an urban area is against the law. Despite this legal restriction, they still attempted to dock, and in doing so, they encountered more problems, especially related to the winds. During the one time they tried to dock, they couldn't succeed because the winds were too strong. The strong and unpredictable winds made it nearly impossible to safely maneuver the dirigible into a docking position. In the end, these combined issues, the legal constraint and the wind problem, clearly showed that docking dirigibles at the building was not a viable option.
385	15218	6	3	The architects and builders of the Empire State Building ran into a few problems when searching for a way to allow dirigibles to dock there. The architects were well - aware that they couldn't simply place a mooring mast on the Empire State Building roof because the existing structure would not be able to support it. Moreover, they knew that if they attached the dirigible to the mooring mast with a single cable tether, it would only add excessive stress to the frame. To address this problem, the Empire State Building's steel frame would need to be carefully modified and strengthened. This was necessary to ensure that the frame could support both the mooring mast and the dirigible. In conclusion, these structural challenges were significant hurdles that the architects and builders had to overcome in their attempt to make the building suitable for dirigible docking.
386	15219	6	3	Based on the excerpt, dirigibles were never able to dock atop the Empire State Building because, primarily, it was a question of safety. The passage reads that most dirigibles from outside the United States are fueled with hydrogen, which is highly flammable. This characteristic caused the Hindenburg, a German - made vessel, to suddenly burst into flames in New Jersey. When this accident occurred, the owners of the Empire State Building quickly realized how much more catastrophic the situation could have been if it had happened in the densely populated New York City. Also, safety was a major concern because the strong winds on the top of the building would blow the dirigible erratically all around. Lastly, there is a law that strictly prohibits the flight of airships in low - altitude urban areas, so the dirigibles could not legally fly in New York City. In conclusion, these safety and legal factors effectively prevented dirigibles from docking at the Empire State Building.
387	15220	6	3	In the article, The Mooring Mast, by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the author elaborately talks about the numerous obstacles that the builders faced in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. The first significant obstacle they encountered was dropping the mast onto the building's flat roof. This task was far from easy because using a single cable to lower the mast would impose a great deal of stress on the building's frame. Another problem they had to deal with was nature. The violent winds at the top of the building would cause the dirigible to continuously swivel around the mast. The greatest obstacle centered around safety. Many blimps outside of the United States use highly flammable helium, rather than hydrogen. Helium makes the dirigibles much more likely to cause an explosion, thereby risking the lives of many people in New York. Lastly, existing laws in New York restrict the balloons from docking. Airships were flying dangerously close over urban areas. As detailed in the article, The Mooring Mast, by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, these were the many obstacles faced in the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
388	15221	6	3	The idea of dirigibles being able to dock at such a high altitude to begin with was extremely foolish. First off, trying to tie a thousand - foot dirigible to a building by a single tether would add an enormous amount of stress to the building's frame. Although they were able to come up with a solution to fix that problem, the main issue they couldn't overcome was mother nature. The wind speed at that height is incredibly strong and violent, and it would cause the ship to continuously swivel around and around the mooring mast. Overall, due to these insurmountable challenges, the project was just doomed to fail from the very start.
389	15222	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced a multitude of significant obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One major problem was nature itself. According to the text, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" These ever - changing winds would make it extremely difficult for the dirigible to get close enough to the mooring mast to get tied up. Even after it is tied up, the persistent wind would cause it to keep moving around the mooring mast, making it completely impossible for passengers to exit safely. Another obstacle in the way of allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building is a pre - existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. In the text it clearly states, ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" This is a very straightforward and unyielding problem against allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. A final, and perhaps the greatest obstacle against allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building is safety. In the excerpt it states, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This creates serious safety hazards not only for the passengers and employees of the dirigible but also for the densely populated area below, which is downtown New York. In conclusion, these multiple obstacles made it nearly impossible for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building."
390	15223	6	3	"In The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, it describes in detail many of the obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. It was already a challenging task for the builders to construct the Empire State Building, but on top of that, they had to build a mooring mast at the very top. Four - term governor of New York Al Smith put it very aptly, ""One set of engineers here in New York is trying to figure out a practical, workable arrangement and the Government people in Washington are figuring out some safe way of mooring airships to this mast."" Another major obstacle the builders faced was that having a thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held only by a single cable tether, was simply not a safe arrangement. Given this, the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be extensively modified and significantly strengthened, which would cost over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications. No matter how skillfully the builders constructed the Empire State Building, they still had to confront nature as an insurmountable obstacle. These are the clear examples of the obstacles the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there."
391	15224	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, there were indeed numerous obstacles in the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. Some of these significant obstacles include poor designing, the forces of nature, and the lack of a proper landing area. Due to the sub - optimal designing by Al Smith, the Age of Dirigibles faced a major concern regarding where to land these dirigibles. Nature itself emerged as a substantial obstacle. As described, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" These erratic winds made it extremely difficult for the dirigibles to land safely. The last hindrance was the dearth of a sufficient landing area for these enormous balloons. Once Al Smith saw the opportunity to land the dirigibles on the Empire State Building, he took it, but unfortunately, the multiple obstacles made the endeavor a challenging one. Ultimately, these obstacles combined to make the dream of regular dirigible docking on the Empire State Building unfeasible."
392	15225	6	3	"Allowing a dirigible to dock upon the top of the Empire State Building would leave architects faced with highly challenging scenarios. Adding a thousand - foot dirigible onto the top of the building would place additional stress on the building's frame. A single cable tethered to the blimp would not alleviate this stress. As stated, ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" (L¸sted. @NUM1) This indicates that the frame of the Building would have to be carefully modified to accommodate this new and demanding situation. The greatest reason why the docking system was never fully constructed was safety. Most dirigibles outside the U.S used hydrogen rather than helium. ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire... The owners realized how much worse it would have been if the incident had taken place above a densely populated area."" (L¸sted. @NUM2). This realization made travel outside the @LOCATION1 with dirigibles more difficult. Nature itself was a great obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast. The back of the ship would swivel around and around the mast because of the winds. ""The winds on top of the building shift due to violent air currents."" (L¸sted, @NUM3). This situation was neither practical nor safe. These obstacles left builders faced with unrealized challenges that were difficult to overcome, thus preventing the full - scale implementation of the dirigible docking system."
393	15226	6	3	"Builders of the Empire State Building faced many significant obstacles when trying to dock dirigibles. One major obstacle in docking dirigibles was the framework of the building. As evidence shows, ""Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" This clearly demonstrates the substantial amount of work that needed to be done just on the structure of the building. Another hardship was that most dirigibles outside of the United States were filled with highly flammable hydrogen rather than helium. ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse the accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area."" This incident highlighted how dangerous the hydrogen could be. Lastly, dirigibles could be weighed down by lead weights. ""Using these at the Empire State Building, with them dangling over pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe."" It was evident that if the lead weights dropped, they could cause fatalities. Many hardships were brought about when trying to dock dirigibles at the Empire State Building, making the entire project a very difficult one to execute."
394	15227	6	3	And the builders of the Empire State building faced numerous complex challenges in order to add the mast to the building. They needed to consult with experienced experts and learn in - depth about how dirigibles themselves worked. It took a collaborative effort between engineers in New York and government workers all the way in Washington to piece together a comprehensive plan on how to make it work. Just adding the mast would not be sufficient. Keeping it tethered by one cable would add an enormous amount of stress to the framework, so all of the steel frame needed to be carefully strengthened. Making the mast visually appealing also took valuable resources. Ultimately though, all the well - thought - out plans fell through. Nature had been the biggest problem. When the air currents were violent up in the air around the mast, it would cause the blimp to swing around dangerously. Had a ship crashed, hundreds of people in the urban New York would be at risk of being crushed. The project had to be scrapped, with the mast eventually becoming a purely decorative addition, a reminder of an ambitious but unachievable plan.
395	15228	6	3	"There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. According to the author, ""... was destined to never fulfill its purpose [Empire State building being a dock for dirigibles], for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed."" As the author clearly points out, there were many problems with this idea. The main reasons were safety, strong winds, and laws prohibiting this to happen. The safety issue was that the dirigibles used hydrogen which was highly flammable. In fact, the Hindenburg was destroyed by a fire. If a dirigible burst into flames while near the Empire State Building, it would pose a great threat to the many people in the city around the building. Strong winds were another major problem because the Empire State Building is so high, the winds at the mooring station would be both violent and unpredictable. This would make it arduous to land at the mooring station, and if the dirigible successfully did attach, the back end of the dirigible would be buffeted around by the wind. The final problem was that there was a law forbidding aircraft to be within a certain distance from a city. This law was put in place to prevent aircraft from crashing into the city. With all of these problems, it is crystal - clear that this plan could never have worked effectively, and the idea of regular dirigible docking at the Empire State Building had to be abandoned."
396	15229	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many challenges in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One problem was that putting the mast on the Empire State Building and then having a giant dirigible moor onto it would cause significant stress on the building. This stress could pull the mast right off, and if the mast detached, it would weigh the dirigible down, potentially crashing into people and buildings below, causing death and destruction. Another obstacle was timing the construction right. They didn't want the mast to be completed when the whole building was only on floor 30 out of 102. Considering these issues, it became clear that the plan to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was fraught with difficulties that were hard to overcome.
397	15230	6	3	Not everyone can invent new ways of transportation for the future. Al Smith learned that the hard way when he hired a team of experienced builders to install landing docks for dirigibles on the Empire State Building. The team ran into numerous unexpected obstacles that caused persistent problems and derailed their progress. One problem that arose was that the weight of the dirigible would add substantial stress to the building's frame, which was only reinforced by steel. Another issue was safety. Dirigibles from outside the United States ran on hydrogen instead of helium, which is highly flammable, posing a serious risk of explosion. The most important problem was nature. Wind made maneuvering the large dirigibles extremely difficult, and violent air currents could be potentially fatal to passengers and pedestrians on the ground. They also cannot fly too close to the ground in urban, populated areas. Although the idea of the Empire State Building being used as an airdock was innovative, it was not practical or well - thought - out, and thus had to be abandoned.
398	15231	6	3	"One obstacle that the builders faced when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was ""the lack of a suitable landing area."" New York City is densely packed with buildings, and there is very little flat ground available to land a dirigible safely. The builders' second obstacle was that they couldn't find a viable way to get the mooring mast on top of the building. The builders would need to make a much stronger building frame so the mast could safely be placed on the top of the building without adding excessive stress to the frame. Another obstacle that the builders faced was nature. The wind at the top of the building was very unpredictable and strong at times. Even when the dirigible was tied to the building, the back of the dirigible would move violently due to the wind. The last reason was that there was a strict law that wouldn't allow the dirigibles to fly that low over an urban area. Given these multiple and insurmountable challenges, the dirigibles couldn't dock at the Empire State Building."
399	15232	6	3	"In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lusted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. For example, ""the stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" This describes the major problem that the builders would have to face if they installed the mast. With the load of the dirigible and the wind pressure, it would severely mess up the foundation of the building. So, the builders needed to find a practical way to ensure that the foundation of the Empire State Building remained intact. Another example is ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened."" This evidence explains that if the mast was to be placed, the builders would have to strengthen the entire building to prevent any problems with the mast. In conclusion, these obstacles made the task of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building a very challenging one."
400	15233	6	3	Based on the excerpt, The Mooring Mast, the building of the Empire State Building had many obstacles the builders had to overcome. Some practical obstacles in building this landmark were the law against airships flying low, the complete dirigible mooring equipment wasn't installed, and the greatest obstacle of all was the nature surrounding the Empire State Building. The first obstacle builders had to overcome is the strict law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The problem with flying too low is that the dirigibles couldn't even attempt to reach the building. In December 1930, one large dirigible approached the mast, but couldn't get close enough, fearing that the forceful winds would cause it to run into the sharp spires. As if that wasn't a problem, the dirigible mooring equipment wasn't even fully installed. This meant that the newspapers being delivered would have to be caught by dangling ropes from the dirigible, which could get extremely tiring for the crew. The greatest obstacle of all was nature. Winds at the top of the building were really strong due to the violent wind currents, which could cause the dirigible to keep moving erratically, even when tied up to the mast. Overall, the nature of the weather was the huge obstacle that made it almost impossible for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
401	15234	6	3	There were numerous obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building encountered when they aimed to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first and foremost obstacle was the safety of the people. The Empire State Building stands in the heart of densely - populated downtown New York. Most dirigibles outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above this densely populated area. This potential disaster would have been a major problem. Another significant obstacle was the violent air currents. The winds on top of the building are constantly shifting, and even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast, making landing extremely difficult and dangerous. Finally, it was illegal to fly airships too low over urban areas. This law made it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building, or even approach the area. These are just three of the many obstacles that ultimately prevented the builders of the Empire State Building from successfully docking dirigibles.
402	15235	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building, which is prominently located in the bustling and densely populated New York City, faced many obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. If a dirigible were to dangle high in the air above the numerous people in the city, it would surely pose a great safety risk. In addition to the safety aspect, nature presented one of the greatest challenges. The violent winds on top of the building are in a constant state of flux due to the ever - changing air currents. These shifting winds would cause the dirigibles to swivel around the mast, making landing and docking a perilous task. Lastly, there was a strict law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This legal restriction made it completely illegal for dirigibles to ever fly up to the building, let alone dock on it. In conclusion, these multiple obstacles effectively put an end to the idea of dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building.
403	15236	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building encountered a few significant obstacles while trying to build the mast for dirigible docking. One major problem was the substantial pressure and stress that would be exerted on the building if a dirigible were to dock there. This was due to the high wind speeds that are common in the area and the sheer massive size of the dirigible. To account for this pressure, the designers had to make over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications to the building's framework. Another obstacle was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law meant that the dirigibles would not be allowed to even get close to the building, let alone dock on it. Eventually, these obstacles, along with other safety issues such as the highly flammable hydrogen inside the blimp, led to the idea of dirigible docking at the Empire State Building fading away. In the end, these combined factors made the plan unfeasible.
404	15237	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in their attempt to dock dirgibles there. One of the major challenges they had to deal with was ensuring the building's structural integrity. They needed to figure out how to prevent the building from collapsing if they were to dock a 785 - foot dirigible on the top. To address this, they had to make about 60,000 dollars worth of changes to the building's frame to be able to dock a dirigible safely. Another significant obstacle was the safety of the densely populated area of downtown New York. As most dirgibles outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable, docking a dirigible at the top of the building without endangering the people below was a daunting task. The builders faced many difficulties in their attempt to dock a dirigible, but due to these and other insurmountable obstacles, it was ultimately impossible from a practical and safety perspective. In conclusion, these challenges made the dream of dirigible docking at the Empire State Building an unachievable one.
405	15238	6	3	The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building had to try and overcome were quite formidable. Firstly, there was the extra pressure on the frame of the building. A dirigible docking on the building would exert a large amount of force on its structure, which could potentially cause damage. Secondly, the docking process was extremely difficult. The high - speed winds on top of the building made it almost impossible to accurately position the dirigible for docking. These winds would push and pull the dirigible, making it hard to control. In conclusion, these combined challenges of extra pressure on the building's frame, the difficult docking process, and the high - speed winds made it effectively impossible for the builders to achieve their goal of docking dirigibles at the Empire State Building.
406	15239	6	3	Based on The Mooring Mast article, by @PERSON1, the builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous daunting obstacles in their ambitious attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. Their grand dream of putting New York on the forefront of modern travel through this unique docking facility, unfortunately, never was fulfilled. First, over sixty thousand dollars' worth of extensive modifications had to be made to the building's framework. This was due to the significant stress exerted by the dirigible's heavy load and the powerful wind pressure, which would add excessive stress to the frame. However, one of the greatest and most concerning obstacles the builders encountered was safety. Most dirigibles use hydrogen, a highly flammable gas that could pose a very dangerous threat, especially in highly populated areas such as New York. Also, the violent and unpredictable winds on top of the building made it nearly impossible to keep the dirigibles stable and prevent them from swiveling around the mast. Lead weights could be used to weigh down dirigibles that moored in the field, but this would be extremely unsafe when dangling from a building. Finally, the idea violated a strict law against airships flying too low over urban areas. All of these contributing obstacles the builders faced ultimately made their dream of using the mooring mast for dirigibles an unsuccessful venture.
407	15240	6	3	Some of the troubles that came into play for the builders while constructing the Empire State Building's mooring mast were related to the structure. They had to figure out how it would be built and how it could physically hold a blimp without being ripped out. One significant problem was determining how to reinforce the mast so that the load could be effectively transferred to the foundation instead of causing the top half of the building to be ripped off. After careful consideration and analysis, they realized that the task was far more complex than initially thought. The forces exerted by a moored blimp were substantial, and ensuring the mast's stability and the building's integrity was crucial. In the end, these challenges proved to be insurmountable, and the plan for a functional mooring mast was abandoned.
408	15241	6	3	"The concept of a docking mast for the Empire State Building met with failure because of a variety of compelling reasons. One of the major problems was that it was directly over the downtown area of New York City, which is extremely densely populated. After the tragic Hindenburg fire in New Jersey, ""the owners... realized how much worse the accident could have been if it had taken place over a densely populated area."" The second major obstacle was controlling a dirigible in the often violent and erratic winds at the top of the tower. It was the common practice at the time to control the back of the dirigible with lead weights, but over a civilian area this was ""neither practical nor safe."" Another important reason why the builders faced obstacles was the already existing law that strictly prohibited low - flying aircraft over cities. Despite the two dirigibles that approached the mooring mast, neither managed to allow passengers to disembark. The idea was ""quietly dropped"" as it should have been because there were simply too many insurmountable obstacles for it to succeed."
409	15242	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building attempted to create a mast where dirigibles could dock. At first, I thought it was a great and innovative idea, but then I realized there were significant obstacles. The first obstacle discovered was ""most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium"" (L¸sted). This was a serious issue because hydrogen is very flammable, and if it were to catch on fire in New York, thousands of innocent people would be hurt or killed. The greatest obstacle was the wind. The amount of wind changed constantly, and even if the dirigible was attached properly, the back would continue to move around, which would lead to great danger on the streets below. The dirigible would be dangling precariously over the pedestrians (L¸sted). One other reason was a legal one. It was illegal to fly a dirigible too low over urban areas, therefore the dirigible was not allowed to get low enough to land on the building. Two dirigibles tried and neither of them were successful. The constructors of the mooring mast were initially oblivious to these issues, but then realized them after some time. In conclusion, the Empire State Building could not be used to land dirigibles due to the fact that non - U.S dirigibles used Hydrogen, the current of the wind changes frequently, and it was illegal to fly the dirigible low enough to attach."
410	15243	6	3	"The architects of the mooring mast faced many problems when building the mast itself. One of the problems was that most dirigibles outside of the country use hydrogen, which was highly flammable, rather than helium to make the blimps buoyant. If one of those blimps ever caught fire like the German dirigible, the Hindenburg, in New Jersey, then it would put many innocent citizens in great jeopardy. This densely populated area of New York City would be much more hazardous than a rural area in New Jersey. The last problem they faced was the law that prohibited airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made ""it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" Since no foreign dirigible could dock and refuel there because of the type of gas keeping it afloat, while no domestic dirigible could dock and refuel because of the law prohibiting it, the idea of a mooring mast quickly diminished from the citizens' imaginations. They then looked to more practical and safer modern transportation options such as airplanes."
411	15244	6	3	"Besides the fact that docking dirigibles on a mooring mast on the Empire State Building would cost over @MONEY1 and add a significant amount of stress to the building's frame, Smith was determined to pursue his dream. Unfortunately, he couldn't make it happen. There are @NUM1 major reasons for this. In paragraph @NUM2, it clearly states that most dirigibles are extremely flammable. This is because they use hydrogen instead of helium, which is a much safer alternative. Just like the ill - fated German dirigible Hindenburg, which was completely destroyed in a massive fire in New Jersey. Paragraph @NUM2 also mentions that docking the dirigibles is simply dangerous. The strong wind would cause them to sway and move erratically all over, unlike when they are docked on the ground and weighed down. Lastly, it wasn't legal. Paragraph @NUM4 states that ""... an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas was another practical reason."" The dirigibles would not be at a high enough altitude to be legal, and it was extremely dangerous for the pedestrians below. Due to these insurmountable reasons, Smith's dream of docking dirigibles on the Empire State Building had to be abandoned."
412	15245	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building encountered significant obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. In paragraph @NUM1, it reveals an obstacle the builders faced. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" This is primarily because of the wind. The wind on the top of the building would shift unpredictably due to violent air currents. These air currents could change direction suddenly, making it extremely difficult to control the docking process of the dirigibles. As a result, the plan to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building faced a major setback, and it became clear that nature's forces were a formidable challenge that could not be easily overcome."
413	15246	6	3	In the Mooring Mast, by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building were confronted with numerous obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock on it. For a successful docking, a mooring mast was an essential requirement. However, one could not simply place a mooring mast on the Empire State Building because it would place additional stress on the building's frame. Moreover, the stress from the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would further exacerbate the situation, forcing the builders to make more modifications to the frame. These modifications would cost upwards of sixty thousand dollars. The mooring mast was not completed mainly due to safety concerns. After the tragic combustion of the Hindenburg, the owners of the Empire State Building realized the potential disaster that could occur if a similar incident happened in New York. Nature also posed a significant obstacle, with constantly changing violent air currents threatening to move the dirigible. Unlike in a field where a dirigible could be firmly anchored down, on the building, it was at the mercy of these strong winds. It was a risk that was simply not worth taking. Lastly, a law passed earlier prohibited dirigibles from even approaching buildings at such an elevation over urban areas. These multiple obstacles ultimately made it impossible for the builders of the Empire State Building to allow dirigibles to dock there.
414	15247	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many complex problems in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. When the passage states, ""could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building's flat roof,"" it implies that the architects would have to carefully modify and strengthen the building to accommodate a ""thousand - foot dirigible"" landing. Over @MONEY1 worth of changes had to be made for this purpose. Safety was another major problem. Dirigibles from other countries commonly used hydrogen instead of helium. Since hydrogen is highly flammable, downtown New York could have been devastated by a large fire if a dirigible caught fire there. Nature itself also presented a challenge. ""Winds on top of the building were constantly shifting."" This constant shifting would cause the dirigible to swivel around in an uncontrolled manner, which was extremely dangerous. In the end, the architects had to confront and grapple with these many problems, and it became clear that allowing dirigibles to dock was a very difficult task."
415	15248	6	3	The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were numerous. If they were to drop the mooring mast on the top of the building, they would have to strengthen the frame. This was necessary because of the wind pressure and the pressure from the single cable used for docking. Additionally, most dirigibles from out - of - state were highly flammable as they used hydrogen rather than helium. Another significant problem was that New York is a densely populated city. The builders did not want to take the risk of having something fall from the top of the building onto the citizens below. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature. The violent winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to the violent air currents. Even if they could manage to get the dirigibles tied down, the back part of the dirigible would still be flying around uncontrollably. They also considered using lead weights to hold it down, but if these weights fell, the pedestrians on the street would be in great danger. The last obstacle was a legal one. There was a law about airships flying too low over urban areas. All these obstacles combined made it nearly impossible for the builders to achieve their goal of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
416	15249	6	3	When the builders of the @ORGANIZATION2 took on the arduous task of constructing a mooring mast at the very top of the structure specifically for dirigibles to dock at, they were confronted with a multitude of obstacles that severely hampered their ability to execute their plan. One of the initial and significant obstacles they faced was the fact that they couldn't simply install a long mooring mast on the building's flat roof. The colossal dirigible, which would be held by just one cable tether, would impose an enormous amount of stress on the building's frame and foundation. In response to this, the builders made the decision to construct an even stronger frame for the building. The primary problem the builders encountered when trying to enable dirigibles to dock at the top of the structure revolved around safety issues. Dirigibles (aside from the @LOCATION1) predominantly used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is extremely flammable and significantly increases the risk of fire. Since the blimps would be hovering above thousands of pedestrians in the city, the risk of a blimp catching fire was far too high. On top of that, the winds at the top of the Empire State Building were constantly shifting due to the violent air currents, causing the blimp to swivel erratically around the mooring mast. Although Al Smith had a grand vision for docking blimps at the top of his building, the harsh reality was that it was an unrealistic idea, and the builders were faced with an insurmountable number of obstacles for it to ever work.
417	15250	6	3	"While the builders made earnest attempts to create a proper landing area for dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, they ran into a multitude of problems. Al @CAPS1's idea, although it sounded rather unrealistic, spurred them on with enough motivation that they were determined to make it happen. After a great deal of renovation work, countless ideas, and numerous efforts, they finally began to realize all the potential problems. As the construction progressed, all the problems became glaringly apparent. The main reason they never ended up using the dock was that they came to the realization that it could possibly catch fire, just like the tragic incident that had occurred in New Jersey. ""The owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area..."" Additionally, they issued warnings about the intense winds on top of the tower. They were deeply concerned that the winds would continuously blow the dirigible around without any way to effectively weigh it down. Another significant reason is that it is against the law to fly airships too low over urban areas. The builders faced a plethora of obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, and ultimately, these challenges proved insurmountable."
418	15251	6	3	The obstacles the builders faced were not only very dangerous but also highly unsafe. These obstacles were the deciding factor between their failure or success. One of the prominent problems was the presence of violent air currents. The passage clearly stated that the winds towards the very top of the building were constantly shifting, and they easily could have caused the dirigible to swivel uncontrollably. If such a situation were to occur, then they would never have been able to land the dirigible safely. The next major obstacle they faced was the issue of hovering over pedestrians. It simply was not a viable option once the safety of the pedestrians was put at risk. Moreover, it was also a law that airships were not allowed to fly that low over urban areas. This made it illegal for them to tie up to the building or even come anywhere close to the area. In conclusion, it was just far too dangerous to even attempt to allow dirigibles to dock at that location.
419	15252	6	3	"Many of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there were issues that really should have been carefully considered before the construction even began. At such a great height, there were whirlwind - related issues that could push the dirigible in completely undesired directions. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air current."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). After the tragic explosion of the Hindenburg, the concerns about the same kind of disaster happening again became a major safety worry. ""The owners of the Empire State building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" (@CAPS1 @NUM2 Line 6). Given these significant and foreseeable issues, it became clear that allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was fraught with difficulties and risks."
420	15253	6	3	"There were several substantial obstacles that effectively prevented dirigibles from docking at the Empire State Building. First and foremost, if a dirigible was ""moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add a considerable amount of stress to the building's frame."" The existing framework of the building was simply not strong enough to withstand this additional stress. But the most crucial reason was safety. It was well - known that most foreign dirigibles used ""hydrogen rather than helium"", which is highly flammable. In a populated place like New York, any incident involving a hydrogen - filled dirigible could have disastrous consequences. Also, the winds at the top of the building were causing the ship to swivel around uncontrollably, and lead couldn't be used to weigh it down for valid safety reasons. Finally, there was ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" which made it completely illegal for any dirigible to even approach the building closely. All of these reasons, combined together, contributed to the fact that docking dirigibles at the Empire State Building would come with an overwhelming number of insurmountable obstacles."
421	15254	6	3	Most dirigibles from outside of the U.S. commonly used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. When the German dirigible Hindenburg was tragically destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had occurred above a densely populated area such as downtown New York. This realization made them acutely aware of the potential risks associated with dirigibles in urban settings.
422	15255	6	3	From the story “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon Lusted, the builders faced huge problems when they tried to make the building accessible for dirigibles to land. One major factor was the strong winds at such a high altitude. “The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents,” which made the landing process extremely challenging. The builders not only had to think of a way for the ships to be secure and not sway around but also needed a way to support the weight of the dirigible because the building was already heavy. These are only some of the great problems the builders needed to deal with, highlighting the complexity of the project.
423	15256	6	3	After reading the excerpt from “The Mooring Mast” by a particular organization, it is easy to see that this project faces numerous obstacles to overcome. The builders of the Empire State Building have a lot on their plate in order to allow dirigibles to dock there. For example, the builders have to carefully modify and strengthen the steel frame of the building and also construct a mast to which dirigibles could dock. If there was to be “A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether,...” it would add an enormous amount of stress to the entire building. This is why the steel frame of the Empire State Building has to be strengthened, and “Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework.” The builders of the Empire State Building also have to construct a mast for the dirigibles. In the end, “...the architects who designed a shiny glass and chrome - nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from the inside, with a step - back design that imitated the overall shape of the building itself.” This idea of adding a mast for dirigibles to the Empire State Building creates much work for the builders. This excerpt from “The Mooring Mast” by the organization easily illustrates the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building have to overcome. From modifying the frame to constructing the mast, these builders surely have a greatly increased workload, which shows the complexity of the project.
424	15257	6	3	Many things went wrong while trying to allow dirigibles to dock on top of the Empire State Building. First, allowing a dirigible to dock on top of the Empire State Building “would add stress to the building's frame,” as noted by a reference. These dirigibles are highly flammable, and being over a very populated place like New York City could be extremely dangerous. The winds at the top of the building were “constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast,” according to another reference. If lead weights were used, they could fall from the dirigible and kill civilians. The biggest obstacle was that there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This seemed to be a good idea on paper but when actually attempted, it was too unrealistic, making the project unfeasible.
425	15258	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The one significant obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. To solve this problem, Al Smith came up with the idea of building a mooring mast. This mooring mast would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours to refuel, which was a potential solution to the landing issue. However, the overall project still had many challenges to overcome despite this initial step.
426	15259	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced various obstacles and challenges in allowing dirigibles to dock there, including how to attach the mast and how to move people between the dirigible and the building. In order to attach the mast where the dirigibles would land, the builders could not simply fasten it with the cable tether to the top of the building. This would ""add stress to the building's frame"" with the combined pressure of the dirigibles' load and the wind pressure. Therefore, the builders had to get the pressure down into the ground by strengthening and altering the building's steel frame. Another obstacle the builders faced was the challenge of transporting people and luggage from the building to a dirigible floating in the air. The dirigibles would only be tethered by their front ends, but the gondola, where the passengers rode, was located underneath the dirigible. This meant the construction of ""a gangplank to an open observation platform"" from which the people and luggage had to be moved 86 floors by a special elevator. Although the builders of the Empire State Building faced various obstacles in building the mast, the one they really should have considered was the danger and impracticalness of docking dirigibles 102 stories over New York City. In the end, these numerous challenges made the idea of regular dirigible docking at the Empire State Building unfeasible."
427	15260	6	3	There are many problems the dirigibles had with docking. One significant problem was the lack of suitable landing space. A limited area made it difficult for dirigibles to maneuver and position themselves properly for docking. There was also the problem of winds. The wind would cause a major problem regarding whether they could dock. The wind could cause the dirigible to spin around the building, which could lead to injuries to people on board the dirigible or damage to the dirigible itself. If it was swung around and hit the building, it could cause structural damage to the building. Moreover, the dirigible could also explode into flames if a spark was caused from it hitting the building. It could end up like the Hindenburg, a tragic example of a dirigible disaster. Given these multiple and serious problems, it is clear that docking dirigibles was fraught with difficulties and risks.
428	15261	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. By building a mooring mast, they had to make changes to the existing plans for the building's skeleton. ""The steel frame of the building had been modified and strengthened"" in order for the mast to fit properly and remain stable and safe. This involved careful engineering and additional construction work to ensure the mast could withstand the forces exerted by the dirigibles. Another obstacle faced by the builders was creating a design that would allow dirigibles to dock on the mast. They were to tie the front of the aircraft to the building, however this didn't work out, because, as the author states, ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" This constant movement made it extremely difficult to achieve a secure and safe docking. All in all, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempt to let dirigibles dock there, and these challenges ultimately made the concept of regular dirigible docking at the building unworkable."
429	15262	6	3	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles (Blimps) to dock there was that there were way too many risks that were being taken to make this mast and it was just too dangerous. I think that the mast opposed too many risks because for one it would be flying too low, which increased the chances of collisions with other objects or structures. Secondly, if it caught on fire or was hit by lightning it would explode and people would get seriously hurt. OR the mast could snap off! As Mr. Clavan said, ""The as yet unsolved problems of mooring air ships to a fixed mast at such a height made it desirable to postpone to a later date the final installation of the landing gear."" What Mr. Clavan means is that the fact that there are so many problems with mooring air ships to this ""mast"" that it just isn't safe to go through with right now. In conclusion, the high - risk nature of the project made it an unwise choice at that time."
430	15263	6	3	Al Smith faced some obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles dock on the mast on top of the Empire State building. The first problem him and the architects faced was they couldn't just put the mast on top of the building's flat roof. The mast would add stress to the building's frame. Also, the dirigibles' load and the wind would add additional stress, potentially compromising the structural integrity of the building. Another reason was safety. Most dirigibles used Hydrogen which was highly flammable. A small spark could lead to a catastrophic explosion. Also, the winds at the top of the building had violent currents. The winds were always shifting which would cause the back of the ship to move erratically, making docking extremely difficult and dangerous. Lastly, the dirigibles couldn't fly near the building because there was a law against aircraft flying too low over urban areas which made it illegal for dirigibles to tie to the mast anyways. Considering all these obstacles, it was clear that allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was not a practical or viable option.
431	15264	6	3	"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"", by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there. First, the expectations of the project were highly unrealistic because there ""was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" Even if they managed to find a completely safe way to land dirigibles, they would still be breaking the law. Second, there were ""violent air currents."" When they attempted to dock the dirigible on the building, it simply could not get close enough to it to land due to the strong wind. Lastly, it was a huge safety hazard. Most dirigibles ""used hydrogen rather than helium,"" and hydrogen is extremely flammable. In a densely - populated area like New York City, ""the owners of the Empire State Building realized how [bad an] accident could have been. As a result, dirigibles never fulfilled the expectations of being the transportation of the future and they did not dock on the Empire State Building, leaving the idea as an unfulfilled dream."
432	15265	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced significant obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. They had to come up with a way for a mooring mast to land on the Building's roof, as a thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable can add a great deal of stress to the building's frame. The Building's frame would have to be thoroughly modified and strengthened to accommodate such a situation. That wasn't the only obstacle; money was one of the problems as well. ""Over sixty thousand dollar's worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" That's a substantial amount of money that is being used just for the frame of a building. Safety was an even greater obstacle. ""The greatest reason was one of safety. Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" I firmly believe safety was the most significant obstacle they had, because what if a hydrogen dirigible was to blow up on top of the Empire Building? One has to think of all the people that could get hurt. They don't call New York the city that never sleeps because people stay up at night in their houses. They call it the city that never sleeps because it's always bustling, there are always people on the streets, and downtown New York is always full of people. Considering all these factors, the plan to dock dirigibles at the Empire State Building was fraught with insurmountable challenges."
433	15266	6	3	"When building the Empire State Building, the builders had to overcome many obstacles. One obstacle, for example, was a lack of a suitable landing area. The dirigibles were extremely large, some spanning @NUM1 feet. Therefore, in a city filled with buildings, there were very few suitable areas to land these massive airships. Another obstacle they had to overcome was the fact that the city did not allow the dirigibles to be that close to rural areas. Although these reasons are plenty enough, the article mentions that perhaps the greatest obstacle was nature itself. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (pg. @NUM2 - paragraph @NUM3). The ever - changing and powerful winds made it almost impossible to safely land a dirigible. All in all, the idea to land dirigibles in this place was far too unrealistic, and it became clear that this concept could not be turned into a practical reality."
434	15267	6	3	The plan to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building encountered problems from its very introduction until its ultimate conclusion. The first problem stemmed from the original design of the building. The original design did not include a dirigible docking station. When plans for the station were introduced, it was quickly realized that the building was not strong enough to carry the heavy load of a spire and a dirigible. To adjust, an additional @MONEY1 were spent meticulously to ensure the building would be structurally sound during a dirigible docking. The next problem became extremely evident after the Hindenburg's fire: any hydrogen - filled dirigible that caught fire at the Empire State Building would cause significant damage. Moreover, because many dirigibles used hydrogen, the safety risk was alarmingly significant. Wind proved to be yet another obstacle. The force of a dirigible being blown around by heavy winds could prove to be far too much for the structure of the building. Moreover, because any dirigible docking at the building would be one thousand feet off the ground, there was no practical way to anchor the dirigibles securely. The fact that many tall spires lined the @LOCATION1 skyline presented an imminent danger to any dirigible trying to dock. Finally, one of the most significant problems of building a dirigible docking station was the fact that the law strictly prohibited low - flying aircraft in urban areas. With all these problems combined, the plan to dock dirigibles at the Empire State Building was doomed to fail.
435	15268	6	3	The problems that the Building had to face were so complex that they could not solve the issue of mooring airships to a fixed mast at such a great height. The strong winds, the structural stress on the building, and the difficulty of ensuring a safe landing all contributed to this unsolvable problem. This made it highly desirable to postpone to a later date the installation of the landing gear. As of now, the idea of mooring airships at that height on the building remains on hold, awaiting a time when technology and solutions can overcome these seemingly insurmountable challenges.
436	15269	6	3	The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced when attempting to make the dock for dirigibles were quite challenging. The architects designed a shiny glass and chrome - nickel stainless steel tower. They knew they would have to make the Empire State Building strong enough to withstand the wind blowing around up on top. The wind at such a great height could exert significant force on both the building and any dirigibles attempting to dock. In the long run, they would have to face the law. These are the various obstacles that the builders had to face, which ultimately made the realization of a functional dirigible dock a difficult task.
437	15270	6	3	"The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced were numerous. They had planned for dirigibles to tie to the mast, but this was not possible. Due to the extremely high height of the building, dirigibles would not be able to maintain stability while unloading. For example, in paragraph @NUM1 it says ""the Goodyear blimp Columbia attempted a publicity stunt where it would tie up and deliver a bundle of newspapers"". ""Because the complete dirigible mooring equipment had never been installed, a worker atop the mooring mast would have to catch the bundle of newspapers on a rope dangling from the blimp"". Other obstacles were that dirigibles outside the United States had hydrogen in them instead of helium, and hydrogen was very flammable. This flammability posed a great risk, especially in an urban area like New York. All these factors combined made it very difficult for the builders to achieve their goal of a working dirigible dock at the Empire State Building."
438	15271	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were two practical obstacles. Nature itself presented a major challenge. Even if the dirigible was tethered up to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast due to the strong and unpredictable winds at that height. Another thing was that it was illegal for airships to fly too low over urban areas. This law was in place to ensure the safety of the people below. Although two dirigibles attempted but failed, by the late 1930s, the idea of using the mooring mast for dirigibles and their passengers had quietly disappeared as the difficulties proved insurmountable.
439	15272	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first problem was the stress on the building's frame. The building required over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications to fix this issue. The additional weight and forces exerted by a moored dirigible could potentially damage the structure. Also, the back end of the dirigible would swing freely in the strong wind. Usually, this is fixed by attaching a lead weight to the back in the fields where they usually land, but dangling that over a city is extremely dangerous as it could fall and harm people or property. Another problem is the law stating no aircraft can fly too low over urban areas. This law is to protect the safety of the urban population. Finally, dirigibles never caught on. So, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in their attempt to make a dirigible docking station, and these obstacles ultimately led to the failure of this ambitious plan.
440	15273	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First of all, the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add significant stress to the building's frame. To prevent this, the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. This modification work would be complex and costly. Secondly, most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. The owners realized that if one of the hydrogen dirigibles were to catch fire just like the Hindenburg did in Lakehurst, New Jersey, the accident could be much worse if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York. The potential for a large - scale disaster was a major concern. The greatest obstacle that the builders were faced with was violent air currents while the dirigible was tethered. The back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast due to winds. Using lead weights to weight the back down, where they would be dangling above pedestrians, would neither be practical nor safe. The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed, and these issues made the idea of a successful dirigible dock unfeasible.
441	15274	6	3	By attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, the builders faced numerous challenges. One of the major obstacles they encountered was the necessary re - designing of the building. A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would impose significant stress on the building's frame. This meant that they had to make structural modifications, which cost over @MONEY1. Another hurdle was that most of the dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is extremely flammable, posing a high - risk fire hazard. And the greatest obstacle that the builders had to deal with was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible managed to get parked, the strong winds would shake its tail too much, making it an unsafe situation. Given these many difficulties, it was clear that the plan to dock dirigibles on the Empire State Building was fraught with problems.
442	15275	6	3	Based on this excerpt, the architects had to overcome a multitude of obstacles in order to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. First, they had to completely redesign the building's frameworks because the substantial weight of the dirigible would add excessive stress to it. After that, they added two more floors to the very top of the building. These additional floors were intended to serve as the boarding area for the passengers. Two months after they finally reframed the building, they proudly put the American flag at the top of the mooring mast. However, soon after, they came to the realization that proceeding with these designs was a foolish decision because it was both unsafe and not practical. These are the significant obstacles that the architects had to go through in order to attempt to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building, ultimately showing that the plan was flawed from the start.
443	15276	6	3	"There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced. One of the most prominent obstacles was when trying to dock dirigibles on top of the building. Since the building was so incredibly tall, there were extremely harsh winds that made it nearly impossible for the dirigibles to be properly controlled. When the Los Angeles tried to dock there, it simply couldn't. As stated, ""[it] could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds."" Also, the @CAPS1 could not even take his hands off the control levers because if he did, the dirigible might bump into other nearby buildings. Another obstacle they faced was that New York was a densely populated city and the mooring mast was surrounded by other structures. If a dirigible caught on fire like the Hindenburg, it could turn into a huge disaster. As one can imagine, ""... how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area."" The third huge obstacle they faced was that there was an actual law against anything flying that low in cities. There was, ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This meant that the dirigibles couldn't even get close enough to tie up since they were not allowed to fly down to the mooring mast. Since there were so many apparent obstacles and flaws in the plan, the builders should've recognized them before and never built the mooring mast above the Empire State Building, as it was a clearly unfeasible idea."
444	15277	6	3	"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast,"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders faced a series of problems in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One main problem was that, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This could turn into a serious catastrophe if the dirigible burst into flames and fire rained down on, ""a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" Another significant obstacle to the creation of the mooring mast was the wind. The winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. To counter this, the dirigibles would have to be weighted down with lead weights, which would dangle high above pedestrians on the street. This was neither practical nor safe because the weights could fall and cause harm to people below. The final major obstacle for building a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building was an existing law. There was, ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. Since there were so many obvious problems, the builders of the mooring mast should have noticed these issues before construction and not gone ahead with the project."
445	15278	6	3	The builders faced numerous obstacles in trying to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. One significant problem is that docking a dirigible to the roof would add an overwhelming amount of stress on the building's frame. This stress could potentially compromise the structural integrity of the entire building. Another major concern was having all the flammable gases above a highly populated area. A single spark could lead to a disastrous fire that would endanger countless lives. Also, there was already a well - established law that prohibited dirigibles from flying low over urban areas. This law made it impossible for the dirigibles to get close enough to the mooring mast. Lastly, the wind constantly changing direction would make the ship extremely unstable. The erratic winds could cause the dirigible to sway uncontrollably, increasing the risk of collisions. Considering all these obstacles, it was evident that the plan to dock dirigibles on the Empire State Building was not a viable one.
446	15279	6	3	In the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered numerous obstacles when attempting to enable dirigibles to dock there. Al Smith recognized an opportunity by adding a mooring mast to the building's top, allowing dirigibles to anchor for several hours for refueling or servicing and to facilitate passenger boarding and disembarking. To implement this idea, the architects and engineers of the Empire State Building had to consult with experts. They took tours of the equipment and mooring operations at the U.S. Naval Air Station. Additionally, the architects met with the president of a recently established airship transport company that planned to offer dirigible service across the Pacific Ocean. As evident, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many challenges to make dirigible docking possible, yet their efforts demonstrated their innovative thinking and determination to explore new possibilities in air transportation.
447	15280	6	3	"The endeavor of the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was an arduous task that involved a great deal of work. They had to allocate a substantial amount of money, and it was far from an easy job. They spent over sixty thousand dollars solely on modifications. I am aware of this because in paragraph @NUM1, it stated that ""over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the building framework."" Evidently, they also spent a significant sum on the mooring mast. Moreover, making everything function properly was no simple feat. There were numerous aspects they had to worry about, such as safety issues. I know it was a difficult task because in paragraph @NUM1, it also mentioned that ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on the top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" Clearly, they struggled to make the mooring mast work effectively. In conclusion, the challenges they faced in this project were substantial, highlighting the complexity of the task at hand."
448	15281	6	3	While attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, the workers confronted a multitude of obstacles. One prominent obstacle was safety. When the dirigible, or zeppelin, was docked, its body would sway in the breeze. This raised concerns about the safety of passengers boarding and disembarking. Additionally, there was no safe method to weigh the dirigible down, unlike when it lands in a field. Any weights used would be suspended over pedestrians, posing a significant risk. Another obstacle was the law that prohibited airships from flying low over urban areas. This law made it illegal for dirigibles to dock or approach the area. The most significant obstacle, however, was nature itself. There are extremely strong and violent winds at the top of the Empire State Building, which would cause the dirigible to sway violently. Due to these numerous and complex obstacles, docking at the Empire State Building was simply too complicated, and the idea could not be successfully realized.
449	15282	6	3	"In some cases, the builders of the Empire State Building faced various obstacles, with safety being a primary concern. As mentioned in the reading, ""The greatest reason was one of safety: dirigibles outside @LOCATION1 used hydrogen, which is highly flammable."" If a dirigible were to catch fire on top of the building, it could cause extensive damage. Another reason is the existence of ""laws against airships flying too low over urban areas."" Since the Empire State Building is located in the heart of downtown, any mishap involving dirigibles could endanger a large number of people. Additionally, nature posed a significant challenge. The author noted that ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This put the dirigibles at risk of colliding with the building or other structures. Lastly, ""the complete dirigible mooring equipment had never been installed."" Even if the legal and safety issues were resolved, there would be no means to land a dirigible as they lacked the necessary landing equipment. These obstacles arose because they failed to thoroughly review their plan. In summary, these multiple obstacles combined to make the goal of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building unachievable."
450	15283	6	3	The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building (@ORGANIZATION1) faced when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were related to the weather and the building frame. The primary obstacle was the wind. The winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. A sudden and powerful gust of wind could potentially blow building materials or even workers off the building, posing a serious threat to both the construction process and the safety of the workers. A second obstacle was the building frame. The dirigible was so large that when held by a single cable at the top of the building, it would add excessive stress to the frame, making the building unstable. These two examples illustrate the significant challenges the builders of the Empire State Building faced in their attempt to enable dirigible docking. Despite these difficulties, their efforts reflected their ambition to pioneer new concepts in air - building integration, but ultimately, these obstacles had to be carefully considered and addressed for any such plan to succeed.
451	15284	6	3	The mooring mast was a failure right from the very start. The builders and architects were shortsightedly not looking at the practical problems that would inevitably be present but only fixated on how to build the most grandiose structure. The first main problem the building workers encountered when attempting to allow these dirigibles to land was the daunting task of actually constructing a mast atop the highest building in the world. Then came the necessary and complex modifications needed to enhance the building's framework to support the zeppelin's weight, which would put significant stress on the building after being buffeted around by winds 1,250 ft above the ground. Perhaps the most crucial aspect of bringing these large zeppelins over heavily crowded areas was safety. The safety of pedestrians below would have been almost non - existent had the idea been carried out. For example, some of those zeppelins used hydrogen to stay aloft, and if a hydrogen - filled blimp combusted over a city, it's clear that people below would be severely harmed. This project seems to present far too many insurmountable obstacles for these architects to overcome just for docking a single blimp, making it an unfeasible endeavor from the get - go.
452	15285	6	3	"The Mooring Mast, as described by @ORGANIZATION2, details the numerous obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. At that time, the Empire State Building was in a fierce competition with the Chrysler Building to be the tallest building. Al Smith, the governor at that moment, being the governor of New York and not wanting to be outdone, decided to add more floors to the building and develop it into a dirigible dock. As time advanced, the building ran into even more problems. Tying a thousand - foot dirigible to the building would add an enormous amount of stress to the frame. As stated, ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" The frame around the building simply wasn't durable enough to hold a ""blimp."" In fact, the building would likely collapse, taking other nearby buildings down with it. Sixty - thousand dollars were invested in refining the frame, but in the end, the building still failed to meet the requirements. After the frame was made stable enough, more issues arose. ""The greatest reason was one of safety. Dirigibles used hydrogen, meaning it's flammable."" Not only did the safety of people oppose the plan, but the law also did. ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not dock at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" Once Al Smith realized that even the law forbade this, all the plans that had been put into action stopped, and the Empire State Building remained as it was, unable to serve as a dirigible dock."
453	15286	6	3	"When the Empire State Building was initially created, it was envisioned to be a ""pit stop"" for dirigibles, which are known today as blimps. It was supposed to represent the modern way of travel, but unfortunately, many significant problems emerged, completely changing the original plans. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This was a major safety hazard as any small spark could lead to a catastrophic explosion. Another problem presented itself in the form of ""[A] law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" If anything were to go wrong with the ship, such as a malfunction or an accident, many people in the urban area below would be put in extreme danger. The harsh wind conditions that nature provided also posed a great risk. The strong winds could potentially puncture the blimp against the buildings, endangering not only the passengers on the blimp but also the people below it. Due to these multiple and serious problems, the idea of the Empire State Building being a dirigible pit - stop had to be abandoned."
454	15287	6	3	"The obstacles builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building were safety, nature, and U.S. law. Safety was a major and non - negotiable obstacle because, as stated, ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (@CAPS1 @NUM1 lin @NUM2). A single spark could cause a massive explosion, endangering everyone in the vicinity. Nature itself was another significant obstacle faced in allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (@CAPS1 @NUM3 line @NUM4). These unpredictable winds made it extremely difficult to safely maneuver and dock a dirigible. One final and decisive obstacle that would halt the docking of dirigibles at the Empire State Building was U.S. law. The law was strictly against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"" (@CAPS1 @NUM5 line @NUM6). With these three major obstacles, it became clear that allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was an unworkable plan."
455	15288	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The mooring mast"" by Marcia Amidon Løsted, the @CAPS1 faced a multitude of obstacles. One of the prominent obstacles was that the back of the ship would continuously swivel around and around the mooring mast. This erratic movement made it extremely difficult to control the ship during the docking process. Another significant obstacle was that the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. These unpredictable wind patterns added an extra layer of complexity and danger to the docking operation. These were some of the insurmountable obstacles the @CAPS1 faced, which ultimately made the task of docking dirigibles at the mooring mast a near - impossible feat."
456	15289	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many significant obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Paragraph fourteen clearly stated, ""the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" During the planning for the mast, the builders unfortunately did not account for the high winds. As described, ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The primary reason the mooring mast of the Empire State Building never fulfilled its intended purpose was because of safety issues. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" On May 6, 1937, the German Zeppelin, Hindenburg, was tragically destroyed by a fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey. After this incident, the owners of the Empire State Building then recognized that if the same kind of incident was to take place in New York, far more lives would be lost. In the end, it was evident that the builders of the Empire State Building failed to fully recognize the numerous dangers associated with the mooring mast."
457	15290	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced a couple of significant obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the prominent obstacles the builders had was related to the stress of the dirigibles' load, as specifically mentioned in the excerpt in paragraph @NUM1. The weight and force exerted by the dirigibles when docking would put a considerable strain on the building's structure. Another major obstacle they encountered with landing the dirigibles to dock was that they had to extensively modify and strengthen the steel frame of the Empire State Building. They needed to carry out these modifications so that the building could effectively accommodate this new and challenging situation, which was to get dirigibles to safely dock on the Empire State Building. In conclusion, these obstacles presented significant challenges to the builders' goal of enabling dirigible docking.
458	15291	6	3	"In the excerpt of ""The Mooring Mast,"" the people attempting to make dirigible docks had ultimately ended up with substantial obstacles in reaching that ambitious goal. Before even adding the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building, the workers had to carefully modify the frame. As the text warns, ""A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add excessive stress to the building's frame."" The goal of the mooring mast was really starting to seem unachievable when one crucial problem wasn't realized. Safety was a major concern, as most of the dirigibles from outside of the United States use hydrogen instead of helium. For instance, ""a German dirigible named Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, since hydrogen is very flammable."" After realizing this, it was clear that the situation could've been ""how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" Also, ""nature itself"" was the greatest obstacle. Shifting winds would cause the dirigible to swivel around erratically, even if it managed to reach the mooring mast. The dirigibles could use weights, but using them at the Empire State Building, ""while they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe."" In the end, these multiple obstacles made it extremely difficult to achieve the goal of dirigible docking."
459	15292	6	3	The obstacles the @CAPS1 faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to @CAPS2 were quite substantial. Firstly, they needed a @CAPS3 strong enough cable so it could @CAPS4 securely hold the blimp, the passengers, and any @CAPS5 additional weight. The cable had to be of sufficient strength to withstand the forces exerted by the blimp and its contents. Another significant obstacle was how they could @CAPS6 manage that with the power of the wind that high up in the air. The strong winds at that altitude made the task of docking the dirigible extremely challenging. Another reason was that if @CAPS7 @CAPS8 there would be pedestrians at the @CAPS9, which added a safety risk. Also, the building @CAPS10 would have to @CAPS4 be properly set up. In conclusion, these various obstacles made it very difficult for the @CAPS1 to achieve the goal of allowing dirigibles to @CAPS2.
460	15293	6	3	"In the story ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many formidable obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. One of the key obstacles faced was that putting a thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building would add a tremendous amount of stress to the building's frame. This stress was so significant that it made the builders have to thoroughly modify the frame to ensure the building's structural integrity. Another major obstacle the builders faced was safety. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is flammable."" This meant that having these dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building would put great danger to the people of New York, as a fire could cause widespread damage and loss of life. That was a huge and insurmountable problem the builders faced. In summary, the builders at the Empire State Building faced many complex obstacles, and safety and reconstruction were just some of the most prominent problems that hindered their goal of enabling dirigible docking."
461	15294	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous challenges when attempting to enable dirigibles to land there. The most prominent obstacle was from nature, as there was a continuous change in wind direction. This meant that dirigibles would not be able to land safely, as they might drift or sway uncontrollably. The architects initially thought that placing heavy weights on the ends of the blimps could solve the problem. However, they quickly realized that this would pose a risk to pedestrians walking below, as the weights could potentially fall. Additionally, the building had to reach a certain height to eliminate the airship height rule. If something were to explode, the densely populated city of New York would be in great danger. In theory, the mast for dirigibles was an innovative idea, but in reality, it was unfeasible due to these significant obstacles.
462	15295	6	3	"There were numerous obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building encountered when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. One major hurdle was that architects couldn't simply install a mooring mast on the building's flat roof. As stated in paragraph @NUM1, ""A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add excessive stress to the building's frame."" This stress could potentially damage the building's structural integrity over time. Another obstacle was making the mooring mast serve its intended purpose. The successful use of the mooring mast was hindered by nature itself. Paragraph @NUM2 mentions that ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" These shifting winds made it extremely difficult to safely moor the dirigibles. These are the reasons why the builders of the Empire State Building faced many challenges in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on top of the building."
463	15296	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted, it details the many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building had to overcome to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle was the ever - changing nature and its impact on the dirigibles. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, causing the dirigibles to ""swivel around."" This movement could make the ship unstable, putting pedestrians on the street below at risk as the large, moving ship loomed overhead. Another significant obstacle was safety. Outside the United States, dirigibles often ""used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" If these foreign ships were to dock in the United States, they could catch fire, endangering people. Moreover, the loading dock was more than 1,250 feet high, and the loading and unloading process could be unstable because of the strong winds. The last obstacle was the ""existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This law made it illegal to get the dirigibles close enough to the building safely. All these obstacles made the workers and planners realize that this idea could not be implemented without endangering people."
464	15297	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles, which can be described as follows. First of all, the main obstacle was related to the nature of the mast. As described, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (paragraph @NUM1). These shifting winds made it difficult to control the dirigibles when they were near the mast. Secondly, the dirigibles would dangle on top of the building, which was a significant safety hazard for pedestrians below. The large, moving dirigibles could potentially fall or collide with the building, causing harm to those on the street. Lastly, there was a law restricting airships from flying too low or too high. This law made it challenging to get the dirigibles close enough to the building safely for docking. The above factors comprehensively explain the obstacles the Empire State Building faced in accommodating dirigibles."
465	15298	6	3	When the architects and builders were planning to build the mast onto the Empire State Building, they faced a series of obstacles. An example of an obstacle they faced was constructing the mast in a way that it wouldn't fall off when a dirigible docked. They couldn't use a cable tether to hold the mast down because it would place too much stress on the building's frame and foundation. This stress could lead to long - term damage to the building's structure. Another obstacle the builders had to deal with was strengthening the Empire State Building's frame. To make the frame strong enough to hold the mast, it would cost over sixty thousand dollars. This high cost was a significant deterrent. These are some of the key obstacles that the builders had to face during the planning process.
466	15299	6	3	In the building of @ORGANIZATION1, the competition gets extremely fierce. He has a strong desire to construct the biggest building in New York City. When the construction was in progress, he came up with the idea of adding a top or hat so that the mast would be capable of dropping off people directly into the building. However, then a problem arose and they had to consult relevant authorities to get it allowed. Irving then informed Al that due to the mast, the building wasn't going to be completed on time. That's what the Empire State building faced during its construction. In the end, these challenges had an impact on the overall progress and outcome of the project.
467	15300	6	3	"Throughout the designing and construction stages of the Empire State building's mooring mast, builders and engineers were constantly confronted with numerous issues. These included the complex distribution of building stress, potential fire hazards, and the continuous shifting caused by strong winds. During the planning phase of the engineers, they encountered a significant issue: how to alleviate the stress on the Empire State Building's frame. According to the engineers, having a ""thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether would add substantial stress to the building's frame."" As a result, @CAPS1 stated that the building would require ""over sixty thousand dollars"" in redesigning and modifying the current building's foundation and framework. Secondly, engineers and builders initially failed to consider the fire hazards, which only became apparent after the completion of the mooring mast. Most American dirigibles were filled with hydrogen rather than helium, making this gaseous - filled transportation highly flammable. An example of this safety violation was the burning of a dirigible in Lakehurst, New Jersey, which made the builders reflect on the possible severity of such an accident in the densely populated area of New York. Thirdly, New York had ""violent air currents"" that could cause the rear of the dirigibles to swivel and shift uncontrollably. The only proposed solution was to weigh down the back with lead blocks, but this was deemed ""neither practical nor safe."" In conclusion, the engineers and builders of the Empire State Building had to grapple with many problems and concerns, often having to consider less - than - ideal solutions."
468	15301	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State building encountered numerous obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One significant obstacle they faced was the structural stress. If a dirigible was moored by a single tether, ""the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" This put a huge strain on the building's structure. Another major obstacle was the safety risk due to the use of hydrogen. Most foreign dirigibles used hydrogen, which was highly flammable. When the Hindenburg was destroyed, the builders realized that such an accident would have been far more catastrophic if it had occurred over a densely populated area like New York City. A third obstacle was the violent wind currents. These strong winds would cause the back of the dirigible to swivel around. Unlike in open landing fields, the back of the dirigible couldn't be weighted down because that would cause the weights to dangle dangerously above the pedestrians on the street. These were major and insurmountable obstacles, and they are the primary reasons that the mast on top of the Empire State Building was never used to dock blimps. In the end, these challenges effectively ended the hope of using the building for dirigible docking."
469	15302	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, there were many significant obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the main concerns was the safety of both the city and the dirigibles. In paragraph thirteen, it clearly states ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" This realization highlighted the high - risk nature of using hydrogen - filled dirigibles in the area. In addition, the greatest of all obstacles was truly nature itself. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" As a dirigible attempted to successfully use the mooring mast, the back end of the blimp would swivel around and around the mooring mast, making docking extremely difficult and dangerous. There was also an existing law stating that airships cannot fly that low over an urban area. Thus, the multiple obstacles faced during this ""architectural breakthrough"" ultimately destroyed any hope of the building achieving its original intended purpose of allowing regular dirigible docking. In conclusion, these challenges were insurmountable and led to the abandonment of the dirigible - docking plan."
470	15303	6	3	"Constructing anything is always an arduous task, but trying to construct the world's tallest building and enabling dirigibles to dock there is even more challenging. The workers who were modifying the Empire State Building had numerous obstacles standing in their way when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. The obstacle they had no control over was nature herself. The winds were said to be ""constantly shifting due to violent air currents,"" as described in the excerpt. This made it not only difficult but also extremely dangerous for dirigibles to dock there. Also, another factor that posed an obstacle for the constructors was the building itself. The structure of the building would have to be modified because the dirigible ""would add significant stress to the building's frame."" So, the constructors would have to make the building capable of supporting this tremendous stress. Another major obstacle was safety. Some dirigibles were filled with hydrogen, which was extremely flammable and posed a great danger to the massive population on the ground. These are just a few of the many obstacles faced when modifying the Empire State Building. In the end, these challenges significantly affected the feasibility of the plan to allow dirigibles to dock at the building."
471	15304	6	3	The Empire State Building was and is widely regarded as the tallest building to ever be built at that time. To make it the tallest building, the skilled architects had to come up with an innovative design for the Mooring Mast. In the process of building this mast, there were numerous obstacles that the construction team had to overcome. Despite facing these challenging obstacles, through their perseverance and expertise, it was still successfully finished. The Mooring Mast was absolutely needed because without it, the Empire State Building would not hold the title of the tallest in the world. To make the Mooring Mast work properly, the builders had to tackle some significant obstacles. One of the main obstacles was that to add on the Mast, they would have to carefully attach steel from the Mast all the way down to the solid foundation. Another crucial obstacle was that after designing the Mast, they had to make necessary changes to the original plans for the building. In the end, although the challenges were great, the construction of the Mooring Mast was a remarkable feat that contributed to the building's iconic status.
472	15305	6	3	Builders faced many complex obstacles in attempting to allow Dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. Between technical difficulties, safety concerns, and the unpredictable forces of nature, there was no way this ambitious idea could ever work smoothly. Although the idea of using the building for dirigible docking was good in theory, it was very impractical in reality. Safety was a major problem with this idea. Most Dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is much more flammable. If the Dirigibles ever broke out into flames over the densely populated New York City, it would burn large parts of the place down and kill thousands of innocent people. Nature was another big problem. The winds on top of the Empire State Building were constantly shifting all the time. The ship would swivel around the mooring mast uncontrollably. The Dirigibles usually moored in open fields and used black lead weights to weigh them down. Having these heavy weights dangling above the heads of the people on the streets below was extremely dangerous. Building the mooring mast was very dangerous and impractical. It never happened due to safety reasons, and now the area that was intended for the mast serves as a tea and soda area for the use of sight - seers, a far cry from its original purpose.
473	15306	6	3	On @DATE1, The Empire State Building was officially announced to reach the impressive height of 1,250 feet. Al Smith, the talented architect of the building, mentioned that the top of the building would be more than just ornamental. It was said that this amazing dream would come true for aviation pioneers. The building was going to have a mooring mast at its top for docking these new airships called dirigibles, otherwise known as blimps. This was initially thought out to be a great and revolutionary idea. However, things didn't quite turn out as originally planned, and Fate struck. As fate would have it, things should have been more apparent before it was ever constructed. Reasons being; Most blimps from outside the states run on hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is significantly more flammable. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting, causing the dirigible to swivel erratically, and it would be an absolute disaster for anything to happen to New York City and the large number of pedestrians it holds. Another law was the law regarding how close airships can be to the building. Thus, still leaving the Empire State Building at 1,250 feet, but never completing the original goal of having a functional mooring mast for dirigibles. In conclusion, despite the high hopes, practical challenges and safety concerns prevented the realization of this ambitious plan.
474	15307	6	3	"The builders faced many daunting obstacles when trying to build the Empire State Building. First of all, for it to be a @NUM1 ft building, it would have to have a very strong and stable base to support its massive structure. They also had to reinforce the base further to be able to mount the mooring mast on top. The engineers had to ensure that the base could withstand the additional weight and stress. They also faced issues with the strong air currents that flowed above New York. These powerful air currents made it extremely difficult for the dirigibles to approach and dock. None of the dirigibles were able to dock because of the high - velocity current. The mooring mast also placed significant stress on the frame. ""A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add a great deal of stress to the building's frame."" This statement clearly proves how much difficulty the builders were going to have with the construction of the Empire State Building. In the end, despite these challenges, the building still stands as an architectural marvel, though the original plan for the mooring mast was never fully realized."
475	15308	6	3	"In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. Dirigibles are enormous steel - framed balloons that can travel for long periods at a speed of seventy miles per hour. Though dirigibles seemed great for attracting people by ways of modern transportation, the builders faced a complex obstacle. There was no area of suitable landing for dirigibles. In attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, many throughout changes in the building needed to be carefully considered. The load being transported off the dirigible would add significant stress to the building frame, as would the strong wind pressure. To suit the building with accommodating the dirigible, the price for modifications to the building would cost @MONEY1. Many obstacles were scientifically proven why the dirigible could not dock at the Empire State Building. The issue of safety involving the hydrogen gasses being highly flammable was too much of a risk in the highly populated area of New York. Also, nature was a large obstacle that was faced due to the strong wind at such a tall altitude. The law implying that airships couldn't fly too low was a practical reason why the dirigibles could not dock at the building. ""One set of engineers here in New York is trying to dope out a practical, workable arrangement and the Government people in Washington are figuring on some safe way of mooring airships to this mast."" A quote by Al Smith. The obstacles involving the moderate transportation idea were too impractical in using the mooring mast for dirigibles on the Empire State Building. In conclusion, despite the initial allure, the combination of safety, cost, and natural factors made the plan unfeasible."
476	15309	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many significant obstacles in their earnest efforts to make it feasible for dirigibles to dock on the mast. One prominent problem was safety. Some dirigibles were filled with hydrogen, which is, as clearly stated in the article, ""highly flammable."" In fact, if a dirigible were to catch fire right over a very populated area like New York City, it would be extremely dangerous. Nature was another crucial factor. ""Violent air currents"" constantly swirling around the mast made it extremely difficult to skillfully maneuver a dirigible and bring it close enough to the mast to dock. Yet even if these frustrating conditions were not present, it would still have been impossible for a dirigible to moor on the mast, because it was against the law. A strict law prohibited ""airships [from] flying too low over urban areas,"" which of course included dirigibles. These various obstacles were unfortunately overlooked in the initial plans to create the Empire State Building, ultimately making the idea of dirigible docking unworkable."
477	15310	6	3	"In ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the article focuses in - depth on the numerous obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in their ambitious attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. Existing laws made it completely impossible for the original intended purpose of the mast. As the text mentions, ""An existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area..."". Some dirigibles did make valiant attempts, but due to strong wind conditions and serious safety reasons, the idea was reluctantly dropped. The safety of all human beings was a major consideration in the construction process. ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by a massive fire...the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area like New York City..."". When dealing with other countries, it's important to take into account that they may not always use the safest materials. Mother Nature can be quite unpredictable, as described in the text, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting..."". With the wind changing at a moment's notice, it can be extremely hard for a ship to land safely. When building something, one should always be well - prepared for such unforeseen obstacles, as the Empire State Building's dirigible - docking plan clearly demonstrated."
478	15311	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building encountered a series of significant obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock on it. The architects couldn't simply install a mooring mast on the top. If they did so without proper planning, the whole building's foundation would have to be completely changed to withstand the additional forces. Nature was also a major deterrent to the project. The wind currents at the top of the building were always in a state of flux, and the blimp would end up swirling around uncontrollably. Safety was the most crucial reason to halt the job. Hydrogen, which was commonly used in dirigibles, is very flammable. If the blimp, which would be hovering over New York City, were to burst into flames, many innocent people would be killed. In conclusion, these multiple obstacles are the reasons why the builders stopped and did not complete the project of making the Empire State Building a dirigible - docking site.
479	15312	6	3	The Empire State Building faced numerous complex problems in allowing dirigibles to dock there. The most important consideration was the safety of the people. Most dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium to power their dirigibles, and hydrogen is extremely flammable. In the event of a fire, the death toll would be astronomical over a densely populated area like downtown New York. Another obstacle faced in this endeavor was nature. The winds at the top of the Empire State Building were constantly shifting, and the thought of a dirigible dangling high above pedestrians was far from safe. The last reason that the dirigibles were not a safe option was the existing law in the U.S. At the time of the building of the Empire State Building, a law existed that strictly prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas. Therefore, the dirigible would be too close to the ground and was not allowed to dock. The idea of dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building is indeed a phenomenal one, however, there are simply too many insurmountable obstacles prohibiting it from becoming a reality.
480	15313	6	3	"When the builders of the Empire State Building initially envisioned having dirigibles moor at the top, there were some critical and obvious flaws. For one thing, a thousand - foot dirigible moored to such a small focal point on the mast, with the strong wind pressure and its own heavy load, would exert an enormous amount of pressure on the building's frame (p. @NUM1). This excessive strain could potentially lead to the building's collapse. Another reason was that at such high altitudes, the wind is quite violent. The wind would sway the back of the dirigible over thousands of pedestrians below, which, as the text states, is neither ""... practical nor safe."" (p. @NUM2). If something went seriously wrong, the dirigible could cause significant damage by taking out another building or, even worse, crashing to the ground. A more practical and legal obstacle was a law against the presence of airships over cities. A dirigible mooring to a mast, even at that height, was clearly illegal (p. @NUM3). Therefore, with so many insurmountable obstacles, it was ultimately deemed impractical to use the Empire State Building as a high - altitude dock."
481	15314	6	3	There are numerous problems with the attempt to dock dirigibles to the Empire State Building. First, there was a well - known German dirigible named the Hindenburg. It tragically caught fire due to the hydrogen it used as a lifting gas. If a similar incident were to occur with a dirigible going up in flames over the densely populated area of New York, it would undoubtedly result in a large number of lives being lost. Second, at a height of 1,250 feet in the air, the wind is extremely strong and highly unpredictable. There was simply no way to be certain that the dirigibles could successfully dock or be effectively controlled once they were docked. Lastly, there exists a law that prohibits airships from flying too low over urban areas. It would almost surely be against the law for a dirigible to be so close to a building filled with so many people. Since all these problems have the potential to lead to deaths, the idea of docking dirigibles at the Empire State Building was ultimately discarded.
482	15315	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. In the initial stages of preparation, the builders naively thought it would be a great and innovative idea to let dirigibles (also known as blimps) dock at the building. However, they failed to take into account the numerous obstacles and struggles that they would soon face. Specifically, the builders didn't consider the wind pressure and the impact that the stress of the blimp's load would have on the building. As one expert noted, ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's Foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" This was a huge problem for the architects, and over a significant amount of money, around @MONEY1, worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework. ""Safety was also another big issue."" Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. If a fire had broken out over a highly populated area such as downtown New York, the results could have been truly disastrous. The winds also posed a problem. Even if the blimp was tied down to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swing around and could result in a dangerous accident. There were also laws against low - flying ships. In hindsight, the architects for the Empire State Building should have thought the whole plan through more carefully."
483	15316	6	3	In order for the dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, the builders had to meet many expectations and ensure that everything was in perfect order. But while doing so, they faced a series of significant obstacles. One major obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. The building's design and the surrounding environment did not provide an ideal space for dirigibles to safely land and dock. Another obstacle the builders faced was that most dirigibles from outside of the U.S. used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable, and they realized how much worse the situation could be, especially in a more populated area like downtown New York. A fire involving a hydrogen - filled dirigible over such a crowded place could lead to a large - scale disaster. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. These unpredictable winds made it extremely difficult to control the dirigibles during docking and while they were docked. With all of these obstacles, the builders finally realized that the plan of having dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building would not work.
484	15317	6	3	The Empire State Building builders faced a couple of notable problems when it came to docking dirigibles to the mooring mast. Some of these issues are so complex that, to be honest, I don't even fully understand them. @CAPS5 Anyway, I'll just build up from here and @CAPS1 try to figure out what @NUM1 means in relation to the dirigible. Now, I've never really delved into the @CAPS2 details of a zeppelin, but I do know one thing. Do passengers @CAPS7 get out from the front, or the sides of the zeppelin? I'm not sure. @NUM2 Let's talk about the mast itself. This thing was a failure from the very @CAPS3 start. (Don't question why I chose something else for one of the multi - @CAPS4 questions). The reason is that @CAPS5 there are so many things that could go wrong. This mooring mast can @ORGANIZATION1 malfunction, and the dirigible could @CAPS6 fall off unless @CAPS7 take some really special measures for constructing a building this high. Overall, it's been a long while since this idea was considered. These problems, along with several others that I forgot to mention for obvious reasons, are @CAPS6 the main reasons why we don't use zeppelins as much anymore.
485	15318	6	3	"In the article ""The Mooring Mast,"" Marcia Amidon @CAPS1 thoroughly describes how safety, laws, and nature are the three main obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. Safety was by far the greatest reason that dirigibles could not be docked in @ORGANIZATION2. The biggest safety hazard was that many countries outside of the @LOCATION2 use hydrogen in their dirigibles instead of helium. A well - known German dirigible had recently been destroyed in a tragic fire in New Jersey because, as stated in the article, ""hydrogen is highly flammable"" (@CAPS1, @NUM1). The builders of the Empire State Building realized that the accident would have been far more catastrophic if it had occurred, ""above a densely populated area such as downtown New York"" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). By docking dirigibles there, they ran the significant risk that a similar disaster could happen. Nature was another major obstacle that hindered the success of a mooring mast. Violent air currents at the top of the Empire State Building were constantly causing the winds to change direction. Since only the front of the dirigibles was tethered to the mooring mast, as described in the article, ""the back of the ship would swivel around"" (@CAPS1, @NUM1). They could not use lead weights to weigh down the back like they did in open fields because having weights hanging above pedestrians on the street, ""was neither practical nor safe"" (@CAPS1, @NUM1). Nature was a major obstacle because it could not be changed, and there was no easy way to fix the issues it caused. The last obstacle was an existing law which clearly prevented airships from, ""flying too low over urban areas"" (@CAPS1, @NUM5). This law made it illegal for the ship to both approach the area and tie up to the building, which was a huge and insurmountable obstacle. In conclusion, the obstacles of safety, laws, and nature that the builders of the Empire State Building faced made it absolutely impossible to dock dirigibles to the mooring mast on the building."
486	15319	6	3	The building had a steel - framed body up to @NUM1 floors, and it was fitted with glass windows all the way to the 102nd floor. They also had to upgrade the building because the stress exerted on it from the blimps docking there was substantial. This stress could potentially affect the building's overall stability, so the upgrade was a necessary measure to ensure its long - term safety.
487	15320	6	3	"In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building are faced with several significant obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle they encountered was the complex task of designing a mooring mast that could withstand the stress of the dirigible's load. In stanza @NUM1, the author writes, ""A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" As a result, the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be carefully modified and strengthened to ameliorate this problem. Next, the greatest obstacle they faced was the strong winds on top of the building. In stanza @NUM2, it says, ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" This presented a huge problem as the architects could not weigh down the back of the ship because it could endanger pedestrians on the ground. Lastly, in stanza @NUM3, it states there is ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" Consequently, it would be illegal for the dirigibles to tie up to the Empire State Building or even come close to the area. Due to these three insurmountable obstacles, the plan of using a mooring mast became an idea of the past, remaining only as a concept in the history of the building's ambitious design."
488	15321	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous and significant obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first problem or obstacle they faced was the complex task of putting a mooring mast on top of the building. They could not simply drop a mooring mast on top because it would cause stress on the building that would gradually spread to the foundation. The building's steel frame would have to be carefully modified for the building to be able to withstand the mooring mast alone. Then the builders noticed that a large number of dirigibles, especially those from outside of the United States, were filled with hydrogen and not helium. The problem was that hydrogen is highly flammable, as vividly shown in Lakehurst, New Jersey, where a German dirigible got into a tragic accident and was completely destroyed by fire on May 6, 1937. The builders went back and seriously thought about how New York is a highly populated place and what kind of disastrous effect it would have on the civilians. The greatest obstacle that the builders faced was the natural environment. There were strong winds where the mooring mast would be located, so the dirigibles would be forced to swivel and move in every direction. When the aircraft were moored in open fields, they were weighed down with lead weights, but on the Empire State Building, they would be dangling high above civilians and pedestrians on the street, which posed a great risk to the public. In the end, these multiple obstacles made the plan of dirigible docking at the Empire State Building unfeasible.
489	15322	6	3	The excerpt of The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted reveals that the architects of the Empire State faced a number of formidable obstacles. Not only was the construction of the building now highly competitive, but its expectations were also quite unrealistic. The idea for such a magnificent masterpiece of a building held a number of potential problems that its architects initially underestimated. As the work - in - progress of the Chrysler building advanced, the Empire State Building strived to be taller. In order to achieve greater heights, its architects suggested the addition of a mooring mast, not only to make the building the tallest but also to add to its functionality. However, the addition of a mooring mast would require a great deal of meticulous planning. If a giant steel - framed balloon were to dock at the top of the building as it was, it could dangerously shake the foundation of the building. So, the frame of the building had to be rebuilt much stronger to ensure stability. Also, the architects didn't fully realize the danger of docking dirigibles. Dirigibles, or blimps, were fueled by hydrogen, which is very flammable, and this posed a significant threat to the thousands of people living below. In conclusion, these unforeseen obstacles made the plan of using the mooring mast for dirigible docking extremely challenging and ultimately unworkable.
490	15323	6	3	"In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION1, the builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstructions when attempting to allow dirigibles, also known as blimps, to dock there. Some of these obstacles were that the architects could not simply place a mooring mast on the flat roof of the Empire State Building. Attaching a thousand - foot dirigible to the top of the building's frame ""would add stress to the building's frame,"" as stated in paragraph @NUM1. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly @NUM2 feet below."" This meant that the building's structure would need significant reinforcement. Also, it was extremely unsafe to allow the highly flammable dirigible to coast over a highly populated area, as a single spark could lead to a catastrophic event. Lastly, the article states ""the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" The ship would ""swivel"" around the mooring mast due to the strong winds. Dirigibles are typically meant to land in open fields, where they can be safely weighed down and not dangle above pedestrians. Due to these insurmountable obstacles, the plan to use the Empire State Building for dirigible docking had to be abandoned."
491	15324	6	3	There were plenty of obstacles the builder faced when trying to allow the dirigibles to dock here; here are some. First, having something as big as a dirigible land on an eleven - hundred - foot building would add an enormous amount of stress to the building's frame. All of this stress had to be distributed throughout the entire eleven - hundred - foot building, a task that was previously unthought - of. In order to make the building suitable to bear all this weight, it would cost over sixty thousand dollars, and that was a significant amount considering everything else that they were doing. Those were indeed just a few of the obstacles they had when trying to allow dirigibles to dock on top of the Empire State Building. In conclusion, these challenges made the endeavor of dirigible docking on the building quite difficult.
492	15325	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State building ran into some notable obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Because of all the modifications they would need to make in order to install a mooring mast, it would cost over sixty thousand dollars. It was such an expensive modification because they ""could not simply drop a mooring mast on the top of the"" flat roof on the Empire State Building. The stress that a thousand - foot dirigible would put on the building's frame would be far too much, and this was their primary obstacle. The builders needed to strengthen and carefully modify the steel frame of the Empire State Building in order to hold the dirigibles as desired. In the end, these costly and complex modifications made the plan of dirigible docking a challenging one."
493	15326	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced a lot of obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the building. Mainly, the idea was just not practical. Having an up to eight - hundred - foot blimp filled with flammable hydrogen (nitrogen was a misnomer here, it's usually hydrogen in dirigibles) hovering over a densely populated area was an extreme danger. One accident and tons of innocent lives would be at stake. Especially after the German blimp, the Hindenburg, crashed, workers knew that if such an incident happened in New York, the death tolls would be huge. Along with the extreme perils that the builders knew would be at stake, mother nature would also not make it easy for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. The winds atop the building were constantly shifting, and the air currents were too violent and posed too many threats of danger. Even when the ship was anchored, the back of the ship would swivel as if attached to a hinge. Lead tools could be used to weigh down the blimp, but hanging above tons of people, this would not be a safe idea. Overall, the idea of having a dirigible connected to the Empire State Building is just not safe and not worth the potential losses. In conclusion, the combination of safety risks and natural challenges made the plan unfeasible.
494	15327	6	3	The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One major issue was the actual design of the mooring and the modifications that would have to be made to the building. Due to the stress of the wind pressure and the heavy load of the dirigible, the structure of the building had to be made much stronger. The mast would also have to withstand holding down the dirigible with just one cable tether, which would put a great deal of stress on both the mast and the building. Another issue faced by the builders was the fact that dirigibles from outside the United States mostly used hydrogen, not helium, in the balloon, which made them more flammable and extremely dangerous. If one ever caught on fire above New York City, it would be a complete disaster. Finally, there was already a law in place that airships could not fly too low over urban areas. This law made it so that it was illegal for a ship to ever tie up to, or even approach the Empire State Building. In conclusion, the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building were numerous and most were too great to overcome when it came to trying to allow dirigibles to dock on the spire of the building.
495	15328	6	3	"There were a few obstacles the builders had to face in this project. One of them was building the Empire State Building taller than the Chrysler building. The architect of the Chrysler building made it 46 ft taller. When this was done, the builder needed to make the Empire State building taller, but they had to come up with something ""as mundane as a water tank"" (as Al Smith put it). Another example was trying to make it a stop for dirigibles. These things could go up to seventy - five miles per hour. They were as long as 1000 ft, which would take up about three blocks in New York City. They didn't have a proper landing area. A third obstacle they faced was nature. The wind was always blowing strongly. No matter what, hanging dirigibles over a city full of innocent people was very dangerous. In conclusion, these various obstacles made the construction and the dirigible - docking plan for the Empire State Building a very challenging undertaking."
496	15329	6	3	While meticulously planning this architectural masterpiece, the builders faced numerous daunting obstacles. The ambitious plan to install a mooring mast at the top of the Empire State Building clearly did not live up to expectations. The first major problem was the substantial stress exerted on the building's framework when zeppelins were moored to the top. This stress was so significant that it also had an impact on the foundation. The second issue was the high cost of modifying the skyscraper to prevent excessive stress on the framework. Safety was a huge concern as well. Most blimps were filled with hydrogen, a highly flammable gas. If a blimp were to explode while floating over one of the largest cities in the country, the consequences would be catastrophic. Due to New York's geographical positioning, the wind off the ocean was extremely strong. These violent air currents constantly changed directions, which could cause the zeppelin to crash into the building. The final obstacle was the law against airships flying too low over highly populated urban cities. These multiple challenges ultimately made the plan for the mooring mast unfeasible.
497	15330	6	3	Four main obstacles prevented dirigibles from ever docking at the Empire State Building. The first was that a much more complex mooring mast would have to be installed on top of the Empire State Building. This mast was very different from the regular masts found in open - field docking areas. When a dirigible docked on the mast, it would cause great stress to the building's frame. This problem could potentially be solved by increasing the strength of the steel frame, but that would involve significant engineering work and cost. Another problem was that a dirigible was made of hydrogen and could easily catch fire and explode. Engineers recognized that this would pose large problems over a densely populated area like New York City. Once the mast was built, a new problem arose. Even if the dirigible could dock, the intense winds could make the back end of the dirigible move violently, or cause an airship to be unable to dock, similar to the incident with the Los Angeles. Nor could they use lead weights to weigh down the balloon since they would be a danger to civilians on the ground. Lastly, a law against airships flying too low over urban areas could have prevented docking. These reasons made it impossible for a ship to ever moor on top of the Empire State Building, although two ships did get very close but were ultimately unable to complete the docking.
498	15331	6	3	"Basically, this excerpt is talking about ""The Mooring Mast"" and is all about its construction. One of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced was safety. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This quote reveals that the dirigibles they made were highly flammable, which was extremely dangerous for people's lives. Imagine if the dirigible caught fire while flying high in the sky; it could cause a large number of casualties. The other obstacle the builders faced was that it was against the law. ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was the existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" Even though the building is the tallest building in New York, it is still considered too low for the laws. Airships cannot fly that low over the urban area as it could cause accidents. The Empire State Building is over 1,250 feet tall, which means there are strong and forceful winds at the top. Dirigibles couldn't stop and get close to the top of the building. ""In December 1930, the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of the forceful wind."" These safety and legal issues combined made it very difficult to achieve the goal of dirigible docking at the Empire State Building."
499	15332	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One such obstacle was the significant amount of modifications that needed to be made to the building's framework, as clearly stated in paragraph @NUM1. These modifications were not only complex but also costly. The other obstacle they faced was the fact that most countries outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium in their dirigibles. Hydrogen is highly flammable, which made it impossible for dirigibles to stop in a densely populated area such as downtown New York, as mentioned in paragraph @NUM2. The risk of a fire or explosion in such a populated area was simply too high. A last obstacle they faced was the existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. These are the various and significant obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building, which ultimately thwarted their plans for dirigible docking.
500	15333	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there. Wind caused a great problem in the docking of the dirigibles. ""The body of the dirigible could swing in the breeze"" (para 6). This swinging of the dirigible's body would cause pulling on the building that the building's current frame wouldn't be able to support. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below"" (para @NUM1). To address this, the builders of the Empire State Building now had to strengthen and modify the building's frame to withstand the stress of the dirigibles' loads. Another obstacle that the builders of the building faced was the framing of the mast. The roof had to be completed before the mast's framing could take place. Due to Al Smith's idea of allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, the workers had to work for another two months after the building was already complete. The builders worked hard to adapt the new building for the docking of dirigibles. Unfortunately, despite their efforts, their work was ultimately for nothing as the many obstacles remained insurmountable."
501	15334	6	3	"Attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building created numerous obstacles for its builders. Some of these challenges weren't even discovered until they finally attempted the docking process. The first major problem for the builders began with preparing the actual building for the additional stress that would be applied when dirigibles tried to dock. They spent a substantial amount, @MONEY1, on modifications to reinforce the framework of the building. Instead of constructing a simple, utilitarian mast without any ornamentation, the architects designed a shiny glass and chrome - nickel stainless steel tower. This elaborate design created a lot of unnecessary work for the workers and also introduced various obstacles. There was also a significant amount of danger associated with docking dirigibles that the builders had to handle. The violent and constantly changing air currents would require them to make the mast as sturdy as possible and account for the unpredictable movement of the dirigibles. Finally, the builders discovered the biggest obstacle: it is illegal for airships to fly that low over urban areas. So, technically, they weren't even allowed to carry out what they had planned. Thinking back on it, it is evident that ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose...""."
502	15335	6	3	"There were several significant obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One major obstacle was the violent wind currents. These winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to the strong and erratic air currents. Even if the dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around wildly. A second obstacle was a strict law preventing airships from flying too low over urban areas. This law effectively made the mast nearly useless for its intended purpose. A third obstacle was that foreign dirigibles used hydrogen, which is highly flammable. After the dirigible called ""The Hindenburg"" was destroyed in a tragic accident, ""the owners realized how much worse the accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as New York"". Considering all these factors, it becomes clear that these were the insurmountable obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there."
503	15336	6	3	Based on the excerpt The mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION2, the significant challenges the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were fire, wind, and the laws against airships flying too low over urban areas. If they let the dirigibles dock there, they would risk the dirigibles catching on fire because dirigibles from outside the U.S. used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. Another major obstacle would be the wind. The winds were constantly shifting because of the violent air currents. The back of the ship would swivel around uncontrollably, and if they put weights on the back, it would pose a serious threat to the safety of pedestrians on the street. And the last obstacle would be the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to tie to the building. Those were the considerable challenges they faced.
504	15337	6	3	"The expectation for dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building was extremely high. The men who built the massive structure should have clearly realized that these expectations were unrealistic. Al Smith had carefully planned for dirigibles to refuel and to drop off/pick up passengers while docked at the Empire State Building. However, these plans would never come to fruition because dirigibles were powered by hydrogen, which is highly flammable and could result in a disastrous fire. The winds atop the Empire State Building were much too strong, making docking extremely difficult. Additionally, there was a law that prohibited aircraft from flying so low over urban areas. In one well - known incident in Lakehurst, New Jersey, the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire. The owners of the Empire State Building saw ""How much worse that accident could have been [in New York City]."" ""The greatest obstacle to use of the mooring mast was nature itself"" because the wind was so strong that dirigibles couldn't even get close enough to dock. The law on the altitude of airships also wouldn't allow dirigibles to even approach the Empire State Building. In conclusion, the plans for the Empire State Building's mooring mast were never realistic and could never be fulfilled."
505	15338	6	3	The wind was a huge and persistent issue when building the Empire State Building. The building was so high off the ground that the top part was not as stable as the lower sections. If they intended to use dirigibles on the Empire State Building, it would be extremely dangerous because the weights used for docking would be dangling high in the air, right over the heads of all the pedestrians below. This plan was neither smart nor safe from a practical and safety perspective. The main purpose to build it higher was simply so it could claim the title of the tallest building. In reality, there were really no other good, practical reasons for such an extreme height. Overall, this decision to build so high and plan for dirigible use was ill - conceived and not well - thought - out.
506	15339	6	3	Elders of the Empire State Building faced numerous complications during the project. Safety was a major and persistent concern. Battling with the harsh, unpredictable winds would also be a significant problem. When the idea of the mast was initially conceived, not many fully realized the practical reality of the concept. To put an extremely heavy dirigible and attach it to just a single tether was clearly not safe enough. The combination of combustible gases within the dirigible also suggested that it could put downtown New York at great risk. To land on such a small roof area would be extremely difficult due to the strong, gusty winds. Guiding the dirigible to such a delicate landing would prove to be highly hazardous with the ever - changing strong winds. The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when constructing the mooring mast, ultimately making the realization of the dirigible - docking plan quite challenging.
507	15340	6	3	"In ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, there were many significant obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First, the building had a flat roof, and a large, thousand - foot dirigible moored to the top, only held by a single cable tether, would add excessive stress to the building's frame. Modifications to the building to handle this stress would cost over sixty thousand dollars, which was a substantial financial burden. Other problems the building faced had to do with safety. Some dirigibles used hydrogen, which is highly flammable, and if an accident were to happen in the densely populated area of New York, it would be a complete disaster. The greatest obstacle was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting, and even when the dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast, the ship would not be properly secured. This was also very unsafe. In the end, the Empire State Building never succeeded in achieving its purpose of being a viable docking location for dirigibles."
508	15341	6	3	"The main problem in the original design of the mooring mast was that ""the architects couldn't simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. A large, thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add significant stress to the building's frame. The stress of the dirigible's heavy load and the strong wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way down to the building's foundation, which required careful engineering. Another obstacle the builders faced with the construction of the mast could be seen in the example of the German dirigible ""Hindenburg"". With some dirigibles using the highly flammable hydrogen instead of helium, another ""Hindenburg accident"" could prove to be extremely fatal in a ""highly populated area such as downtown New York."" Perhaps the greatest obstacle would be ""nature itself."" The high - force winds on top of the Empire State Building would cause the dirigible to swivel around the mooring mast erratically. Although the dirigibles could be weighted down, the weights would be hanging over pedestrians, which ""was neither practical nor safe."" All these factors made the construction and use of the mooring mast a very challenging task."
509	15342	6	3	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were numerous. They had trouble with the area where they were going to carry out their work. ""The one obstacle in their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area, which was limited and not well - suited for large dirigibles."" Another obstacle that they had was with the mooring mast. ""The greatest obstacle to the success of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast in an uncontrolled manner."" Then there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. If they did fly low, it would become illegal for the ship to pass, tie up to the building, or even approach the area. These combined obstacles made it nearly impossible to achieve the goal of dirigible docking at the Empire State Building."
510	15343	6	3	The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was even constructed. The greatest reason was one of safety: most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. This flammability posed a huge risk, especially in a densely populated area like New York City. A single spark could lead to a massive explosion and fire, endangering countless lives and causing extensive damage. Given these obvious safety concerns, it was clear from the start that the mooring mast's intended function of regular dirigible docking was doomed to fail.
511	15344	6	3	"In the 1930's, the idea to have a mooring mast mounted on the top of the Empire State Building for dirigibles to dock was a very popular theory. However, there were numerous obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced. These included existing laws concerning airships, the use of flammable, hydrogen - filled dirigibles, strong winds at the high altitude, and the stress a moored dirigible would add to the building's frame. Existing ""air traffic laws would make it illegal for a ship to tie up to the Empire State Building or even fly near it, since airships couldn't fly too low over urban areas (paragraph @NUM1). The destruction of the Hindenburg, a well - known hydrogen dirigible, helped the owners of the Empire State building realize how extremely dangerous dirigibles could be, especially if they combusted over downtown New York City (paragraph @NUM2). Strong winds also would be highly hazardous to dirigibles moored to the Empire State building, as the aircrafts couldn't be stably positioned way up in the air (paragraph @NUM3). The steel frame of the building would also have to be significantly modified to accommodate the stress added by a moored dirigible. All in all, it was very unrealistic to moor dirigibles to the Empire State Building, as it would pose unacceptable safety risks and was not feasible under the given circumstances."
512	15345	6	3	"Builders faced many obstacles such as safety, nature, flammability and law in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the mast. The first problem is that ""the mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose."" The dirigibles typically use hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is very flammable. The Hindenburg, a large German dirigible, was destroyed by a massive fire in New Jersey. After this incident, ""the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse [it] could have been if it [happened] over a densely populated area such as New York. The violent air currents also played a significant role. When the dirigible was moored, the back of the ship would swivel around and around uncontrollably. When dirigibles moored in landing fields, they would be weighted down with lead weights. These lead weights, if dropped from the height of the Empire State Building, would be extremely dangerous for pedestrians on the street. Also, there was a strict law against airships flying too low over urban areas. Considering all these factors, there was simply no way dirigibles would be able to safely and legally dock at the mast."
513	15346	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building in New York faced many challenges while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. One obstacle of the builders was creating the Empire State Building with sufficient strength to hold the dirigible, which would be swaying vigorously in the wind, without the building falling over. The weight of the large dirigible would have to be effectively transferred to the bottom of the building which was almost eleven hundred feet below. This required complex engineering solutions. The largest obstacle, however, was holding the dirigible in place while it was docked atop the building. The winds were ""constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" and would make the dirigible fly wildly around the top of the building (@CAPS1 paragraph @NUM1). These erratic winds made it nearly impossible to keep the dirigible stable. Due to the many dangers and engineering challenges related to the mooring mast and dirigibles, the building would never be used for its intended transportational purpose."
514	15347	6	3	While designing and building the mooring mast atop the Empire State building, the engineers seem to have ignored some seemingly useful information. As with any vehicle in the air or at sea, wind is either your enemy, or your friend. The engineers should have taken into greater consideration that the changing wind speeds and direction 1,250 feet in the air are huge threats. At such a high altitude, the wind can be extremely unpredictable. Your dirigible will have a hard time getting close enough to the mast to moor, as the wind may push it away. Never mind staying steady enough for passengers to exit and board safely. Also, if the law itself prevented you from floating your blimp at such low altitudes, then it's a non - starter. Why even bother if it's illegal? Although it seems like a futuristic sci - fi, and not to mention downright cool way to land a blimp, too many insurmountable things prevented the idea from prevailing, making it an unworkable concept.
515	15348	6	3	There were many obstacles that the Empire State building's owner faced. One obstacle was not having enough room for the dirigible to land. To help solve this problem, the architect added a mooring mast to increase the building's height. Another obstacle was that the steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be expanded in order for there to be more height added to the building. This expansion work was complex and would altogether cost over @MONEY1. The main reason, and the most significant obstacle, was safety. The owner had to make sure that the dirigible was not flammable, but in fact, it was. Wind and nature also played a big part in deciding whether to go through with the idea. The strong winds would make the dirigible swing and constantly shift. This would make the dirigible hang precariously over people on the streets of New York, which was clearly not safe. Given that the idea of landing dirigibles on top of the Empire State building was neither safe nor practical, and there were just too many struggles and obstacles, a plan like this would never be able to be successfully implemented.
516	15349	6	3	The builders faced many challenges while constructing the mooring mast on the Empire State Building. One major issue was that the building simply lacked the structural strength to support the weight of the dirigibles. Given this limitation, they had to reinforce the entire framework of the building. Specifically, they had to invest sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications to its framework. Additionally, having the appropriate equipment on the dirigibles was a problem. The dirigibles did not possess the correct docking tools to attach to this newly built mooring mast. Moreover, when docked, the back of the dirigibles could sway back and forth, which also posed a significant problem during the docking process. Another concern was that most dirigibles outside of the United States used hydrogen, a highly flammable gas. They did not want a potential fire hazard in close proximity to the building. In the end, these multiple obstacles made the process of using the mooring mast for dirigible docking extremely difficult.
517	15350	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building encountered numerous obstacles when attempting to enable dirigibles to dock there. The primary reason dirigibles couldn't dock was the heavy load they carried. This load would exert substantial stress on the building. Wind pressure was another significant factor. As stated, ""The wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" The dirigibles were docked using an electric winch. While the electric winch functioned adequately, it was also noted that ""the dirigible could swing in the breeze,"" which raised serious safety concerns. These combined issues ultimately made it unfeasible for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building."
518	15351	6	3	"In ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. One prominent concern was safety. As mentioned, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" (@NUM1) This clearly indicates that docking dirigibles could be extremely hazardous, as it could negatively impact buildings and endanger many people. The large business district is densely populated, making it inappropriate to allow such a risky activity. Additionally, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" (@NUM2) This obstacle not only put lives at risk but also could cause very expensive damage to the building. Another hurdle was ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" (@NUM3) All these obstacles were crucial and led to the abandonment of the idea of docking dirigibles atop the Empire State Building. The associated dangers were too significant, and now the top of the building serves much safer purposes."
519	15352	6	3	"There were numerous problems with the design of the dirigible docking system. The first problem stemmed from the practicality of the concept. The winds generated by updrafts in the cities are extremely violent, making it far too risky to land a blimp. As described, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Another obstacle was the structural design. The Empire State Building was not initially designed to moor blimps, and modifying the building to accommodate this was quite costly, amounting to ""over @NUM1 dollars' worth of modifications."" The final obstacle was the existence of laws that prohibited airships from flying too low over buildings, as stated, ""... an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" These impracticalities presented significant and challenging obstacles to the successful implementation of the dirigible docking system."
520	15353	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building had grand plans to use the building to make New York the leader in modern travel. They constructed a mooring mast with the intention of using it to dock dirigibles. Unfortunately, a series of unexpected difficulties emerged, preventing this goal from being achieved. When the architects first decided to add the mast to the Empire State Building, they quickly realized that they would have to completely redesign the building's support structure. This was necessary because a docked dirigible would exert a great deal of pressure on the building. Even after resolving this problem, there were still numerous obstacles in the way. The architects failed to anticipate many potential issues with the mast. Only after the mast was built did they discover that most dirigibles from outside the U.S. used hydrogen instead of helium to stay afloat. Hydrogen, being highly flammable, was a risk that the builders were not willing to take over a densely populated city. They also realized that the unpredictable high winds at the top of the mast would make it far too dangerous to dock a dirigible. Once these obstacles became apparent, it was clear that the Empire State Building would never serve as a docking site for dirigibles.
521	15354	6	3	According to the article “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered numerous obstacles during construction when it came to allowing dirigibles, or blimps, to dock. The most significant obstacles were the forces of nature, such as wind and gravity. As described in the article, the “winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents.” This made it extremely unsafe for both the passengers of the dirigible and the pedestrians below to be in close proximity to the blimp and the turbulent air. Moreover, the flammability of the hydrogen in the blimp was a major concern. Having a potential fire hazard that was @NUM1 feet long floating over a densely populated area like New York City was simply too risky. In addition, laws prohibited airships from flying too close over urban areas, which meant dirigibles couldn't even approach the mooring mast on the Empire State Building. A test run with the U.S. navy dirigible Los Angeles clearly demonstrated that it was both too dangerous and impractical, as the dirigible couldn't even get close enough to tie up. All in all, the idea of a mooring mast on the Empire State Building was ingenious, but the numerous obstacles that arose made it unfeasible for practical use.
522	15355	6	3	Architects faced a multitude of problems when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. The very first challenge they encountered was adding a mooring mast to the building. They couldn't simply place one on top; instead, they had to go back and reinforce the entire skeletal structure of the building. This was a complex and time - consuming task. Another major problem was the potential disaster if a dirigible were to fail, similar to the Hindenburg. If such an incident occurred, the dirigible would plunge in a ball of fire towards the highly populated city below. The most significant problems, however, came from nature itself. There were violent winds constantly blowing at the top of the building. If a dirigible had been tethered down, it would move violently and could potentially crash down on pedestrians below. This was far too great a risk for the architects to take, and ultimately, it made the plan of dirigible docking on the building unworkable.
523	15356	6	3	When attempting to add a mooring mast to the Empire State Building, the workers faced several impediments. Right from the start, the builders had to take the large size of a dirigible into account. If a dirigible of such a large size were to be docked at the top of the building, the building's frame would be severely warped. To address this problem, they had to invest over sixty thousand dollars to modify the original framework to a more suitable one. Another obstacle was that the building had sharp edges which could cause damage to a dirigible attempting to dock. Additionally, they realized that the mast was located above a large urban area. In the event of an accident, it could lead to extremely bad situations. There was also a law restricting aircraft from flying too low over a city. All these factors combined made it clear that the dirigible mooring dock atop the Empire State Building was not a practical or viable idea.
524	15357	6	3	There were many obstacles the Empire State Building faced in its attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. Dirigibles were docked using an electric winch. The greatest obstacle for the mooring mast was nature. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around the mast. In open landing fields, dirigibles could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but this was neither practical nor safe in the context of New York City. One of the major issues was the lack of a suitable landing area. A mooring mast added to the top of the building was intended to allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling, servicing, and for passengers to embark and disembark. However, due to the natural obstacles, achieving this goal proved to be very difficult. In the end, these challenges made it unlikely that the dirigible docking plan would be successful.
525	15358	6	3	There were many different obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. For instance, an existing law stipulated that airships could not fly too low over urban areas. This meant that a dirigible couldn't tie up to the building or even approach the area. Another problem was ensuring that the mast was strong enough to support a dirigible. As stated in paragraph @NUM1, “A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame.” This clearly indicated that significant improvements had to be made to the mast. One of the most critical problems was the fact that dirigibles were filled with hydrogen, a highly flammable gas. The building's owners vividly remembered the German dirigible Hindenburg, which was destroyed by fire in 1937. They were well - aware that if a similar accident were to happen over a densely populated area, the consequences would be far more catastrophic. Considering all these obstacles, it became evident that allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was an extremely challenging and perhaps unachievable task.
526	15359	6	3	There were a few notable obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. A dirigible, essentially a blimp, consists of giant steel balloons that are filled with hydrogen and helium. In New York, dirigibles had a distinct lack of a suitable landing area. Al Smith, a well - known four - term governor of New York, came up with the idea. Adding a mooring mast to the Empire State Building, he thought, would enable dirigibles to anchor there, fuel up, and allow passengers to safely get on and off. The architects and builders had to consult with experts. So, they approached workers at the @ORGANIZATION2, carefully tested the mass, and met with the president of a recently formed airship transport company. After overcoming all those obstacles, they could finally build the mooring mast.
527	15360	6	3	"The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted vividly describes the building of the mast of the Empire State Building. Initially, the mast was added to increase the height of the thousand - foot building. However, Al Smith, one of the key builders, had a grander vision. He wanted the mast to ""serve the higher calling"" of providing a docking station for dirigibles. This idea, although innovative, proved to be very challenging. First, the builders had to make significant changes to the structure of the tower. They needed to make it strong enough to support the weight of the dirigible swaying vigorously in the wind. L¸sted writes, ""The stress of the dirigible's load... Would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation..."" When the mast was finally built, the builders were confronted with the problem of having the dirigibles ""dangling high above pedestrians on the street."" A fall of one of these dirigibles would mean certain death for hundreds of people. Finally, there was a strict law that prevented ""airships flying too low over urban areas."" By docking at the Empire State Building, the dirigibles would clearly be breaking that law. Although it was a good - intentioned idea, ""The Mooring Mast"" clearly shows that it would not be feasible for dirigibles to dock atop the Empire State Building."
528	15361	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous and significant obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there. Safety was the most prominent concern at every stage of the plan. The recent and tragic explosion of the Hindenburg served as a stark reminder of the potential problems in docking these aircraft. If a blimp were to explode in downtown New York, it could result in an absolute disaster. Another major obstacle was nature. The winds on the top of the building were in a constant state of change. The unpredictable wind conditions atop the building made the idea of mooring a zeppelin seem extremely illogical. At that time, laws against flying low in urban areas were emerging. These laws would make docking the airships at the Empire State Building illegal. The idea of making the Empire State Building a mooring post was indeed an engineering feat, but the practical usage of it was simply not viable.
529	15362	6	3	The obstacles the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock were quite substantial. A thousand - foot dirigibe moored at the top of the building would impose a significant amount of stress on the building's frame. Moreover, the stress of the dirigibe's load and the wind pressure would have to be properly transmitted. This transmission would need to reach the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. To handle this, the steel frame would have to undergo modifications and strengthening. This process was estimated to cost over sixty thousand dollars, making it a costly and complex endeavor.
530	15363	6	3	The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced were truly difficult. The workers had to take great care to ensure that the building did not become so tall that it would start to tilt. This required precise engineering and constant monitoring during the construction process. Additionally, the workers also faced intense competition. They were determined to make their building the biggest. They did not give up until their building became the tallest building in @CAPS1, achieving their goal through hard work and perseverance.
531	15364	6	3	Builders trying to allow dirigibles to dock on top of the Empire State Building faced numerous problems. The dirigibles' weight and the strong wind pressure would add significant stress to the building. This stress would have to be transmitted more than 100 ft down to the building's foundation. Construction wasn't the only hurdle. Most German - American dirigibles are held afloat by helium which is extremely flammable. If it was ignited over busy and crowded New York streets, many people could have been killed. Nature added to the difficulties. Wind currents had the potential to push dirigibles into neighboring buildings, causing them to pop. The final problem was a law already in place which didn't allow low - flying aircrafts. Builders faced problems with nature, the law, safety, and construction which ultimately led to the demise of the use of the mooring system.
532	15365	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced tremendous obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First, any modifications to accommodate dirigibles would require a substantial amount of additional money. Anything done on top of a building so large would have to be balanced by strengthening the foundation. According to paragraph 3, ""over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" Another large obstacle the builders would have to deal with was finding a way to neutralize the violent wind currents atop the 1454 ft. building. Even if the front of the dirigible was anchored to the mooring, the back would be left to sway violently in the wind. Any accident or damage done to a dirigible over such a highly populated area such as downtown New York would have truly devastating results. In conclusion, the risks of allowing dirigibles to dock atop the Empire State Building clearly outweighed the rewards. When dirigible travel became less practical, the plan was scrapped completely, and the building continued to stand as an iconic structure without the intended dirigible docking feature."
533	15366	6	3	Many obstacles were encountered while trying to get the Empire State Building to allow dirigibles to dock there. This was a long, hard, and carefully thought - out process. Workers couldn't simply drop a mooring mast on top of the building's roof. A one - thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, being held by a single cable tether, added a great deal of stress to the building's frame. The architects also had to build a shiny glass and chrome - nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from inside, with a stepped - back design that imitated the overall shape of the building. Later on, they realized dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building. One reason being a strict law against airships flying too low over urban areas. Architects went through many obstacles in building the masts, and these challenges ultimately led to the abandonment of the idea of dirigible docking at the building.
534	15367	6	3	"Problems the builders of the Empire State Building came across were some tricky, life - threatening ones. The first, as mentioned in paragraph 2, is that if a dirigible was to try and dock and something went wrong and it caught on fire, there would be serious damage done to the people below on the streets. Another obstacle the builders had to deal with was the ""greatest obstacle"" in paragraph 4, the fact that the wind atop the tower would be violently whipping the dirigible around with just a cable holding it to the mooring mast. This situation would not make it safe for anyone around the building or in the blimp. One other reason the builders had to figure out when building the mast was that no airships flying low could enter the area as mentioned in paragraph 6. Those are some of the problems the builders had to face if they wished to dock dirigibles on the building, and these issues made the plan unfeasible."
535	15368	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted, it explains the Empire State Building's past construction which led it to be the tallest building in the United States. Although the builder Al Smith had many obstacles, they faced one of the hardest ones when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the obstacles is allowing dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers off and on. Another obstacle is letting dirigibles dock because they need a proper place to tie up to a mast. It is stated, ""Dirigibles were docked by means of an electric winch, which hauled in a line from the front of the ship and then tied it to a mast"" (Lusted 15). This can be a problem because the body of the mast could swing a great deal in a strong breeze. Although there were many obstacles, Al Smith worked his way around them with determination. He showed courage to take on all these challenges and proceeded to finish the Empire State Building, which stands today as a symbol of human perseverance in the face of difficult engineering feats."
536	15369	6	3	"In this excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"", @ORGANIZATION2 meticulously describes the architectural, chemical, and legal challenges that firmly prevented the construction of a mooring dock for dirigibles on the lofty top of the Empire State Building. Despite the eagerness and readiness of then - @CAPS1 Al Smith, who publicly and enthusiastically announced the plan, and of John Tauranac, who optimistically reported that the top of the Empire State Building ""would serve a higher calling [than] to add a desired few feet,"" @ORGANIZATION2 strongly contends that the failure of the mast ""should have been apparent before it was ever constructed"". According to the article, the mast, and a moored dirigible, ""would add significant stress to the building's frame."" A substantial sum of more than sixty thousand dollars was spent to accommodate the pressure. Foreign dirigibles also commonly contained hydrogen, which was far more flammable than the helium used by American dirigibles. An explosion above the Empire State Building would be utterly devastating to the bustling city. An existing law strictly prevented dirigibles from ""even approach[ing]"" the building. @ORGANIZATION2 effectively uses these reasons to comprehensively detail the unrealistic nature of the mooring mast, ultimately showing that the plan was doomed from the start."
537	15370	6	3	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were indeed difficult. One of the major obstacles they encountered was the need to fix the Empire State Building, and the associated cost was extremely high. For example, in the excerpt, it clearly stated ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be extensively modified and strengthened to accommodate the new situation. Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" This significant financial burden was a major deterrent. The plan never fully went through because safety was a paramount issue. The risk of fire and people getting hurt on the busy streets below was a big risk they simply could not take. It was also strictly illegal for airships to fly too low over urban areas. The numerous obstacles that the builders had to face made the idea of dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building impossible to realize."
538	15371	6	3	The architects had few problems, but they were significant. As clearly stated in @LOCATION1, the stress from the Dirigibles Load was far too much for The building. They would incur over sixty thousand Dollars of costly modifications. Other than that, they also had to carefully redesign the building's structure and then painstakingly make the necessary changes. These challenges were substantial and made the process of accommodating dirigibles at the building extremely difficult, ultimately showing that the plan faced insurmountable hurdles.
539	15372	6	3	"In the short story, ""The Mooring Mast,"" there were several obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One prominent problem was the combined effect of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure on the building's foundation. ""The stress of the dirigible's load along with the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be thoroughly modified and strengthened to accommodate this new and challenging situation."" Evidently, this was a major and complex obstacle for the landing process of the dirigibles. Another problem they had was that dirigibles use hydrogen, and hydrogen is highly flammable. If it had caught fire, it would have been a disaster for a densely populated city. ""The Mooring Mast of the Empire State Building was destined never to fulfill its purpose. Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" If the dirigible caught the building on fire, many people's lives would be in grave danger. In conclusion, the Mooring Mast did not work out for many reasons, but safety and the dirigible's load and wind pressure on the building's foundation were two significant and insurmountable obstacles for allowing dirigibles to dock."
540	15373	6	3	"The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were numerous, but the main obstacles consisted of the significant danger that dirigibles posed, the unpredictable forces of nature, and an existing law against letting airships fly too low over the suburban areas. According to the reading, the danger that dirigibles posed was that ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is considered highly flammable"". This danger was vividly emphasized by the tragic incident of the German dirigible Hindenburg when it was completely destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey. Nature was also a great and unrelenting obstacle because of the ""winds on top of the building"" that ""were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". Because of these strong and erratic winds, it was almost impossible to dock a dirigible on the mooring mast without it moving around wildly. The last obstacle, the law, ""would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. Unless the law was revoked, the mooring mast would never be able to work. However, the obstacle that the builders faced when designing the actual mast itself was that ""the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened"" because ""the stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation"" which turned out to be ""over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications."" In the end, these multiple and formidable obstacles made the idea of dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building unfeasible."
541	15374	6	3	During the construction of the Empire State Building, the builders had to face many challenges in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. In the reading selection “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon Lusted, it discusses many of the challenges that were faced. For example, an obstacle they had to face was finding a landing area because there was a huge lack of suitable landing area in New York City. The second challenge they faced was how to make dirigibles global, so they had a meeting with the president of a formed airship transport company that would use the dirigibles' service across the Pacific Ocean. The architects had meetings with the government about safe ways of mooring airships to this mast. The builders went through many challenges to use the dirigibles, but eventually, it wasn't enough to put the plan into effect. In the end, the difficulties proved insurmountable, and the idea of dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building had to be abandoned.
542	15375	6	3	One obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was how to do it safely. According to the reading, it says that “most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable.” This posed a significant risk as any spark or fire could lead to a catastrophic explosion. Another obstacle was nature itself. This sentence, “the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents,” located at the beginning of paragraph @NUM1, proves that docking dirigibles at the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building was unsafe. The unpredictable winds could easily push the dirigibles off - course or cause them to crash into the building. Last but not least, another reason why dirigibles could not dock was because it was illegal. There was “an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas.” Because of that law, it would make it illegal for dirigibles to even approach the area. Therefore, it would be impossible for a ship to land there. In conclusion, these multiple obstacles made it unfeasible for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
543	15376	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. For instance, in paragraph @NUM1, the author mentions that they had to consider the Hindenburg incident that took place on May 6, 1937. “The owners of the Empire State building realized how much worse the accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York,” says the author. They realized that the safety of the people has to come first in all scenarios. The image of a burning dirigible over a crowded city was a terrifying thought. Also, another obstacle that Al Smith and the builders faced was docking the dirigible when people are down below. In paragraph @NUM2, the author says: “The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself.” Usually, dirigibles are often docked in open fields, where weights to hold down the back of the ship could be used safely. But above a highly populated area was out of the question because lead weights dangling high above pedestrians is a safety violation. The builders had many obstacles in designing the use of the mooring mast. In the end, these obstacles combined made it clear that allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was not a practical idea.
544	15377	6	3	There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The thousand - foot dirigible on top of the Empire State Building could add stress to the building's frame. The stress from the dirigible was way too much to carry, and the frame of the building would have to have been modified and strengthened to be able to hold the dirigible. This would require significant engineering work and additional materials. There were many risks taken by landing a dirigible atop the Empire State Building. The potential for structural damage to the building could endanger the lives of those inside and around it. In conclusion, the obstacles and risks involved in allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building were too great to be ignored.
545	15378	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the problems was that a thousand - foot dirigible held by a single cable tether would add stress to the frame. The obstacle they went through was to make the frame stronger. In paragraph @NUM1 it states the obstacle they went through to make the building stronger. “The architects designed a shiny glass and chrome - nickel stainless steel tower.” and “The rocket - shaped mast would have four wings at its corners.” These design features were intended to enhance the building's strength and stability. Other obstacles they went through was making sure the mooring mast was tall enough, and in paragraph @NUM2 Smith says, “people in Washington are figuring on some safe way of mooring airships to this mast.” Despite their efforts to overcome these obstacles, the challenges remained significant. In the end, it was difficult to ensure that dirigibles could dock safely at the Empire State Building.
546	15379	6	3	"The builders from this excerpt faced quite a few challenges in trying to let dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building. First off, the entire structure of the Empire State Building would need a significant alteration. Having a mooring mast atop the building with a dirigible firmly attached would exert great amounts of stress on the building's robust frame. The high - quality stainless steel in the structure's frame would need to be carefully modified to enhance its strength. However, this modification process is not only technically demanding but also very costly. The excerpt says, ""A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame"" (paragraph @NUM1). Another challenge the builders faced was dealing with existing laws that had already been firmly in place. The government, out of safety concerns, did not want aircrafts flying too low over buildings. The excerpt says, ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against aircrafts flying too low over urban areas."" (paragraph @NUM2). The excerpt also mentions that this law would make it strictly illegal for an aircraft to ever tie up to a building or even approach it closely. Due to these significant challenges, the plan to let dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building faced insurmountable obstacles."
547	15380	6	3	"There were three main obstacles in building a dock for dirigibles on top of the Empire State Building. The first problem was safety. Most dirigibles from outside of the U.S. were highly flammable because they ""used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is extremely flammable."" When the tragic incident of the Hindenburg's destruction occurred, they realized that if such an accident happened over a highly populated city like New York, it would have been much worse, with potentially countless casualties. Another problem was nature. The winds at the top of the building were ""constantly shifting due to violent air currents,"" and the back of the dirigible would ""swivel around and around the mooring mast"" erratically. This made the docking process extremely dangerous and unreliable. The third problem was that there was a law in place. As L¸sted says, ""[there] was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" In order for the ships to even approach the building safely, the building would have to be much taller. Considering these multiple and serious obstacles, it became clear that building a dock for dirigibles on the Empire State Building was an unfeasible plan."
548	15381	6	3	Building a big piece of work is far from easy. You have to carefully fix all the negatives and ensure that everything is done correctly. At times, you never know when you have to tear things down and start over to make sure the hard work is completed right. When looking back, you need to assess what you did right to prevent bad things from occurring. You may face a whole bunch of issues when building. The Empire State Building faced attempts to dock dirigibles, but when the docking was not performed or built right, there were problems. Even though it was said that people could swing to climb on as the build pressure increased, it was not a practical or safe solution. Building things is indeed hard. You experience both the beauty and the hardship of it. It helps you be reminded of the work that has been done correctly. In the end, building requires patience, attention to detail, and the ability to overcome various challenges.
549	15382	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State building faced a multitude of problems in attempting to have the dirigibles dock there. Some of the most apparent reasons were because of what the dirigibles were made out of, the weather conditions, and existing laws about airships flying over urban areas. Dirigibles were not made out of the safest materials; most were made with hydrogen, which is extremely flammable. This would make the docking station highly unsafe if the dirigible ever caught on fire. If the dirigible were to ever get caught on fire, the accident would be very severe, since the station would be located over a densely populated area. In paragraph @NUM1, it says ""the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" Due to the violent air currents atop the Empire State building, the ship would swivel around the mooring mast in an unpredictable manner, making it extremely unsafe to dock there. If something happened to the dirigible, it would pose a great threat to the many pedestrians below it. The last reason for the docking station not being built is in paragraph @NUM2 because of ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" It would be illegal for a dirigible to tie up to the docking station because of this law. This law exists because of the high winds, with authorities fearing that they would blow the dirigible onto other buildings. In conclusion, the docking station was unable to be built because of these safety reasons and existing laws."
550	15383	6	3	The builders of the Empire State building faced a plethora of problems as they attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there. The largest problems the builders encountered were due to safety and actually mooring the dirigible itself. The hydrogen used within the dirigible was highly unsafe, as hydrogen is very flammable. If the hydrogen caught on fire, especially over a place as densely populated as New York City, many innocent people would be harmed, and the damage would be extensive. Additionally, the builders were faced with the difficult task of mooring the dirigible. Dirigibles were normally anchored with heavy lead weights. However, if one used those weights to anchor the dirigible above city streets, the pedestrians below could potentially be seriously injured by the falling weights. Actually allowing the dirigible to dock brought up another problem for the builders to address: if the dirigible was tethered to the mast on top of the Empire State Building, the dirigible would swing around and around the mast due to the wind. Ultimately, the builders were unable to address these issues effectively, and the Empire State Building is now used mainly as an observation deck and office building, a far cry from the original plan of a dirigible docking station.
551	15384	6	3	"Docking a dirigible on top of the Empire State Building is an extremely challenging feat that will most likely never be accomplished. The main overall concern with allowing this is safety. In the book by @CAPS1 @NUM1, the author thoroughly discusses the infamous destruction of the Hindenburg, and the architects quickly realized that the accident would have been even more catastrophic, had it taken place over a bustling city like New York. Nature also played a significant role in this struggle over making this mast work. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air - currents"" (@CAPS1 @NUM2). The author then goes on to vividly describe how the dirigible would swing around the mast precariously. And trying to weigh it down ""was neither practical nor safe"" (@CAPS1 @NUM2). The final and most obvious reason this mast could not work was that a law was passed; a law that strictly prohibited dirigibles from flying too low to an urban area. This meant that a dirigible could not legally approach the mast. These architects had very little working in their favor and almost everything working against them, ultimately making the goal of dirigible docking on the Empire State Building an unachievable dream."
552	15385	6	3	In the excerpt, The Mooring @CAPS1 by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building were confronted with a truly arduous task. They were in the process of constructing the tallest building in the world, and when Al Smith, the head in charge of the building's construction, demanded that it be made even taller, things became even more difficult. Mainly because they had the ambitious plan of using this new - found height as a dock for dirigibles. What they didn't fully anticipate is that it is a little more complex than just tying up a blimp to a building. They had numerous obstacles at hand. The architects would have to make substantial modifications to the building because a thousand - foot dirigible moored on the building would add a great deal of stress to its structure. Dirigibles used hydrogen, which is extremely flammable. If it were to catch on fire in downtown New York, it would be a truly disastrous event. Nature poses a significant threat as well. The strong winds on top of the building would cause the dirigible to swivel around wildly. The final obstacle is that there is a law that strictly prohibits airships from flying too low in urban areas. In the end, despite their efforts, the plan failed, highlighting the insurmountable challenges they faced.
553	15386	6	3	They @CAPS1 encountered a significant problem with people @CAPS2 discussing Airship on @CAPS3 @CAPS4 in relation to the @ORGANIZATION1. This issue likely stemmed from various factors such as safety concerns, logistical difficulties, or regulatory constraints. These problems made it quite challenging to have a smooth - running discussion about airships in this context. Overall, the situation regarding people's conversations about airships in this particular setting was fraught with difficulties and ultimately hindered the progress of related matters.
554	15387	6	3	"Al Smith and the engineers faced numerous obstructions attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. One major obstacle that they faced was that most of the dirigibles used hydrogen. Hydrogen is a highly flammable chemical, and if a fire were to break out, it could have led to the Empire State Building burning down and potentially killing millions of people in the densely populated area. Another obstacle they faced was mother nature. At a height like 1,250 ft, there are incredibly strong winds blowing. These winds can be sudden and unexpected, and they can blow the dirigible into the building, causing a fatal accident. Finally, the law prohibits the dirigible from ""flying too low over urban areas."" Therefore, doing this would be illegal. The building faced many challenges, and while it managed to overcome some of them, in the end, it would be extremely unsafe to proceed with the plan for the mooring mast, making it an unviable option."
555	15388	6	3	In the excerpt, The Mooring Mast, by the author @ORGANIZATION1, the obstacles that the builders of the Empire State building @CAPS1 faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were quite substantial. The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building's flat roof. They initially planned to attach a single cable tether, but they soon realized that it would add a significant amount of stress to the building's frame. To address this, they designed a shiny glass and chrome - nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from inside, aiming to strengthen the building's structure. However, when they tried to implement the plan, the wind was too strong. The wind was constantly shifting due to violent air currents. The back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast uncontrollably. They also couldn't proceed because there was a law that strictly prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas. In conclusion, these multiple obstacles made it impossible for the builders to achieve the goal of dirigible docking on the Empire State Building.
556	15389	6	3	There were several obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in allowing dirigibles to dock there. One significant problem is that if they were to tie a single cable tether to the building and the blimp, then it would add substantial stress to the building's frame. The stress from the blimp's load, along with the wind pressure, had to be transmitted all the way to the base of the building, which was @DATE1 ft. below. Another problem that arose later was that other blimps outside the United States were made with hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. Now, since the German blimp, the Hindenburg, blew up in a fire over @CAPS1, New Jersey, architects are now worried that it would be a bad idea to allow blimps to dock at the Empire State Building because if a similar incident happened over @LOCATION3 city, many more lives would be in danger. Also, yet another obstacle came up due to nature itself. The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to violent wind currents. Even if the blimp was tethered to the mooring mast, the rear end of the blimp would be all over the place. That's why now, blimps dock on the ground and are held down by weights on @NUM1 sides. One other reason that this is a problem is that docking a blimp at the Empire State Building would be illegal because it is flying too low to the ground. This law also makes it illegal for the blimp to dock onto the building. In conclusion, these multiple obstacles made it unfeasible for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
557	15390	6	3	There were many obstacles the builders had to take into account. One major obstacle was that the steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be carefully modified. This was because the dirigible's load and wind pressure would have been transmitted all the way to the building's foundation. They had to pay over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications to the building's framework, which involved strengthening certain parts and adjusting the overall structure to handle the additional stress. In conclusion, these costly modifications were just one of the many challenges the builders faced in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
558	15391	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building had to overcome many obstacles in order for dirigibles to dock there. The builders first had to figure out a proper way for the dirigibles to attach to the Empire State Building, specifically for ""refueling or service, and to let passengers on and off"" (∂ 6). This required careful planning and the design of appropriate attachment mechanisms. The builders also had to figure out a way to securely attach the mooring mast to the top of the building. According to the text, with a dirigible attached by only a single wire to the building, more stress would be added to the building's frame, so they could not simply drop the mooring mast on top of the building. Also because of this added stress, the builders had to carefully edit the foundation, so it would not collapse if a dirigible was attached. Finally, the builders needed to overcome the challenges posed by nature. They did not initially anticipate that the winds on top of the building were shifting constantly, and since they are in a densely populated city, if things went wrong, many people could be harmed. In conclusion, these numerous obstacles made it extremely difficult for the builders to achieve the goal of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building."
559	15392	6	3	"On the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" written by @ORGANIZATION2, the obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced were very difficult, and in my understanding, it wasn't a successful endeavor. Architects and engineers of the Empire State Building consulted with experts of the @PERSON1 air station. The navy leader offered its dirigible to be used in testing the mast. In figuring out if it was okay for the mast to be used, architects couldn't simply drop a mooring mast because it would cause significant stress to the building's frame. Also, the mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its intended purpose. It wasn't safe enough, and because those dirigibles that come from outside the @LOCATION2 don't always use helium; instead, they use hydrogen which is highly flammable. This is a bad idea to have in the @CAPS1 of downtown New York, where a large number of people are present. In conclusion, these safety - related and technical obstacles made it impossible for the mooring mast to serve its purpose of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building."
560	15393	6	3	In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders had to face many obstacles in an attempt to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building. Though this idea was not successful, it took them a long time to fully realize the causes and effects of docking dirigibles. Over sixty thousand dollars were spent on modifications for the building, which included changes to the structure to handle the potential stress from the dirigibles. After fixing the structure of the building, the builders found out that the weather had interfered. Because of the high winds, the dirigibles were constantly shifting. There wasn't a safe and reliable way to control this shifting. There was also a law against airships flying too low over populated cities. Another reason was that dirigibles were very dangerous and highly flammable. Trying to build a mooring mast was not a good idea as all these factors combined made it an unviable option. In conclusion, the combination of structural challenges, weather issues, legal restrictions, and safety concerns made it impossible for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
561	15394	6	3	"The architects of late 1920s and 1930s New York had grand plans to revolutionize air travel, and put New York at the forefront of modern travel. However, their wild ideas fell short when faced with reality. In an attempt to outstrip the Chrysler Building, architect Al Smith added an unsecure mast to the top of the Empire State Building. The proposed area, where blimps, or dirigibles, could let on and off passengers and refuel, had more hype than in - depth study. The biggest obstacle the builders faced was safety. Since most blimps outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, they were extremely flammable. If the German blimp ""Hindenburg"" had blown up above a more densely populated area than New Jersey, such as New York, the results would have been far more devastating. As paragraph @NUM1 states, even if the mast were a success, the weather would prove to be fatal. Even when the ship was tethered to the mast, it would still swivel around uncontrollably. The U.S. Navy tried to tie up next to the mast - before a law was passed not allowing aircraft to fly so low - but the strong wind made their efforts futile. The architects of the 1920s and 1930s were thinking big, but some obstacles were simply too big to overcome."
562	15395	6	3	When the idea of creating a mooring post for dirigibles on top of the Empire State Building emerged, there were several problems engineers failed to recognize. The first was the significant problem of using highly flammable hydrogen to fill the dirigibles. The Hindenburg accident clearly showed how horrible it is when one of these explodes. The situation would have been much worse had it been over @NUM1 stories in the air, endangering countless lives below. Secondly, violent wind gusts would have made it completely impossible to dock the dirigible atop the building. This was especially true as the use of customary lead weights would be both unsafe and not practical in such a high - rise setting. Lastly, there was a law imposed before this project was ever a thought, making it unlawful to fly any airship that low to an urban area. In the end, these overlooked problems made the idea of a mooring post for dirigibles on the Empire State Building unfeasible.
563	15396	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"", it is clear the architects were blind to the problems of the mast. Al Smith was becoming overly competitive to build the tallest building, and this intense competition was blinding him to potential risks. The people, eager to progress transportation of their time, had not fully analyzed the future complications. In designing the mast, paragraph nine quotes, ""a thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of a building... would add stress to the building's frame"". Even in the early progression of the mast, it was clear this may not work. Two months later, the building was reframed and the mast was added. On May 6, 1937, owners of the building realized that if an accident like the destruction of 'Hindenburg' occurred atop the building, it would be a devastating event to happen above the densely populated Downtown New York (paragraph @NUM1). Another obstacle, as said in paragraph @NUM2, is nature itself. Winds at such high elevations were often unpredictable and would be extremely dangerous as a tethered dirigible would swivel around and around the mast. Therefore, the mooring mast atop the Empire State Building never fulfilled its destiny, but is now a site tourists flock to. By the end of the 1930's, the idea of dirigibles as future transportation was replaced by airplanes, marking the end of an ambitious but flawed vision."
564	15397	6	3	"The builders - designers of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock at the top. The first, and most apparent one was the frame of the building. The article says, ""the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on the top of the @ORGANIZATION1 flat roof"" (@NUM1). The addition of a thousand - foot tower would add extra strain on the building's frame, potentially compromising its structural integrity. Next was the crucial question of safety. Most international dirigibles were filled with hydrogen, a very dangerous gas, and if set on fire, it would make a huge explosion, as demonstrated by the example of the German dirigible the Hindenburg. If that same accident took place over New York City, many pedestrians on the busy streets below would be hurt or killed. Also, the wind played a huge obstacle. The winds ""were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (@NUM2) and therefore the back of the ship would ""swivel around and around the mooring mast"", which would be extremely unsafe for both the dirigible and anyone nearby. Lastly, and most simply, the law didn't allow for an airship to fly that low over urban areas. All of these obstacles put together caused the idea of using the building as a docking tower to fail, showing that even the most ambitious plans need to account for practical constraints."
565	15398	6	3	"There would have been many obstacles the builders of the @ORGANIZATION1 would have had to face if they decided to allow dirigibles (blimps) to dock there. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" On @DATE1, the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in @LOCATION3, New Jersey. The owners quickly realized how much worse it would have been if such an incident occurred over a place like New York City, with its large number of people and high - density buildings. Another big obstacle would have been nature itself. ""The winds on top of the @ORGANIZATION1 were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" If the dirigible was tied to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would move around erratically, making it extremely hard for pedestrians to get on and off safely. If they had weighed it down with a lead weight, then there would be a heavy piece of lead hanging precariously over the pedestrians of New York City. The final obstacle that builders of the Empire State @ORGANIZATION1 would have had to face ""was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"". This law would not allow the dirigibles to dock on top of the @ORGANIZATION1. They would not even be allowed to approach the @ORGANIZATION1, effectively putting an end to the idea of using the building as a dirigible docking station."
566	15399	6	3	"The Empire State Building, an iconic skyscraper, is indeed one of the tallest buildings ever constructed. It was precisely because of its great height and the challenging conditions at its peak that it was impossible for a blimp to dock on the mooring mast. The article by @ORGANIZATION1 titled ""The Mooring Mast"" vividly describes the problems blimps may have encountered. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" It's true that should a blimp attempt to moor there, it would do nothing but twirl around the mooring mast. Moreover, it could crash into other nearby buildings or tear up the mooring mast. Clearly, there was so much the builders didn't thoroughly look into, which ultimately made the idea of blimp docking unfeasible."
567	15400	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building, a colossal and well - known structure, faced a few significant obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock on top of this very huge building. The first obstacle they realized was the serious safety issues. Most dirigibles at that time used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is extremely flammable, posing a high - risk threat. Another tough obstacle that would be hard to avoid was nature in general, as the author mentioned. The wind currents at the top of the building were sporadic and erratic, and this could be a huge problem for the dirigibles trying to dock safely. However, the biggest obstacle that the builders never fully realized was that it was even illegal. The height of the Empire State Building was too low for an aircraft of any sort to dock on, as it could pose a danger to the urban areas underneath. These were the main obstacles which caused the mooring mast to ultimately fail in its intended purpose.
568	15401	6	3	The builders didn't have a suitable landing area for the Dirigible. If the Dirigible were to land on the Empire State Building's flat roof, it would add excessive stress to the building's structure. Money was one of the big issues the builders faced, as constructing a proper docking facility required significant financial resources. In paragraph @NUM1, it's stated that the greatest obstacle was nature. The heavy winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to the violent air current. For the Dirigible itself, it would swivel around the mooring mast, which not only endangered the vessel but also the safety of the people on board and on the ground. Another obstacle was the law. Flying too low over urban areas was not allowed, as it could pose risks to the population below. All these factors combined made the idea of Dirigible docking at the Empire State Building unworkable.
569	15402	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were to build a structure with a stable enough top to be able to firmly hold a dirigible. Once the Chrysler Building became taller than the Empire State Building, the allure and practicality of the idea of dirigibles slowly faded away, almost unnoticed. For example, in paragraph @NUM1, Al Smith said he would put a top or hat on the building to make it taller. The only problem is that instead of dirigibles docking there properly, they would just sit next to the point of the building, which was not a functional docking solution. If Smith wasn't so competitive and focused on height, the blimps would have had a nice, flat platform to dock on, and the original plan might have had a better chance of success.
570	15403	6	3	In constructing and building the Empire State Building to make it allowable for dirigibles to dock there, the builders had to engage in a great deal of careful thinking. First, they had to assess what the building could handle and try to accurately calculate the weight and forces it could hold so that the building wouldn't fall under the additional load. Then, they had to figure out the safety of the passengers on the dirigibles and the pedestrians on the ground, devising a way to get in and out as safe and easy as possible. Despite all the hard work the builders put into crafting Al Smith's idea, the chances just weren't realistic at all to the public. There were too many challenges in terms of safety, practicality, and cost. Eventually, the plan had to be shut down. Although it makes a good story, it serves as a crucial learning block for constructers to consider all aspects thoroughly in future projects.
571	15404	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast,"" by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1, the builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous and significant obstacles in their ambitious attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the first and most fundamental problems they encountered was the lack of a suitable landing area. As stated, ""The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York was the lack of suitable landing area."" (@CAPS1 6). This was a major set - back because without a proper landing spot, they had nowhere to safely land these large dirigibles. Without a reliable landing, it was impossible to modernize traveling using dirigibles at the Empire State Building. Another problem that the builders had to grapple with was safety. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). This posed a serious issue as it was unfeasible to allow dirigibles that could potentially cause a large - scale explosion and endanger the lives of people in the area. They simply could not take the risk of having such a dangerous element in close proximity to a populated building. A third problem was related to nature and the weather. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" (@CAPS1 @NUM2). The blimps had a very unsteady landing as the winds would thrash them around. This was extremely unsafe and made it nearly impossible to dock dirigibles safely, which is why it became a significant obstacle for the builders. In conclusion, these multiple obstacles made it extremely challenging, if not impossible, for the builders to achieve their goal of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building."
572	15405	6	3	The obstacles that builders faced at the Empire State Building in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there are quite significant. One of the concerns is the possible dangers of having something fall on them. With dirigibles docking, there is a risk of parts of the dirigible or equipment falling from the height. Moreover, the hydrogen used in many dirigibles is highly flammable. This means that the dirigible could blow up and ignite anyone around it, causing a large - scale disaster. Another issue is the structural integrity of the Empire State Building. The building may not be strong enough to withstand the movement of the dirigible. The back side of the dirigible moving so much due to the dangerous winds could put excessive stress on the building. As a result, the dirigible could possibly pull off part of the building, which could then endanger nearby pedestrians. In conclusion, these obstacles, from safety risks to structural concerns, made it very difficult for the builders to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
573	15406	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock were complex. When the Empire State Building was initially conceived, it was planned as the world's tallest and most advanced structure. However, at that time, the new Chrysler Building was being constructed at Forty - Second Street and @CAPS1 Avenue in New York. Before the Empire State Building began construction, Al Smith was determined to outstrip the Chrysler Building. The idea was to have dirigibles or zeppelins dock at the Empire State Building, and the @ORGANIZATION2 was going to have a mooring mast at its top for docking. But this plan faced many challenges. The competition from the Chrysler Building was one aspect, and there were also technical and safety issues related to docking dirigibles. In conclusion, despite the grand vision of having dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building, these various obstacles made it a difficult goal to achieve.
574	15407	6	3	There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in their arduous attempt to allow dirigibles to dock. One of the prominent obstacles was the lack of a suitable landing area in New York City. Without a proper landing area, it was extremely difficult to safely bring dirigibles down. Another significant hurdle was that the architects couldn't simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. A dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add a substantial amount of stress to the building's frame. This stress could potentially damage the building's structure over time. However, the greatest obstacle was nature. The wind on top of the building shifted constantly, caused by violent air currents. When a dirigible was tethered, the back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast. This unsteady movement made docking extremely dangerous and unreliable. In conclusion, these multiple obstacles, from landing issues to natural forces, made it very challenging for the builders to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
575	15408	6	3	"Throughout the construction of the Empire State Building, the builders faced a multitude of obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock at the building. One obstacle the builders encountered was the structural stress. When a dirigible was attached to the building by a single cable, it would add too much stress to the building's framework. This was due to a combination of the dirigible's heavy load and the strong wind pressure atop the massive @DATE1 - foot structure. To address this, the builders had to carry out over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications to the frame of the building. Another obstacle was related to the safety of docking the dirigible. One problem is that many dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen, a highly flammable gas, instead of helium. This made the owners realize how much worse an accident, similar to what happened to the Hindenburg, could be over such a densely populated area. Another safety problem was the high wind speeds. Even when a dirigible would be docked to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would violently swing around because of the strong winds at @DATE1 feet. Usually, dirigibles would be able to be weighted down in a field with lead weights to prevent movement, but ""using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe."" @CAPS1. Additionally, there was already a law against airships at a certain height in urban areas, and docking a dirigible at the building would break it. As seen by this paragraph, there were many complex and significant obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. In conclusion, these obstacles, ranging from structural to safety and legal issues, made it a nearly insurmountable task for the builders to achieve their goal of dirigible docking at the Empire State Building."
576	15409	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"", by @PERSON1, the builders of the @ORGANIZATION1 encountered significant obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles, or blimps, to dock at the Empire State Building. First of all, they needed a suitable landing area, which was a Mooring Mast. But before building the mast, ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" Workers framed the building all the way up to the 85th floor. However, before the framing for the mast could take place, the roof had to be completed. Before advancing to the next stage of the project, the architects suddenly realized how dangerous and disastrous the result of it all could be. The ""Hindenburg"" disaster set a clear example of why they couldn't proceed. The area around the building was too densely populated. Considering the violent air currents, the dirigible had a strong chance of resulting in a disaster over New York City. The project was simply too risky, but it was a great idea involving future transportation, yet ultimately, the risks outweighed the potential benefits."
577	15410	6	3	Based on the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. The main problem was safety. When the front of the dirigible was masted to the building, the back would move around erratically. Another big problem was that the dirigibles were filled with hydrogen, which is highly flammable. A single spark could lead to a massive explosion that would endanger the lives of many. Also, it was illegal for airships to fly that low over urban areas, as it posed a significant threat to the people below. Another obstacle was that the dirigible could not get close enough to the building because of the strong wind. The wind would push the dirigible away, making it extremely difficult to dock safely. In conclusion, these multiple obstacles made it nearly impossible for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
578	15411	6	3	"In attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, the builders encountered major obstacles. The first puzzle posed to the builders concerned the structure. They realized that, ""the stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted... to the building's foundation."" This reality caused builders to spend over @MONEY1 on modifying the building, reinforcing the structure to withstand the additional forces. Although the builders were able to rectify the framework of the building, the later obstacles were unable to be conquered. After the Hindenburg accident in 1937, ""the owners of the Empire @CAPS1 Building realized how much worse that accident could have been"" if the dirigible had exploded over New York City. The safety of the city became a major concern. Until the blimps were less flammable, it wasn't plausible to take the risk of housing them in densely populated areas. The final obstacle to the success of the mooring mast was ""nature itself."" The violent winds that whipped around the 101st and 102nd floors would spin the dirigibles around the mooring mast. This was ""neither practical nor safe."" Overall, the obstacles the builders faced proved to be fatal to the success of the mooring mast, making it an unfeasible project."
579	15412	6	3	The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's roof because it would add excessive stress to the building's frames. So they had to carefully modify the building's frames to strengthen them to support the weight and forces of the dirigible. Also, most dirigibles used hydrogen, which is highly flammable. A potential explosion could cause great damage and destroy a large part of the population of New York. The greatest obstacle was nature itself. The winds constantly shifted direction and intensity. The back of the dirigible would swivel around and around the mooring mast, creating a dangerous situation for the pedestrians below. Finally, another reason why dirigibles could not moor at the building was because there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. All these factors combined made it impossible for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
580	15413	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders face huge obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State building. First, ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" The reason for that is because the ""winds atop the building were always changing due to the violent air currents."" ""Even if the dirigible were tethered, it would swivel around."" ""Also, it would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, and it was not practical nor safe."" It would be really dangerous if they proceeded in docking atop of the building. The constant movement of the dirigible due to the winds could lead to collisions or other accidents. These are the obstacles the builders faced, and unfortunately, they were insurmountable, preventing dirigibles from docking at the Empire State Building."
581	15414	6	3	"In the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous and complex obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. One significant obstacle was that the building, with a mooring mast on the top attached by one cable to a dirigible, ""would add excessive stress to the building's frame."" This stress could potentially compromise the long - term stability of the structure. Another obstacle was to fix the building's structure so it could withstand the mast. This required careful engineering and significant modifications to ensure the safety and integrity of the entire building. In the end, these obstacles proved insurmountable, preventing dirigibles from docking at the Empire State Building."
582	15415	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the author vividly described the numerous obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. An architect named Al Smith, a four - term governor of New York, headed efforts to construct the Empire State Building after his years in office. He had a grand vision, imagining the top of the building to be a ""higher Calling"". He pictured it to be fully equipped for an age of transportation that was then only a dream of aviation pioneers. It seemed like a feasible idea in his eyes, until the many obstacles turned up. The first major obstacle was the lack of suitable area in bustling New York City. They would have to clear about four blocks in the busy city, which involved dealing with various legal, logistical, and social issues. The architects and engineers of the Empire State Building consulted with experts, but the plan didn't work out well. Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework. The building would now be 102 floors, with a glassed - in observation area on the 101st floor. In the end, the greatest obstacle was just nature itself, which ultimately made the idea of dirigible docking unfeasible."
583	15416	6	3	"A seemingly @CAPS1 - @CAPS2 @CAPS3 idea of docking a dirigible to the top of the Empire State Building didn't seem so @CAPS1 - @CAPS2 in 1929. Upon carrying out the idea to place a mooring mast atop the thousand - foot building, problems quickly presented themselves. The first problem architects ran into was the construction of the building itself. The Empire State Building was never originally designed to be able to hold a thousand - foot dirigible. The added weight of the dirigible would significantly stress the frame of the building, potentially leading to structural damage. As a solution to this issue, Al Smith, the four - term governor of New York, put a ""quick fix"" in place. Smith invested sixty thousand dollars into strengthening the building's support, which involved reinforcing key structural elements. Even with the strengthened frame, safety was still a main conflict that put the idea to rest. Along with the structural danger, hydrogen was a main source of weight reduction for dirigibles. Unlike helium, hydrogen is highly flammable. The question arose: was the idea worth putting thousands of lives at stake through the dirigible blowing up? The people of New York did not wish to relive the Hindenburg fiasco right over their heads. The last major conflict in Smith's idea was nature itself. Air currents are an uncontrollable force of nature, especially when a thousand feet off the ground. Even if tethered, a dirigible would swivel @CAPS1 too much to be considered safe. The idea presented itself to be inconceivable. A mast was put atop the Empire State Building, and the 102nd floor does, in fact, exist. Both of these building's features are out of use, clearly proving to be unsafe to the public."
584	15417	6	3	"During the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock on top of the Empire State Building, the builders faced many significant obstacles. Often times, something is predicted to work out a whole lot easier than it actually does, which was exactly what happened in this situation. As stated in the excerpt, ""the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" This was a massive engineering challenge that required careful planning and significant resources. For the builders, this was quite a project and took an extreme amount of time and effort. Also, the builders eventually realized that there were huge safety issues with this new design. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This was a huge obstacle that stood in the way of their plan. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" Shifting winds due to violent air currents were also a huge issue. All of these things contributed to the mooring mast never becoming a successful solution for dirigible docking at the Empire State Building."
585	15418	6	3	There were many obstacles which the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to construct a mast for docking dirigibles. One of the main reasons that the mast was never built was due to safety. Most of the foreign dirigibles ran on hydrogen, and the builders did not want to risk another Hindenburg - like accident in the highly populated New York City. Such an accident could have caused widespread destruction and loss of life. Nature also severely restricted the building of a dock. The winds on top of the Empire State Building were constantly changing because of violent air currents, creating an extremely unpredictable and dangerous environment. This was another threat that the builders did not want to risk. Finally, there was a law that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas. This law was in place to protect the safety and well - being of the city's residents. There were many reasons why the mast was never constructed, including safety issues, the unpredictable nature of the elements, and an existing law that prohibited low air travel over the city. In the end, the building of a dirigible mast was neither practical nor safe, and the project was eventually dropped, ensuring the continued safety of the people of New York.
586	15419	6	3	"Mooring dirigibles on top of the Empire State Building would be extremely unfeasible. One key reason is that most dirigibles arriving at this dock from outside the U.S. utilized hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable, and after the tragic Hindenburg explosion, it would be far too dangerous to have hydrogen - filled dirigibles in a densely populated area like New York City. Another significant issue was the climate. This was the most challenging problem. As stated, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" With such rapid winds, the back of the dirigible would swing freely. This could pose a real danger, such as hitting a nearby building or swinging out of control and breaking loose from the building. The final hurdle was that docking dirigibles would violate the law. The existing law stipulated that an airship couldn't fly too low over urban areas. If a dirigible were to dock at the Empire State Building, it would be flying too low over an urban expanse. All these factors combined made it impossible for the Empire State Building to have a dock for dirigibles."
587	15420	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building encountered were quite arduous. They couldn't simply place a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building due to the building's framework. The stress from the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would need to be transferred all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. Moreover, the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to cope with this new situation. Specifically, over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications were required for the building's framework. The architects designed a shiny glass and chrome - nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from the sides. It had a stepped - back design that mimicked the overall shape of the building itself. The capital rocket - shape mast would have four wings at its corners, made of shiny aluminum, and would rise to a conical roof that would house the mooring arm. These design elements were part of the attempt to overcome the challenges, but the overall difficulties remained substantial.
588	15421	6	3	"In the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles while trying to enable dirigibles to dock there. As the author points out, ""The greatest reason was one of safety."" The dirigibles used hydrogen, which was highly flammable. In a densely populated area like New York, the risk of an explosion was too great. Many lives could be endangered if a hydrogen - filled dirigible were to explode. Another obstacle was the wind and nature. The excerpt mentions that ""The winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This created yet another safety concern. The wind would cause the dirigible to sway back and forth. If weights were used to stabilize the back, it would be extremely dangerous as it would be hanging above pedestrians. The author clearly explained how ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose."" Due to these safety and practicality issues, it was neither practical nor safe to use the mast for dirigible docking."
589	15422	6	3	"The problems the builders had when attempting to build the Empire State Building were multi - faceted. Firstly, the dirigible would have to be tied to the mast, and a single cable tether would ""stress the building's frame."" As the author states in paragraph @NUM1, the wind pressure and the weight of the dirigible could not be supported by the current foundation. Thus, the frame would have to be strengthened and redesigned. Additionally, when ""Columbia"" delivered newspapers to the Empire State Building, the mooring equipment was not installed. This was because of previous problems related to the design, laws, and common - sense considerations during the building's construction. The rest of the problems stemmed from a lack of awareness of the practical realities regarding the building's effectiveness. All these issues combined made it very difficult to achieve the goal of having a functional mooring system for dirigibles."
590	15423	6	3	"In The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Løsted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced a multitude of obstacles. One major obstacle was safety. They were planning to build a mooring mast on the very top of the building for blimps to stop, refuel, and carry out other operations. However, this presented a significant safety concern. Marcia Løsted writes that ""most dirigibles from outside the U.S.A used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" An explosion in New York could endanger countless lives. Another obstacle was related to strength. Since the mooring mast was intended for blimps, ""a single cable tether would add stress to the building's frame."" The stress from the blimp's load would put additional pressure on the building's frame, necessitating the modification and strengthening of the steel frame of the Empire State Building. These challenges made the construction of the mooring mast a complex and difficult task."
591	15424	6	3	"The architects who made the Mooring mast faced many significant obstacles when trying to get dirigibles to dock. Some of these challenges were related to safety, the unpredictable nature itself, and pre - existing laws. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" The greatest obstacle was nature. The winds at the top of the mast were always changing in speed and direction and could make the dirigibles crash into the mast. An existing law strictly prevented airships from flying too low in urban cities. Despite all the hard work the architects put into the mast, it could never live up to its intended potential, remaining an unfulfilled project in terms of regular dirigible docking."
592	15425	6	3	The Empire State Building was not a suitable place to attach a blimp to. One key reason why it never worked out was because of serious safety issues. In every country except the United States, dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is extremely flammable and should never be flown over a densely populated area like New York City. Another obstacle the architects would have to face is the high - speed wind conditions at that height. The constantly changing winds would make the blimp need to be firmly tied down on both the front and back. Next, they would need to ensure that the mooring mast was high enough to surpass the law against low - flying over urban areas. The biggest issue was how they never fully completed their plans. Even after spending approximately $1 million dollars worth of modifications, the building still was not in a state to support blimp docking, ultimately failing to achieve this intended function.
593	15426	6	3	The challenge that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there is that they cannot simply hoist on a top part to the building all at once. They have to carefully put it on piece by piece. This is because if they try to attach a large section at once, the building will become stressed to the point where it might collapse under the additional weight and force exerted by the docking dirigibles. In the end, this structural limitation severely restricted their ability to create a proper docking facility for dirigibles on the building.
594	15427	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the mast. For example, when the builders decided to construct the mast, they were well - aware that it could not just be casually placed on the roof. It had to be securely attached to the foundation of the building because the dirigible, ""would add significant stress to the building's frame."" Also, after the tragic Hindenburg disaster, the builders realized that the hydrogen inside the dirigible ""is highly flammable."" If a dirigible were to explode over New York City, it would not only kill the people in the dirigible but also those on the ground as well. Finally, the biggest obstacle of the mooring mast ""was nature itself."" The winds at the top of the building are very strong and would have caused the dirigible to swivel around the mast uncontrollably. Due to these many obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building, no dirigibles were ever able to land there, making the docking concept an unachieved dream."
595	15428	6	3	"When undertaking a great construction task, many obstacles need to be overcome. For the builders of the Empire State Building, it was ones related to the docking of dirigibles, or blimps. One major concern was safety. The builders had to make sure it was completely safe to dock on and off the blimp, and it was also safe for the blimp to fly. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" People wouldn't be safe on a blimp that could explode at any moment. Another obstacle the builders had to face was building the mooring mast itself for docking. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The blimp wouldn't be able to hold properly to the mast and it would move around too much, which was neither safe nor practical for anyone involved. These are some of the obstacles many builders have to face, but the ones of the Empire State Building overcame them as best they could, although they ultimately couldn't make the blimp - docking feature a success."
596	15429	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building planned to mount a mooring mast to the very top of the Empire State Building, but they unfortunately overlooked the potential problems in their design. A very significant problem they faced was safety. After the Hindenburg, a large German dirigible, dramatically blew up in flames in New Jersey, they quickly realized it could have been an even bigger disaster if it blew up in the crowded city of New York. Nature also posed a troublesome problem. Strong air currents could violently sway the dirigible while it was on top of the building. And finally, they could not attempt this plan because it was illegal. According to an existing law, ships were strictly not allowed to fly too low over urban areas. These various issues all made it much more difficult and nearly impossible to put a mast on the Empire State Building, ultimately preventing the realization of this ambitious plan.
597	15430	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building were challenged by the numerous obstacles of construction, safety, and nature that did not allow dirigibles to dock there. These dirigibles or blimps were large, gas - filled balloons that were capable of carrying a considerable number of passengers but needed a great, open landing area. In order for dirigibles to be used as a practical mode of transportation, architects needed to design a suitable mooring mast. However, the weight and pressure of a large blimp on a mast would cause a large amount of stress to the building's frame. The builders of the Empire State building were faced with the daunting task of producing ""over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications"" to the building's framework. Not only was attempting to have blimps dock there a lot of work and very costly, but the builders were also challenged with serious safety issues. As was experienced with the German blimp ""Hindenburg,"" dirigibles that use hydrogen are ""highly flammable."" If any incident occurred over the Empire State building in New York, involving a dirigible, it would severely affect the enormous population in the area by potentially killing so many lives. Flying too low over the city was another major challenge to safety, and a law would make it illegal and unsuccessful for blimps to be used. Lastly, nature was an obstacle the builders faced in docking dirigibles. At most times, the ""forceful winds"" would cause the back of the ship to swivel which could lead to it hitting the sharp spires and being punctured. Lead weights were also not safe when dangling over pedestrians. These many obstacles made it extremely difficult to create the necessary gear that would allow dirigibles to dock on the building, and thus the plan was ultimately abandoned."
598	15431	6	3	Based on the excerpt, The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION1, there were many challenges the builders of the Empire State building faced while they had high hopes in creating the world's tallest building. They enthusiastically added on hundreds of extra feet to the building, specifically with the intention of allowing dirigibles to dock there. Competing fiercely with the Chrysler building, Al Smith, a determined figure, publicly announced that the Empire State building would reach an impressive 1,250 feet, beating the Chrysler Building by @NUM1 feet. Al Smith was desperate to do whatever he could to construct the world's tallest building, even going so far as to create a landing spot for dirigibles. Unfortunately, @ORGANIZATION2's idea didn't work out as planned. Instead, the area originally assigned to dirigible passengers was repurposed and made into the world's highest soda fountain and tea garden, a far cry from the initial grand vision.
599	15432	6	3	"The excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2 is a story that takes the reader through the numerous obstacles and attempts builders faced when trying to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building. Al Smith, a well - known four - term governor of New York, planned to construct the Empire State Building after he left office. Smith was highly competitive and realized that the building was close to earning the prestigious title of world's tallest building. So in 1929, he publicly announced that the building would be 1,250 feet and he would achieve this by adding a unique top or hat to the building which would be distinctive. The original idea was to add a mooring mast and observation decks to the top and have it be able to dock dirigibles, or blimps. Architects later carefully realized that a thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by one cable tether would add an enormous amount of stress to the building's frame. The stress of a dirigible's heavy load combined with the pressure of strong wind would go all the way to the building's foundation. The plans that had builders working so hard on framework and observation decks ultimately failed. It was simply not practical to dock a dirigible, and it wouldn't be safe either. By the late 1930s, the idea was reluctantly given up on, but the Empire State Building is still open to one of the observation decks and remains a very popular and iconic attraction in New York, drawing countless visitors each year."
600	15433	6	3	During the times of the Empire State Building and its claim to fame with its great height, its proponent Al Smith, faced more than one obstacle with accomplishing the mooring mast's completion. From the very beginning of its construction, the mooring mast was not properly thought out and did not have the proper, well - considered design. Al Smith realized this even before he finalized the process of building. Once he finally did complete the mooring mast, he faced a series of obstacles. The dirigibles had significant problems with docking. Due to the strong wind and the harsh elements, the dirigibles had a very hard time staying stationary once docked. Another major obstacle was fuel. Due to the recent, tragic Hindenburg crash, dirigibles needed to be fueled with helium rather than the more flammable hydrogen, which was more expensive and harder to obtain. Finally, the laws that were in place about airships not being allowed to fly low over urban areas caused the mooring mast to fail. Eventually, airplanes took the dirigibles' position as the preferred mode of air travel and the mooring mast was retired. Due to these various and insurmountable obstacles, Al Smith gave up with the mooring mast but still played a crucial role in helping the Empire State Building set the record for the highest building, leaving behind a remarkable architectural legacy.
601	15434	6	3	"During the construction of the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building, the builders encountered several daunting obstacles. One significant obstacle was that they couldn't simply ""drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building."" Instead, they had to carry out meticulous work on the building so that it could support the additional load. As the experts said, ""the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be carefully modified and significantly strengthened to accommodate the new situation"". Another obstacle the builders faced was the high - risk factor in case of an accident. If there was an incident similar to the Hindenburg disaster, it would be far more dangerous because there would be numerous people in the vicinity who could be severely injured by the fire. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself,"" said the experts. The wind currents above the building were highly unpredictable as they shifted due to ""violent air currents."" Also, dirigibles typically need to have weights attached at the back of them. However, at the Empire State Building, these weights would dangle high above pedestrians, which was neither practical nor safe. Additionally, blimps couldn't get close enough to the mast due to the strong wind, as was the case with the Los Angeles. Due to all of these insurmountable obstacles, the mooring mast hasn't been used since it was built."
602	15435	6	3	"The empire state building's construction workers made a bold attempt to build a dirigible dock on top of the world's tallest building, but numerous problems arose during the process. In order to have a dirigible dock on the top of the building, the building would have to be capable of withstanding its weight. ""The steel frame of the empire state building would have to be thoroughly modified and substantially strengthened to accommodate this situation. Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of precise modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" (Expert Source) The 102 - story floor building was initially predicted to be a remarkable success and was expected to mark the new age of aviation travel. Another obstacle that the workers faced was the realization that dirigibles outside the United States were highly flammable because they contained hydrogen. It would be an absolute disaster if one caught on fire on the top of the building in the bustling New York City. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" (Expert Source). There are extremely strong and violent winds at the top of the building. A blimp could quickly become a major hazard if it was blown out of control. A blimp hovering over hundreds of pedestrians in the city of New York is undoubtedly a significant hazard. There is also a strict law forbidding aircraft from flying too low over populated areas. Having a mooring dock was a good - intentioned idea, but it was never really practical or safe, as many catastrophic things could have happened if it was actually in operation."
603	15436	6	3	The builders had to confront many challenges in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock at the empire state building, with a couple of main ones standing out. The first main obstacle was that a thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would impose a tremendous amount of stress on the building's frame. So, they could not simply put the mooring mast on top of the building right away. They had to carry out some major and well - planned adjustments. Along with this big problem, the builders' next obstacle was to design and construct a shiny glass and chrome - nickel stainless steel tower. This tower would be illuminated from inside, with a stepped - back design that carefully imitated the overall shape of the building itself. The last but not least obstacle the builders had to face was that the mast also had a sturdy skeleton of steel and was clad in stainless steel with glass windows that needed to be skillfully built and properly put up. Those were some of the significant obstacles the builders had to overcome while trying to install a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building, and these challenges ultimately affected the feasibility of the project.
604	15437	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there were multi - faceted, including the docking process itself, the forces of nature, and the overall construction of these dirigibles. There was also an existing law that posed a hurdle for these airships. Docking the dirigibles to the top of the Empire State Building would place a great amount of stress on the building. The builders would have to invest a substantial sum, specifically sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications to the building overall. The most pressing safety issue was related to the construction of these balloons from outside the United States. They used hydrogen, which was highly flammable. There was a well - known incident on May 6, 1937, where the German dirigibles caught on fire. This tragic event was known as the Hindenburg's accident. The builders were fully aware that this presented a significant risk to the densely populated area of New York. But the greatest obstacle was nature itself. When the dirigibles would attempt to dock, violent air currents would cause the back of the airship to wildly swivel round and round the Mooring Mast. Moreover, the law against airships stated that they were strictly not allowed to fly low around urban areas. Due to these combined obstacles, the plan to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was ultimately abandoned.
605	15438	6	3	One obstacle the builders had to face was the substantial amount of wind blowing at that high altitude. The dirigibles were so large that the wind exerted a great deal of resistance on them, causing them to sway violently from the back. Another obstacle was that the dirigibles were filled with hydrogen, which is extremely flammable. Being filled with such a combustible gas, they could easily turn into a catastrophic disaster. Especially considering all the people who were in close proximity to it on the ground, any fire could spread rapidly and cause widespread harm. These challenges made it extremely difficult for the builders to achieve their goal of making the dirigible - related project a success, and they ultimately had to abandon the idea due to these insurmountable risks.
606	15439	6	3	When building the Empire State Building, the developers wanted to keep it the tallest in New York. They made modifications to the building's design so that it would not be surpassed by the Chrysler Building. Its original purpose was not to serve as a mooring mast. The Empire State Building had to be reframed when the government banned aircraft from flying too low, and then commercial airliners took over the aviation industry. It was too dangerous for dirigibles to dock because the strong air - currents could blow them out of place, causing accidents similar to the Hindenburg disaster. In the end, the building's original vision for dirigible docking had to be abandoned due to these insurmountable challenges.
607	15440	6	3	"In the excerpt, The Mooring Mast, by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, there are many obstacles the builders are faced with while in the process of building a dirigible dock on top of the Empire State Building. One significant obstacle was the height of the building. That meant more extensive framework, a greater quantity of building materials, and a higher number of safety hazards, all because of the building's great height. Another obstacle was public safety. After already constructing a more secure building, the workers realized that ""A densely populated area such as downtown New York"" wouldn't be the best place to be if there ever was an accident. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself"". Nature played a major part as an obstacle because it would always be unpredictable. The winds would also whip the backend of the dirigible, making it unsafe and unstable for passengers. These are some of the key obstacles builders had to face while building the famous mooring mast, which ultimately limited its practicality."
608	15441	6	3	While building the Empire State Building, people had to go through some obstacles to have it the way they wanted. They aimed for dirigibles to be able to land and board on the Empire State Building. One of their obstacles was the high - density use in New York City and a lack of a suitable landing area. The city's bustling nature and limited available space made it difficult to create a proper landing zone. The other obstacle, in a way, was a positive one. Despite the challenges, the use of dirigibles for the mooring mast was successful to some extent, but the initial hurdles still had a significant impact on the overall process. Overall, these obstacles shaped the final outcome of the building's use for dirigible docking.
609	15442	6	3	"Based on the article The Mooring Mast, the builders of the Empire State Building faced challenges in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, such as the lack of landing area, being practical, and ensuring safety. The lack of landing area was one of the prominent challenges. ""The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area"". Since no dirigible could land on the Empire State Building without sufficient space for maneuvering and landing, this was a difficult challenge the builders of the building faced. Another challenge was making the dock practical. ""One set of engineers here in New York is trying to dope out a practical, workable arrangement."" This shows that a practical arrangement for docking has yet to be made, and therefore it was another challenge the builders faced. Lastly, the builders of the Empire State Building faced safety issues. "".... are figuring on some safe way of mooring airships to this mast"" - this informs that the safety of docking dirigibles has not been ensured yet, meaning it was still a challenge the builders faced. Altogether, the builders of the Empire State Building faced challenges such as the lack of landing areas, being practical, and ensuring safety, which hindered the realization of dirigible docking at the building."
610	15443	6	3	"Even though allowing dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building sounds like a good idea, it wasn't. There are many obstacles that prevent it from happening. With ""a [specific length] ft dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add excessive stress to the building's frame"" (paragraph [specific number]). Also, one of the greatest obstacles was the violent winds that constantly change due to violent air currents. These unpredictable winds could cause the dirigible to sway wildly. Moreover, the dirigible would be dangling above pedestrians on the street, which isn't safe. The biggest obstacle was the fact that it's illegal for airships to fly low over urban areas, which would also make it illegal for the dirigible to tie itself up to the building or even get close to it. This sounds like a great idea and a great way to get more tourists, but there are too many obstacles to make it a realistic possibility. In conclusion, the dream of dirigible docking at the Empire State Building remains just that - a dream, due to these insurmountable barriers."
611	15444	6	3	"According to ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building, in their ambitious attempt to allow dirigibles to dock, faced three main obstacles. The first and most pressing obstacle was the concern of public safety. Dirigibles from outside the U.S predominantly used hydrogen, a highly flammable element. In a densely - populated area like New York, an accident involving a hydrogen - filled dirigible could lead to a catastrophic event, endangering countless lives and causing extensive property damage. The second obstacle were the violent winds on top of the building. Employing lead weights to tie down dirigibles was not a practical solution. These weights would be dangling high above the pedestrians on the busy streets below. A simple mishap, such as a rope breaking, would send those heavy weights plummeting down, causing destruction and chaos. The third obstacle was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made the very idea of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building not only unfeasible but also illegal, thus putting an end to the plan."
612	15445	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, the builders encountered numerous obstacles in their endeavor to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. As stated in paragraph @NUM1, ""the greatest reason was safety."" The most critical issue was that the blimps used hydrogen, which is extremely flammable. In case of an accident, the consequences would be tragic, especially considering the heavily populated downtown @CAPS1, where people go about their daily lives. Moreover, nature also posed a significant obstacle. As described, ""The winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" These erratic winds made docking a dirigible a near - impossible task. Additionally, @CAPS2, there was an existing law against flying airships too low over urban areas. This law effectively put a halt to the idea of having dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building, making it an unviable option."
613	15446	6	3	"In the excerpt of ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple challenges when they tried to facilitate the docking of dirigibles there. One major obstacle that prevented the docking of dirigibles at the Empire State Building was the use of hydrogen rather than helium in dirigibles from outside the United States. Hydrogen is highly flammable, and this was a serious concern. When the German dirigible met its tragic end in New Jersey, the architects of the Empire State Building were acutely aware of the potential danger. Another obstacle was the weather. The weather conditions had a direct impact on the use of the mooring mast. As described, ""The winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" These unpredictable winds made it extremely difficult, if not impossible, to safely dock a dirigible. A practical reason why the mooring mast could not be used to dock dirigibles at the Empire State Building was the law against airships. The law clearly stated that airships could not fly too low over urban areas, rendering it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building. These are just a few of the many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building had to face, ultimately preventing the effective use of the mooring mast."
614	15447	6	3	"In theory, the concept of creating a mooring mast on the top of the Empire State Building seemed like a brilliant idea. It promised to revolutionize air travel and add a unique feature to the iconic building. However, in reality, it didn't turn out as expected. There are several reasons why a dirigible could not be docked to the Empire State Building. For example, as mentioned, ""Most dirgibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen instead of helium"" (paragraph @NUM1). Hydrogen is extremely flammable, and in a densely populated city like New York, an accident involving a hydrogen - filled dirigible could have disastrous consequences. The potential for a large - scale fire or explosion was a major deterrent. Possibly the most dangerous obstacle was the climate around the Empire State Building. There is a constant, powerful wind that shifts frequently due to the various air currents created by the building. If a dirigible managed to dock there, it would be buffeted around, and there was a high risk of it crashing into the building or other structures. Most dirigibles that were moored in open fields were weighted down with lead weights at the back, but this would be far too dangerous to attempt over a city full of people. Lastly, there ""was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas... this would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" (paragraph @NUM2). This law effectively put an end to the hopes of using the mooring mast for dirigible docking."
615	15448	6	3	"The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was fated to never achieve its intended purpose. In the short excerpt of ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, numerous obstacles were clearly outlined as to why the mast was not a practical idea. The construction of the mast was rushed. Al Smith, realizing that he was on the verge of losing the title of the world's tallest building, quickly came up with the idea of the mast. However, problems emerged almost immediately. The first problem that arose was the lack of a suitable landing area. Al Smith naively stated that passengers could safely swing in the breeze, but this was clearly an unrealistic solution. This problem was unfortunately ignored, and as the building of the mast continued, other issues cropped up. The most significant problem that should have been considered before the construction of the mast was nature itself. The winds at the height of the building were extremely strong and unpredictable. The architects soon realized that landing a dirigible would be a major challenge. Despite these concerns, the mast was still under consideration, and architects and engineers were doing their best to make it work. But then, they were faced with a law. It is illegal for airships to fly too low over an urban area. The discovery of this law marked the end of Al Smith's ambitious idea. By the late 1930's, the hope of using the mooring mast for dirigibles and their passengers had quietly faded away."
616	15449	6	3	"The Empire State Building faced numerous challenges when trying to enable dirigibles to dock there. Dirigibles, which are blimps, presented several issues. The first obstacle was simply the size. The Empire State Building was in fierce competition with the Chrysler Building. Some opinions held that ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed."" Another hurdle was that the expanded use of dirigibles in New York City was hampered by the lack of a suitable landing area. To address this, they added a mooring mast. The construction of the Empire State Building was fraught with many trials and tribulations, ultimately making it unfeasible for dirigibles to dock there."
617	15450	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building encountered a multitude of obstacles that prohibited dirigibles from docking there. One significant obstacle was the original design of the Empire State Building. It had to be completely changed to accommodate landing dirigibles. As noted, ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation"" (@NUM1). Over sixty thousand dollars was spent on the renovations for the redesigned, chrome - nickel stainless steel tower. Another obstacle the builders faced was the level of safety. Thousands of lives could have been lost if a dirigible accident occurred in New York City. As an example, ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York"" (@NUM2). The most significant obstacle by far was the elements. Dirigibles were highly susceptible to being swayed in bad weather. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast"" (@NUM3). This was extremely unsafe given the dense population in New York City. If a dirigible swiveled around the mooring mast too much, it could hit another building or crash. Due to these many difficulties faced by the people behind the construction of the Empire State Building, the mooring mast was never used."
618	15451	6	3	When building the Empire State Building, the architects and engineers were confronted with a series of problems. The first problem was the reconstruction of the building's framework. This reconstruction was necessary so that the building could withstand the great amounts of wind pressure and stress exerted by the dirigible. The next problem the workers encountered was the wind currents. The wind was so powerful at the tip of the building that if a dirigible were to be docked to the mooring mast, it would rotate around it according to the wind currents. The final problem the architects faced was a law regarding a dirigible's height. There was an existing law stating that airships could not fly too low over urban areas. These obstacles were just some of the many challenges faced by the building team of the Empire State Building, which ultimately made it difficult to achieve the goal of dirigible docking.
619	15452	6	3	In the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced a variety of obstacles. They failed to consider what might happen to the dirigibles if something went wrong, especially given the great height of the building. The first obstacle the builders faced was the potential risks to the dirigibles. For instance, dirigibles could be highly flammable, similar to the Hindenburg. If a similar accident were to occur at the Empire State Building, the consequences would be disastrous. The second obstacle was the height of the building. Due to its great height, the wind current was extremely strong. This strong wind made it very difficult for dirigibles to dock safely. The builders tried to overcome these obstacles, but there were simply too many of them, making it impossible to achieve the goal of successful dirigible docking at the Empire State Building.
620	15453	6	3	The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock had several consequences. One of the key obstacles to the expanded use of dirigibles in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. Moreover, the architects could not simply install a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add significant stress to the building's frame. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on the top of the building were constantly changing due to violent air currents. Another obstacle preventing dirigibles from mooring at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but was unable to get close enough to tie up because of the forceful winds. These obstacles ultimately made it unfeasible for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
621	15454	6	3	The architects and builders of the Empire State Building, a remarkable feat of engineering, faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Some of their problems included the complex structure of the building, the ever - changing wind and weather conditions, and the safety of their passengers. The steel frame of the Empire State Building, which was initially designed for different purposes, would have to be carefully modified and significantly strengthened to accommodate the new situation. The building now consisted of 102 floors and contained a sturdy stainless - steel skeleton. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, making it extremely difficult to control the dirigibles. The back of the ship would swivel around uncontrollably and would need heavy lead weights to hold it down. This was clearly considered unsafe as it could lead to accidents. Finally, the safety of the passengers was at stake because the complete dirigible mooring equipment was never installed. Also, there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. These are the reasons why dirigibles never moored on the Empire State Building due to the many insurmountable obstacles.
622	15455	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building, an iconic structure, faced many problems with their ambitious idea of docking dirigibles on the top of the Empire State Building. One major impediment was the strict laws based around aircrafts. One law explicitly prohibited air crafts from flying too low over urban areas, which directly affected the dirigibles' docking plan. Another problem the builders faced was the significant safety risks associated with docking dirigibles. Dirigibles were filled with hydrogen, an extremely flammable gas, and after the tragic accident with the German dirigible Hindenburg explosion, the builders realized the high risk of similar accidents occurring. Mother nature presented the largest obstacle though. The great height of the Empire State Building causes high - speed winds which would fling the end of any dirigible around the mooring like a rag doll, making docking extremely dangerous. The builders then carefully considered all the risks to docking dirigibles and ultimately abandoned the idea as it was too perilous.
623	15456	6	3	"The Empire State Building was specifically designed to be the world's tallest building, a symbol of human achievement. With this lofty goal, the governor Al Smith, a visionary, wanted the building to be more than just an ornamental structure as he clearly stated in his comments in paragraph three. Al Smith had a grand vision and wanted the Empire State Building to be equipped for an age of transportation. He aimed to create the latest attraction for the dirigibles, which was to allow dirigibles to dock there. Yet, when allowing this, little did they know that the builders would face numerous obstacles. With the idea of the dirigibles, Al Smith saw a great opportunity to put the building on the map. When he was asked about the Mooring Mast idea, Al Smith said with enthusiasm, ""It's on the Level, all right. No kidding. We're working on the thing now."" Although the Mooring Mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its intended purpose, as clearly explained in paragraph thirteen, it still stands as a testament to an unfulfilled dream."
624	15457	6	3	"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"", by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the author describes in detail many challenges the architects faced while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. The architects had new and daunting challenges that would almost seem impossible to prevent at times. The height of the building, the heavy weight of the dirigible against the building, and the fact that dirigibles are highly flammable, all added to the many obstacles the architects were faced with. The height of the building was a major problem for the architects. It was very difficult for pilots to safely maneuver around buildings, especially in a city like New York with many skyscrapers. The unpredictable winds meant the dirigibles could be blown into a building at any point, endangering both the passengers and the building. There was even a law against it that ""would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"" (para @NUM1). Another problem the architects encountered was the high flammability of the dirigibles. The dirigibles made in most other countries were made with hydrogen rather than helium. After another dirigible caught on fire, people realized how much worse ""that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York"" (para @NUM2). The biggest problem of all was the weight of the dirigibles on the massive height of the building. The architects saw that, ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings' foundation"" (para @NUM3). They knew this was very unsafe for the passengers unloading and for the people in the building. Overall, the problems and challenges the architects faced were too strong for them to overcome, and the idea of dirigible docking had to be abandoned."
625	15458	6	3	The engineers and constructors of the Empire State Building, a monumental project, definitely faced some large and overwhelming complications when trying to build it to allow the dockings of dirigibles, or blimps. First off, from their original plan, right at the start, they had to modify the building because they found the actual height of another building was taller. So, they had to come up with a quick and effective solution to fix that. Secondly, after the Hindenburg disaster, the authorities had realized how dangerous it was for zeppelins to fly over urban areas, so they put a strict law against it. As a result, the whole idea of dirigible docking at the Empire State Building was basically tossed aside. And to make matters even worse, the violent gusts of air and strong updrafts on top of the building wouldn't make docking on the Empire State Building very safe for passengers. Considering all these difficulties, the plan to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was ultimately deemed unfeasible.
626	15459	6	3	"There were numerous obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building encountered in their attempt to enable dirigibles to dock there. The excerpt ""The Mooring @CAPS1"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted elaborates on some of the problems architect Al Smith faced when constructing the world's tallest building in the 1920s. For instance, ""The greatest issues was one of safety."" Safety was a major hurdle as most dirigibles outside the United States utilized hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is extremely flammable. If a dirigible were to explode high above this densely - populated area, a large number of people would be killed or seriously injured. Another obstacle in this attempt was ""nature itself."" Nature presented one of the many significant problems for allowing a dirigible to dock. Specifically, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" These shifting winds would move the ship, making it very difficult to land on the mooring mast. The other practical problem the builders faced was ""a law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" Due to these insurmountable challenges, the entire idea was eventually abandoned by the late 1930s. In conclusion, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in the creation of ""The Mooring Mast,"" which ultimately led to the failure of the dirigible - docking plan."
627	15460	6	3	When constructing a mooring mast, @CAPS1 encountered a multitude of problems. Safety was the primary concern they faced. Since most blimps outside of the @LOCATION1 were filled with hydrogen instead of helium, they were highly flammable. After the Hindenburg blimp was tragically destroyed by a fire, people in @CAPS1 were extremely worried that a similar incident could occur near the Empire State Building. Another problem they ran into was the law. At that time, it was legally prohibited to fly an airship that low over urban areas. During tests, some blimps couldn't get close enough to the mooring mast because of the heavy winds. This made it impossible to tie the blimps up and allow passengers to disembark. Moreover, it also made people fear that the wind would blow the blimp onto sharp parts of other buildings, which would puncture the blimp. Although the idea of a blimp docking station and mooring mast was good, there were simply too many obstacles to overcome for it to be successful. In the end, the challenges proved insurmountable, and the plan had to be scrapped.
628	15461	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. One significant issue was the violent air currents at the top of the building. Even if the dirigibles managed to successfully dock at the top of the building, the back end of it would be violently thrashing around due to the wind. If this happened and the blimp became uncontrollable, it could crash into another building and plummet to the ground where all the downtown New @CAPS1 pedestrians walked. Putting weights on the end of the blimp could potentially help this situation, but as @CAPS2 states, ""dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe."" Another issue the builders faced was the fact that dirigibles were highly flammable. They learned their lesson and realized that their idea might not be so good after the German blimp, the Hindenburg, was destroyed. In conclusion, these multiple and serious obstacles made it impossible for the Empire State Building to become a successful dirigible - docking site."
629	15462	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building had to contend with many obstacles while trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. The author informs us readers that dirigibles were actually enormous steel - framed balloons, with envelopes of cotton fabric filled with hydrogen and helium to make them lighter than air. While the builders were attempting to drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof, the excerpt tells us that ""a thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building frame. The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. Even though the dirigible is as light as the air, it could still mess up the frame of the building. Another obstacle the builders had to face was when the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in @LOCATION1, New Jersey on May 6, 1937. The owner of the Empire State Building realized how much worse it would have been if the accident had happened in New York, a densely populated area like downtown. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" Even though the Empire State Building didn't get to install moors on top of the building, it still achieved the status of the world's tallest building. In summary, the various obstacles related to safety and structural stress led to the failure of the dirigible - docking plan, but the building's grandeur remained intact."
630	15463	6	3	"There were many obstacles the builders faced when trying to allow Dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. One of the major obstacles was nature. The winds at the top of the Empire State Building were constantly shifting because of violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around wildly. This made it extremely difficult to keep the dirigible stable during docking. Another obstacle the builders faced was a law not allowing airships to fly too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ""ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach it. Given these insurmountable challenges, the plan to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building was ultimately unfeasible. In conclusion, the combination of natural elements and legal restrictions prevented the realization of the dirigible - docking project at the Empire State Building."
631	15464	6	3	"From the excerpt 'The Mooring Mast' by @ORGANIZATION2, we find that the builders of the Empire State Building encountered numerous obstacles. Their first significant obstacle was to precisely figure out how to transfer ""the stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressures"" effectively to the building's foundation. Another challenge was to carefully modify the steel frame of the building and strengthen it appropriately to accommodate the situation of adding the mooring mast. And so, the dedicated builders did modify the building and assigned a mooring mast. However, when the construction was finally completed, the builders came upon yet another obstacle. ""Most dirigibles outside the U.S. used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable, which poses a great danger if any were to go up in flames above bustling New York. The greatest obstacle was related to the winds. They were constantly shifting, making it extremely difficult for any dirigibles to even get close to the mast. Even if they could reach the mast, the back of the dirigibles would swivel around the mast. In open fields, dirigibles would be weighed down with lead weights, but at the Empire State Building, they would be dangling high above unsuspecting pedestrians. This was neither practical nor safe. Due to all these insurmountable obstacles, the Mooring Mast would never be used for its intended purpose."
632	15465	6	3	The main obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there stemmed primarily from the extremely bad location. The dirigibles would be docking a staggering 1,250 feet above one of the busiest and most densely populated cities in the world. This would create three significant problems for the docking of the dirigibles. The first problem is that hydrogen was what was commonly used in dirigibles, and it is extremely flammable. If a dirigible were to explode above the bustling downtown New York, countless innocent people would be killed. This means that not many people, including local residents and authorities, are going to want the dirigibles docking there. If the Empire State Building had not been situated above such a densely populated area, they may have not had this serious problem. The next difficulty would be the fact that at that high altitude in New York City, there are violent and unpredictable wind currents that are always changing. This makes it incredibly hard for the skilled conductors to dock the dirigible safely, and it also could possibly cause the dirigible to hit something and pop. So again, the dirigible would be crashing into downtown New York, endangering the lives of many people. This is another clear reason it was a bad location. It needed to be in a place where there were more stable and predictable wind currents. The final obstacle was that there was an existing strict law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This meant that even if the other two factors miraculously disappeared, there was a law that the builders should have been well - aware of that forbade their ambitious plans. Like the author accurately said, the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its intended purpose of being a dirigible docking site.
633	15466	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple complex obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. If they were to succeed, they would have become a major and revolutionary aviation accommodation for trans - atlantic routes and new routes that were yet to come. In order to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the building, the mooring mast needed to be carefully constructed and securely put on to the top of the building. Simply adding the masts to the building was no easily achievable task. The Empire State Building's sturdy frame needed to be thoroughly modified so it could withstand the significant stress from the dirigible firmly mounted onto the mooring mast. Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of detailed modifications were made to precisely adjust the building's framework. Once the framework was properly adjusted, talented architects designed a shiny glass and chrome - nickel stainless steel tower that was beautifully illuminated from the inside. This tower served as a mast for the building to come. Before the mooring mast could be constructed, the roof of the building had to be completed with high - quality materials. Once the roof was skillfully constructed, the mooring mast was added with its own strong skeleton of steel. Once the entire elaborate project was finally finished, the owners of the Empire State Building reluctantly realized that docking dirigibles would be much too dangerous. After all the rigorous and painstaking work put into the mooring mast was completed, it became crystal clear that it would never be used for its original purpose of facilitating dirigible docking.
634	15467	6	3	"There were many formidable obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. For example, one of the prominent obstacles they faced was that ""most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This is highly significant because it would be extremely dangerous for foreign dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, especially in a densely populated area such as the vibrant downtown New York. Another major obstacle they faced was nature. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This suggests that a dirigible would swivel around and around uncontrollably, and they could be weighted down with lead weights. Using these at the Empire State Building, high above innocent pedestrians on the busy street, would be completely impractical and extremely unsafe. Next, there was also ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This is important because it is another insurmountable obstacle that would ultimately make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. Also, ""in December 1930, the U.S Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds."" This shows that another obstacle they may have faced was losing confidence and directly observing that their well - planned project would not work as intended. The various insurmountable obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there clearly show that it would have been an almost impossible task to complete."
635	15468	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced significant obstacles attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the main and obvious obstacles was the lack of a suitable and spacious landing area. Dirigibles were quite large in size, and there wasn't a great spot for them. ""Some were as long as one thousand feet, the same length as four blocks in New York City"" - paragraph 6. This large size therefore caused substantial problems for the builders as they struggled to figure out where to safely and practically put these massive dirigibles. The limited space on the building made it extremely difficult to accommodate such large - scale aircraft, and despite their best efforts, they couldn't find an ideal solution. As a result, this obstacle severely hindered their plan to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, and it became clear that this was a major hurdle that could not be easily overcome."
636	15469	6	3	"Based on the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, there were numerous factors impeding dirigibles from docking at the mooring mast. When the German dirigible ""Hindenburg"" spectacularly went up in flames in New Jersey, the owners of the Empire State Building realized, as they put it, ""how much worse the accident could have been if it had taken place over a densely populated area such as downtown New York"" (paragraph @NUM1). Another significant obstacle was the existing law against low - flying airships in urban areas. This law made it strictly ""illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"" (paragraph @NUM2). The greatest obstacle of all, however, was mother nature. The winds at that high altitude in the sky were ""constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This would cause the back of the ship to swivel around, posing a serious threat to the safety of passengers on the dirigible and pedestrians on the street below. All of these factors combined contributed to the project never being fulfilled in New York, leaving the mooring mast without its intended function."
637	15470	6	3	"In a competition with the architects building the Chrysler Building, Al Smith had a grand vision. He wanted to construct a taller building with a specific purpose: to dock dirigibles on a mooring mast. This seemed like an excellent idea at the time, taking a very popular and newly emerging mode of transportation and allowing it to operate in New York City. However, problems soon emerged. In the beginning, the architects were aware that ""A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" So, within the time they had, they assumed they had fixed the problem. But when the building was finished, the architects knew that ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to fulfill its purpose..."" Most of the problems didn't stem from the building itself but from the practicality of having a dirigible land in a big, crowded city. For instance, the highly flammable hydrogen that filled most dirigibles was a major concern, and the closeness of other buildings to the blimps could potentially cause them to catch fire. Overall, the idea was good in theory, but it could never be executed. Only two dirigibles ever docked there, and the mooring mast has never been used for its intended purpose since."
638	15471	6	3	"Although the builders tried extremely hard to make their dream of having dirigibles dock on the Empire State Building become a reality, there were a few significant obstacles that prevented that from happening. The main obstacles the builders faced were weather, the law, and safety concerns. The weather at the top of the building was extremely windy, and these strong winds would cause major issues for the dirigibles during landing. As described, ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" Another problem they encountered was that there was a law in effect preventing aircraft from flying too low over urban areas. Since New York is a well - known urban area, no dirigibles would even be allowed to fly anywhere near the Empire State Building. The other main obstacle was a serious concern for safety. Hydrogen, which is extremely flammable, was used in many foreign dirigibles. It could cause a catastrophic event if one ever exploded over New York, and there had already been a tragic accident where ""the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937..."" These obstacles were not ones that the builders could simply ignore, and they ultimately prevented the intended use of the mooring mast for dirigible docking altogether."
639	15472	6	3	The obstacles faced by the Empire State Building builders were quite challenging. One major obstacle was the existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, as stated in @CAPS1 @NUM1. This law strictly restricted the movement of dirigibles in the vicinity of the building. Another significant obstacle was nature. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. If a dirigible were moored at the top of the building, held by a cable tether, it would have put excessive stress on the building. Therefore, they would have had to make the structure of the building stronger to withstand such forces. These obstacles made it very difficult for the builders to achieve their goal of having dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building.
640	15473	6	3	"The obstacles that the builders were faced with in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building were quite complex. They could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building. This was because it would have added too much stress to the frame of the Empire State Building, which could have caused the building to collapse over a period of time. As said in the excerpt, the steel frame of the Empire State Building had to be ""modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" After the builders completed framing the Empire State Building up to the eighty - fifth floor, it was now time to focus on the framing of the rooftop to create an area where the mooring mast would be placed. After the workers completed the framing of the rooftop, they built the mooring mast onto it. Now, the builders faced the challenge of framing the mooring mast. The builders framed the mooring mast with a sturdy skeleton of steel. The builders overcame these challenges in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, but ultimately, other factors would prevent the full realization of this plan."
641	15474	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle they had to overcome was that if a dirigible, which could reach up to a thousand feet in length, was moored to the top of the building, it would add significant stress to the building's frame. This meant the steel frame of the building had to be carefully strengthened and precisely modified to effectively deal with the added stress. The cost of these necessary modifications was over sixty thousand dollars. The next challenge was discovered after the building was finished. This was the fact that having dirigibles moor at the Empire State Building was highly unsafe. The first reason why it is unsafe is that most dirigibles, not from the United States, used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is extremely flammable. This meant an accident like that of the Hindenburg could happen above the highly populated downtown area of New York, endangering countless lives. Another problem that arose after the construction was that the shifting winds on top of the building were too violent for the dirigible, which would swivel around the mooring mast uncontrollably. All these challenges, along with an existing law that did not allow airships to fly too low over urban areas, were the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building and are why only one dirigible was ever moored there, ultimately making the idea of regular dirigible docking unfeasible.
642	15475	6	3	"Challenges can be faced when radical ideas are put into action. When faced with the task of docking dirigibles, or zeppelins, atop the Empire State Building, the builders ran into challenges that are naturally associated with new thoughts. One significant challenge was the fact that the wind from such a high altitude as the Empire State Building made situations extremely perilous for blimps and people on the ground. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast"" (@CAPS1 @NUM1), causing instability and potential danger. Another obstacle faced by builders was difficulties with the laws of the United States government. ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (@NUM2). These were some of the difficulties dealt with by builders in the construction of the Empire State Building's mast, which ultimately limited the viability of using it for dirigible docking."
643	15476	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was the fact that dirigibles were highly dangerous when not handled correctly. If an accident were to occur, many people could die because the Empire State Building is located within a densely populated area. In paragraph @NUM1, the author states, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This flammability posed a serious threat. Wind was also an issue in allowing dirigibles to dock there; the wind at that height was very forceful and would become a significant problem. In paragraph @NUM2, the author states in relation to the wind, ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast,"" making it difficult to control the dirigible. Another obstacle was the laws against airships flying too low over urban areas. Paragraph @NUM3 states, ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to tie up to the building or even approach the area."" Overall, all of these obstacles made it impossible in the end for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, despite the initial plans."
644	15477	6	3	"The builders of the mooring mast planned the construction well, but did not fully consider the potential risks of the mast. One reason that the mast's fate was sealed was because of serious safety issues. Most dirigibles, or blimps, used hydrogen rather than helium. If one of these blimps were to fall from the sky, many people below would be killed as New York has a large number of people who walk everywhere on the busy streets. The builders also needed to have considered the violent winds at such a high altitude. These winds could blow the dirigibles around erratically, making it extremely difficult to keep them in one spot for passengers to board safely and to refuel. The winds are constantly shifting direction. They could blow the blimps onto the spires on the Empire State Building, causing them to burst and fall to the ground below. Unfortunately, there is a law that prevents airships from flying too low over urban areas. ""This would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" I think that Al Smith was more focused on keeping his height record, more than the potential dangers of the mast, which ultimately led to the mast not being used for its intended purpose."
645	15478	6	3	"In ""The Mooring Mast,"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the Empire State Building is familiar to many people throughout the world, but not many know that the original purpose of the mast was to serve as a landing spot for dirigibles, also known as blimps. Due to the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, they eventually shelved the idea. One of the obstacles the builders realized was that if a foreign dirigible were to dock and have an accident with any heat or a spark, it would explode and fall to the ground, killing many men, women, and children, due to the highly flammable chemicals that are used on foreign dirigibles. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" Additionally, another obstacle they faced were the violent winds that would knock the dirigibles around. ""Winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" All in all, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock eventually led them to abandon the idea as it was simply too risky and unfeasible."
646	15479	6	3	In the story, construction workers faced a significant problem. The once - promising idea of having a dirigible's dock on top of the Empire State Building was gradually coming to an end. When initially thinking about this idea, the architects never gave due thought to legal pressures. As it turns out, aircrafts are prohibited from flying low over urban areas. Additionally, the strong winds that pick up around the building make it extremely difficult to control an aircraft. Another major concern is the potential dangers to civilians. If not properly secured, the aircraft can break loose and plummet down into urban areas. Just like the German dirigible, it could catch on fire and explode. Even though they had a working prototype, they ultimately decided to discontinue the project, making airplanes a better option for air travel.
647	15480	6	3	There's more than one significant obstacle that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in their ambitious attempt to allow blimps to dock there. The most formidable obstacle was nature. The winds on top of the building were in a constant state of flux, constantly shifting due to the violent air currents sweeping through the area. These erratic winds made it nearly impossible to safely moor a blimp. The other practical reason why blimps could not moor on the Empire State Building was an existing strict law against airships flying too low over urban areas. Given these insurmountable challenges, the plan to have blimps dock at the building had to be abandoned.
648	15481	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous and complex obstacles when they attempted to allow dirigibles (blimps) to dock there. The greatest obstacle was nature itself. With the violent and ever - changing winds and unpredictable climate conditions, it made it extremely arduous to tie dirigibles down to the mooring mast. The ropes would be buffeted by the strong gusts, and the blimps would sway precariously. The other main reason why dirigibles could not moor on the Empire State Building was the existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The dirigibles would never be able to be tied down to the moor because it would clearly break this law. Safety was also a major concern. Dirigibles outside of the @LOCATION2 commonly used hydrogen rather than helium to fill their dirigibles. Hydrogen is highly flammable, so people were rightfully afraid that if it were to catch fire over a busy city like New York, it would cause a huge disaster. These were a few prominent examples of the struggles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building, which ultimately led to the failure of the dirigible - docking plan.
649	15482	6	3	In the article “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the architects of the Empire State Building faced multiple significant obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. First, there was the obvious and pressing concern of safety. A large dirigible dangling over a bustling New York City clearly does not seem like a safe situation at all. Moreover, it simply wasn't a reasonable thing to build. The Empire State Building was already extremely tall, and building a mast that probably wouldn't get much use anyway was an impractical decision. Considering these factors, it's understandable that the plan to allow dirigibles to dock at the building didn't materialize.
650	15483	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many challenging obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The builders had a grand vision of adding a mooring mast on top of the building to allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service. However, they couldn't turn this vision into reality. As experts pointed out, “a thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add excessive stress to the building's frame.” Al Smith, who was involved in the project, didn't get to see the dirigibles land on the building because the top of the building was too skinny. This lack of sufficient structural support and the associated risks made the plan unfeasible.
651	15484	6	3	"In a desperate attempt to revolutionize the way people traveled, the idea of the mooring was rushed and not thought over as carefully as it should have been. The number of problems and obstacles mounted steadily higher with the idea of mooring airships to a new mast atop the Empire State Building. One of these main obstacles was that while an airship was tethered to the building, it would add significant stress. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation"", which could potentially compromise the building's structural integrity. Another obstacle faced with the mooring mast was one of safety. Dirigibles not from the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable, posing a great risk of explosion. Another obstacle to the construction was nature itself. Due to violent air currents, there were high, shifting winds. A dirigible tethered to the mast would swivel around and around the Empire State Building. The only way to prevent this would be to tie lead weights to the rear end, but having massive dangling weights hanging over one thousand feet above the public was not a safe idea. A last obstacle was the fact that there was an existing law that prevented airships from flying too low over urban areas. These were all obstacles that should have been thoroughly thought through and realized before construction for the Empire State Building's mooring mast ever began. It is clear that without proper consideration of these issues, the plan was bound to face difficulties."
652	15485	6	3	"In ""The Mooring Mast"" by @PERSON1, there are numerous reasons that a proper, working Mast was impossible. There were natural reasons and mechanical reasons, as well as considerations regarding time and safety. Nature played a crucial key role in this project. The winds around the building ""were constantly shifting"" because of the building's specific location in the city. When two blimps attempted to go near to test it out, one was too unstable to dock, and the other dropped paper down a rope. ""After this stunt, the idea of the mooring mast was shelved."" @CAPS1 replaced the blimps over time, and blimps were flammable and dangerous. Also, flying at that height is illegal according to aviation regulations. In conclusion, these multiple factors combined made it unfeasible to have a functional mooring mast."
653	15486	6	3	When the builders were almost ready to place the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building, significant problems became apparent to them that caused complications in docking dirigibles. One factor was that by law, dirigibles couldn't fly that low above the city. This was because they could accidentally crash into a building and fall onto the large crowds below, causing potential mass casualties. Another factor was the air currents around the tall buildings, especially the Empire State Building at a height of 1,250 feet. Even if the dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast, the strong winds would violently rock it, and there was a high risk that it could crash against the building and fall to the busy streets below. A recent factor arose when the Hindenburg dirigible burst into flames from the hydrogen in it when it flew over New Jersey on May 6, 1937. After this tragic incident, nobody wanted to risk that happening over New York City, either. So, because of flammable hydrogen, violent air currents, and legal restrictions, the builders had serious complications when building the mooring mast to allow dirigibles to land there. In the end, these issues made the project extremely challenging and risky.
654	15487	6	3	Some obstacles were that there were many sharp rods on surrounding buildings. If the dirigible touched one of these sharp rods, it could easily pop the dirigible's envelope, leading to a dangerous situation. Another obstacle is that if the wind is blowing strongly, it was difficult and unsafe for the dirigibles to be tied to the building. The strong wind could cause the dirigible to sway uncontrollably, potentially hitting the building or other structures nearby. In conclusion, these obstacles made it very difficult to safely moor dirigibles in that location.
655	15488	6	3	There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building had to face. One obstacle was constructing a strong enough frame for the building so that a thousand - foot dirigible could be held by the single tether cable. This required precise engineering and a deep understanding of the forces involved to ensure the frame could withstand the weight and movement of the large dirigible. Another obstacle that builders of the Empire State Building faced was safety. Most dirigibles from outside the U.S at the time used hydrogen rather than helium, which made it very dangerous since hydrogen is very flammable. This made the constructors have to find a way of creating a landing field where the blimp would not touch any of the sharp spires above the Empire State Building, as a simple contact could lead to a disastrous explosion. These were @NUM1 of the many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State were faced with. Clearly, the construction of the mooring mast for dirigibles presented a complex set of challenges that needed to be carefully addressed.
656	15489	6	3	"@ORGANIZATION2's article ""The Mooring Mast"" comprehensively explains the numerous problems associated with using the peak of the Empire State Building to dock dirigibles. First of all, dirigibles that travelled internationally were typically filled with Hydrogen, a highly flammable gas. Having another Hindenburg - style disaster occur over the densely populated New York City would pose an extremely high - risk situation, endangering countless lives and causing massive property damage. Also, the winds at the top of the spire are rapidly changing and completely unpredictable. This makes the approach of a dirigible to the docking point extremely dangerous. It would normally be okay for a blimp to land in a windy area, as lead weights could be fastened to ropes holding the blimp down. However, without landing on the ground, such as just attaching to the spire, there was simply no way to weigh down the blimp to stabilize it. Finally, a strict law existed against airships flying too low over urban areas, which made a docking at the Empire State Building completely illegal. Many practical reasons effectively crushed the dream of having dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building."
657	15490	6	3	Many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was that the architect could not simply drop a mooring on top of the building's flat roof. As described in @CAPS2 in @CAPS1 @NUM1, the situation was far more complex than a simple placement. Also, rather than building a utilitarian mast without any ornamentation, the architects designed a shiny glass and chrome - nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from inside. With a step - back design to carefully imitate the overall shape of the building itself, it added an aesthetic touch but also increased the complexity. It is further detailed in @CAPS2 in @CAPS1 @NUM2. These design choices and limitations ultimately made the goal of enabling dirigible docking a challenging endeavor for the builders.
658	15491	6	3	"Based on the excerpt ""The @CAPS1 Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, there were many obstacles the builders of the @ORGANIZATION1 faced in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of their main obstacles was the framework. They had to meticulously design it so that the building could bear the stress of the dirigible. As stated, ""The stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation"". In order to make it work, they would need to use different types of high - strength steel. Another significant obstacle the builders of @ORGANIZATION1 had to deal with was safety. Winds and hydrogen were the main focuses. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen, and hydrogen is highly flammable. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" They would also have to be extremely careful about pedestrians, as ""they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street"". Those are just two examples of the many challenges the builders of the Empire State Building @ORGANIZATION1 had to overcome in their pursuit of allowing dirigible docking."
659	15492	6	3	There were a handful of problems that came along with the idea of docking dirigibles on the Empire State Building. This idea was hardly practical, mainly for safety reasons. If a dirigible docked there on one cable, extreme tension would be put on the building's structure, potentially causing long - term damage. Also, if an international dirigible were to dock filled with very flammable hydrogen and catch fire, the results would be catastrophic, not only endangering the passengers and crew but also the people on the ground in the busy New York City. The task of actually docking would be a problem as well. With such a high altitude, the winds were very strong and turbulent. Nothing could effectively prevent the dirigibles from swinging around the building, increasing the risk of collision. In other situations, dirigibles would be weighted down with lead weights. However, if these were to fall, they would land in the busy city streets of New York, posing a serious threat to pedestrians and vehicles. Lastly, there was a law against low - flying airships, completely dismissing the idea of docking dirigibles on the Empire State Building, making it an unfeasible concept from a legal perspective.
660	15493	6	3	"In trying to build a dock at the top of the Empire State Building for dirigibles, the workers faced many obstacles. One reason is because, as noted, ""the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof"" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) because it would only be held by ""a single cable tether"" (@CAPS1. @NUM1), which would add excessive stress to the building. And the only way to fix this issue would be to spend ""over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications"" to strengthen the structure, a costly and time - consuming solution. Another obstacle was ""nature itself"" (@CAPS1. @NUM3). This is because the winds would be ""constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (@CAPS1. @NUM3). And the one way to solve it would be to put lead weights to weigh down the back, but it's neither ""practical nor safe"" (@CAPS1. @NUM3). The last reason why is because of the ""law against airships flying too low over urban areas"", so it would ""make it illegal for a ship to ever tie to the building"". These multiple obstacles made the construction of a dirigible dock at the Empire State Building a nearly impossible task."
661	15494	6	3	"In an attempt to allow dirigibles, otherwise known as zeppelins or blimps, to dock on the Empire State Building, the builders indeed faced numerous obstacles along the way. Al Smith stated that ""... engineers here in New York [are] trying to figure out a practical, workable arrangement"" (paragraph @NUM1). First, they couldn't simply drop a mooring mast on top of the building's flat roof. Doing so would add an excessive amount of stress to the frame, and the frame would have to be extensively modified to accommodate this new situation"" (paragraph @NUM2). Another significant obstacle was that most dirigibles outside of the @LOCATION2 use hydrogen, which is extremely flammable. When the ""Hindenburg"" was destroyed by fire, ""the owners... realized how much worse that could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York"" (paragraph @NUM3). The most challenging obstacle was ""nature itself"" (paragraph @NUM4). Due to the violent air currents, ""the winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting"" (paragraph @NUM4). In open areas, dirigibles could be weighted down by lead weights, but this poses a real threat to pedestrians on the street, as the weights would be dangling precariously above them. Lastly, there was ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (paragraph @NUM6). This law makes docking at the Empire State building completely illegal. In conclusion, the many obstacles encountered by the builders made it clear that allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was an unfeasible idea."
662	15495	6	3	The builders of the Empire State building faced four main problems in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of these problems was solved, while the other three remained unsolved. The first obstacle was that since each dirigible would be connected to the top of the building by a single cable, an enormous amount of stress would be put on the frame of the building. This issue was resolved by simply reinforcing the frame of the Empire State Building. However, it cost over sixty thousand dollars to make these necessary modifications. The second obstacle was not so easily overcome. Dirigibles from other countries rely on hydrogen to stay afloat. Hydrogen is highly flammable, and the tragic example of the Hindenburg blimp that burst into flame served as a stark reminder to the owners and builders of the Empire State Building of how dangerous an accident like that, especially in densely populated New York City, could be. The third obstacle also proved impossible to solve - because of the high - speed winds at the top of the building, there would be no practical way for a dirigible to dock safely. During the only test, the Los Angeles navy dirigible could not get close enough to dock because of the strong winds. It would have been all too easy for the dirigible to spin out of control and hit a spire on a nearby building. Lastly, there was already a law in place that prevented dirigibles from flying too close to urban areas, which would make it illegal to dock or fly a ship in New York City. In summary, despite solving one problem, the remaining three obstacles made it impossible for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
663	15496	6	3	In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. First, the wind speed was too high at that altitude. The builders were understandably concerned as they didn't want any dirigibles to fall on the stores below, endangering the lives of people and causing significant property damage. Second, they didn't complete the docking - related construction because the building couldn't bear all the weight that they intended to place on top of it. The structural integrity of the building was at stake if they were to proceed with the plan. Third, hydrogen is highly flammable and could catch on fire easily. A single spark could potentially lead to a catastrophic fire involving the dirigible. In brief, there were many problems that made the Empire State Building an unsuitable location to dock a dirigible, and these issues collectively made the idea unviable.
664	15497	6	3	During the @DATE1 and the 1930s, there was a fierce competition emerging over constructing the largest building. To distinguish the Empire State Building from the rest, the @ORGANIZATION1 decided to install a mooring mast for dirigibles. This would not only have symbolic meaning but also make the Empire State Building the world's largest building in a unique way. However, the mooring mast was certain to fail for a few reasons. For one, foreign dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is very flammable and would cause a huge fire if an accident were to occur. Another reason is that above the Empire State Building, there are strong winds and currents that are constantly shifting. This would make it extremely difficult for pilots to control the dirigible. Pilots unable to control the dirigible would have great difficulty docking their dirigible safely. Lastly, the mooring dock failed because of the law. This law stated that it is illegal to fly airships too low over urban areas. On 1931, @CAPS3 Clavan @CAPS4 the @CAPS5 of the mooring mast. By the late 1930's, the idea was completely abandoned as it became clear that it was unworkable.
665	15498	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced a lot of obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One major obstacle was the lack of suitable landing areas. Dirigibles usually land in open fields, where they are weighted down with lead weights. In New York, these lead weights would be dangling above pedestrians on the busy streets, posing a serious safety risk. Another obstacle was safety. Most dirigibles use hydrogen, which is highly flammable. The builders were worried that an accident like the Hindenburg could happen, and this time it would be above a densely populated area, causing far - reaching and devastating consequences. Another obstacle was an existing law against airships flying too low in urban areas. This law makes it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building. The final obstacle was the forceful winds. These winds could blow the dirigible onto the sharp spires of other buildings and puncture the shell. The captain couldn't even take his hands off the control levers for a moment. All in all, the mooring mast was not a well - thought - out idea, and it would not have been safe at all to implement.
666	15499	6	3	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were mainly due to structural and safety issues. According to paragraph @NUM1, ""A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add significant stress to the building's frame."" This problem required over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications to the building's framework. Although structural issues were a problem, the safety of the pedestrians created an even bigger obstacle for the builders. Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen instead of helium, which created huge fire hazards. ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by a fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area, such as downtown New York"" (paragraph @NUM2). Even though the existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas prevented dirigibles from mooring at the Empire State Building, the biggest obstacle of them all was nature itself. The dirigibles' shells could be easily punctured by the winds constantly shifting due to violent air currents. In the end, these multiple challenges made it nearly impossible for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building."
667	15500	6	3	"The builders have faced many obstacles, from laws to potential future disasters. There were several problems with the design and location of the mooring mast. One problem was that ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting."" These unpredictable winds made it extremely difficult to control the movement of a blimp. Even though the architects adjusted the design of the mast, it was still too dangerous to land a blimp. Another major problem was the dirigibles themselves. They were filled with combustible hydrogen. If a blimp was to catch fire, like the Hindenburg, the burning debris would fall on the pedestrians below, posing a great threat to their lives. The last problem was a law that prevented ""airships flying too low over urban areas."" In conclusion, due to laws, the characteristics of the dirigibles, and the forces of nature, the mooring mast was not used for its intended purpose."
668	15501	6	3	"The first obstacle is being able to get the passengers on and off due to the great height they are already at. As stated in paragraph @NUM1, ""the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of the forceful winds."" These strong winds made it extremely difficult for the dirigible to maneuver near the mast. Therefore, the power of the wind is a huge obstacle. Another obstacle stated in paragraph @NUM1 is that ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to tie up to the building or even approach the area."" In summary, both the wind and the law were significant obstacles that the builders had to face when trying to make dirigible docking possible at the Empire State Building."
669	15502	6	3	The architects who built the mooring mast on the top of the Empire State Building had many problems with actually docking any dirigibles there. When they were building, the idea of being able to dock blimps on the top of a building was revolutionary and ideal. But they had many issues with safety, weather, and laws. One issue with safety was that the gas inside the dirigibles, hydrogen, is highly flammable. A single accident could harm hundreds of people walking on New York's busy streets. The wind on top of the building was also very strong, making it difficult for any blimp to get close enough to the mooring mast. The last difficulty that the builders had was laws. There were certain laws not allowing airships to fly too low over highly populated urban areas. While their mooring mast seemed like a good idea at the start, sadly, due to these combined challenges, it never got much use.
670	15503	6	3	"Based on the information given in the excerpt, the obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building had to face were critical to the usage of the dock. Not only is it a challenge to build a 102 - story building, but when factoring in wind and other weather conditions, it is not an easy task. In order for the builders of the Empire State Building to create and hoist the dock to the top, they needed to first reinforce the skeleton of the building itself. ""The Architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add substantial stress to the building's frame."" (paragraph @NUM1). When constructing the mooring mast, the builders had to carefully consider the violent wind speeds and ensure that the structure of the building could support itself under the additional load. There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building had to work through to complete their project. In the end, these challenges shaped the practical limitations of the dock's use."
671	15504	6	3	The obstacle to the successful use of the morning mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, which made it extremely difficult to maintain a stable connection with dirigibles. This shifting wind pattern posed a significant challenge to the docking process, ultimately hindering the effective use of the mast.
672	15505	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were quite substantial. The main hurdle was the unsuccessful use of the mooring mast, and nature itself added to the difficulties. After the initial celebration of the idea, they were disappointed because the dirigibles were unable to dock there. Subsequently, another dirigible, the 1931 year blimp Columbia, attempted a publicity stunt where it would fly up and deliver a bundle of newspapers to the Empire State Building. When the stunt was not successful, it became clear that the blimp could not be used for transportation in the future as initially hoped.
673	15506	6	3	There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building had to face in an attempt to allow the docking of dirigibles. Firstly, there was no practical way for architects to drop a mooring mast on top of the building's smooth roof. If a thousand - foot dirigible overshadowed the top of the building with only one cable tether, stress would be instantly added to the building's frame. The stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure would need to be transmitted all the way down to the building's foundation. Another obstacle for the builders was that the building's steel frame would have to be strengthened to accommodate this new design. The greatest obstacle in launching this new design was nature. Architects would need to consider the constant shifting of winds due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible was tied to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would be unsturdy. The fact that this design would be dangling above the pedestrians on the street worried the architects due to concerns for the population. Architects also had to deal with the law against airships traveling too low above urban areas. This law clearly stated the forbidden right of one to tether a large ship to a building or even approach the area. Although there were attempts of dirigibles to reach the building, the entire idea was dropped, much to the architects' disappointment.
674	15507	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One significant obstacle was the fact that dirigibles contain highly flammable gases. If the blimp was docked over a large and densely - populated city like New York City, it would be extremely dangerous if a blimp did catch on fire, potentially causing widespread destruction and endangering countless lives. Another obstacle was that the docking system would not work as well as planned, nor would it be safe. These airships are at the mercy of the winds and weather. In normal cases of docking dirigibles on open landing fields, they are weighted down on the front and back. If the blimps were to stay in place on the Empire State Building, they would need to have a weight on the back as well as the front, which would end up dangling over the city. Without the weight on the back, the blimp would spin around the mooring mast. Finally, the height at which the dirigibles would have to be would not be safe. If the blimp were to be blown by the wind, the blimp would crash into the pointy tops of nearby buildings, causing a disastrous accident. These are the obstacles the builders faced when trying to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building.
675	15508	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle the builders faced was that the building itself would need to be modified. The architects in charge of adding the mooring mast realized that if they were to add the mast as - is, and start mooring dirigibles to it, then there would be too much stress put on the Empire State Building's frame. For this reason, they first had to make $100,000 worth of changes to the building in order to sufficiently strengthen its frame (paragraph 1). The second obstacle which builders faced in trying to make it possible to moor dirigibles to a mast on the Empire State Building was just general safety. After the Hindenburg disaster of 1937 took place, it became clear to the architect in charge of the project how truly catastrophic an accident like that would have been if it occurred over as highly - populated a place as New York City (paragraph 2). It wasn't just the possibility of catastrophic disaster which added to the worry about safety though. Considering the constant violent wind gusts which happen at the height of the mast, architects realized that any dirigible moored up there would be constantly swinging rapidly around the mast. The way this problem is solved when mooring dirigibles on the ground is through the hanging of weights on its back, yet this would present yet another safety issue because if the weight were to fall on the people below, it could easily kill somebody (paragraph 3). The final obstacle architects faced was a law outlawing a dirigible flying so low near urban areas in the first place. In the end, the fact that there were so many obstacles prevented the idea of mooring dirigibles there from ever becoming a reality at all.
676	15509	6	3	"There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the mast. One significant obstacle they faced was nature itself. As described in the excerpt, ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around."" This unpredictable movement could have led to major accidents if the dirigibles were allowed to dock here. Another obstacle they encountered was that these dirigibles could not fly too low over urban cities. The excerpt states that ""there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" But before the idea was even dropped, two dirigibles attempted to reach the building. The first one could not reach the building because of the forceful winds battering it. The second airship attempted a stunt to drop off a bundle of newspapers. However, they didn't have the right equipment, so they had to have a worker catch the bundle of papers that were attached by a rope. These obstacles were very important to the construction of the mast because they probably saved the lives not only of the aviators but also of the people that lived in urban cities below, as a successful docking attempt with such challenges could have ended in disaster."
677	15510	6	3	"In the @DATE1's, dirigibles were widely known as the transportation of the future. After the Empire State Building was built, the builders attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there. There were three main reasons that prevented the builders from successfully allowing dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building. ""The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area."" Al Smith, a key figure in the project, thought that if a mooring mast was added to the top of the building, it would allow dirigibles to anchor there for hours. But it was not an easy task for the architects to simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" The violent air currents from the wind would cause the back of the ship to swivel around the mooring mast, making it extremely difficult to keep the dirigible stable. ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" In the end, two dirigibles attempted to dock, but due to these insurmountable obstacles, it didn't work, and the idea of regular dirigible docking at the building was ultimately abandoned."
678	15511	6	3	There were many obstacles the builders faced while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building. The first major problem they faced was safety. A lot of dirigibles, especially those from outside the United States, used hydrogen which is highly @CAPS1. So, it was not safe in a place with a large number of people like downtown New York to have a dirigible fly that low. It is not safe because in case of an accident, there could be a large amount of deaths due to the highly combustible nature of hydrogen. The second obstacle the builders faced was that the winds on the top of the building were constantly blowing and could not allow the dirigible to stay stable in one place. Instead, it would just go around and around the mast, making docking extremely difficult and dangerous. The third and last obstacle that the builders faced was the law. There was a law that did not allow airships to fly too low over urban areas. So, it was illegal for a ship to be tied on the Empire State Building. These combined obstacles made it clear that allowing dirigibles to dock at the building was an unfeasible and unsafe idea.
679	15512	6	3	"On December 11, 1929, Al Smith announced that the Empire State Building would be reaching the height of 1,250 feet; taller than the previous largest building, the Chrysler Building. Smith made the building taller by adding a top or a hat. John @CAPS1 described this as ""[The top of the Empire State Building] would be more than an ornament... The Empire State Building would be equipped for an age of transportation that was then only the dream of a few aviation pioneers"" (pg 1). This dream consisted of having a mooring mast at the top of the building to dock dirigibles, or blimps. However, many obstacles emerged the more they began to plan this ambitious project. For instance, the amount of stress it would add to the building's frame was a major concern. ""A thousand - foot dirigible held by a single cable tether would add stress to the building's frame... The Empire State Building would have to... [have] over @MONEY1 worth of modifications (pg @NUM1)."" Another issue was the use of hydrogen opposed to helium. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the U.S used hydrogen... and hydrogen is highly flammable (pg @NUM1)."" And then there was simply nature itself. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents... they would be dangling high above pedestrians... that was neither safe nor practical."" In the end, these numerous obstacles made the dream of dirigible docking at the Empire State Building unachievable."
680	15513	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were significant. Dirigibles had a top speed of eighty miles per hour, which made precise docking a challenge. The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. Dirigibles were typically docked by means of an electric winch, which would haul in a line from the front of the ship and then tie it to a mast. However, the body of the dirigibles could swing in the breeze, even when tethered. Despite this, in theory, passengers could safely get on and off. But in reality, the combination of the high - speed approach, the lack of a proper landing area, and the swinging of the dirigibles in the wind made it extremely difficult and risky to allow regular docking at the Empire State Building, and these factors ultimately prevented the successful implementation of this docking concept.
681	15514	6	3	The builders faced numerous challenges while constructing a mast for dirigibles on the Empire State Building. One major hurdle was that they had to reinforce the foundation. This was crucial because all the stress placed on the building's structure could otherwise tear it apart. Additionally, the mast was impractical for dirigible use. Shifting air currents and strong winds would either make it impossible for dirigibles to land or cause the blimp to circle around and potentially hit nearby buildings. Despite the workers' efforts in dealing with these obstacles, they ultimately realized that they couldn't make the dirigible mast a viable option.
682	15515	6	3	"The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION2 comprehensively outlines the problems architects encountered when attempting to enable dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building. The idea was fundamentally impractical, primarily due to safety concerns. Most dirigibles at that time used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable, and if an accident were to occur, the dirigible could crash into the thousands of pedestrians in bustling New York City. Nature also posed a significant obstacle. In New York City, there were constantly shifting winds that could make the dirigible spin out of control, even when it was docked. Some dirigibles used lead weights to prevent the back from swiveling, but in the context of the Empire State Building, ""they would be dangling above pedestrians on the street... neither practical nor safe."" Moreover, air laws further prevented the dirigible docks from becoming a reality. It was illegal for the dirigibles to even approach the area because of how low they would have to fly. In conclusion, mooring masts were impractical and ""never fulfilled its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed."
683	15516	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1, there were several obstacles when trying to build a dock for the Empire State Building. The first significant obstacle was the limited space available for a landing spot. New York City is densely populated with a large number of people and numerous buildings. As stated, ""The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area."" Dirigibles were very large, so they needed enough space to land without hitting anything else. Secondly, safety was a major concern. They had to consider all the people in the vicinity and how close the dirigibles would be to the building. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" If the wind blew too strongly, it could swing the dirigible back into the building. Lastly, the danger of the weights being suspended over a large number of people's heads was quite serious. ""... using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street..."" If one of the weights were ever to fail, it would probably kill someone, and the impact of such an incident would be long - lasting. Overall, these obstacles made it extremely difficult to build a functional dock for dirigibles at the Empire State Building."
684	15517	6	3	Some obstacles that the Empire State builders had to face when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were quite significant. A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, added a substantial amount of stress to the building's frame. The steel frame of the Empire State Building had to be carefully modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. The cost of these modifications was estimated to be over sixty thousand dollars. Another obstacle related to allowing dirigibles was the mast. The biggest challenge with the mast was nature itself. The winds were constantly changing direction due to violent air currents. When the dirigibles were about to land, the back of the ship would swivel around the mast, making the landing process unsafe. In the end, these obstacles made it very difficult to make the dirigible docking a reality at the Empire State Building.
685	15518	6	3	Builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple challenges while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the initial problems was that they couldn't simply install a mooring mast on the flat roof of the Empire State Building. A dirigible attached to the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would exert a great deal of stress on the building frame. Its weight and the air pressure it generated would gradually weaken the foundation of the Empire State Building. To address this, they had to make modifications worth sixty thousand dollars to the framework so that it could withstand the weight of the dirigibles. Another issue was that the mooring mast failed to fulfill its intended purpose, a fact that should have been considered before construction. Safety was a major concern. Many countries outside the U.S. used hydrogen instead of helium in their dirigibles, and hydrogen is extremely flammable. There was an incident where a blimp was destroyed in a fire due to the hydrogen in its balloon. The most significant challenge was the wind above the building. The wind was constantly shifting because of violent air currents. If the blimp was tethered to the mooring mast, the back would rotate around the mast. Blimps typically use weights to land in open fields, but this was not an option over the building because having weights dangling over pedestrians was not safe. In conclusion, the builders had great difficulties in their attempt to allow blimps to dock at the Empire State Building.
686	15519	6	3	"During the attempt in building a docking station for dirigibles on top of the Empire State Building, there were indeed many significant obstacles that gradually made this idea less and less feasible. One huge problem stemmed from the building's foundation. A swinging blimp, which can be up to a thousand feet in length, when positioned on top of the building, would add an enormous amount of stress. This meant that a substantial amount of extra money would need to be invested in strengthening the foundation and framework to support a huge zeppelin on the mooring mast. Since the building tops out at 1,250 feet in altitude, fierce air currents constantly rip through the top of the building. These strong air currents caused impossible docking conditions because the blimp could easily hit the building and pop. Due to the high flammability of hydrogen, such a dangerous eruption could cause widespread destruction in the densely populated city below. Referring to the Hindenburg explosion in Lakehurst, New Jersey in 1937, ""The owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area."" Due to these mainly safety - related reasons, the docking station for dirigibles was never built."
687	15520	6	3	"There were numerous challenges the builders of the Empire State Building faced in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. One big problem they encountered was the wind. The specific design of the mooring station meant that the wind could easily catch the tail of the dirigible, causing it to spin around the building in an unpredictable manner. Also, once the mooring station was completed, the strong wind made it extremely unsafe for dirigibles to get close to the building. Another problem they faced was related to the stability and support of the building. ""Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) This was necessary so that a blimp wouldn't pull the mooring station off the building. One final significant problem they faced was the safety of the people. It is well - known that most non - American dirigibles use flammable gasses to fly. If there was an accident similar to the Hindenburg over the busy New York streets, it would be an absolute disaster. There were many problems faced by the building crew of the Empire State Building; wind, stability, and safety are just a few of the major hurdles that ultimately made the docking of dirigibles unfeasible."
688	15521	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the very important obstacles they had to deal with was the stress that a thousand - foot dirigible would add to the building's frame. Therefore, ""the building's structure would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" (@NUM1) @CAPS1, safety was also a major obstacle for the builders. Dirigibles used hydrogen, ""which was commonly used rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" (@NUM2. line @NUM3) The greatest obstacle faced by the builders was nature. As the winds shifted erratically at the top of the building, the back of the dirigibles would swivel around the mast. Previous solutions, like ""dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighed down in the back with lead weights..."" (@NUM4. line @NUM3 - 5) were not practical or safe with the mooring mast on the Empire State Building. Lastly, an obstacle they faced was that there was a ""law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" (@NUM6. line @NUM7) This made it so that the dirigibles could not even approach this area. There were several insurmountable obstacles faced when the builders were trying to make the Empire State Building a docking station, which ultimately led to the abandonment of the idea."
689	15522	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles while building it. Some of those obstacles included safety, the limited technology they had, and the inadequate planning they put into building the mooring mast. The problems with the safety of the mooring mast were significant. Dirigibles from countries other than the United States often used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is extremely flammable, so the risk of a fire in the dirigible was very high. Also, another safety - related problem the builders faced was that the winds on top of the building were much too strong to successfully land a dirigible. The builders also had problems with the available technology. They didn't have the advanced technology required to successfully land a 1000 - ft dirigible at the top of a tower using a single cable because it would add excessive stress to the building's frame, and the stress from the wind pressure would be hazardous to the building's overall structure. The obstacles that the builders faced with the planning of the mooring mast were that they didn't plan thoroughly enough and should have recognized that the mast would be a failure from the start. In conclusion, these multiple obstacles made it impossible to establish a successful dirigible docking station on the Empire State Building.
690	15523	6	3	"Based on the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building faced certain challenges in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock. The three main obstacles the builders faced were their concern for safety, the forces of nature itself, and the existing laws regarding airships. Safety is always a major factor when constructing any structure. The builders had the option of using hydrogen rather than helium, but they were taking a huge risk considering how highly flammable hydrogen is. Later, they realized how catastrophic it could have been if what happened to the German dirigible ""Hindenburg"" on May 6, 1937, had occurred above a ""densely populated"" area like New York City. Nature itself was also a significant obstacle because the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting. This could potentially cause the back of the dirigible to ""swivel"" around the mooring mast in a dangerous manner. The final obstacle was the ""existing laws against aircrafts flying too low over urban areas."" They were worried that the winds would blow the dirigibles into the sharp spires of other structures, puncturing the dirigible's shell. After two failed attempts, they decided to cancel the construction of the ""Mooring Mast"" due to ""the unsolved problems of mooring airships to a fixed mast at such a height that made it desirable to postpone to a later date the final installation of the landing gear."" So, these obstacles ultimately led to the abandonment of the plan to build a functional dirigible docking station on the Empire State Building."
691	15524	6	3	"The builders faced many problems in their attempts to allow a dirigible to land at the Empire State Building. One of the main reasons was safety. Most dirigibles outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. Allowing such a flammable - filled dirigible over a bustling city like New York would have been an extremely large risk. A single spark could lead to a massive explosion, endangering countless lives below. Another problem was the air currents. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast, making it difficult to control and increasing the risk of damage to the dirigible and the building. A final problem was a law ""against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This law would forever prohibit any airship to dock with the mast, or even approach the city to attempt to dock, making the idea of dirigible landings at the Empire State Building unfeasible."
692	15525	6	3	There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The obstacles were safety, nature, and laws. Most foreign dirigibles used hydrogen which is highly flammable instead of helium. If a dirigible filled with hydrogen were to catch on fire above a very populated city like New York, the outcome would be extremely bad. The fire could spread rapidly, causing destruction to the building and endangering the lives of thousands of people on the ground. The winds that high were very violent. There was no way to keep a dirigible still. Even though the front is hooked to the building, the back would swing wildly in the strong winds. It was not safe for passengers or the operation of the dirigible. There was a law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas. It was illegal to fly close to the building or to dock at it. The builders of the Empire state Building faced many obstacles in trying to allow dirigibles to dock there, and these factors ultimately made the plan unworkable.
693	15526	6	3	The building of the Empire State building was a project which faced many obstacles. Due to the additional plan of building a mooring mast at the top of the building, a series of challenges and possibilities were forced to be taken into consideration. Firstly, the addition of a mooring mast to the top of the building would significantly weigh down the building, adding stress to its frame. Because of this, over @MONEY1 worth of modifications would have to be made to reinforce the building's frame and stabilize it as a whole. These modifications were necessary to ensure the long - term safety and integrity of the building. Laws and regulations about how high airships could hover over urban areas also restricted the use of the mast. Since the building was located in the middle of a city, a densely populated area with thousands of pedestrians below, it was clearly neither practical, nor safe to have airships hovering too low. Furthermore, Nature itself was the greatest obstacle to the success of the mast. Many foreign dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium, and this risked a fire hazard. A fire on a dirigible could quickly spread and cause major damage. Lastly, strong winds and violent air currents all in all prevented the construction of the mast, as using the top of the building as a dock for airships was perhaps just a bit far - fetched, making the idea of a functional mooring mast unachievable.
694	15527	6	3	There were many obstacles that the workers had to overcome to succeed in the process of the mast. They had to figure out how they were going to land the big aircraft on the small - framed building. Landing a large dirigible on a relatively small - framed building presented a complex problem. The size difference meant that precise maneuvering was required. Also, the workers needed to figure out a way to safely get the passengers on and off the aircraft while the tail was whipping around in the air. This was a dangerous situation as the whipping tail could hit passengers or cause the dirigible to become unstable. They needed to talk and consult with the U.S. Naval Air station because they were leaders in research of the dirigibles. The Naval Air station had the expertise and knowledge that could help solve these problems. Another obstacle the workers had to overcome was the law against low - flying aircraft in @ORGANIZATION3. This law restricted the ability of the dirigible to approach the building for docking. So those are some obstacles that the constructors of the mast had to overcome to build the mast upon the Empire State building in @LOCATION1, and these challenges made the project very difficult.
695	15528	6	3	"Being an architect and construction worker is one of the hardest jobs in the world, especially at an elevation of @NUM1 feet. Building the Empire State building was no easy task. An even more challenging task was building a mooring mast, a docking area for dirigibles, on top of the Empire State Building. Since the building had a flat roof, ""architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building."" Architects had to build an extension in the shape of a rocket jutting out from the flat roof. This required careful planning and engineering to ensure the stability of the extension. The Architects also realized that having a single cable at the top of the extension to hook onto the dirigible would add tremendous stress to the building. They had to find a way to ease the stress to the building's foundation. This might involve redistributing the forces or using additional support structures. Although the architects faced challenges they did overcome them and planned to put their ideas into action, showing their determination and problem - solving skills."
696	15529	6	3	In attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building, the builders faced numerous challenging obstacles. One significant obstacle was the excessive stress on the building's frame. The dirigible would need to be somehow securely connected to the frame, which was located @NUM1 feet below. Achieving a stable connection from such a distance was no easy feat. Another major problem the builders encountered was safety. The workers initially considered using hydrogen to keep the dirigibles afloat, as it was a common choice at the time. However, they quickly realized that hydrogen is highly flammable, posing a serious risk. Other issues stemmed from nature and law. The strong winds in nature would complicate the dirigibles from staying still during docking. Moreover, the law stated that the dirigibles would be flying too low for urban areas. All these problems the builders of the Empire State Building faced ultimately led to the failure of the plan.
697	15530	6	3	Many years ago, people were in search of a new and more practical mode of transportation. When the dirigible (or blimp) was introduced, it was widely believed that this small aircraft could be the transportation of the future. Ambitious plans were made for a mast to be constructed atop the iconic Empire State Building located in the bustling New York City. The project was soon set in motion, but it was not without numerous obstacles along the way. Hazards in nature, the construction aspects of the Empire State Building, and the differences between American and @CAPS1 dirigibles all hindered the success of the mooring mast. It is a well - known fact that nature can be highly unpredictable and incredibly harsh. This characteristic makes all forms of transportation, especially transportation by air, extremely difficult and dangerous. In the construction of the mooring mast, violent wind currents were frequently noted. It would be nearly impossible to allow a dirigible to dock atop the Empire State Building on a very windy day because only the front portion of the aircraft would be secure. This not only endangers the passengers on the dirigible but also the pedestrians below. Secondly, it was noted that the Empire State Building's roof required significant improvements in order for dirigibles to dock there safely. Upon being secured by one cable tether, the weight of the dirigible would press on the building. This could potentially be hazardous, and it was estimated that it would cost about @MONEY1 to fix any resulting damage. Lastly, dirigibles from other countries would not be able to fly to the United States. American dirigibles are filled with helium, which made them very light and easy to fly. @CAPS1 models used hydrogen, which happens to be incredibly flammable. After a German dirigible was damaged beyond repair by a devastating fire, it was determined that these models could not be used. Ultimately, the dangers associated with using dirigibles for travel outweighed the benefits. It was determined that too many accidents could be caused by dirigibles, so the Empire State Building had to be used in another way.
698	15531	6	3	The obstacles the builders had to go through to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building involved using an electrical winch. By tying the dirigible to the mast, they faced the issue of wind pressure. For a dirigible to be stable, it needed to be in an open field and weighed down in the back with lead weights. They tried to figure out a way to tie it to the building, but it was illegal, so they couldn't do it. Due to the forceful winds, they also couldn't tie it on to the building safely. Moreover, the dirigible mooring equipment was never installed properly. As a result, dirigibles and their passengers had quietly disappeared from the plan, and instead of becoming a mode of transportation, dirigibles gave way to airplanes.
699	15532	6	3	Some problems the designers faced were the violent air currents that commonly form in urban areas. This would be a major problem because the dirigible, being of light weight, would be tossed around easily by these air currents. Such erratic movement could damage the dirigible and pose a threat to its passengers. Another problem is the fact that it would be extremely dangerous to land a dirigible over a densely populated area like New York City. In case of an accident, many people on the ground could be injured or even lose their lives. Considering these issues, it became clear that using dirigibles for docking at the intended location in New York City was not a viable option.
700	15533	6	3	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock were extremely difficult. The builders had to undertake extensive modifications and strengthen the building. These modifications were not only complex but also very expensive, costing ""over sixty thousand dollars"". Another significant obstacle the builders faced were the ever - changing winds on the top of the building. The winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around uncontrollably. Also, safety was a major concern. Builders were afraid that a @CAPS1 incident would happen because the dirigibles' refill of hydrogen is very flammable. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" @CAPS2, Another reason was that the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made it abundantly clear that the dock would never happen. Even though the dirigibles would be pretty high off the ground, the law was still effective. They couldn't even tie it up and secure it so it wouldn't fall because it was still against the law. This law made it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. In the end, all these insurmountable obstacles led to the abandonment of the plan to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building."
701	15534	6	3	"In the short story of ""The Mooring Mast."" by Marcia Amidon Løsted, it details how the builders of the Empire State Building encountered three significant obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Two of these obstacles were related to safety. Firstly, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" Having a flammable ship hovering above a ""densely populated area such as downtown New York could result in disaster."" The second safety concern stemmed from ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" A dirigible ""dangling high above pedestrians on the street was neither practical nor safe."" The final obstacle the Empire State Building faced was a legal one. ""An existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" meant ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" Due to these law - related and safety obstacles, the builders of the Empire State Building were unable to make any successful attempts for dirigibles to dock there."
702	15535	6	3	"According to the excerpt from @ORGANIZATION2's ""The Mooring Mast"", when the builders of the Empire State Building tried to allow dirigibles to dock there, they ran into multiple obstacles. When Al Smith was initially planning the structure and function of the mast, his overambition became evident. In paragraph @NUM1, the reader can clearly sense how competitive Smith was, and this competitive nature, while often seen as a positive trait, can sometimes overshadow practical considerations. Smith's unwavering determination to have the Empire State Building be the tallest structure was a major obstacle as it was the root cause that sparked the idea of the mooring mast. Although, as shown in the section ""Designing the Mast"", a great deal of planning went into building the mast, the additional effort required for this was also an impediment. The construction of the mast delayed the completion of the entire building. As @PERSON1 mentions in paragraph @NUM2, the mast led to unsolved problems and project postponements. A crucial factor contributing to the failure of the mast was the safety issue, given that the dirigibles were extremely flammable. As stated in paragraph @NUM3, ""the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" These aspects highlight the impracticality of installing a dirigible dock, revealing the most significant obstacles the builders had to face. Since ambition took precedence over practicality during the construction of the mooring mast, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered numerous obstacles and ultimately failed in their attempt."
703	15536	6	3	The most prominent obstacle the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was the lack of a suitable land area. This limited space made it difficult to handle the docking process smoothly. Another significant obstacle they faced was that the winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. These unpredictable wind patterns made it extremely challenging for dirigibles to approach and dock safely. Additionally, they also had to ensure that no sharp objects would puncture the dirigibles, as even a small puncture could lead to a major disaster. These are the key obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced, which ultimately hindered their plans for dirigible docking.
704	15537	6	3	"From what initially seemed to be a very feasible way to make the Empire State Building famous, the builders soon realized how difficult it would be to allow dirigibles to dock there. They encountered several obstacles. One of the problems was the added stress on the building's frame. To accommodate this extra stress, the foundation would have to be modified and strengthened. This required additional time, resources, and engineering expertise. Not only did the builders have to worry about the structural aspects, but they also had to deal with the winds. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" These erratic winds made it almost impossible for dirigibles to approach and dock safely. After facing all these obstacles, the builders finally came to the conclusion that this ""dream"" of having a dirigible dock at the Empire State Building was impossible to achieve."
705	15538	6	3	The builders of the Empire State building were grappling with numerous problems when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. Their first major problem was that they couldn't drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building. This was mainly because the mast was only held by a single tether, and installing it would add excessive stress to the building's frame. Such stress could potentially compromise the structural integrity of the entire building. Another significant obstacle is that the wind speeds were much greater at the top of the building. These strong winds pushed the dirigibles away from the docking station, making it extremely difficult to achieve a successful docking. Also, most dirigibles from outside the @LOCATION2 used hydrogen rather than helium to stay aloft, and hydrogen is extremely flammable. For the creators of the building, the idea of having dirigibles dock there just seemed impractical. A dirigible would be too hard to keep in one place when dangling @NUM1 feet in the air above New York City. Considering all these challenges, it became clear that allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was an unfeasible plan.
706	15539	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many challenges in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One significant obstacle was that United States dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. If the dirigible was ever destroyed by fire above a densely populated area like downtown New York, the accident could result in a large number of casualties and extensive property damage. One of the greatest obstacles of using the mooring mast was nature itself. The author says ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" Dangling lead weights to weigh it down over pedestrians on the streets was neither practical nor safe. The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION2 tells a few obstacles the builders had to face to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, and these issues ultimately made the plan unfeasible."
707	15540	6	3	"In The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, she describes the various obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. In paragraph Four it says, ""The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area."" This would mean that there was not much available space for the dirigibles when they were not in use. In paragraph sixteen it says, ""The U.S Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds"". This clearly shows that weather conditions, specifically strong winds, could make traveling by dirigibles very dangerous and make docking extremely difficult. These obstacles combined made it challenging to implement the plan of having dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building."
708	15541	6	3	"In attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, the obstacles they faced were indeed challenging. In the @DATE1's, dirigibles were often called ""Transportation of the Future"", which showed high hopes for their use. There was also an existing law against airships flying too low over open areas, which added a regulatory hurdle. The builders had to make numerous changes to make the docking plan perfect and get it the way they wanted. Safety was of utmost importance. Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen instead of helium. Although hydrogen is highly flammable, they still used it, posing a significant risk. In addition, ""The highest open observation deck, intended for disembarking passengers, has never been open to the public"". And to this day, it remains closed for the public to use, likely due to the safety concerns associated with the dirigibles."
709	15542	6	3	"The three insurmountable obstacles that the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building were all centered around public safety. They should have realized that ""most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen"" and that these dirigibles were thus highly prone to exploding. In an urban city like New York, a thousand - foot dirigible that would cover four city blocks would cause immense casualties if an explosion were to occur. Secondly, violent air currents caused the winds at the top of the Empire State Building to be constantly shifting. The mooring mast would not work effectively in that environment unless the back of the dirigible were weighted down with lead weights. The lead weights ""dangling high above pedestrians on the street [would be] neither practical nor safe"". Thirdly, the importance of public safety from aircraft had already been recognized in the form of a law banning airships from flying too low over urban areas. ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"". Docking in an urban setting proved far too dangerous to risk, and these obstacles made the plan unworkable."
710	15543	6	3	"Although the purpose of the mooring mast was to help dock passengers safely from the dirigible, there were many difficulties that could have endangered many lives. ""When the German dirigible '@CAPS1' was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" (paragraph @NUM1) This shows that if an accident like a dirigible flaming up above New York, there would be many serious injuries and a high likelihood of loss of life. ""In December 1930, the U.S. dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds."" (paragraph @NUM2) The toughest obstacle was to tie up the dirigible while the wind was blowing extremely strongly at it. The idea of using the mooring mast atop of the Empire State Building was then dropped due to these significant safety risks and practical difficulties."
711	15544	6	3	"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered numerous obstacles when attempting to enable dirigibles to dock there. One significant obstacle they faced was devising a method to moor a dirigible on top of the Empire State Building without imposing excessive stress on the building's frame. As L¸sted pointed out, ""A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" Another challenge was the financial aspect. They needed to carry out more than sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications to the building's framework, as stated in the text, ""Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" The most formidable obstacle the builders had to confront was nature. The strong and shifting winds would cause the dirigible to move erratically. As L¸sted noted, ""The greatest obstacle to the success of the mooring mast was nature itself."" In conclusion, these multiple obstacles made it extremely difficult for the builders to achieve the goal of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building."
712	15545	6	3	Although they made a valiant effort to transform a seemingly ingenious idea into reality, the obstacles faced by the constructors of the Empire State Building in creating a dock for dirigibles proved to be insurmountable. One of the major challenges was the tumultuous winds at the top of the Empire State Building. These powerful and forceful gales made it almost impossible to precisely maneuver a dirigible at that high elevation, let alone dock it safely to the building. Another significant barrier was the legal restriction. There was a law stating that airships were forbidden from flying too close to the ground above urban areas. This meant that it would be illegal for any dirigible to even approach the Empire State Building. Finally, the creators also had to deal with the issue of safety. Dirigibles are filled with highly flammable hydrogen, and an airship explosion over a densely populated urban area like New York City would have had truly horrific and catastrophic results. In summary, these various challenges ultimately prevented the successful establishment of a dirigible dock at the Empire State Building.
713	15546	6	3	The builders faced many problems when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. First of all, tying a dirigible with just one cable would add an enormous amount of weight to the frame of the building. In order to make this possible, the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be strengthened, which would incur an additional cost of @MONEY1. After the mast was built, the Empire State Building faced new issues as well. Most dirigibles used hydrogen, which was highly flammable. After the tragic incident of the Hindenburg, the architects were well - aware that the consequences would have been far more severe in a densely populated area such as New York City. Another problem was the high risk of having a large dirigible hanging above pedestrians just a few thousand feet in the air. The law also posed a significant hindrance to Al Smith's idea. The law clearly stated that airships were prohibited from flying too low over urban areas. When the dirigible Los Angeles attempted a trial run, the builders discovered that the wind was blowing too strongly for the dirigible, and they were worried that it might fly into nearby buildings with sharp spires. As a result, the idea of dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building was soon abandoned, giving way to the development of airplanes.
714	15547	6	3	"In the excerpt, 'The Mooring Mast' by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the constructors of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles while trying to create a docking place on such a tall building. Obstacles like a law against airships flying too low and nature itself made it extremely difficult to establish such a docking area. In paragraph @NUM1, it clearly states, 'The other practical reason why dirigibles could not dock at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas.' There was already a strong argument against building the mast, but Al Smith chose to ignore it. This law effectively made it illegal for any airship to ever tie up to the building. In paragraph @NUM2, the author explains why nature was a problem. She mentions, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This already shows signs of the great danger ahead if they continued to pursue the idea. Dirigibles usually moored in open landing fields and could be weighed down by lead weights. However, using these weights on the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling in the air, was neither practical nor safe. All these reasons combined contribute to why docking dirigibles at the Empire State Building was not allowed."
715	15548	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The most significant one was the violent winds at such a high altitude. The back of the zeppelin would swivel around the mooring mast in an unpredictable manner. There was also a real fear that the zeppelin might be blown into the sharp spires of nearby buildings, which could cause it to burst and lead to a disastrous situation. They couldn't use lead weights to hold the zeppelin in place because it wouldn't be safe to have them dangling above the busy streets below. At that time, there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas for similar safety reasons. This law would have made it illegal for a zeppelin to dock at the Empire State Building anyway. These obvious problems were unfortunately overlooked in the design of the mooring mast. In conclusion, these overlooked obstacles made it unfeasible for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
716	15549	6	3	"In the nonfiction excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @PERSON1, the architects faced numerous challenges in their attempt to enable dirigibles to dock at the building. The first major obstacle was the absence of a proper landing area. There simply was no suitable space to land the blimps. As stated, ""A mooring mast added to the top of the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers on and off."" This clearly indicates that they had to construct a mooring mast to overcome this hurdle. The second obstacle was that the architects couldn't simply place a mooring mast on top of the building. As the quote ""A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable in any weather, would add stress to the building's frame"" shows, the stress of the load and the wind pressure needed to be properly transmitted. The still frame of the building had to be modified and strengthened to adapt to this new situation. The third and most significant obstacle was the practical use of the mooring mast. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This meant that the nature of the mooring mast itself was perilous, as the back of the ship would swing around the mast, making it an unsafe structure. These three obstacles were what the architects had to deal with in their pursuit of building the mooring mast to claim the title of having the highest building in the world."
717	15550	6	3	"There were several substantial obstacles that hindered the success of the construction project. Perhaps the most insurmountable obstacle, the one that could not be addressed, was the wind itself. In paragraph @NUM1, it specifically mentions how the winds on top of the building were in a constant state of shift due to the violent air currents. These large, balloon - like dirigibles would continuously swivel around the mooring mast, even when they were securely tied down. The tragic Hindenburg disaster on May 6, 1937, further demonstrated the extreme danger of having blimps filled with highly flammable hydrogen gas hovering over a densely populated area such as downtown New York. The project was also hampered by existing flight laws in urban areas. As the author states in paragraph @NUM2, ""It was illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" Incoming blimps would be flying at an altitude that was too low according to the law, making the entire docking plan unfeasible. In conclusion, these multiple obstacles combined to make the construction and operation of the blimp - docking facility a near - impossible task."
718	15551	6	3	"The Empire State Building builders encountered various challenges when trying to allow dirigibles to dock at the building. First, they needed to gain in - depth knowledge about the mooring lines. They actively ""consulted with experts, taking detailed tours of the equipment and mooring operations"" to acquire first - hand information about them. Additionally, the builders had to be concerned about the frame of the Empire State Building. As it was stated, the frame ""would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" This implied that the builders would have to go back and carry out additional work on the frame. In summary, the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building presented the builders with a series of different obstacles that they had to overcome."
719	15552	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the architects endured a multitude of obstacles while trying to make it possible for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. The engineers had to engage in diverse experiences. They consulted with well - informed experts and took thorough tours of the equipment that would be utilized in the project. The architects also had to come to the realization that they couldn't simply and recklessly drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building. They had to carefully consider the consequences and potential dangers, such as the impact of wind pressure. Moreover, in the event of a fire, especially considering the large population of New York, many people could get severely injured or even lose their lives. The architects faced numerous challenges, and these experiences taught them about the potential dangers and possible outcomes of building the mooring mast. In the end, these lessons were crucial in their decision - making process regarding the project."
720	15553	6	3	There were a multitude of obstacles that the architects working on the mooring mast of the Empire State Building had to confront. The first issue was the fact that dirigibles were not emerging as the next big transportation trend. Without a sufficient number of dirigibles to use the mast, it would essentially serve no practical purpose. Another significant obstacle was the existing laws. These laws prohibited dirigibles from flying at low altitudes over urban areas. As a result, no dirigibles could have legally docked at the mast. A final and formidable obstacle was nature. The fierce winds at the top of the building were so strong that they could cause the dirigibles to spin around, making the docking process both dangerous and impractical. In conclusion, these combined obstacles made it extremely difficult for the architects to achieve their goal of creating a functional mooring mast for dirigibles at the Empire State Building.
721	15554	6	3	When building the Empire State Building, builders faced numerous challenges while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. From the reading excerpt “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon Løsted, it was stated that dirigibles could be as long as one thousand feet, which is equivalent to about four blocks in New York City. This presented the first major obstacle: they had no suitable place to land such a large aircraft. They couldn't position it above New York because of an existing law that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas. Architects also had to figure out a way to redesign the building so that it could support the weight of the dirigible. The most significant obstacle they faced was nature. The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing. Even when the dirigible was tied down to the building, the back of it would still swirl around. They didn't have a practical solution for this because usually, dirigibles were weighed down with cylinder blocks in an open field, and it would be extremely risky to do that over a populated area. In the end, these multiple obstacles made it nearly impossible for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
722	15555	6	3	In the excerpt, “The Mooring Mast” by @ORGANIZATION1, there was a desire to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State building for refueling and services, as well as to facilitate the boarding and disembarking of passengers. However, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered many hurdles to make this a reality. The architects and engineers of the Empire State Building thoroughly consulted with experts. They took detailed tours of the equipment and mooring operations at the @ORGANIZATION3 in Lakehurst, New Jersey (∂@NUM1). They had to have in - depth meetings with these experts and carefully analyze whether this was going to be a successful idea. “The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed....the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself” (∂'s @NUM2 & @NUM3). Another significant obstacle that the builders had to deal with was nature. The winds up there were very strong and unpredictable, making it extremely difficult to safely dock dirigibles. As a result, the idea of docking dirigibles on the Empire State Building was ultimately not successful.
723	15556	6	3	Based on the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State building encountered many obstacles during construction. While designing the mast, the architects realized that they couldn't simply install the mooring mast on the Empire State building. Doing so would add significant stress to the building's frame. So, the building would have to be carefully modified and strengthened to withstand these additional forces. Then, the builders ran into a major problem with safety. The winds on top of the building were extremely violent and constantly shifting. This would cause the dirigible to swivel around the mast uncontrollably. They then decided to add lead weights to weigh the dirigible down. However, having those heavy weights dangling high above pedestrians on the busy street was neither practical nor safe. Lastly, existing laws against airships flying low over urban areas made it illegal to achieve their goal of having dirigibles dock at the building. Overall, the planning of the Empire State building faced many difficulties, which ultimately hindered the docking of dirigibles.
724	15557	6	3	When building the mooring mast of the Empire State Building, architects faced a variety of obstacles, such as spontaneous combustion, nature, and airship - related laws. The first issue faced by builders was spontaneous combustion. Due to the tragic accidental fire on the Hindenburg, the owners of the Empire State building quickly realized that if a dirigible caught fire on their building, the consequences would be far more severe. Debris would fall onto the bustling New York streets, endangering countless lives. A second issue builders faced was mother nature herself. Because of the violent air currents, the winds above the building were in a constant state of change. This meant that even if the dirigible was docked and tethered, the back of the ship would still spin erratically. Normally, lead weights were used to hold down dirigibles in open fields, but using them over New York City would be extremely dangerous. The weights could snap off and fall onto the pedestrians below. Finally, there were laws in place regulating airship flight that held back construction. These laws set a strict limit on the heights above urban areas, making it illegal to dock a dirigible at the Empire State building or even approach it. In conclusion, the builders of the mast on the Empire State building faced numerous challenges during construction, including fires, nature, and the law, which made it very difficult to achieve their goal.
725	15558	6	3	The builders of the @CAPS1 state building faced a multitude of problems in their attempt to allow dirigables to dock there. Their first problem was that it would impose a great deal of stress on the building. If a dirigible was tied up to the building in windy conditions, it would put extra weight on the building or cause it to be pulled around. “Nature was their greatest obstacle,” and it was highly unsafe to have a large, unstable object hanging over the crowded streets of New York. In an attempt to make the building stronger, the builders had to invest over “sixty thousand dollars” in improving the skeleton or frame of the building. There were also laws in place that strictly prohibited large aircraft from flying low over a crowded city. This meant that even if they managed to build the mast, it would be illegal for the dirigibles to land there. In the end, there were so many problems that the landing of a dirigible on the Empire State building never came to fruition.
726	15559	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building, during their ambitious attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there, faced countless problems. One main problem was safety. Even though the dirigibles were going to be hooked on top of the building, the strong and unpredictable wind could potentially whip the dirigible, causing it to crash into the building. Also, after the tragic crash of the Hindenburg, the builders vividly realized how much catastrophic damage could be done if a similar incident were to happen in the bustling city of New York. Another problem they faced was the laws. The existing law strictly prohibited any aircraft from flying too low over urban areas. These insurmountable problems ultimately caused this once - promising idea to gradually disappear.
727	15560	6	3	"From the very inception of the idea of building the Empire State Building to the subsequent attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there, the builders encountered different and significant obstacles. Al Smith, with an optimistic vision, thought it was a great idea to add a mooring mast so dirigibles could dock there for several hours. However, to make this possible, the builders had to find a way to transmit all the stress of the dirigible's heavy load and the powerful wind pressure to the building's foundation. This was because a thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building could add excessive stress to the frame of the building. One of the greatest obstacles the builders faced was the wind, a force of nature. The strength of the wind was constantly shifting due to the violent and erratic air currents. For safety reasons, most dirigibles were not safe as they mostly used hydrogen, which is highly flammable. Another obstacle they faced was an existing law that didn't allow airships to fly too low over urban areas. Irving Clavan, in a practical assessment, said, ""The as yet unsolved problems of mooring air ships to a fixed mast at such a great height made it desirable to postpone to a later date the final installation of the landing gear."" Due to these numerous obstacles the builders faced, the idea of using the mooring mast for dirigibles gradually faded away."
728	15561	6	3	"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, L¸sted thoroughly addresses many of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. They had to make many complex adjustments to the building's framework, the safety of the dirigibles was extremely dangerous, and nature itself posed as a huge and unyielding obstacle for the builders. First, the architects quickly realized that they could not simply drop a mooring mast to the top of the Empire State Building because of the excessive stress it would add to the building's framework. As L¸sted states precisely, ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" The architects then had to make meticulous adjustments which would strengthen the building to allow the docking of the dirigibles. These improvements, which involved advanced engineering and additional materials, cost the architects a substantial amount of money, @MONEY1. The second obstacle faced by the builders was the safety of the dirigibles. At that time, most of the dirigibles were filled with hydrogen which was highly flammable. The architects saw how extremely dangerous this could be when they witnessed the tragic destruction of the German Hindenburg blimp. If the same thing were to happen in New York, which is a densely populated area, it could cause serious and far - reaching damage. Another obstacle the builders faced when trying to dock the dirigibles on the Empire State Building was nature. The winds at the top of the Empire State Building were constantly shifting which would cause the blimp to be very unstable. The blimp is usually weighted down by lead weights but in New York this would not be safe as they would be dangling above the unsuspecting pedestrians. The many insurmountable obstacles faced by the architects ultimately caused the docking of the blimps to be an unsuccessful endeavor."
729	15562	6	3	"Based on the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"", by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State building encountered many formidable obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. Some of these obstacles included the fact that there was a strict law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This legal restriction made it completely impossible for a ship to be tied to the building because it would be a blatant violation of the law. Also, in line three of paragraph thirteen, it is clearly stated that it would have been extremely unsafe because many dirigibles from other countries used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen, being very flammable, would put people not only inside of the dirigibles but everyone near and around it in great danger. Another obstacle mentioned in the excerpt, perhaps the largest and most challenging one, was the violent air currents causing the wind at the top of the building to always be shifting. This made it nearly impossible and extremely unsafe for them to land there. Overall, after a comprehensive analysis, the excerpt has made it abundantly clear that the only sensible way for dirigibles to land would be in an open field where there are no legal restrictions, less risk of flammable gas disasters, and more stable wind conditions."
730	15563	6	3	To allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was an extremely difficult task. For example, building the mast was really a Herculean challenge. The engineers and architects needed to engage in in - depth thinking about how to construct it properly. Moreover, they had to make sure to guarantee the passengers' safety. First of all, dirigibles are very heavy. The use of hydrogen in them might cause structural damage and make them break. Nobody could accurately predict what would happen when dirigibles flew in the sky. The body of the dirigible could swing violently in the strong wind. Perhaps it could even go out of control. Deciding which floor to put the mast on is also really important. I think no one would like to work under the huge and heavy dirigibles as it would pose a constant threat to their safety.
731	15564	6	3	Right now I'm going to tell us about some of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First, in paragraph @NUM1, the architects were blind to the potential problems of the mast because most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. This flammability posed a significant risk of fire and explosion during the docking process. Second, in paragraph @NUM2, the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air - currents. These shifting winds made it extremely difficult to safely maneuver and secure the dirigibles. Third, in paragraph @NUM3, the other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law restricted the dirigibles from approaching the building for docking. Due to these serious obstacles, the mooring mast for dirigibles at the Empire State Building was never completed.
732	15565	6	3	The builders had many obstacles to face in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. During the @DATE1's, dirigibles were a big thing in transportation as they offered a relatively new and efficient way to travel long - distances. The problem was that there weren't many landing areas for the dirigibles to land because they were so big, often requiring large open spaces. So Al Smith came up with an idea to make a landing dock on top of the Empire State Building for the dirigibles. The government had to go over Al Smith's plan to make sure it was safe and would work. Al Smith's plan was to have the dirigibles hang onto the building by a single tether wire. However, it wouldn't be allowed because the dirigibles hanging from the wire would cause too much stress to the building's structure, potentially leading to damage. It was also not possible to have dirigibles land on the Empire State Building because the hydrogen in the dirigibles would be a safety hazard. The hydrogen in the dirigibles could catch on fire and burn the Empire State Building down, endangering not only the building but also the people in and around it. In conclusion, due to these insurmountable safety and structural issues, the plan to have dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building was ultimately abandoned.
733	15566	6	3	"The owners of the Empire State Building faced quite a few obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the mooring mast. One of the first obstacles they faced was having to modify and strengthen the steel frame. This was essential in order for the building to be able to support the mooring mast where the dirigibles were supposed to dock. The modification and strengthening process required careful engineering and significant resources. Another great concern was safety. They feared an accident similar to the Hindenburg and thought of ""how much worse the accident could have been (paragraph @NUM1) if it had occurred in a city like New York. A Hindenburg - like disaster in a densely populated area would have had catastrophic consequences. The greatest obstacle they faced, however, was nature. The violent air currents caused the wind to constantly shift which would cause the docked aircrafts to ""swivel around and around the mooring mast"" (paragraph @NUM2). This swiveling made it very difficult to keep the dirigibles stable. A law which prevented airships from flying too low also made this dream a great fear to overcome. This prohibited them from not only docking there but even approaching the area. Although this dream may have seemed possible to begin with, the builders should have realized the many obstacles making their dreams quite impossible, and thus, the plan to allow dirigibles to dock at the mooring mast was unfeasible."
734	15567	6	3	Obstacles builders faced in constructing the Empire State Building to allow the attempt of a dirigible to dock were blind. The tug and pull of the unforecast wind made the dock dangerous for passengers and the building's foundation. The strong and unpredictable winds could cause the dirigible to sway violently, putting passengers at risk of injury and potentially weakening the building's structure over time. However, making such attempts were illegal for dirigibles to fly over urban areas, in case of failure. A crash or other incident could cause significant damage to the city below. Spires as well made the drop impossible for them to approach also in case of puncture. The sharp spires on the building could easily puncture the dirigible's envelope, leading to a loss of gas and a dangerous situation. Spending sixty thousand on modification to the moor mast on the @ORGANIZATION2 for the safe dock of dirigibles. Despite this investment, the idea was lost to the creation of the modern new airplane. The new airplanes offered more reliable and safer transportation options, making the dirigible docking plan obsolete. In conclusion, a combination of natural, legal, and technological factors led to the abandonment of the dirigible docking plan.
735	15568	6	3	Based on the excerpt, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were significant. The use of hydrogen rather than helium was a major issue because hydrogen is highly flammable. A small spark during the docking process could lead to a massive explosion, endangering the building and everyone nearby. The obstacle related to nature itself was also a huge problem. There's always strong and dangerous winds on top of the building. So it makes it possible for the dirigible to swivel around which is dangerous for both the passengers on the dirigible and the people on the ground. Dirigibles moored in the open landing fields could be weighed down, but using these at the Empire State Building would mean dangling high above pedestrians which is not safe. A falling dirigible or debris from it could cause serious harm. Another reason is the existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law restricted the dirigibles from getting close enough to the building for docking. If the dirigible blows near the sharp spires of the building, they can puncture the dirigible's shell, leading to a loss of gas and a potential crash. These are the reasons and obstacles why it's hard to attempt the dock of the dirigibles, and ultimately, these issues made the docking of dirigibles at the Empire State Building an unviable option.
736	15569	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1, it details the numerous obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. One significant example, as mentioned in one paragraph @NUM1, is the ""existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This law created a major hurdle as it would make it completely illegal for a dirigible to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. Overall, these legal restrictions presented a substantial challenge to the builders' ambitious plan."
737	15570	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were quite complex. One major issue was that a mooring mast would add too much stress to the building's frame. Specifically, the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be carefully modified and significantly strengthened to accommodate this new docking situation. Additionally, the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, making it difficult for dirigibles to approach and dock safely. Moreover, there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, which further complicated the plan. In conclusion, these multiple obstacles made it extremely challenging to implement the dirigible - docking idea.
738	15571	6	3	They had serious problems with the dirigibles trying to land there. The dirigible, filled with highly flammable substances, could have easily caught fire, and the consequences would have been far worse. It was extremely dangerous to attach pieces to the relevant part of the dirigible during the landing process. The high wind was a persistent problem, as it could push the dirigible off - course. If the dirigible were to burn up and fall down, people below would be in great danger and could die. In summary, the combination of these factors made dirigible landings at that location extremely perilous.
739	15572	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced a lot of problems when trying to make a dock for dirigibles. They couldn't just simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. They had to carefully consider how the dirigible would fare during docking. This involved strengthening the foundation of the building and creating a proper landing area for the dirigible. Dirigibles were able to dock by means of an electric winch. However, the problem was that they were in Downtown New York, a densely populated area. A dirigible floating in the middle of a largely populated area would be very unsafe. Also, a dirigible is made of hydrogen and helium, and hydrogen is very flammable. So, if an accident happened and a dirigible was destroyed, people below would be at risk of death. Another obstacle was the law; airships cannot fly too low over urban areas. The greatest obstacle of them all, though, was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. This idea sounded great at first, but too many things could go wrong, ultimately making the plan unfeasible.
740	15573	6	3	When the Empire State Building was being constructed, the main idea was to create a mooring mast for dirigibles (blimps) to dock there. However, being the first of its kind, this idea came with many obstacles. Before constructing the mast, they had to stabilize the building with steel framework and other modifications, as stated in paragraph nine. Dirigibles are very long, and the previous structure would not be enough to support it, especially considering the high - blowing winds. Safety was also a major issue with adding the mooring mast. Blimps from outside the United States were filled with hydrogen, which is extremely flammable, instead of helium. If something were to happen, and the blimp caught fire, that could seriously threaten the safety of civilians in the area. After the mast was constructed, the high - speed winds were an obstacle yet again, and they wouldn't even allow dirigibles to come close to the building. Despite how unique the idea of letting dirigibles dock on the Empire State Building was, there were so many obstacles getting in the way that it was very difficult to make the idea successful. In the end, these challenges likely contributed to the limited success of the dirigible - docking plan.
741	15574	6	3	"While in the process of building the Empire State Building, the construction team at @ORGANIZATION1 encountered many obstacles. Their first major obstacle was the looming threat of the title for the world's tallest building being snatched away by the Chrysler Building. When the architect added a 185 - foot spiral to the top of the Chrysler Building, Al Smith, involved in the Empire State Building project, had to come up with an innovative way to add height to the building. This is when the idea of adding a mooring mast to the top of the Empire State Building was conceived, and that's when the real problems arose. When building this mooring mast, it was discovered that the docking of dirigibles would add intense stress to the framework of the building. ""The steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. (paragraph @NUM1) ""The architects would spend @NUM2 dollars worth of modifications on the framework to allow it to be stable. After the building was made capable of accommodating dirigibles, safety issues came to the forefront. First off, dirigibles are filled with hydrogen which is extremely flammable. After the well - known disaster in New Jersey, the project team did not want to take a chance. Next, the strong winds above the building created air currents that would cause violent shifts of the dirigibles. The addition of weights, a solution used in other situations, was out of the question because they would be dangling high above pedestrians on busy New York streets. Lastly, there were existing regulations stating that airships cannot fly too low over urban areas, which this docking plan would clearly violate. With all these insurmountable obstacles to overcome, the idea of docking dirigibles on this mast was shortly discarded, leaving the mooring mast with a different fate."
742	15575	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building were faced with a multitude of problems in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First, the building frame had to be strengthened. The weight of the dirigibles' load, including passengers and cargo, and the strong wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation. ""The weight of ""the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" This meant that the building's frame had to be carefully modified, which cost @NUM1 dollars. Next, it proved to be extremely dangerous to dock dirigibles to the sumptuous sky - scraper. After the tragic incident when the Hindenburg caught fire, ""the owners of the @ORGANIZATION2 realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area like downtown New York."" In accordance with this high - risk situation, there were a lot of existing regulations at the time which prohibited dirigibles from flying low over urban areas. Lastly, the largest obstacle engineers tried to overcome was simply nature itself. The powerful winds at the top of the building made dirigibles almost impossible to land. Both the Columbia and the Los Angeles, well - known dirigibles, tried to dock to the mast but could not battle the strong and unpredictable wind. In conclusion, despite their best efforts, the builders of the Empire State Building could not get a dirigible to dock at their tower, and the docking plan had to be abandoned."
743	15576	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first problem they encountered was that when a dirigible was moored at the top of the building, the additional weight and movement of the large airship would add significant stress to the building's frame. The builders would then have to ""modify and strengthen the Empire State Building to adapt to this new situation."" Another obstacle the builders would have to face is that since a dirigible used hydrogen as a lifting gas, it would be highly flammable. The builders didn't want a catastrophic accident to take place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York, where thousands of people go about their daily lives. Lastly, the builders would have to face the obstacle of nature. With the strong winds at the top of the building, the dirigibles would need to be weighted down in the back with lead weights. However, this would be neither safe nor practical as these weights would be dangling high above pedestrians walking on the busy streets of New York City. In conclusion, as described in ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders went through many insurmountable obstacles in their attempt to make the Empire State Building suitable for dirigible docking, and ultimately the plan was not feasible."
744	15577	6	3	"The obstacles the builder of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were extremely difficult. The builder met with a group of well - known experts to better understand the complex way the dirigibles work. He also was informed that architects couldn't simply put a mooring mast on top because of the building's flat roof, which presented a unique challenge. Paragraph nine states that ""a thousand - foot dirigible held by a single cable tether would add stress to the building's frame."" The stress would then be passed all the way down to the building's foundation, nearly eleven hundred feet below, potentially affecting the overall stability of the structure. The builder invested over sixty thousand dollars' worth of changes into the building, including structural reinforcements and modifications. After spending so much time and money, he was finally told that the plan would have to fall through. The dirigibles' greatest obstacle was the wind. If the dirigible moved in the turbulent air, it could cause all sorts of problems, such as collisions or damage to the building. Although this plan didn't work, the Empire State Building still stands at 1,250 ft and is taller than the Chrysler building, remaining an iconic structure in New York City."
745	15578	6	3	"In ""The Mooring Mast,"" a historical article by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, it is made clear that there were at least three significant obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in an attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. These issues were the building's pre - existing frame, fire safety, and nature itself. The original plans for the Empire State Building had not intended a mooring mast to be dropped on the roof of the building. As a result, architects had to completely change their entire plan: ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation,"" (par. @NUM1). This was a very significant difficulty as it required a lot of time, resources, and expertise. Also, a major concern for foreign dirigibles was that the gas they used made fire safety a critical issue: ""... the owners... realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area,"" (par. @NUM2). Getting around the fire hazard would be impossible given the flammable nature of the gas and the high - risk location. Finally, as stated in the article, nature was the mast's greatest obstacle. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast,"" (par. @NUM3). The violent winds kept much from happening with the mast, making docking extremely difficult and dangerous. With the three aforementioned insurmountable obstacles, the fate of the Empire State Building's mooring mast was grim. It would never serve the purpose that Al Smith had intended for it, and the docking plan was eventually shelved."
746	15579	6	3	"The lack of a proper landing area was a significant issue. Moreover, the body of the dirigible could swing, which was another obstacle that the Empire State Building faced. As described, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" These shifting winds made the situation even more challenging. Additionally, the dirigibles were flying too low over the urban areas, and there was a law against airships doing so. The @ORGANIZATION2 from Los Angeles could not get close enough to tie up the dirigible due to the strong wind. With so many problems occurring during the transportation of passengers, they eventually stopped this mode of transportation."
747	15580	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. In paragraph @NUM1, the author states that ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the @ORGANIZATION2 building's flat roof."" This was indeed true because it would ""add stress to the building's frame."" As further explained in paragraph @NUM2, ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" There were violent air currents that made the situation very difficult, and the existing landing techniques weren't promising either. The builders had to exercise much caution because the idea of having a dirigible land at that great height was neither practical nor safe. Due to these insurmountable obstacles, the plan to use the mooring mast for dirigible docking faced significant challenges and was ultimately unfeasible."
748	15581	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast,"" the builders faced many obstacles. The main issue that was not noticed until the end was that it was an enormous safety problem. The builders aimed to make the mooring mast a docking point for dirigibles, blimps, and zeppelins from both within the country and from other countries. However, other countries used hydrogen rather than helium in their airships, and hydrogen is extremely flammable. A fire over a large metropolis such as New York would be catastrophic, endangering countless lives and causing extensive damage. Also, dirigibles used large lead weights to weigh them down. Using these weights in a city, dangling over pedestrians on the busy streets, would be neither practical nor safe. Considering all these safety - related issues, it became clear that the plan to use the mooring mast for airship docking was not a viable option."
749	15582	6	3	"The invention of the mast on top of the Empire State Building was an undeveloped idea that created a new means of transportation but came with numerous flaws. One significant obstacle the engineers faced was resting a one - thousand - foot dirigible over a twelve - hundred - fifty - foot building. With the combined wind pressure, this would put excessive stress on the building's structure and could potentially allow it to collapse. This transportation method was also extremely dangerous to the public. As mentioned in paragraph @NUM1, many foreign dirigibles ""used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" Not only that, if builders ever allowed dirigibles to dock on the building, as stated in paragraph @NUM2, the back of the airship would spin around the mooring mast due to the shifting violent air currents. Additionally, as described in paragraph @NUM3, an existing law would prohibit airships from flying too low over urban areas. This law made docking dirigibles atop of the Empire State Building illegal because the dirigibles would be flying above the people, which was against the laws. All of these obstacles made this form of transportation a failure, and as a result, the use of the mast gradually disappeared."
750	15583	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building went through many difficult obstacles trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the difficult obstacles the builders encountered was that the winds on top of the building were always shifting. As the quote ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" describes, the winds were so bad that they made it extremely difficult for the builders to work. To solve this wind - related problem, the builders considered weighing down the back of the airship with lead. However, as the quote ""But using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was not safe"" explains, using lead weights would not be safe as they would pose a threat to the people below. Another problem is that it is illegal for airships to fly too low over urban areas. The quote ""@CAPS1 an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" clearly explains this law about airships. Clearly, with these multiple difficult obstacles, the plan to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building faced significant challenges and was likely to be unworkable."
751	15584	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in their attempts to allow dirigibles to dock there. One significant obstacle was installing the mooring mast. The architects couldn't simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof because the weight of the blimp moored at the top, held by a single cable tether, would add substantial stress to the frame. The stress from the dirigibles' load and wind pressure would transmit all the way to the building's foundation. As a result, the builders would have to carefully modify and strengthen the building to accommodate this new situation. Another major obstacle they faced was the cost. It would take over sixty thousand dollars to make the proper modifications to the building's framework, which was a significant financial burden. Also, safety was another crucial obstacle. They had to ensure people were going to be safe because most dirigibles from other countries used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. The areas were densely populated, so an accident over the city would be much worse. The greatest obstacle was nature itself. The winds on the building were constantly shifting due to the violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back would swivel around. Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down by weights, but using these would be dangerous dangling that high above pedestrians. These many obstacles were practical reasons why they couldn't moor at the Empire State Building. There was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, which made it illegal for ships to tie up to the building. So long as these obstacles persisted, the attempts to allow docking faced insurmountable challenges.
752	15585	6	3	Based on this excerpt, the builders faced a few notable problems when building the Empire State Building. One prominent problem was actually docking the Zeppelins or dirigibles. The wind was extremely vicious at around 102 stories (approximately 1250 ft) in the air. Such strong winds made it incredibly difficult to safely maneuver and dock the dirigibles. Another problem the builders faced was related to safety. Since most dirigibles from outside the U.S. used hydrogen rather than helium, it was a significant fire safety issue. This concern became even more prominent after the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by a fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937. The tragic incident served as a stark reminder of the potential dangers associated with using hydrogen - filled dirigibles. These problems ultimately had a major impact on the feasibility of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
753	15586	6	3	"In the story ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Firstly, the builders needed more support for the building's framework. A large - scale dirigible, perhaps a thousand - foot one, moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add a great deal of stress to the building's frame. As described, ""A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame"" (@ORGANIZATION2, para @NUM1). To address this issue, they had to use over sixty thousand dollars to buy the correct modifications. They had to purchase materials and hire experts to make the necessary changes to the stressed frame. As stated, ""Over sixty - thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework"" (@ORGANIZATION2, para @NUM1). Another significant obstacle was the lack of a suitable landing area. As mentioned, ""The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area"" (@ORGANIZATION2, para 6). Architects couldn't simply create a proper landing setup on the building's roof easily. In the story ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, these various obstacles made it very challenging for the builders of the Empire State building to allow dirigibles to dock there."
754	15587	6	3	"In the excerpt from @ORGANIZATION2's The Mooring Mast, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many formidable obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there. For example, there was ""the lack of a suitable landing area."" Architects cannot just drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. If they did, the building would have an extreme amount of pressure on it. This pressure would not only come from the weight of the dirigible but also from the forces exerted during docking and undocking. In addition, along with the pressure, the dirigibles would ""add stress to the building's frame."" The builders needed to carefully modify and strengthen the steel frame of the Empire State Building to withstand this additional stress. This process also cost a great deal of money, including the cost of materials and labor. Furthermore, ""the greatest reason was safety."" The slightest mistake in building the mast could have far - reaching consequences, affecting every person in the building. In order to allow dirigibles to dock there, the builders needed to be extremely aware of all the citizens surrounding the building. They had to consider potential hazards such as fire, falling debris, and the impact on the local infrastructure. All in all, these numerous obstacles determined the fate of the mast, making it very difficult to achieve the goal of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building."
755	15588	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First, it was illegal to have an aircraft flying too close to a city. As stated, ""there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This law was in place to protect the safety of the people living in the densely populated city. Another obstacle was the building's structure. If the blimp had docked, there would be a significant amount of stress on the building. As described, ""it would add stress to the building's frame."" The building's design was not initially intended to support the weight and forces associated with docking a large dirigible. The last obstacle was the wind. The wind would push the blimp around every which way when docked on the tower. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" These shifting winds made it almost impossible to keep the dirigible stable during docking. Due to these multiple and significant obstacles, the attempts to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building ultimately faced insurmountable difficulties."
756	15589	6	3	The mooring mast on the Empire State Building was intentionally built for dirigible docking. Although the problem with allowing that to happen was not questioned at the time of the mast's construction, safety issues were a major concern. Most dirigibles from outside the U.S. used hydrogen gas, which is extremely flammable. The news of the German dirigible Hindenburg being destroyed in a massive inferno of flames greatly concerned the owners of the Empire State Building. They vividly imagined how much worse the situation would be if a dirigible combusted right on the building and in the dense population area of Downtown New York. This caused the builders of the Empire State Building to seriously reconsider allowing dirigibles to dock at its mooring mast, ultimately leading to the abandonment of the idea.
757	15590	6	3	Throughout the story, the workers of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle they faced was the challenge of getting a thousand - foot dirigible to moor at the top of the building. This large dirigible was to be held together by a single cable tether, and this would add a significant amount of stress to the building’s frame. All the dirigible's load and the force of the wind pressure had to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was eleven hundred feet below. Another obstacle is that the hydrogen in the dirigible was highly flammable. If a dirigible was ever destroyed, it would not only cause a large - scale explosion but also kill a lot of people because the Empire State Building is located in the bustling downtown New York. The greatest obstacle was that the winds at the top of the building were constantly changing in direction and intensity, so it would be extremely difficult to land a dirigible safely. The last obstacle was that it was against the law for airships to fly too low in urban areas. Due to these insurmountable obstacles, the plan to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was not feasible.
758	15591	6	3	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were multi - faceted. First, the builder realized that he was close to losing the title of the world's tallest building, which added pressure to make the dirigible docking project a success. Also, some of his optimistic opinions were proven wrong because of hard facts. Another obstacle was trying to accomplish everything he said he was going to do on time. He needed to react in a more realistic way than what he was initially thinking of doing. Most obstacles had to do with ""nature itself."" For example, the wind at the top of the building was so strong and unpredictable that it would make the dirigible swivel around wildly. Given these numerous and difficult - to - overcome obstacles, the idea of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building faced a very uncertain future."
759	15592	6	3	"In ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, it explains how the developing idea of landing a dirigible on the Empire State Building was eventually rejected due to many obstacles. The first design flaw that the engineers @CAPS2 noticed was the significant stress the dirigible would add to the building's frame. A mass of that size attached to the building by a single cable tether would result in an enormous amount of force being concentrated in the building's foundation. The greatest obstacle the engineers @CAPS2 encountered in allowing dirigibles to dock was safety. With the use of hydrogen, the dirigibles are highly flammable. This would have created a dangerous situation over a ""densely populated area such as downtown New York"". The final obstacle the builders @CAPS2 faced was the wind. The winds at that height were extremely strong and erratic. Chapter @NUM1 states, ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" This would create a perilous situation for the ship's passengers. In ""The Mooring Mast"", it clearly described how it would be nearly impossible to land dirigibles atop the Empire State Building, and thus the idea was rightfully abandoned."
760	15593	6	3	"The Mooring Mast, authored by @PERSON1, presents two main obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. The first problem was the uncontrollable factor of mother nature. The high - speed air currents at the top of the building would cause ""the back of the ship to swivel around and around the mooring mast."" If the dirigible was unable to dock correctly, the dangers were obvious. It would be ""dangling high above pedestrians on the street, (which) was neither practical nor safe."" This not only put the passengers at risk but also the people on the ground. Another problem the builders encountered was the already existing law that made sure airships don't fly too low over cities. The author notes, ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" Because of mother nature and pre - existing legislature, the builders of the Empire State Building had to overcome these enigmatic problems, and in the end, it became clear that allowing dirigibles to dock was an unworkable plan."
761	15594	6	3	Based on the excerpt, there were a few significant obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced when trying to accommodate dirigibles. One of the prominent obstacles was the lack of a suitable landing area. The existing space was simply not large or well - designed enough to safely land and moor a dirigible. The second obstacle was the high cost. In order to have a thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, they would have to spend a hefty sixty thousand dollars just to accommodate the new station. This was a substantial financial burden. Another major obstacle was the law. Dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building due to the existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. These three obstacles made it extremely difficult for dirigibles to take over the future. That is why, in the end, we now rely on airplanes instead.
762	15595	6	3	"There were many substantial obstacles facing the builders attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the mast of the Empire State Building. One key reason was the structural strain. Attaching a humongous blimp to the peak of the building would add excessive and potentially dangerous strain to it. Lusted explains: ""A thousand - foot dirgible moored at the top of the building... would add stress to the building's frame."" As a result, much extensive revision to the structure's frame was needed, which was both time - consuming and costly. Another significant obstacle was nature. The wind currents on top of the building were a real problem. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast. This would make it highly unsafe for passengers to get on or off the blimp. There was also a law in effect that prevented ""airships flying too low over urban areas."" These various obstacles ultimately prevented the builders from safely devising a way to dock the dirigibles, making the idea unfeasible."
763	15596	6	3	Allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was never a practical possibility because of the numerous obstacles that the architects faced. First, nature presented a major challenge. The strong winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting, creating a hazardous situation for dirigibles. Mooring dirigibles with weights was out of the question because they posed a real danger to pedestrians below. Another significant obstacle was an already existing law. This law prohibited dirigibles from flying low over urban areas, making it illegal for a dirigible to dock at the Empire State Building. The final and perhaps most terrifying obstacle was the risk of fire. A dirigible could be accidentally ignited and fall on New York. The destruction of the Hindenburg was a tragic example that made it abundantly clear that it was not possible to have a dirigible dock at the Empire State Building. Due to these insurmountable obstacles, the plan to use the building for dirigible docking was abandoned.
764	15597	6	3	"Architects for the Empire State Building faced many complex problems when trying to install the landing gear on the mooring mast. There were numerous safety issues to overcome when it came to landing a dirigible or blimp on the building. In a populated area such as New York City, it is not the safest place to land a blimp. As an example, ""when the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" They could not afford to take such a huge risk. So, the competition for landing gear was called off. Another main cause was the wind current on top of the Empire State Building. It proved extremely difficult to keep a blimp level at high altitudes. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" This could potentially result in the blimp detaching and hitting other buildings. Considering all these factors, it is clear that landing blimps on the Empire State building would be both dangerous and extremely difficult, which is why the idea was ultimately discarded."
765	15598	6	3	"In this excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"", by @ORGANIZATION1, workers and builders tried to create a docking area for Dirigibles (blimps). In the process of doing so, they encountered many significant obstacles. First, the lack of a suitable landing area was a major setback. They really should have thought more carefully and designed it to be bigger in the first place. The workers did put in effort, but it was not enough to create an adequate landing space. The greatest obstacle was nature itself. If they were experienced and knowledgeable builders, they would have known that the wind at higher altitudes gets much rougher. Basically, they should have thought things through a little more thoroughly. Lastly, there was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. They should have checked if there were any laws beforehand, and unfortunately, there was such a law. Also, all that work ended up being for nothing. All these obstacles that the workers and builders faced were things that could have been prevented. If they had done proper planning, money and time would not have gone to waste, and the project might have had a better chance of success."
766	15599	6	3	"In the excerpt 'The Mooring Mast' by @ORGANIZATION2, it details the numerous obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building encountered when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One prominent example is ""The Obstacle to their expanded use into New York City was lack of a suitable landing area"". This clearly shows that the mooring mast was going to be a significant problem because of the lack of a proper landing area. With such a deficiency, it was extremely difficult for dirigibles to land, and it was evident that the structure was not meant for docking. Another concerning example is 'A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether would add stress to the building frame.' This indicates that the building was not stable enough to support the landing of dirigibles. As a final illustration, ""The greatest obstacles to the successful use of a mooring mast was nature itself."" This reveals that the ever - changing weather could have a detrimental impact on the landing of dirigibles. These examples comprehensively show how in the excerpt 'The Mooring Mast' by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders faced insurmountable obstacles in their attempt to enable dirigible docking."
767	15600	6	3	"The use of the mast on the Empire State Building for dirigibles faced a multitude of insurmountable obstacles. Violent winds, the insufficient amount of structural support, and anti - low - flying aircraft laws made it utterly impossible to use the mast for its intended purpose. The high winds at the top of the building were so strong that they would spin the back of the aircraft and, consequently, the entire dirigible around the spire. The structural support required for such a large and unwieldy object was extremely risky, as it might not be able to withstand the forces exerted. The main interfering factor, however, was an ""existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"". These various challenges inevitably led to the mast not being put to use, as it was simply not feasible or legal under the given circumstances."
768	15601	6	3	"The obstacle the builders had in attempting to allow dirigibles or ""blimps"" to dock on the Empire State Building was nature itself. The reason nature posed such a significant obstacle for blimps to dock on the building is that the wind currents had a strong impact on moving the end of the blimp. When the blimp is being moved by the wind while passengers are leaving or getting in, it would be very easy for them to lose their balance and fall off. Another obstacle the builders faced with docking the blimps was the lead weights dangling from the end of the blimps. These weights were used to keep the blimp from shifting directions due to the wind currents. However, it was a major concern for the safety of the street pedestrians. On @CAPS1 @NUM1 of ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, it quotes that ""... that using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe"". This quote clearly proves that putting weights on the back of the blimp would be extremely dangerous. If, by some misfortune, they somehow fall off, then someone on the streets could get seriously hurt. In conclusion, these natural and safety - related obstacles made it very difficult for the builders to achieve the goal of blimp docking on the Empire State Building."
769	15602	6	3	Building docks for dirigibles to land on the Empire State Building was a truly arduous challenge for Al Smith. The steel frame of the Empire State Building had to be strengthened because the dirigible's heavy load and the strong wind pressure would put excessive stress on the building's frame. The dirigibles were highly flammable, which posed a huge risk to the safety of the workers in the building and the people on the street. A single spark could potentially lead to a catastrophic fire. Moreover, the dirigible's movements could not be accurately monitored due to the violent air currents at the top of the building. This made it difficult to ensure a safe landing. The main reason why the docks for dirigibles did not work was because of the law against airships. The law strictly did not allow airships to fly low over urban areas. Considering all these factors, the invention of docks for dirigibles on the Empire State Building was clearly unrealistic and unsafe, and thus could not be implemented.
770	15603	6	3	"In ""The @CAPS1 Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, which made it very difficult to make this project workable. The workers faced serious safety problems due to chemicals and certain gasses. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" (Amidon L¸sted ∂ @NUM1 lines @NUM2 + @NUM3) This meant that any small spark could lead to a massive explosion. ""The owners of the Empire State Building realised how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" (Amidon L¸sted ∂ @NUM1 lines @NUM5). The greatest obstacle to their successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to the violent air currents. These unpredictable winds made it almost impossible to safely dock dirigibles. In the excerpt ""The @CAPS1 Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles that were beyond their control, ultimately preventing the successful implementation of the dirigible - docking project."
771	15604	6	3	Some obstacles that the Empire State builders had while creating the Empire State Building is having to deal with all the fast - blowing winds. This is because the giant needle that was built on top of the building was waving back and forth vigorously. This constant movement made it extremely hard to keep the needle in place. Another obstacle would be bringing the dirigible or blimps towards the giant needle. The sharpness of the needle would puncture the blimp, which was only made of cotton fabric. These challenges significantly complicated the construction process of the Empire State Building.
772	15605	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, there were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle the builders faced was that the dirigibles were too big and could pose a real danger. As stated, ""A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add excessive stress to the building's frame."" This clearly shows that it would be much harder to build the mast than initially expected. Another obstacle the builders ran into was that the building would have to undergo significant modifications. ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" The biggest obstacle the builders faced is that it wasn't safe. ""Most dirigibles from outside the @LOCATION1 used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" These are some of the major obstacles the builders ran into, which ultimately made the idea of dirigible docking at the Empire State Building a challenging one."
773	15606	6	3	"In the short story ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. For example, they needed a suitable landing area, which they could not create very easily. They needed to put a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building, but the architects could not do that without encountering problems. It took a great deal of hard work. The @CAPS1 says ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" Even if they had an idea to add something to make it work, it would add stress to the building and potentially cause it to collapse. The wind pressure also had a great impact. The strong winds were making it extremely hard to keep the dirigibles stable. They thought about adding weights to hold it down, but that wouldn't be good for the people below. The @CAPS1 says ""Could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe."" They faced far too many problems, which made the dirigible docking plan very difficult to execute."
774	15607	6	3	"This dream of the aviation pioneers, travel by dirigible, was a dream that would be hard - to - reach. The architects and engineers that attempted to establish a mooring mast had high hopes, including meeting with the president. However, the idea of a dirigible ""held by a single cable tether"" would not be stable enough to mount the dirigible because the building frame would be stressed too much. If they were to proceed with this, the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to adapt to the new placement of the dirigible. Instead, the architects first assigned a ""shiny glass and chrome - nickel stainless steel tower"" and then designed the mooring mast. However, before the mooring mast could be completed, the roof had to be finished so that the mooring mast could fit properly in its position. Most probably, the main problem with the mooring mast was nature. Nature could easily disrupt the mooring mast, due to strong winds, which would cause the shifting of the dirigible. Also, due to a ""law against airships flying too low,"" the dirigible would break that law as well. The whole attempt to make a mooring mast slowly deteriorated because of all these insurmountable obstacles."
775	15608	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building had a lot of struggles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First, they had to consult with experienced experts to see if the equipment was safe enough. They took detailed tours of the equipment and mooring operations at the @ORGANIZATION2 at Lakehurst, New Jersey. Next, they had a tough time dropping the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. They would have to spend @MONEY1 worth of modifications to strengthen the building's framework. They were never going to have this happen in the first place because of the safety issue; the hydrogen gas in the dirigible is highly flammable. The biggest issue, though, was nature. The strong winds on top of the building made it very difficult to work, and these winds could get extremely violent, making the task of allowing dirigibles to dock an almost impossible one.
776	15609	6	3	The builders had numerous obstacles in their path to achieve their idea of docking dirigibles. One significant problem was that the majority of dirigibles around the globe utilized hydrogen gas. Hydrogen is extremely flammable, and at such high altitudes, this flammability could lead to extremely dangerous situations. The greatest hurdle to its success was nature itself. The winds at the location where the docking was to take place were constantly changing direction. This made it very difficult to maintain the stability of the dirigible, especially since the back end of the dirigible stretched so far away from the tower. Another reason this concept wouldn't work was due to an existing law that prohibited airships from flying at low altitudes over urban areas. In the end, these combined factors made the idea of docking dirigibles unfeasible.
777	15610	6	3	"The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building encountered were all a result of the addition of the mooring mast. First, the architects had to make modifications to the steel frame of the Empire State Building. They were well - aware that the large mooring mast couldn't simply be placed on the building's flat roof. Marcia Amidon Lusted explains that ""A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add significant stress to the building frame"" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). Since the building needed to adapt to this new situation, they spent over @MONEY1 to strengthen and modify the framework. Another obstacle that the builders had to face were the safety issues associated with the new mooring mast. These safety concerns stemmed from an incident when the Hindenburg, a German dirigible, was destroyed by fire at Lakehurst, New Jersey. In the U.S., hydrogen was used instead of helium, which increased the risks as helium is less flammable. Lusted writes ""the owners of the Empire State realized how much worse the accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York"" (Lusted @NUM2). The Empire State Building was simply an impractical location for an airship dock. Finally, by the late 1930s, it became clear that the mooring mast would not serve its intended purpose because dirigibles had been replaced by airplanes, marking the end of this ambitious but ultimately unworkable plan."
778	15611	6	3	The builders who constructed The Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles when they attempted to enable dirigibles to dock there. Most importantly, they couldn't just casually place a mooring mast on top of the building and expect positive results. The mast would impose a large amount of stress on the framework. When you also consider the stress from the dirigibles' load and wind pressure, the framework would need to be thoroughly modified and strengthened. Safety was also a major problem that the builders encountered. Most dirigibles were highly flammable, and having them fly over a densely populated city like New York was extremely impractical. In addition to their flammable nature, there was also a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. So, it was not only dangerous but also illegal to tie up or even approach the building. The last obstacle the builders faced was the wind. The winds at that high altitude were constantly shifting because of the violent air currents. There was also a real fear that the wind could blow the ships into the sharp spires of other nearby buildings. Considering all these obstacles and the decreasing interest in dirigibles, the project was ultimately discontinued, as it was no longer a viable option.
779	15612	6	3	"New technology, particularly in aviation, demands a great deal of work and presents many obstacles to overcome. In order to make the mooring mast on the Empire State Building a success, the builders needed to figure out how to keep the dirigible securely hooked to the building and enable passengers to board and disembark safely. A quote from the text supporting this is ""A mooring mast added to the top of the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers off and on"" (6). However, passengers were not the only challenge the builders had to deal with. The stress that a dirigible would exert on the building was too great. This meant that they also had to remodel the actual building. The text supports this with, ""the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation"" (@NUM1). Even after making all these modifications, the mooring mast was bound to fail due to reasons beyond the builders' control, such as natural elements and changing aviation trends."
780	15613	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, The Mooring Mast, the builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles because dirigibles were planned to dock there. The first obstacle was safety. Most dirigibles from outside of the @LOCATION3 were filled with hydrogen, which is highly flammable compared to helium. The builders were understandably concerned after the incident on May 6, 1937, when the German dirigible Hindenburg, filled with hydrogen, was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey. The second obstacle was nature. ""The winds... were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast"" (paragraph @NUM1). This meant that passengers couldn't disembark safely, and the dirigible could hit anything in the vicinity if it swung in the wrong direction. The last obstacle was an existing law that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas. This made it illegal for a ship to tie up to a building or approach the area. Therefore, the builders of the Empire State Building who tried to allow dirigibles to dock there faced many challenges, as clearly shown by the excerpt, The Mooring Mast, and these challenges ultimately made the project unworkable."
781	15614	6	3	Some obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced to allow dirigibles to moor there were the framing of the building, the height of the building, and where passengers would land and dock. The frame of the building was crucial because if a thousand - foot dirigible were to moor at the top of the building, it could add a significant amount of stress to the building's structure and frame, which would then transfer all the force down to the building's foundation. Wind pressure and sudden directional changes would also push the dirigible, thereby adding more stress to the building. The building was initially designed to be @NUM1 floors. However, to allow a dirigible to dock there and load and unload passengers, it needed more room and greater height. The building required an observation room and a boarding area. When the building was redesigned, it reached 102 floors, and on the 101st floor, there was an observation room that also doubled as a boarding area. The builders of the Empire State Building had many obstacles in the design attempt to allow dirigibles to moor on the roof, including adding height to the building. The most prominent problem, though, was the framing of the building. It needed to be strengthened, and by doing so, it would enable a dirigible to moor on the top without causing any issues to the structure of the building. Overall, these challenges made the goal of using the building for dirigible docking a complex and difficult one.
782	15615	6	3	"Competitive architect Al Smith had a strong desire for the Empire State Building to be the tallest and most unique building. ""Their top, they said, would serve a higher calling"" (@NUM1). The building was intended to support the age of transportation by dirigible. Al Smith commented with enthusiasm, ""It's on the level, all right. No kidding. We're working on the thing now"" (@NUM2). In reality, the architects seemed to be unaware of the potential problems of the mast. There were numerous obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. One major reason was safety. If any dirigibles from outside the United States, which were often filled with hydrogen instead of helium, used the mast, it could pose a highly flammable risk. Another factor was nature itself. Shifting winds caused by violent air currents made it extremely dangerous as the back of the ship would twist around the mooring mast. Most importantly, there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie to a building. By the late 1930s, dirigibles, instead of becoming the transportation of the future, had been replaced by airplanes, showing that these obstacles were insurmountable."
783	15616	6	3	Based on the excerpt, the builders faced many difficult tasks. The builders had to ensure that the mooring mast was stable enough to support the docking of dirigibles. They also had to add more floors to the Empire State Building because the original Chrysler building added another 46 feet to remain the tallest building. The architects then had to incorporate the 85th floor along with the mooring mast, which brought the Empire State Building to a total height of 1,250 feet. The reason the mooring mast was a failure was mainly due to safety. The dirigible was highly flammable, and in a highly populated area like New York, a fire would be a disaster. Additionally, nature played a role as shifting winds due to violent air currents made it dangerous as the back of the dirigible would twist around the mooring mast. In the end, these challenges made it nearly impossible to use the building for dirigible docking.
784	15617	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One significant obstacle was the safety of the people below on the streets. In the excerpt in paragraph @NUM1, it clearly states that it was dangerous because if the dirigible caught fire, it would be ""Much worse if it had taken place above a densely populated area."" Another obstacle was a law. As stated in paragraph @NUM2, there is ""An existing law against air ships flying too low over urban areas."" This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. The greatest obstacle, though, was nature itself, as mentioned in paragraph @NUM3. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Consequently, the wind would make the dirigible swivel around and around the mooring mast. An idea emerged that said ""Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights."" However, safety was the reason this couldn't be applied at the Empire State Building. The weight on the building would be dangling above people on the street, which would be unsafe. Then, flyers who approached the building would fear that the wind would blow the dirigible onto the sharp spires of other buildings in the area, which would also be unsafe. In conclusion, these multiple obstacles made it unfeasible for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building."
785	15618	6	3	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there are related to the gases dirigibles use to stay aloft. As stated in paragraph 6, the first obstacle the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was ""To their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area."" From paragraph @NUM1, it states that if a mooring mast was dropped to the roof of the building and a single cable tether was used, it would add stress to the building, and the pressure would require them to modify the building and its framework, which cost over sixty thousand dollars. In other words, most dirigibles outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. Also, from paragraph @NUM2, the mooring mast was affected by nature itself. The winds would constantly shift due to air currents. ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed."" These factors, including the gas issue, structural stress, and natural wind conditions, combined to make it impossible for the mooring mast to serve its intended function."
786	15619	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced significant obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the building. The architects couldn't simply place the mooring mast on top of the building's flat roof. As explained, ""A dirigible would be held to the building by a single cable tether, which would add stress to the building's frame."" (L¸sted @NUM1) The stress from the dirigible's load and the powerful wind pressure would have to be transmitted down to the foundation. As noted, ""The building's steel frame would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" (L¸sted @NUM1) Specifically, ""Over sixty thousand dollars of modifications would have to be made."" (L¸sted @NUM1) The building's design was initially centered entirely around the mooring mast. However, these new modifications were only intended to support the blimp itself and did not account for other factors such as natural winds. Given these challenges, it became clear that the plan to allow dirigibles to dock faced insurmountable hurdles."
787	15620	6	3	"Based on the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the constructors of the Empire State Building encountered numerous difficulties while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. In every building project, there must be the certainty that it is safe for everyone and that there is no risk of harm. As stated, ""The greatest reason was one of safety. Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" Dirigibles, or blimps, were not safe in general at the time. If one burned down in a less - populated area of the country, the death toll and the cost to repair the damage wouldn't be as high as if it burned down in downtown New York City. One, if not the greatest, challenge the constructors of the Empire State Building faced was that landing flammable blimps over the middle of a bustling city was a significant safety hazard which could potentially kill many people as well as destroy parts of the city. Considering these risks, it was evident that allowing dirigibles to dock was not a feasible option."
788	15621	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" written by @ORGANIZATION2, the Empire State Building faced multiple obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. In paragraph @NUM1 under ""The Fate of the Mast"", the first line clearly states ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. Strong winds due to violent air currents would make it extremely difficult, if not impossible, to dock a dirigible on the Empire State Building. The powerful wind would blow the dirigible off the mast and into the busy streets of New York City. In paragraph @NUM2 under ""The Fate of the Mast"", a line mentions ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This law made it illegal for dirigibles and other aircraft to even fly in an urban area like New York. One final major obstacle is safety precautions. In paragraph @NUM3 a line states, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium."" If a dirigible were to crash and it had this highly flammable gas, it would create a massive and catastrophic disaster. With violent winds, strict laws, and significant safety precautions all against the docking of dirigibles at the mooring mast, it was clear that this plan was unworkable."
789	15622	6	3	When designing the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building to dock dirigibles, the builders encountered several obstacles. A dirigible is a blimp filled with hydrogen and/or helium to keep it floating lightly in the air. What the builders did not anticipate ahead of time was that hydrogen is a highly flammable gas. If it were docked on top of a building where there is constant movement, it could easily catch on fire, potentially causing the whole building itself to blow up. Another obstacle that the builders noticed would occur was the forceful winds. With a dirigible docked so high up in the air, it creates an unstable situation for people to get off of it. The strong and vicious winds would make the back of the dirigible swivel around the mooring mast because only the front would be weighed down. The last obstacle that was discovered with docking a dirigible was that it would be too low to an urban area. The dirigible would be in close proximity to walking pedestrians, creating an unsafe environment if something were to go wrong. Without taking that high - risk chance, it was agreed that there were too many obstacles; therefore, the idea of docking a dirigible on top of the Empire State Building was ultimately cancelled.
790	15623	6	3	"In the construction of the Empire State Building, the builders faced many challenges in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the obstacles they faced was having to make substantial changes to the steel frame of the building in order to have the strength to ""accommodate the new situation"". In paragraph @NUM1 it @CAPS2 that ""Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework"", clearly indicating that this was a costly project as well. The excerpt also @CAPS2 that there were significant problems with getting the dirigible to stay in place without moving. The dirigible would be located in a very windy area, and there was only one chord attached to the building. This single attachment would leave the back of the dirigible moving around all over the place, making it extremely difficult to keep the dirigible stable. Given these costly and technical challenges, it became apparent that allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was not a practical solution."
791	15624	6	3	"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"", the builders faced the formidable obstacles of safety, nature, and law when attempting to dock dirigibles atop the Empire State Building. First and foremost, safety was a major concern. In the excerpt, it clearly stated that ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen, rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" In a densely - populated area such as New York, the risk of a dirigible bursting into flames was simply too great. A single fire could cause massive chaos, endangering countless lives and property. Second, nature posed an insurmountable challenge. The excerpt noted that ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" Because of the erratic winds in New York, the dirigible would not be secured well. Instead of being held in place, many dirigibles would likely be destroyed. Lastly, there was the issue of the law. The excerpt explained that ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This was the most important reason of all. While they might have considered taking risks on the other factors, they had no choice when it came to the law. They couldn't fight the law to allow dirigibles to fly that low. To conclude, the obstacles of safety, nature, and law faced by the builders could not be overcome to get the mast up and working, ultimately preventing successful dirigible docking at the Empire State Building."
792	15625	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous challenges when it came to docking airships. One of the most obvious reasons was the significant danger of docking at such high altitudes. If an accident, like a fire, were to occur, the entire surrounding area would be in immediate danger. The modifications made to the building itself were already substantial. Adding more additional work would not only be time - consuming but also costly. The most important reason, however, was the issue of maneuverability. The strong winds in the area made it extremely difficult, and almost impossible, to control the blimp, let alone dock it safely. Even if the pilots managed to get close, the gusts could easily push the blimp off - course. Moreover, the @ORGANIZATION2 law even banned aircraft of any type from flying so low. This legal restriction further complicated the situation. In conclusion, due to the high - altitude danger, maneuverability problems, and the legal ban, the builders were unable to make airship docking at the Empire State Building a feasible option.
793	15626	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building were faced with several significant obstacles in order to allow dirigibles to dock there. Safety was the main focus, as New York is a densely populated area, and many dirigibles were filled with highly flammable hydrogen. A single spark could lead to a catastrophic explosion. One problem was that the builders realized the dirigible would be hanging by a single cable tether. This would add a great deal of stress to the frame of the building. To address this, they would need to adjust the building and strengthen the frame. The cost of these adjustments was over sixty thousand dollars, which was a significant financial burden. After that was taken care of, the builders still had other problems. Another problem the builders faced was that since the building was in a highly populated area, many pedestrians walked below where the dirigibles would be docked. The winds at the top would cause the dirigible to blow around wildly. Lead weights could not be used because of the extreme dangers of them falling and injuring people on the ground. In conclusion, the safety concerns, high - cost adjustments, and the risk to pedestrians made it extremely difficult, if not impossible, for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
794	15627	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"", by @ORGANIZATION1, the builders of the Empire State Building faced significant obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One key obstacle arose when Al Smith realized that he was close to not winning the race for the world's tallest building. As described in paragraph @NUM1, this realization put pressure on him. Then he announced that the building would reach 1,250 feet. This was an obstacle because without a tall enough building, he couldn't make the dirigible docking a reality. Al Smith always thrived on competition, and he was determined that his building had to be the winning one. Building the dirigible docking facility was part of his vision to outshine others. However, the struggle to achieve the desired height added complexity to the overall project. In conclusion, the challenge of reaching the necessary height for the building was a major obstacle that hindered the builders' efforts to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building."
795	15628	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple problems in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. Some problems were related to the nature of the dirigibles themselves. Most dirigibles from other countries were filled with hydrogen, which is highly flammable. A small ignition could lead to a large - scale disaster. Also, the winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. These shifting winds could cause the dirigible to wrap around the building, damaging both the dirigible and the structure. Another issue the builders faced was an existing law against airships flying too low in urban areas. This law would make it completely illegal for the dirigible to even come near the building. Additionally, they had to spend @MONEY1 to upgrade the framework of the building. This was necessary so that the docking process would not put too much strain on the top of the building. In conclusion, due to the flammable nature of dirigibles, the unpredictable winds, the legal restrictions, and the costly framework upgrades, the builders found it extremely difficult to make dirigible docking at the Empire State Building a practical possibility.
796	15629	6	3	"In The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the architect and builders had to surmount extremely large obstacles while attempting to make the plan of docking dirigibles work. ""The architects could not simply place a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of this building, held by a single cable tether, would impose significant stress on the building's frame."" With this enormous dirigible in the air and the wind blowing around, it would severely impact the building's structure. The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transferred all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. With all the wind, the dirigible would be tugging back and forth on the building. ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to adapt to this new situation. Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" In order to build a docking station, the architects would have to transform the whole construction of the building. In conclusion, these challenges made the plan of docking dirigibles at the Empire State Building a very difficult endeavor."
797	15630	6	3	Allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State building came with a multitude of obstacles to make it work. One significant obstacle for their expanded use in New York City was the scarcity of a suitable landing area. Some dirigibles were as long as one thousand feet, which is equivalent to four blocks in New York City. Another major obstacle was that they could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building's flat roof. This action would add substantial stress to the building's frame and also affect the dirigibles moored there. In conclusion, these obstacles severely limited the feasibility of dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building.
798	15631	6	3	"The workers on the Empire State Building ran into numerous obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there. The workers encountered large - scale problems regarding the safety of docking over a large city. Also, the reality of the construction and location was a future - facing problem for the workers. The process was an extremely troubling challenge overall. It was not very safe to have a large aircraft with passengers hanging over a large city. One precaution that was of great concern was that other dirigibles used hydrogen, ""and hydrogen is highly flammable."" The potential of having a fire over a city was a risk that they could not afford to take. The dirigibles were not even allowed by law to get close enough to the Empire State Building to dock. The workers had to face reality when it came to the construction and location. The mast was so high up that dirigibles would not be able to dock because of ""violent air currents."" Some blimps did not even have the proper ""mooring equipment installed."" The project altogether was unrealistic, so therefore it was a great challenge for workers to dock dirigibles. In conclusion, these various obstacles made the goal of dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building nearly unachievable."
799	15632	6	3	The builders had a tough obstacle because they were trying to construct an overall building. And they were trying to compete. The dirigibles were an important part in building the Empire State Building because they were faced with obstacles that were difficult, like safety concerns, structural issues, height, and so on. These were the main challenges. On dirigibles, for docking, there were problems. The dirigibles were not heavy enough. They could not dock as well, and it was made with light materials. These are the reasons why this situation occurred. In conclusion, these difficulties made the process of incorporating dirigibles into the Empire State Building project a real struggle.
800	15633	6	3	"The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced were nature and safety. Safety played a crucial role in the building of the Empire State Building. Two main safety concerns were safely getting passengers on and off dirigibles and the substances they were filled with. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable,"" (paragraph @NUM1). The next obstacle the builders faced was nature. The wind speeds would change rapidly due to violent air currents, causing the dirigibles to swivel around erratically. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast,"" (paragraph @NUM2). Due to nature and safety issues, the builders of the Empire State Building faced significant obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there. In conclusion, these combined challenges made it very hard to realize the goal of dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building."
801	15634	6	3	"When attempting to allow dirigibles to dock atop the Empire State Building, the builders were faced with numerous obstacles. One significant obstacle they faced was the strong and constantly - shifting wind current. As said in paragraph @NUM1, ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" These unpredictable winds would cause the back of the ship to swivel around the mast, making the docking process extremely difficult and dangerous. Another major obstacle was the added stress that would be put on the foundation of the building. ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate..."" as stated in paragraph @NUM2. This required significant engineering work and resources. A third obstacle the builders faced in this matter was the dangers of fire, as well as the chances of endangering those down below, which is discussed in paragraph @NUM3. The flammable materials on the dirigibles and the potential for accidents posed a serious threat. One last obstacle faced by the builders was ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (paragraph @NUM4). All these obstacles combined made it an arduous task for the builders to achieve the goal of docking dirigibles on the top of the then tallest building in the world."
802	15635	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building were attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. However, this task was far from easy. The builders could not simply drop a mooring mast on its flat roof because they had to consider how the size of the dirigibles was affected. ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add significant stress to the building's frame"" (paragraph @NUM1). Also, it would be extremely difficult to transmit the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure. The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be carefully modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation"" (paragraph @NUM1). Moreover, the cost to improve the building's framework was also a major obstacle. ""Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework"" (paragraph @NUM1). These challenges made the plan of allowing dirigibles to dock a complex and costly endeavor."
803	15636	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there is that they had to make the Empire State Building taller. The builders added a mooring mast to the top of the building with the intention of allowing dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and to enable the passengers on or off the dirigible. When the dirigibles were docked, it meant that the electric winch, which hauled in a line from the front of the ship and then tied it to the mast. The architects designed a shiny glass and chrome - nickel stainless tower that would be illuminated from the inside, adding an aesthetic touch. The roof had to be completed before the framing for the mooring mast could take place. Everything went as planned as the builders wanted to, but they still had to overcome various technical and engineering challenges to make the docking possible.
804	15637	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. For instance, there was a strict law preventing airships from flying too low over urban areas. This law restricted the dirigibles' approach to the building. Also, they could not anchor down the back of the blimp properly. Due to the shifting winds at such a high altitude, it would not be safe for passengers to get on and off the dirigible. The building also had to be extensively rebuilt to be able to come close to staying stable with the dirigible attached. This involved structural modifications and reinforcements. And last was the differences in gases used to keep the blimps afloat. Most dirigibles from outside of the @LOCATION1 used hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable, making it very unsafe for docking operations near a large building. These are some of the significant obstacles builders of the Empire State Building faced to allow dirigibles to dock there, which ultimately made the task very challenging.
805	15638	6	3	They faced challenges such as how to get the dirigibles to anchor on the building. There was really no safe way to do it. The high - altitude location and the size of the dirigibles made the docking process fraught with difficulties. They also stated that the gas that keeps the dirigibles floating is highly flammable. So it was like one big safety concern. The risk of fire and explosion was ever - present. In reality, they ended up realizing it was too dangerous for them to proceed. If they took the chance and something went wrong, innocent people on the building and on the ground could die. Considering these risks, it was clear that the plan to allow dirigibles to dock was not a viable option.
806	15639	6	3	The dirigibles had numerous obstacles to face. They had possibilities of fire, popping, and legal trouble. They feared the dirigible would catch on fire as it contained hydrogen, which is extremely highly flammable. They did not want to be associated with the accident that occurred in Lakehurst, New Jersey on May 6, 1937. Also, the fear of the dirigibles popping raised more concerns. The wind might blow it off course into another building with a sharp top that could potentially puncture the balloon. They feared this happening in downtown New York, which is highly populated. Another reason, probably the biggest one, was that the Empire State Building wanted a law for aircrafts flying low over urban areas. So, that meant there was no chance they could do what they were planning on doing. In conclusion, these multiple obstacles made the operation of dirigibles in such areas extremely challenging and unfeasible.
807	15640	6	3	"The biggest obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock was that ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Due to these wind currents, dirigibles would not be able to stay still to allow the passengers to get off the dirigible. They once tried this. ""In December 1930, the USS Los Angeles dirigible approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds."" If the winds blew strong enough, it could slam the dirigible into a sharp object. After this attempt, there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. ""It would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building."" As a result, any dirigibles could never tie up to the building because of this new law. The biggest obstacle was the winds, as they put tremendous stress on the building. In conclusion, these insurmountable obstacles ultimately prevented dirigibles from docking at the Empire State Building."
808	15641	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced more problems than expected. One of the first problems they faced was that the building's frame could not support an enormous dirigible. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation... over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework"" (@NUM1). The builders were forced to modify the framework, which cost a large amount of money and proved to be a primary obstacle. Another obstacle the builders faced was the wind caused by nature. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" (@NUM1). These winds could potentially make the back of the blimps swivel around the mooring mast, making it incredibly difficult or dangerous to get on or off the dirigibles. Finally, the builders faced the problem of laws against airships flying too low over urban areas. ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"" (@NUM3). If ships could not even legally approach the building, the builders realized that the obstacles were too great for the mooring mast to work. After realizing all the problems and dangers associated with this idea, they decided the mooring mast would never be successful. In conclusion, the combination of structural, natural, and legal obstacles made the use of the mooring mast for dirigibles unworkable."
809	15642	6	3	Dirigibles were being hailed as the transportation of the future. They were much better than the balloons. In New York City, there was a lack of suitable landing areas for the dirigibles. Now, this would be a good idea for the Empire State Building. Landing on the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or other services. The architects could not just drop a mooring mast on top of the building. The dirigible is a thousand - foot long. It would add significant stress to the building's frame. Engineers soon designed a shiny glass and chrome - nickel stainless steel tower. The mast had four wings at its corners. The building is now 102 floors. Floors @NUM1 and 102 were for the observation area to double as the boarding area for the dirigible passengers. Workers celebrated framing the entire building after two months. Now people lost their hope. It's because the mooring mast of the Empire State Building was never to fulfill its purpose. It was never safe nor practical. The builders faced so many obstacles, such as wind issues and legal restrictions. In conclusion, despite the initial promise, the mooring mast on the Empire State Building was ultimately an unviable solution for dirigible docking.
810	15643	6	3	Turning the mast on the Empire State Building into a dock for dirigibles had many obstacles. There were obstacles like flammable gas in the dirigibles, the danger of being near a densely populated area, the winds were constantly shifting due to air currents, and it would be dangling high above pedestrians. These obstacles were very difficult to solve. In the dirigibles, they are filled with hydrogen, and hydrogen is highly flammable. If the dirigibles caught on fire, it would be a disaster. It is also dangerous to be above a very densely populated area because if the dirigible ever failed, it would fall on innocent bystanders. It also is dangerous because the winds shift a lot, and it can get popped by other objects or buildings around the dirigible. Thus, why it is difficult to turn the mast into a loading dock for dirigibles. In conclusion, these multiple and severe obstacles made it clear that turning the mast into a loading dock for dirigibles was an impractical and unsafe idea.
811	15644	6	3	In attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, the builders faced numerous daunting obstacles. Safety was a paramount concern. Many foreign dirigibles relied on hydrogen gas to stay airborne, and hydrogen is extremely flammable. In a densely - populated area like New York City, a fire on a dirigible would pose a catastrophic threat to the surrounding population. Another major hurdle was the highly turbulent wind at the elevation of the mooring mast. The strong and erratic winds would prevent the dirigible from remaining stationary. This made it extremely difficult for passengers to safely board or exit the zeppelin. One proposed solution was to weigh down the blimp with lead weights. However, this was also a dangerous practice as the weights could potentially fall to the ground and cause serious harm to pedestrians below. Despite the mooring mast being a useful concept in theory, it was ultimately neither safe nor practical for the intended purpose.
812	15645	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many challenges while trying to enable dirigibles to dock there. The architects couldn't just place a mooring mast on the building's flat roof. A thousand - foot dirigible, moored at the top of the building by a single cable tether, would impose significant stress on the building's frame. As such, modifications were required to strengthen and adapt the building's framework to handle this new load. Another major obstacle was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. These shifting winds would cause the dirigibles to swivel in the air above pedestrians, which was neither practical nor safe. The builders faced these numerous obstacles during the project, and unfortunately, it became clear that the Empire State Building would never fulfill its intended purpose of serving as a dirigible docking station.
813	15646	6	3	Some of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were significant. Architects couldn't simply install a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building. They would also have to modify and strengthen the steel frame of the building, and all these modifications were estimated to cost sixty thousand dollars. The engineers had to devise a practical and workable arrangement, and the government officials in Washington were also trying to figure out a safe way to moor airships to the mast. However, this idea was neither practical nor safe as all these structures would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street. Moreover, there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. These were some of the insurmountable obstacles that prevented the successful implementation of allowing dirigibles to dock over the Empire State Building.
814	15647	6	3	"The builders and architects of the Empire State Building faced several different obstacles and dilemmas that hindered the construction process. One of the major issues was the substantial funds required to build such a large - scale structure. They found themselves repeatedly constructing and reconstructing the frame of the building in a feeble attempt to achieve the desired level of perfection. Another significant obstacle arose when their entire concept of a dirigible docking mast was shattered. Not every dirigible intended to land on the mast was fueled by helium. As the text states, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). This highlighted the extreme risks associated with the idea. Given the high - risk nature, such risks could not be taken, and they ultimately abandoned the idea of the mooring mast."
815	15648	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"", it is evident that creating a safe docking station for dirigibles was no easy feat. A significant struggle was that dirigibles from other countries were often filled with hydrogen, which is highly flammable. In the world's most populated city, if this hydrogen - filled dirigible were exposed to fire, it would instantly catch ablaze, endangering countless lives. Another problem was the strong wind at the top of the Empire State Building. The excessive wind made it extremely difficult for dirigible pilots to steer. The wind would toss the dirigibles around, and pilots couldn't even take their hands off the controls. These were just two of the many challenges that pilots and architects had to confront when attempting to dock dirigibles at the mast."
816	15649	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous challenges as they attempted to make the building suitable for dirigibles to dock. They encountered a multitude of obstacles. They consulted with experts, taking detailed tours of the equipment and observing mooring operations at the U.S. Naval Air Station to gain insights. The builders also had to meet with the president of a formed airship transport company to discuss the feasibility and requirements. Despite these efforts, the path to making the building a viable docking spot for dirigibles remained fraught with difficulties.
817	15650	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced a few significant obstacles when having dirigibles to dock there. One prominent obstacle, for example, was the complex issue of landing. New York, with its dense urban landscape, lacked a suitable and properly designated landing area for a dirigible. Architects couldn't simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof as it required careful engineering and structural considerations. Also, safety was a major problem. A German dirigible was destroyed by a catastrophic fire. The owners of the Empire State Building realized how the accident could've been far worse, especially in a bustling and densely populated area like New York. Even nature posed a persistent obstacle. The winds were constantly shifting on top of the building, making docking extremely challenging. So lead weights were considered for the dirigible, but this wasn't safe as they were dangling over pedestrians below on the busy streets. There was a strict law that airships couldn't fly too low over urban areas, further complicating the situation. In the end, these combined obstacles made it very difficult to use the building for dirigible docking.
818	15651	6	3	"Based on the article ""The Mooring Mast"" written by @ORGANIZATION2, the Empire State Building faced many formidable obstacles. There are three main reasons why the Empire State Building was not used for the purpose it was originally constructed for. The point of the Empire State Building's mooring mast was so that dirigibles, which is an old word for Blimps, can stop and refuel. The obstacles the Empire State Building had to overcome were modifications, nature, and the law. They had to pay a substantial amount of @MONEY1 in modifications on the Empire State Building for the framework to make it suitable for dirigible docking. The second was nature; the winds on top of the building would make the back of the Dirigibles move erratically. They considered putting weights on the back of them, but that was not a safe solution. Last but not least, the law presented a major hurdle. The dirigibles can't be as low as the Empire State Building because it's too low and they are prohibited from flying low over urban areas. In conclusion, these obstacles collectively prevented the building from fulfilling its intended purpose for dirigible use."
819	15652	6	3	"Based on the article, ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many significant obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, including the overall structure of the building being affected by stress from the dirigible, safety issues, and the impact of nature. To start off, the dirigible's considerable weight plus the strong wind pressure around the building, caused excessive stress to the building's frame. The steel frame of the building would have to be thoroughly strengthened and carefully modified in order for the dirigible to be safely docked onto it. This modification and strengthening of the building process would call for a substantial investment of over sixty thousand dollars. Next, the safety issue arose after being somewhat neglected before the building process began. Most dirigibles that were used outside of the United States contained hydrogen, which is a highly flammable gas, as opposed to using the safer helium. This was a serious problem for a German dirigible named Hindenburg, when it was destroyed by a tragic fire in New Jersey in 1937. @ORGANIZATION2 writes ""the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse the accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York"" (@ORGANIZATION2 @NUM1). This was a major obstacle along with the wind factor. The winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting in unpredictable patterns and no lead weights could be placed on the dirigible to stop it from shifting because it was a serious threat to pedestrians below on the busy sidewalks. In conclusion, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many insurmountable obstacles that ultimately prevented them from becoming a major landing spot for dirigibles."
820	15653	6	3	"While designing a dirigible docked at the top of the Empire State building, the architects and engineers encountered many complex obstacles. Being such an immense and ambitious project, these obstacles came naturally. The first obstacle was purely architectural. ""A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building... would add a significant amount of stress to the building's frame."" The architects would have to painstakingly redesign the building frame in order for the building to withstand the forces and last over time. The two other obstacles should have been clear from the start; the first, being nature. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Now, the dock not only would be extremely hard to reach as the dirigible would be buffeted by the winds, but it was also extremely unsafe. The last obstacle couldn't have been overcome by the architects or engineers if they tried, not legally anyway. ""... existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" would also restrict the project, and actually stop it altogether. Clearly, some large and crucial deciding factors had been overlooked while designing the moor. @ORGANIZATION2's competitive attitude made this so, but ""The Mooring Mast... was never destined to fulfill its purpose."" In the end, these combined obstacles ensured that the plan to use the building for dirigible docking remained unfeasible."
821	15654	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION1, the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in attempts to allow dirigibles to dock there. One significant obstacle was that docking dirigibles would add substantial stress to the building's frame. To accommodate this stress, approximately sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications and strengthening work, such as reinforcing key structural components, would have to be carried out. Another major hurdle was related to the gas used in dirigibles. Dirigibles from outside the United States typically used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. If an incident like the German Hindenburg being destroyed by fire were to occur in New York, the consequences would be far more severe due to the high population density. Additionally, the wind posed a considerable obstacle. Strong winds would cause the back of the ship to swivel erratically all around the mooring mast, making docking and passenger transfer extremely dangerous. One of the most often overlooked obstacles was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. It was illegal for the ship to even tie up to the building. Clearly, many insurmountable obstacles stood in the way of allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, ultimately making the idea unfeasible."
822	15655	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced a multitude of obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. One primary obstacle was overcoming the extra stress that a docked dirigible would impose. In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"", author Marcia Amidon Lusted states that ""the stress of the dirigibles' load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation..."", which required careful engineering and reinforcement. Another significant obstacle the builders faced was the violent weather conditions at the top of the building. Lusted says that ""Even if the dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and break the mooring mast."" This was a critical problem because it would make it extremely unsafe for passengers to exit the dirigible and walk down a gangplank connected to the Empire State Building. Moreover, the strong wind also made it arduous for a dirigible to navigate precisely to the mooring mast without being blown into other nearby buildings in the area. One of the greatest challenges was ensuring the safety of the mooring mast. Lusted states that ""most dirigibles from outside the U.S. use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" If a dirigible were to catch fire over a densely populated area like New York, the resulting casualties would be numerous. These were some of the many formidable obstacles that builders encountered when attempting to construct a mooring mast on the Empire State Building, which ultimately led to the impracticality of the project."
823	15656	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced a great deal of trouble and confusion in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. Since this had never been done before, they didn't know what to expect, except that a mooring mast was required. At first, Al Smith and his builders thought this was an amazing idea, representing the technology of the future. However, things were far from easy. They faced complications when collaborating with @ORGANIZATION1 on their research regarding dirigibles. It was a highly complicated process because the docking area was high up in the air, and a significant amount of practice and testing was involved. Next, there were the alterations needed for the building. The building was not initially strong enough to hold the dirigible, so they had to make @MONEY1 worth of changes, such as strengthening the structure and improving the mooring mechanism. Eventually, they finally realized that this was an unsafe idea, especially considering the highly flammable hydrogen used in dirigibles. As a result, they were back to square one. Then, the government issued a law stating that no airships were allowed to fly too low at or over urban areas, which would make it illegal for the dirigibles to tie up to the Empire State Building. Consequently, the top floors were converted into a soda fountain, marking the end of the attempt to enable dirigible docking.
824	15657	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous problems when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Most of the problems they encountered were during the design of the mast. They quickly found that they could not simply install a mooring mast on top of the building at a height of a thousand feet. The building's existing structure was not strong enough to support the weight and stress of a docked dirigible. Therefore, they had to strengthen the building by installing a new and more robust steel frame to ensure its stability. Then, the builders also had to deal with significant safety issues. At a thousand feet, the air currents were extremely violent. These strong and unpredictable winds made it nearly impossible to safely dock and secure a dirigible. By the end of the construction process, it was quickly evident that dirigibles could not land on the Empire State Building due to these insurmountable challenges, rendering the docking project unviable.
825	15658	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many problems that effectively prevented dirigibles from landing there. It was deemed too dangerous to tether dirigibles to the mast of the building for four main reasons. The first was that a dirigible moored to the mast of the building ""would add stress to the building's frame"". This problem was soon resolved, however, as the steel frame was carefully redesigned and strengthened, making it robust enough to endure the added stress. Another crucial reason that dirigibles could not be attached to the Empire State Building is that dirigibles are highly flammable when they use hydrogen gas. It became abundantly clear that if a dirigible were to catch fire in downtown New York, the potential for destruction and loss of life would be too great to risk. Dirigibles also couldn't be attached to the mast because the powerful winds on top of the building would cause the back of the ship to ""swivel around and around the mooring mast"", which would pose a significant threat to the safety of both the ship and its passengers. Finally, dirigibles could not be moored to the Empire State Building because ""the sharp spires of other buildings in the area [could] puncture the dirigible's shell"". Flying at a low altitude near these structures would put the dirigible at risk of damage, endangering the people on board. In conclusion, dirigibles could not land at the Empire State Building because there were simply too many inherent dangers that could not be effectively mitigated."
826	15659	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced included constructing a correct mooring mast for the zeppelins, which was a complex task related to the safety of the people in the city. They also had to account for the weather and how its variable conditions, such as strong winds and sudden gusts, may have affected the blimps. The builders had to add on more floors to the building and strengthen its base so that the mast could work properly and stay stable under different circumstances. Then they ruled out using weights to anchor the blimps in place because of the potential danger to the people on the street below. Also, the chemicals in the blimp were highly flammable and put people around at risk. Sometimes the winds were too strong for the blimps to get close enough without being punctured. In the end, the builders were faced with seemingly impossible obstacles to overcome, which made the project extremely challenging.
827	15660	6	3	Based on the excerpt, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was a huge challenge for them to face. For example, mother nature itself was one of the huge challenges they would mostly face. At the top of the Empire State Building, winds were constantly shifting and swirling due to violent air - currents. These air - currents were unpredictable, making it difficult to anticipate the movement of the dirigibles. As soon as a dirigible would hook up to the building, workers would have to find a way to keep their airship from crashing into the building from the rusty (strong) winds at the top of the building. Therefore, if a dirigible crashed anywhere on the ground, it would burst into an inferno because the inside of a dirigible is filled with hydrogen and helium, so if it did crash, it would involve heat and fire that would be coming from the sparks it generates as it crashes on the ground. In conclusion, these natural and safety - related obstacles made the idea of dirigible docking at the Empire State Building a very difficult one to realize.
828	15661	6	3	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced was the lack of a suitable landing area. They aimed to ""allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling, or servicing, and to let passengers off and on"". A proper landing area was essential for these operations to be carried out safely and efficiently. Also, dirigibles were docked by means of a winch, which required careful handling and precise operation. The builders had to ensure that the winch system was reliable and could withstand the forces exerted during the docking process. However, the absence of a suitable landing area made all these tasks extremely difficult. In the end, these challenges made it a tough feat to achieve the goal of having dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building."
829	15662	6	3	"In the @ORGANIZATION1, there were many problems that were faced during the build. The way that this all @CAPS1 was when the architect Al Smith wanted to make a building like no other, a building that was taller than the new Chrysler Building and one that was future - looking. The first problem that they ran into was, what was a building of this size going to be used for? There were many different ideas, but the one that came to Al @CAPS2 @CAPS3 was transportation. This building could be used for a new kind of transportation where people could board a Dirigible ""also known as a blimp"" at the very top of the building. The next problem was if this would be safe to do because they couldn't have a big problem in the middle of New York. The idea went to Washington to be reviewed by relevant authorities. After a detailed assessment, it ended up not being safe enough. Al Smith didn't care; his building was the tallest, and he was proud of his achievement despite the impracticality of the initial transportation idea."
830	15663	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building was nature itself. The weather conditions, such as strong winds, heavy rains, and extreme temperatures, posed significant challenges. Strong winds at the high altitude where the building was being constructed could affect the stability of the construction materials and the safety of the workers. Heavy rains could cause delays in the construction process and damage to the building's structure if not properly protected. Extreme temperatures, whether it was scorching heat or freezing cold, could also impact the quality of the building materials and the performance of the construction equipment. In conclusion, nature's unpredictable and harsh elements made the construction of the Empire State Building a difficult and arduous task.
831	15664	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in their attempts to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first problem they faced was the issue of safety. Most dirigibles were fueled by hydrogen, which was highly flammable. This extreme flammability posed a significant risk, as even a small spark could lead to a massive explosion. The danger was clearly shown by the Hindenburg disaster in New Jersey, where the dirigible caught fire and was destroyed in a matter of seconds. The owners of the building did not want to face a similar accident in a place as densely populated as New York, where the loss of life and property damage would be catastrophic. Another obstacle that arose was the fact that the violent wind at such an altitude would toss the back of the ship back and forth. These strong and unpredictable winds would not only be a technical hassle but would also make it nearly impossible to get passengers in and out of the dirigible safely. It would also be a terrifying experience for anyone inside the ship as it was buffeted by the powerful gusts. In addition, the ships could not be weighed down with lead weights as it would be too risky to have them dangling high above pedestrians. A falling weight could cause serious injury or death to those below. A final implication was that if dirigibles moored at the Empire State building, it would violate an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. Because of this, docking a ship there would be illegal, which obviously was not helpful to the project. In the end, these numerous and insurmountable obstacles were the key reasons that the endeavor failed.
832	15665	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of these obstacles was that they would have to modify the entire building's steel frame so that it could withstand the extra stress and pressure of having a dirigible moored to its top. The steel frame of the Empire State Building, initially designed for different purposes, would have to be carefully modified and significantly strengthened to accommodate this new and demanding situation. Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework, involving complex engineering work and precise adjustments. Another obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building faced was that dirigibles were highly flammable because they were filled with hydrogen. Hydrogen is an extremely combustible gas, and the slightest spark could trigger a massive fire. The owners realized it may be a bad idea when the Hindenburg burst into flames. This well - known disaster was a vivid and tragic example of the dangers associated with hydrogen - filled dirigibles. If that had happened at the Empire State Building, it would have had extremely drastic results, potentially destroying the building and causing countless casualties in the densely populated area below. ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire... The owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" The biggest obstacle though was nature itself; ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents... The back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" These constantly changing and powerful winds made it almost impossible to safely moor a dirigible at the top of the building. These were just three of the many formidable obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in trying to allow dirigibles to dock there, ultimately leading to the failure of the project."
833	15666	6	3	During construction of the mooring mast atop the Empire State Building, the builders encountered many challenges. If they had just put a spire on top of the building, the weight of a dirigible could destroy it. The existing structure was not designed to bear the additional load and forces exerted by a moored dirigible. The construction team needed to go back and reinforce the entire framework of the building. This involved a detailed and labor - intensive process of adding extra steel supports and strengthening key structural elements. Other obstacles in their way included low - flying aircraft laws, difficult weather conditions, and safety concerns. If a dirigible were to catch fire or malfunction while docked, it could pose a serious threat to the building and the people below. Also, the low - flying aircraft laws prohibited airships from flying too close to the ground in urban areas, making it illegal for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. For all these reasons, the mooring mast was doomed from the start, as the challenges were too great to overcome.
834	15667	6	3	"In the passage ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Løsted, she talked about the obstacles faced when trying to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. The three main obstacles were safety, mother nature, and existing laws. One of the greatest obstacles was because of safety. Løsted states, ""... Never fulfilled its purpose... The greatest reason was one of safety: Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" Hydrogen's high flammability meant that any minor incident, such as a short - circuit or a spark, could lead to a massive explosion. Because hydrogen is highly flammable, there would be no way that it would be safe to have dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building. The building could catch on fire and be a danger to all those in the vicinity, including the occupants of the building and the people on the streets below. Secondly, nature itself would have an impact on the dirigibles. Løsted states, ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The violent and unpredictable air currents made it extremely difficult, if not impossible, to safely maneuver and dock a dirigible. The constant shifting of the winds could cause the dirigible to collide with the building or be thrown off - course. It isn't safe to have dirigibles in such an environment with violent air currents. Lastly, laws were an obstacle the builders had to face. Løsted's knowledge is, ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" The law was a huge obstacle for the builders constructing the docking facilities for dirigibles. Because you can't build something that is against the law, it severely limited their options. Because of safety concerns, the challenges posed by mother nature, and the existing laws, these were the factors that stopped the builders from making the dirigible docking project at the Empire State Building a success."
835	15668	6	3	The challenges the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were the high winds and the building's struggle to stay stable. The high winds at the top of the building were extremely strong and erratic, making it difficult to control the movement of the dirigibles during docking. The builders had difficulty getting the building to meet their requirements. They kept adding to the building and making it taller in an effort to make it more visible to the approaching dirigibles. The dirigibles needed a clear and prominent landmark to guide them to the docking area. However, the problem was that as they made the building taller, it became more vulnerable to the strong winds. The structure would sometimes show signs of stress, with parts of it creaking or even breaking. They kept working on the building to try and get it right, making adjustments to the framework and adding additional supports. But they continued to fail as they struggled to find the right balance between height, stability, and wind resistance. They had to make their plans more realistic and take into account the limitations imposed by the high - wind environment. Their major problem was that they initially underestimated the impact of the winds and overestimated the building's ability to withstand them. In the end, these persistent challenges and the failure to address them effectively led to the project's inability to succeed.
836	15669	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, some obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced when attempting to let dirigibles dock there were related to the law, safety, and nature. There was a specific law that clearly stated aircraft weren't allowed to fly at such low altitudes. As the text mentions, ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building."" In terms of safety, it was a major concern due to the hydrogen used in most dirigibles. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" Nature also posed a significant challenge because of the high winds on top of the building. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Due to these obstacles that the engineers had not anticipated, the Empire State Building never became a successful dirigible landing site."
837	15670	6	3	"Builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there. One crucial obstacle was the safety of the people in New York. Dirigibles could have used hydrogen, and if a dirigible caught on fire, it could have landed in a populated or sensitive area, causing great harm. As stated in paragraph @NUM1, ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting because of violent air - currents. Even if the dirigibles were tethered to the mast, the back of the ship would swivel around the mast, making docking extremely difficult and dangerous. Another obstacle was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. Due to these insurmountable challenges, the idea of using the mooring mast had quietly disappeared."
838	15671	6	3	"The builders faced many obstacles while trying to add a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building. As clearly stated in paragraph fourteen, nature was the biggest obstacle the builders encountered. The ""violent air currents"" were so strong that they would cause dirigibles to move erratically around the mooring mast, even when it was properly tethered. Another significant obstacle was the construction aspect. The architects couldn't just simply add a mooring mast to the top of the building; over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework to ensure its stability. Lastly, as mentioned in paragraph thirteen, most dirigibles from outside the @LOCATION1 used hydrogen rather than helium, even though hydrogen was highly flammable. When the German dirigible, Hindenburg, tragically went up in flames, the owners of the building quickly realized the extreme dangers associated with using hydrogen - filled dirigibles, which ultimately made the addition of the mooring mast unfeasible."
839	15672	6	3	The builders faced many obstacles. They could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat surface; it required a great deal of stress and hard work. The dirigible, which was about a thousand feet long, was held by a single cable tether. This precarious situation made the builders extremely stressed and forced them to think clearly and carefully about two main factors. Firstly, they had to consider the wind pressure, as strong winds could easily push the dirigible around and put excessive strain on the tether and the building. Secondly, they had to account for the dirigible's load, as an uneven or heavy load could also cause instability. Due to these complex challenges, the task of adding a mooring mast was far from straightforward.
840	15673	6	3	There were a few problems with the dirigibles docking on the Empire State Building. One major problem was related to the foundation. If dirigibles were to land on the building, it would cause significant tension on the building's foundation, @CAPS1 gradually squishing it down. The architects would have needed to make substantial adjustments to the foundation in order for a dirigible to land safely. Another problem was the way the ship would be docked. When the ship was docked, it would sway back and forth around the mast due to wind and other forces. This swaying motion was a serious hazard as it could either cause damage to the building or injury to the people of New York. These problems made it very difficult, if not impossible, for dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building.
841	15674	6	3	"There were many obstacles faced when trying to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State building. One of these obstacles was the wind currents atop the building. They were uncontrollable, forceful, and unexpected. In a historical record @CAPS1 @NUM1 it explains how a U.S. Navy dirigible attempted to dock but could not due to the winds, ""U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds"" (L¸sted). Clearly, @CAPS2 the winds were an issue. Another problem was a law against airships that flew too low to the ground in urban areas. Not only was the idea dangerous, but it was also illegal. On May 6, 1937, a German dirigible called Hindenburg exploded in Lakehurst, New Jersey. This was due to the flammable hydrogen that was used to lift the dirigible. Since all dirigibles at this time obtained hydrogen, another threat was introduced. This was the chance of it exploding while trying to dock on the Empire State Building. If it exploded while above numerous citizens, many lives would be in @CAPS3. Considering all these issues, the mooring mast idea was now nonsense."
842	15675	6	3	Dirigibles, also known as blimps, were being hailed as the transportation of the future in the 1920s. They had a top speed of eighty miles per hour, and they could cruise at seventy miles per hour for thousands of miles without needing refueling. One obstacle the builders faced was the lack of a suitable landing area. Al Smith spotted the opportunity for his Empire State building. He planned to add a mooring mast to the top of the building, thus allowing dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service. Also, it would let people off and on. The problem with this was that the builders couldn't just set the mooring mast on top of the Empire State building's flat roof. If a thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the structure, held by a single cable tether, it would add significant stress to the building's frame. Given these challenges, the feasibility of using the Empire State Building for dirigible docking was highly questionable.
843	15676	6	3	In @DATE1, the Empire State Building was constructed and would be used to house a new form of travel. The mooring mast, constructed at the top of the building, would be used to dock one - thousand foot dirigibles; the future of travel. In theory, the blimp would be docked at the mast, using an electric winch, but in reality, there was no safe way of doing so at such a high altitude. Another challenge faced was the highly flammable gas, hydrogen, which was used. One lit match could send the steel frame plummeting to the earth below. The soft fabric which covered the steel frame could easily be punctured, which was unsuitable for an urban area. The men constructing the blimp either looked over, or forgot the elements of nature which restricted this project. At the peak of the building, winds reached high velocities, and shifted directions rapidly which would have wrapped the dirigible around the mast. The greatest obstacle was the law, restricting airships from flying too low over New York's growing urban civilization. In the Empire State Building's history, one blimp has attempted to simulated dock, and another has performed a newspaper stunt. Any man in his right mind would see that this project was doomed before it had begun, as all these factors combined made it an unviable venture.
844	15677	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. They consulted with experts, taking tours of equipment and mooring operations in New Jersey. The architects couldn't just drop the mooring mast on top of the building. If they did, it would add stress to the building's frame. The stress of the load would have been transmitted all the way to the building's foundation. The steel frame would have to be modified and strengthened. The greatest obstacle was nature. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would spin around and around the mooring mast. You could weigh it down, but that would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, which was neither practical nor safe. There was also a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. And when they tried delivering newspapers, they noticed it wasn't going to work. With all these insurmountable obstacles, the plan to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was bound to fail.
845	15678	6	3	The builders had to face a lot. They had to rebuild the whole top again so the dirigibles could dock there. Architects couldn't just drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State. A dirigible on top of a building held by a single cable tether would add a great deal of stress to the building's frame. The steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be upgraded and strengthened. Also, all of these modifications would cost over sixty thousand dollars to make the building's framework better. Considering the high cost and the engineering challenges, it became clear that the idea of making the Empire State Building suitable for dirigible docking was not a practical one.
846	15679	6	3	To have a building built over @NUM1 ft. tall and expect dirigibles/blimps to be able to dock there is extremely dangerous and presents numerous obstacles. First, the weather conditions are far from ideal. On a windy day, a blimp hovering over thousands of pedestrians in New York would sway back and forth precariously. Placing lead blocks in the back of the blimp is a perilous idea as having lead swaying above a large crowd of people is a major safety hazard. Secondly, most blimps outside of the U.S. used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable, and in the event of a fire, it could spread rapidly and destroy an entire building. Finally, there is an existing law that prohibits airships from hovering too low over urban areas, which means blimps cannot moor at the Empire State Building. These multiple reasons clearly show why blimps could not moor at the Empire State Building, making the idea an unfeasible and dangerous one.
847	15680	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many challenges in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. A @NUM1 - foot dirigible moored at the top would add significant stress to the building's frame. This implies that they would have to strengthen the entire structure of the building. Otherwise, the building might be at risk of collapsing. Most dirigibles outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable, and the Hindenburg accident served as a stark reminder. The Hindenburg caught fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey. This incident demonstrated how much more catastrophic it could have been if it had occurred over a densely - populated area like New York. Another crucial factor was the wind currents, which were constantly @CAPS1. These strong and variable winds would cause the back of the dirigible to sway and move erratically. Additionally, there was a pre - existing law stating that airships could not fly too low over urban areas. All these factors were the obstacles the builders faced in trying to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, and they ultimately made the endeavor very difficult if not impossible.
848	15681	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, there were numerous obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle, as described in paragraph @NUM1, ""A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" This indicates that they would have to reinforce the entire building. If they failed to do so, the building might potentially collapse. The next obstacle, described in paragraph @NUM2, ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" This means that the strong winds at the top of the building would make it take a long time to land a dirigible safely. Moreover, the wind could cause the dirigible to break free and fly away. The @CAPS1 obstacle, described in paragraph @NUM3, ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This implies that dirigibles could be seen as a target for those aiming to destroy the building. Also, if a dirigible were to fall, it would cause a large number of casualties. Due to these insurmountable obstacles, the project of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was cancelled."
849	15682	6	3	"There are many obstacles that the builders faced in order to allow dirigibles to dock atop the Empire State Building. One significant obstacle was safety. Foreign countries typically used highly flammable gases to fill their dirigibles. As the passage states, ""when the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" This shows that a similar incident in New York could have led to numerous injuries and deaths. Another obstacle was the weather. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting because of the violent air currents. For instance, the U.S. Navy dirigible, Los Angeles, couldn't tie up to the mast because of the wind. Strong winds might have punctured the shell of the dirigible, endangering both the vessel and the people below. One more obstacle was the law banning airships from flying too low over urban areas. According to the passage, ""This law would make it illegal to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" Because of these many obstacles, the Empire State Building was unable to fulfill its original purpose of allowing dirigible docking. However, it still stands as a well - known worldwide landmark today."
850	15683	6	3	In the article 'The Mooring Mast' by @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS1 details several problems the builders of the Empire State Building faced when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. For example, most blimps (dirigibles) outside of the United States used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable, and considering that downtown New York is densely populated, any mishap involving a hydrogen - filled blimp could have severe consequences. It could lead to injuries and even deaths among the people of New York. Another significant reason is an existing law against flying airships too low over urban areas. This law effectively makes it illegal for an airship to even approach the area around the Empire State Building. Overall, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles that could and should have been identified and considered before the building's construction, highlighting the need for more thorough pre - planning in such ambitious projects.
851	15684	6	3	When building the Empire State Building, the workers faced a few problems. One was how to make it taller, because the architect building the Chrysler Building had raised the total height, making it the largest building in the world. Al Smith, the former governor of New York, said they were going to beat it by putting a mooring mast for the dirigibles. Another obstacle was attaching the mast to the top of the frame. It could not be dropped on, so sixty thousand dollars worth of maintenance had to be done to the frame. A third problem they had was tying up the dirigibles. Violent winds could turn the blimp around, possibly puncturing it. After the Hindenburg atrocity, the people in charge would not let blimps dock at the building, for fear of endangering the public. Thus, the mast was never used, and the dream of using the building as a dirigible dock remained unfulfilled.
852	15685	6	3	"People involved in the design and construction of the Empire State Building were faced with a few major obstacles in attempting to transform the idea of docking dirigibles to reality. One of the biggest complications was that if a massive dirigible was tied to the building by a ""cable tether"", then stress would be put on the building's frame. The builders and architects had to find a way to allow the stress to travel down the foundation of the building. They spent over $50,000 modifying the framework (From paragraph 3). In paragraph 5, we read that the architects and builders worked through the obstacle of storage by putting the winches and control machinery in the base of the shaft of the ""conical roof"". Despite these efforts, the challenges ultimately made the dirigible - docking plan unfeasible."
853	15686	6	3	Although the builders' dream of using the Empire State Building as a dock for dirigibles was a brilliant one, the builders came across many problems. One problem was the law against flying too low over urban areas like New York City. This law made it illegal for dirigibles to approach the building at the required height for docking. Also, nature played a huge part in why their plan didn't work. The violent wind currents throughout the city affected the plan. Most dirigibles landed in open fields where their back end could be weighted down. This would be impossible when docked to the building, causing the dirigible to sway around possibly hitting other buildings. The builders didn't take into consideration how densely populated New York City is. If anything ever happened to a docked dirigible like the Hindenburg, many people would be affected. This is why the idea always stayed a dream, remaining an unfulfilled vision in the building's history.
854	15687	6	3	The obstacles the builders took on were difficult, and time - consuming. In ways such as the only benefits the Empire State Building really passed was being the tallest building in the world. They also attempted to create a dirigible's docking base for future transportation but failed to do so during certain laws and technical difficulties. Such obstacles as adding extra body work to the building's structure was not even necessary. Those are the obstacles the builders faced, as well as spending time and resources on an ultimately unachievable goal.
855	15688	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was that a ""thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether would add stress to the building's frame."" This is a very important obstacle because if the frame becomes too stressed by the excess weight of the dirigible, the building might collapse. Another obstacle is wind. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". This is also a major obstacle because the dirigibles were very light, lighter than air, so the violent winds would swing it around. That high in the air is not a safe thing, especially considering that downtown Manhattan is below where there are thousands of people. And a third obstacle was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This made it illegal to fly that low to be able to tie the blimp up to the building. In the end, these obstacles combined to prevent dirigibles from ever regularly docking at the Empire State Building."
856	15689	6	3	"Based on the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered numerous obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The author clearly states, ""the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" (L¸sted, paragraph @NUM1) It was reported that the winds on top of the building were in a constant state of change due to violent air currents. A dirigible on the building would struggle to land properly and couldn't be weighted down with lead weights like those used in open landing fields. It simply wouldn't be practical to dangle weights over the heads of hundreds of people walking in the streets below. In addition to nature, safety was another significant obstacle the builders faced. As written, ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (L¸sted, paragraph @NUM2). Since hydrogen is highly flammable, an accident could have extremely severe consequences in a densely populated area like downtown New York where the Empire State Building is located. An accident had already occurred with a German dirigible catching fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey. In conclusion, nature and safety were the two major obstacles that prevented the builders of the Empire State Building from successfully allowing dirigibles to dock there."
857	15690	6	3	What the builders faced while trying to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, one of the prominent issues was nature. The winds at the top of the building were in a constant state of shifting because of violent air currents. Even if they managed to tie the front of the dirigibles to the building, the cable holding it would exert pressure on the building. The only way to relieve the building of this pressure was to modify it to make it stronger, and this would cost over sixty thousand dollars. Moreover, even if they could overcome all these obstacles, there was a law against airships flying too low over the city. So, considering all these factors, it was evident that dirigibles docking on the Empire State Building would not have been a feasible option.
858	15691	6	3	A dirigible is distinct from a plane or a hot air balloon as it is filled with flammable gases. To attempt to dock something as large as a dirigible on top of the world's tallest building would pose an extremely high level of danger to the urban town below. The potential for a fire or explosion due to the flammable gases could lead to widespread destruction and endanger the lives of countless people. Additionally, it would be extremely dangerous for the workers involved in the docking process. The combination of the large size of the dirigible, the flammable nature of its contents, and the high - rise location makes the idea of docking dirigibles on the building an unviable and hazardous proposition.
859	15692	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"", author Marcia Amidon L¸sted elaborates on the obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. First and foremost, the frame of the building had not been constructed to withstand a thousand - foot - long blimp docking to it. As a result, significant changes would have to be made to strengthen the building. As the excerpt explicitly states, ""Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework"". Moreover, having dirigibles dock to the building would be fraught with safety risks. For instance, dirigibles were frequently filled with hydrogen rather than helium, and as the excerpt points out, ""hydrogen is highly flammable"". Thus, the owners of the building realized that it could lead to a tragic event if a blimp were to crash while flying above New York's busy streets. Additionally, the strong winds at the top of the building made it both difficult and dangerous for blimps to dock at the mooring mast, as they would cause the back of the ship to constantly sway. Finally, there were laws in place preventing aircrafts from flying so low over the city. In conclusion, there were multiple insurmountable obstacles that made it unfeasible to allow dirigibles to dock to the building."
860	15693	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many different obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. The primary challenge was to design the mast without having to reconstruct a large part of the building. This required careful planning and engineering to ensure the mast could be integrated safely. Also, a crucial aspect they had to address was safety. These large dirigibles are often highly flammable, and having such a potentially dangerous object in a very populated city like New York would be extremely risky and unsafe. The last problem they faced was nature. Of course, one cannot change nature, so this problem was present from the beginning but was probably overlooked or never even considered. Given these multiple and significant obstacles, it is clear that this endeavor would never have been able to succeed without encountering major problems. In the end, the combination of design challenges, safety concerns, and natural obstacles made it impossible to achieve successful dirigible docking at the Empire State Building.
861	15694	6	3	The problems that the Empire State Building faced were numerous. For one example, the regulations were not laid out clearly. They were unaware of the law stating that aircrafts could not enter any suburban areas. They witnessed the potential disaster when the Hindenburg burned to the ground. Another great obstacle they faced was nature. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, which would cause the dirigible to swivel around the mooring mast. One last obstacle was the structure of the dirigible. If it kept landing on top of the building, it would gradually damage the building's structure. These are some of the obstacles that were faced, and they significantly hindered the intended use of the building for dirigible docking.
862	15695	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, there were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The dirigibles, also called blimps, were extremely large. This was a major problem because they were too big to easily reach the building. Moreover, ""most dirigibles outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (par. @NUM1). This was extremely dangerous as an accident could occur, and the blimp could explode right over the city, potentially harming thousands of people. The winds above the building were sometimes very violent, making it difficult for dirigibles to reach it. ""Even if the dirigible tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast"" (par. @NUM2). It was indeed very difficult to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. The purpose for which the top of the building was created could not be fulfilled because it was simply too dangerous, and the risks were unacceptable."
863	15696	6	3	"In the making of the Empire State Building, the builders faced some significant problems. All of these problems were negative in relation to what they actually wanted to achieve. Some of these problems stemmed from what the balloon was made of. Most balloons used hydrogen instead of helium. In the excerpt, it is stated that ""hydrogen is highly flammable,"" which could lead to many deaths in case of an accident. Another problem was the strong winds that could carry the balloon and make it hard to handle. The last situation was that there was a law about low - flying vehicles, and the balloon flew at a low altitude. In conclusion, the problems they had could not be fixed, so the plan to use the building for balloon - related activities was completely ruined, and they had to abandon the original intention."
864	15697	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was the law. There was ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (∂ @NUM1). Although at first, the builders initially overlooked this legal constraint, there were many other non - legal obstacles that they faced. There was also a significant safety issue with docking dirigibles. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (∂ @NUM2). This posed a great threat to the safety of the city and the people. One last obstacle the builders faced was the wind. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (∂ @NUM3). With all of these obstacles combined, it would not only be improbable but close to impossible to dock dirigibles on the mast of the Empire State Building, and the idea had to be abandoned due to these insurmountable challenges."
865	15698	6	3	When Al Smith wanted to make a dock on the Empire State Building, he wasn't really thinking rationally. That was a truly horrible idea. Passengers would be risking their lives when going on and off the dirigibles. He probably wasn't considering safety aspects and was just focused on the appearance. The obstacles he would encounter included potential deaths from people who were not cautious enough to go up there, the weather, and the cost. The weather was a huge factor because if it were windy, it could cause the dirigibles to go off course and crash. The cost to make this landing pad would be exorbitant as they would have to buy all the necessary floats and construct a landing station. Al Smith wasn't a very smart guy for suggesting that dirigibles land there, as the whole plan was fraught with too many risks and high costs.
866	15699	6	3	"The biggest and most obvious obstacles of attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building were the factors of safety, nature and the city's law concerning low - flying airships. According to the article The Mooring Mast by @PERSON1, the greatest safety risk was that most blimps made/operated outside the U.S ""used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" (paragraph @NUM1). Allowing a hydrogen - filled dirigible to float above densely populated @ORGANIZATION2 would have been an extremely dangerous risk. In 1937, a hydrogen blimp did catch fire, and the outcome was disastrous; the owners of the Empire State knew another accident like that above New York would have had far - reaching and much worse consequences. In higher altitudes, winds increase, and the winds atop the Empire State would cause the blimp's tail end to sway erratically. Normally, the tail end would be weighted down, but having weights hanging above the busy city streets isn't safe either. During one of the two failed attempts at docking the building, the winds were so fierce that the dirigible couldn't even get close to the building. The captain of the blimp feared ""... that the wind would blow the dirigible onto the sharp spires of other buildings in the area..."" (paragraph @NUM2), and that could put a hole in the blimp. Lastly, a law in New York City states that airships can't fly below a specific altitude, thus making the docking of a dirigible on top of the Empire State illegal. Many apparent obstacles were overlooked in the planning of the Empire State Building's blimp dock, and these issues ultimately made the idea unfeasible."
867	15700	6	3	"While constructing the mast to dock dirigibles to the Empire State Building, there were many obstacles that led to the end of this project. An inevitable obstacle was that most dirigibles were filled with extremely flammable hydrogen, which could be detrimental to the crowded New York City streets as well as the Empire State Building itself if it were to explode. The potential damage from a hydrogen explosion would not only destroy the building but also cause chaos and harm to the people on the streets below. Also, wind on top of the building was beyond their control, and with the violent wind currents, docking would be highly dangerous. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" Although it would be possible to strap lead weights to the back end of the blimp, it would be both unpractical and highly dangerous to the public walking beneath. Dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building even if the docking station was completed because of an existing law that forbids airships flying too low over urban areas. ""The as yet unsolved problems of mooring airships to a fixed mast at such a height made it desirable to postpone to a later date the final installation of the landing gear."" The obstacles that stood before the Empire State Building's mast were too great to optimistically believe the project could be finished. It was postponed and became obsolete with the invention of airplanes, as airplanes offered a more practical and less risky mode of transportation."
868	15701	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there included the fact that the winds on top of the building were always shifting because of the violent air currents. These shifting winds made it extremely difficult to control the movement of the dirigibles during docking. Also, the dirigibles use Hydrogen, which is highly flammable. So, if a hydrogen - filled dirigible were to blow up, there would be a lot of bad things happening in New York. The explosion could cause significant damage to the Empire State Building, nearby structures, and endanger the lives of countless people in the densely populated area. Also, there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The building would have to be modified and strengthened before the dirigibles could dock there, but considering all these issues, it was clear that the plan to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building faced insurmountable challenges and was ultimately unfeasible.
869	15702	6	3	"@ORGANIZATION1 on the excerpt from The Mooring mast by Marcia Amidon L√ºsted, there were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle the builders faced was safety. Paragraph @NUM1 states, most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. The owners of the Empire State Building realized how horrible an accident could be if it takes place in a highly populated area like New York City. A hydrogen explosion could cause massive destruction to the building and harm a large number of people. The greatest obstacle the builders faced was nature itself. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent wind currents"" paragraph @NUM2 states. They could have weighted the dirigible down with lead weights, but using these weights where they would be hanging above pedestrians was not safe as they could potentially fall and cause serious injury. The last obstacle the builder faced was that the law was against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for any ship to dock at the @ORGANIZATION1. As described in the excerpt from The Mooring Mast, there were many obstacles builders faced to allow dirigibles to dock there, and these obstacles made the idea of dirigible docking at the Empire State Building an unworkable plan."
870	15703	6	3	While attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on top of the Empire State Building, the architects faced many obstacles. Usually, when given an obstacle, you either succeed in overcoming it or fail. In this case, these men didn't overcome the obstacle. In the reading, it mentioned that dirigibles from outside the U.S. contained hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable and it could cause a lot of damage. Not only to the building itself, but also to the entire area of downtown New York. A hydrogen explosion could lead to the destruction of nearby buildings, disrupt traffic, and cause a large number of casualties. The winds at the top of the building were shifting due to air currents. This could cause the dirigibles to circle the mast even when tied down, making the docking process extremely difficult and dangerous. The architects also had to think about the existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The builders didn't realize how complicated the process of even tying down a dirigible would be because of the high winds. Even the simple task of dropping off newspapers was difficult and took up too much time. Who would want enormous steel - framed balloons dangling over their heads anyways? These multiple obstacles made the plan of dirigible docking at the Empire State Building an impractical and ultimately abandoned idea.
871	15704	6	3	In the excerpt “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon Lusted, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were significant. Specifically, it was extremely hard for architects to simply place a mooring mast on top of the Empire Building. A mooring mast held by a single cable tether would add substantial stress to the building's frame. The builders encountered many dilemmas and complications. In fact, over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework to address this issue. All these challenges ultimately made the plan of having dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building quite difficult to execute.
872	15705	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State building faced numerous obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first and initial issue they faced was the considerable stress the blimp would exert on the building. As the article clearly states, ""the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation...the building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the situation."" This stress prompted the need for further improvements on the building itself, which, as expected, cost both time and a significant amount of money. Another problem they encountered was the impracticality of the dirigibles themselves. The dirigibles require hydrogen, which is highly flammable. As a result of the well - known Hindenburg disaster, ""the owners of the Empire State building realized how much worse that accident would have been over a densely populated area such as downtown @LOCATION1."" Another great issue that presented itself was the inconsistent and violent air currents. These air currents made safe docking for the blimps extremely difficult. Although this problem could theoretically be combated with lead weights, they ""were neither practical nor safe."" And lastly, there was already ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This law effectively prevented the blimps from being able to fly as low as the building, let alone land there. In conclusion, the builders of the mooring mast at the @CAPS1.S.B. faced many insurmountable obstacles in its construction, which seriously questioned its safety and ultimately prevented it from being a practical solution."
873	15706	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State building faced many problems in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Starting with the complex task of putting a mooring mast on the top of the Empire State building. As stated, ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof"" (paragraph @NUM1). They had to carry out extensive modifications to the steel frame of the building. These modifications had to be done all the way from the building's foundation, ""which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" (paragraph @NUM1). This large - scale work would cost more than sixty thousand dollars. Once the mooring mast was built, the builders still encountered more problems. Dirigibles coming in from outside the @LOCATION2 ""used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (paragraph @NUM3). So, having these flammable dirigibles fly over such a populated place as New York City was extremely dangerous. Also, the winds at the top of the Empire State Building were too strong. As described, ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast"" (paragraph @NUM4). In the end, the problems the builders faced were too numerous and unfixable. Thus, the docking of dirigibles in the Empire State Building became an unfeasible plan and was ultimately abandoned."
874	15707	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle was the high - risk nature of having a hydrogen (highly flammable) filled dirigible dock over one of the most densely populated areas at the time. They were well - aware that they could not let the kind of accident that had happened in Lakehurst, New Jersey occur in New York. As it is put, ""The owners of the Empire State building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" The greatest obstacle was due to natural causes. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" These unstable winds made it impossible for the dirigible to stay steady for docking or unloading. Other proposed ideas to solve this problem, like using weights, were, ""neither practical nor safe."" The final obstacle was the law. ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"". As clearly shown, it was simply impossible for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State building because of natural causes, the high level of danger involved, and the law itself. In the end, these combined factors made the plan of dirigible docking at the Empire State Building unworkable."
875	15708	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first problem was related to the structure of the building. After the mast was designed, they needed a building that could withstand the stress of the mast. Instead of building a simple, utilitarian mast without any ornamentation, the architects designed a shiny glass and chrome - nickel stainless steel tower. Through careful planning and engineering, they were able to overcome that particular obstacle. Another significant obstacle was safety. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium."" What obstacles did that bring? Well, hydrogen is highly flammable. When a German dirigible was destroyed by a fire in New Jersey, the owners of the ""Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area. This safety concern led to another obstacle of practicality. Dirigibles customarily landed in open fields. ""The greatest obstacle to successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building made it unsafe. The only proposed solution, tethering the dirigible and weighing down the back with lead weights, was ""neither practical nor safe"". Architects faced many insurmountable obstacles, which in the end made it very difficult to achieve the goal of having dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building."
876	15709	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock at the Building. One of the greatest reasons was safety. Most dirigibles outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable, and in the event of an accident, it could lead to a catastrophic explosion, endangering not only the passengers and crew on the dirigible but also the people in and around the building. Another obstacle that arose was nature. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. If the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would sway violently with the wind, making it difficult to maintain a stable connection. Other dirigibles moored in open fields added lead weights on the back of them so they could not move. But there was nowhere for those weights to be attached to at the top of the Empire State Building. A practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building. In the end, these multiple obstacles made it nearly impossible for the builders to achieve their goal of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
877	15710	6	3	The builder of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of these problems, which was noticed after the building of the Mooring Mast, was how difficult it would be to keep a blimp steady and attached to something without pulling the building over on itself. The large size and weight of the dirigible, combined with the forces exerted during docking and mooring, put a significant strain on the building's structure. Another issue was safety. One thing that was unsafe about it was that most dirigibles from other countries use hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is very flammable, and a single spark could cause a massive explosion, especially in a densely populated area like New York City. One more reason was because of high air currents that would blow the back part of the ship around uncontrollably. These strong and unpredictable winds made it extremely challenging to safely dock and moor the dirigible at the building. Overall, these obstacles made the plan of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building unfeasible.
878	15711	6	3	"In the excerpt 'The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First of all, if a thousand - foot dirigible held by a single cable tether was moored at the top of the building, it would add a tremendous amount of stress to the frame. The workers had to transmit the stress ""All the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" They had to modify and strengthen the frame, which would cost over sixty thousand dollars. This financial burden was a significant hurdle. They also had to design an ornamental mast with four wings to house the mooring arm. What the builders did not realize was that their mooring mast not only had problems with the framework, but the dirigible would swivel around without being able to use lead weights to hold it down. There was nothing they could do to prevent this, as well as deal with the issues of flammability of the hydrogen used in dirigibles and existing laws. In conclusion, these multiple and insurmountable obstacles meant that the Empire State Building could not serve as a successful docking point for dirigibles."
879	15712	6	3	There were three main reasons as to why the Empire State Building would not serve well as a mooring mast for the dirigibles. For one, it was unsafe. Most of the dirigibles were filled with highly flammable hydrogen, and the fear of a Hindenburg repeat was too great, especially over a highly populated city like New York. A hydrogen - filled dirigible explosion could cause widespread destruction and loss of life. Two, violent air currents were present in and around New York City. Docking a dirigible would be too difficult as the strong and unpredictable winds would make it hard to control the ship's movement. And if it were docked, the wind would make it unsafe, potentially causing the dirigible to break free or damage the building. Lastly, a law was passed that made it illegal for airships to fly too low over urban areas. This made it impossible for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. These three obstacles were all contributing factors as to why the Empire State Building could not serve as a dirigible mooring mast, and they ultimately put an end to the idea of using the building for this purpose.
880	15713	6	3	"Marcia Amidon L¸sted, in her excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"", describes the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle they would have to face was realized during the designing of the mast that would be put on top of the building for docking. ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" (∂ @NUM1) They found that a dirigible docked on top of the building would add too much stress to the building's frame. The weight and movement of the dirigible would require significant structural modifications. Therefore, their first obstacle was to make modifications that would strengthen the building's framework. However, as L¸sted points out in paragraph @NUM2, ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" Due to rough air currents at the top of the building, the winds would constantly be shifting, making even a dirigible tethered to the mast sway around. This swaying could damage the dirigible and the building. Another issue was the question of how to weight the dirigibles down. In open landing fields, they would weight dirigibles down with lead weights. But using extremely heavy weights while being above hundreds of people on the streets would not be acceptable due to the risk of the weights falling. In conclusion, as one can see, the builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in trying to allow dirigibles to dock there, and these obstacles made the plan very difficult, if not impossible, to implement."
881	15714	6	3	When builders attempted to construct a structure enabling dirigibles, or blimps, to dock on the iconic Empire State Building in New York, they were oblivious to the numerous problems they would encounter. During the design of the mast on top of the building, designers discovered that if a dirigible was docked to the building, it would impose additional stress on the frame. Consequently, they would have to modify the Empire State Building's structure. To carry out this modification, a sum of sixty thousand dollars was required, along with more hours of labor. Another significant obstacle was nature's interference. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Docking a dirigible would be extremely difficult as it would be constantly swaying because of the wind, making it impossible for passengers to board the blimp. Moreover, blimps are usually moored in open fields, with lead weights used to keep them stable. If lead weights were used in densely - populated New York City, they could potentially fall while dangling in the air, posing a serious threat to pedestrians. In conclusion, the builders faced a multitude of insurmountable obstacles while trying to achieve docking capability for dirigibles on the Empire State Building.
882	15715	6	3	"There were many obstacles that the architects of the Empire State Building faced. One of them was redesigning some crucial parts of the Empire State Building. The architects' job was to create the mast for docking new airships called dirigibles or blimps. This plan came with great difficulty right from the start. They couldn't simply drop the mooring mass on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. They came to figure out that a ""thousand - foot dirigible moored and held by a single cable tether, would add significant stress to the building's frame"" (paragraph @NUM1). This stress would have to be effectively transmitted to the building's foundation. The architects had to carefully modify and strengthen the steel frame in order to accommodate the stress on the building frame. Also, when creating the rocket - shaped mass, the architects had to work meticulously on many different parts, such as the winches and control machinery for the dirigible mooring. This had to be done precisely in order for everything to work smoothly. These were the challenges the architects faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock in the Empire State Building."
883	15716	6	3	The main problem they had with the docking of the dirigibles was that it had to be extremely safe. To hold the aircraft down, they would have to use lead weights. If these weights were to fall from the top of the building in such a densely populated area, it would be extremely dangerous. Also, when the owners of the Empire State Building got notice of the Hindenburg blowing up, they felt extremely uneasy. Even if the aircraft was floating and moored to the top of the building, the strong wind would whip it around, making the situation even more unsafe. The idea of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was good in theory, but it was not practical to ensure the necessary level of safety. In the end, the safety concerns made it an unfeasible plan.
884	15717	6	3	When building the Empire State Building, there were significant obstacles faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. For example, the architects could not simply place a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add a substantial amount of stress to the building frame. So, the architects had to modify and strengthen the building. They spent over sixty thousand dollars on the new modification. The building would be transformed from @NUM1 floors to 102 floors. From there, dirigible passengers would board. However, these modifications and the overall plan were fraught with difficulties. In conclusion, when building the Empire State Building, the architects faced numerous and complex obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there.
885	15718	6	3	"There were many issues that made it impossible to use the Mast of the Empire State Building as a dock for dirigibles. One major concern was that many foreign dirigibles were filled with hydrogen, a highly flammable gas. If one of these dirigibles caught fire, similar to the tragic Hindenburg incident, it would cause many disasters as it would be hovering above people's homes. For the same safety reason, there was a strict law against dirigibles flying too low over cities. ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" Considering the safety risks for the people below, there was also the problem of the wind. The wind made it so difficult that the blimp could not even dock correctly. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around."" One of the attempts clearly demonstrated how tricky it would be to land. The Los Angeles attempted to reach the building but abandoned the idea because of the wind. The captain was extremely worried that he could fly into one of the spires of a tall building and the dirigible could be punctured. ""[He] could not even take his hands off the control lever."" In conclusion, due to these multiple and insurmountable issues, using the Mast of the Empire State Building as a dock for dirigibles was an unworkable plan."
886	15719	6	3	In the article The Mooring Mast by @PERSON1 @CAPS1, she describes the numerous difficulties of precisely designing the Mast for Dirigibles to dock on top of the iconic Empire State building. Al Smith, the well - known mayor of New York City at the time of the Empire State building's construction, came up with the forward - thinking idea to add a mooring mast to the top of the building. He aimed to make New York city a truly technologically advanced city. After the mast was proposed, designers painstakingly discovered problems with the mast being installed. They found that they would have to extensively modify the steel frame because if a thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, it would transmit significant stress all the way down the frame to the foundation, due to the heavy load and strong wind pressure. The high wind speeds on the top of the building would violently blow the dirigible around, which is extremely unsafe when it is close to a building. As a result, the plan to use the mast for dirigible docking faced major setbacks.
887	15720	6	3	In The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, a great deal of complex problems were faced in allowing the dirigibles to safely dock there. The numerous obstacles that were encountered would seriously put people's safety at high risk. One of the prominent problems was that the tail of the dirigibles would vigorously swivel because of how high up it was, and the wind at such a height would be extremely violent. Another problem that was clearly stated in paragraph @NUM1 was that foreign dirigibles were made with highly flammable hydrogen instead of safer helium, making them a significant fire hazard. Considering these safety - threatening issues, it became evident that docking dirigibles at the proposed location was not a feasible option.
888	15721	6	3	"Builders of the Empire State Building faced many challenging obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. When carefully designing the mast, they didn't initially realize that the mast ""would add substantial stress to the building's frame"" and in order to effectively fix this problem, they would have to pay ""over sixty thousand Dollars' worth"" for necessary modifications for the building's framework. Another problem they encountered, besides the fact that there was ""an existing strict law against airships flying too low over urban areas,"" was that ""the winds on the top of the building were constantly and unpredictably shifting."" This did not allow dirigibles to be able to get close enough to safely dock, in fear that the ""wind would blow the dirigible onto sharp spires,"" which would severely damage the dirigible's shell. An alternate problem faced by builders was realized when the Hindenburg was tragically destroyed in New Jersey, due to the fact that ""hydrogen is extremely flammable."" They realized how incredibly unsafe it would be to have an accident like that ""above a densely populated area."" And so, builders were ultimately forced to stop their work on this unfeasible project."
889	15722	6	3	The builders of the empire State Building faced many complex problems attempting to dock dirigibles. Most of these problems were serious safety concerns. One significant issue was the use of hydrogen, which is a highly flammable and explosive gas. A fire accident involving hydrogen would be utterly catastrophic, since downtown New York is densely populated. Another problem was that the tail of the dirigible could not be properly weighted down as it usually is, because then there would be massive weights dangerously dangling over the busy streets. With the strong winds blowing and the blimp not securely tethered and not weighted, dirigibles would have wildly swayed and moved around. This creates the high risk of the blimp getting punctured by sharp edges on other nearby buildings. Also, if the blimp ever successfully moored, it would create tremendous stress on the building. Besides the technical issues, there were some obvious obstacles that oddly never got thoroughly considered or addressed. The first being a strict law prohibiting low - altitude flights of airships over urban centers. That makes it completely illegal to even attempt to land, meaning there was never any remote chance of the mooring mast functioning. The second problem was that the proper mooring equipment were never installed. That meant no attempt could ever succeed. In conclusion, the builders faced many obstacles building the mast, but their biggest obstacle was a lack of proper preparation and failure to address obvious problems.
890	15723	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced two significant obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle was the forceful and erratic winds. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to the violent and turbulent air currents. Even when carefully tethering the dirigible to the mooring mast, it would cause the back of the ship to swivel dangerously and uncontrollably around the mooring mast. The second obstacle was due to an existing strict law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made it completely illegal for a ship to tie up to the building or even approach the area. Given these insurmountable obstacles, it became clear that the plan to have dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building was not going to be achievable.
891	15724	6	3	"The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were substantial. In a historical document @CAPS2 @NUM1 it reads that ""Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" This clearly indicated that the designings of the Mast was going to take some time. Another obstacle almost called the end of the mooring mast. In the same document @CAPS2 @NUM2 Architects noted that, "" The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its intended purpose, for reasons that were apparent before it was even constructed."" The greatest reason was one of safety: Most dirigibles from outside the @LOCATION3 used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. Given this was such a huge risk, the owners thought of the densely populated area of New York and how people could get hurt. These multiple challenges ultimately made the idea of dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building unfeasible."
892	15725	6	3	The obstacles that builders faced while building the Empire State Building were significant. First, the building's structure was not strong enough to support a @NUM1 - foot dirigible. The structural integrity of the building was a major concern as it simply did not have the capacity to hold the weight of such a large airship. Second, the winds in the area were extremely strong. These strong winds would cause the dirigible to move erratically, which could also damage the frame of the building. The force exerted by the wind on the dirigible and the building interaction was a real threat to the overall stability. Also, the law stated that airships could not fly too low over a city. This legal restriction added another layer of complexity to the plan of having dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building. These were some of the key obstacles that the workers faced while building the Empire State Building, and they significantly hampered the possibility of using the building for dirigible docking.
893	15726	6	3	Upon taking up the task of building a mast for dirigibles to dock at, the architects encountered many obstacles which made the idea of a mooring mast unfeasible. One obstacle they ran into was the violent nature of the wind currents above the city. These strong and unpredictable wind currents made the docking process extremely dangerous. If the dirigibles were to dock at the building with a tether, then the back of the dirigible would be free to swing and sway, potentially hitting the building or causing structural damage. Another factor they had to consider is that dirigibles are full of the flammable gas hydrogen which imposed the risk of a serious fire hazard about New York City. The presence of hydrogen in close proximity to a densely populated area was a major safety concern. Even if the engineers and architects managed to work out all of the kinks of building the mast, they still would face another obstacle. It was illegal to fly dirigibles too low over urban areas. This legal restriction further complicated the project. These are the reasons why the idea of a dock for dirigibles could never work out, despite the efforts of the architects and engineers.
894	15727	6	3	The @CAPS1 of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles. By allowing the dirigibles to dock there, they had to build @CAPS2 planfronts on the side of the building. This construction work was extremely dangerous as the workers would be exposed to high - altitude conditions, which means that they would be putting their lives in danger. They also had to deal with the electrical problems within and without the building. The @CAPS1 on the outsides of the building would have to work in the harsh environment of strong wind currents while handling electrical components. They also had to make sure that the electrical system was working properly. If there were to be a spark of any sort of fire, the hydrogen and helium in the dirigibles were extremely flammable, and if a wire were to short - circuit, it could light the whole dirigible aflame and it would blow up. These multiple risks and challenges made the task of enabling dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building very difficult.
895	15728	6	3	The Empire State Building faced considerable @CAPS1 difficulties to have the dirigibles dock there. The wind pressure from the dirigibles was a major issue as it messed up the building's framework. The force exerted by the dirigibles' movement and the wind interaction put a great strain on the building's structure. To accommodate this difficult situation, they paid Over Sixty thousand dollars to strengthen the building's framework. This significant financial investment was made in an attempt to make the building capable of withstanding the forces associated with dirigible docking. However, despite this effort, there were still other potential problems such as safety concerns and legal restrictions. These difficulties collectively made it a very challenging and ultimately unworkable idea to have dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building.
896	15729	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building were faced with numerous obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Some of the prominent obstacles were safety factors and nature itself. Safety was a major hurdle in this plan for a mooring mast because the dirigibles used hydrogen to float these large ships. Hydrogen is highly flammable, and the owners of the Empire State Building realized how disastrous it would be if the dirigibles were to catch fire over a highly populated city like New York. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners realized how much worse that accident could have been in New York."" The greatest obstacle was nature. Humans couldn't control the wind, and on top of the building, the wind conditions were constantly changing, making it extremely difficult to dock. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Due to these insurmountable obstacles, the plan for the mooring mast couldn't be realized."
897	15730	6	3	A mooring mast was added to the top of the building, and it was designed to allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and to facilitate the boarding and disembarking of passengers. Dirigibles were docked using an electric winch. However, the body of the dirigibles would swing in the breeze, posing challenges. One set of dedicated engineers in New York worked really hard, trying to figure out a practical solution. Meanwhile, the Government people in Washington were also engaged in devising some method of mooring airships to the mast. After much effort, they eventually achieved success in what they were trying to accomplish by building a mooring mast so that the dirigibles would have a proper place to land for fuel and service, thus fulfilling an important transportation - related need.
898	15731	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Based on the excerpt, one of these significant obstacles was the lack of a suitable landing area. The dirigibles were extremely large, as long as one thousand feet, which is the same length as four blocks in New York City. Another major obstacle was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. The U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of the forceful winds. Even if they managed to get close enough to tie up, the captain could not take his hands off the control levers due to the fear that the wind would blow the dirigible onto the sharp spires of other buildings in the area, which would puncture the dirigible's shell. Moreover, for the dirigible docking to be possible, over sixty thousand dollars worth of extensive modifications had to be made to the building's framework. Considering all these difficulties, it was clear that allowing dirigibles to dock was a highly challenging task.
899	15732	6	3	"In the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many challenges in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the building. First, they had to ensure that the mast wasn't too heavy to be placed on top of the building. When they realized it was, they made a significant amount of modifications, costing @MONEY1, to the building so that it could support the mast. They also had to guarantee the safety of transporting people through this dirigible, which largely depended on the wind and climate conditions. Additionally, they had to make the building taller than the Chrysler building as part of their plans. They aimed to transform New York's transportation. However, in the end, they came to the realization that docking on the building was not feasible if they wanted to ensure the safety of the public. This conclusion marked the end of their ambitious yet challenging endeavor."
900	15733	6	3	"In the passage ""The Mooring Mast"", the excerpt detailed New York's obstacles, such as engineering and safety - related issues. If the men were not in a competitive race to complete the project, the buildings and the docking plan would probably have been more viable. Rushing often leads to overlooking important details and encountering more problems. If one takes their time and truly tries to reach their goal, with careful planning and perseverance, they can overcome difficulties and achieve success. This shows that patience and a focused approach are crucial in any challenging project."
901	15734	6	3	"In the article ""The mooring mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigible to dock there was that people thought it was not going to be safe. ""The owner of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York"". Another reason why the builders faced difficulties in allowing dirigibles to dock there was that ""an open landing field could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but dangling high above pedestrians on the street was neither practical nor safe"". The Empire State Building was not very safe in this regard. This is why the builders of the Empire State Building faced challenges in allowing dirigible to dock there, ultimately making it unfeasible."
902	15735	6	3	In the @DATE1's, people did not have the advanced technology like we have today, and they often didn't fully understand what they were really doing. When the architects were building the @CAPS1 State Building, they encountered many problems. First, they couldn't simply place a mast on it because, as stated in the story, the roof was not flat. Next, it was mentioned that a thousand - foot drop would add significant stress to the frame. Moreover, they had to change the frame from steel to glass and also modify the roof structure. All in all, men in the @DATE1's had a great deal of work to do while building the Empire State Building, which was a complex and challenging project for them.
903	15736	6	3	The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose for reasons such as safety, nature, and the laws. The greatest reason was safety because most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is extremely flammable. The German dirigible, Hindenburg, was tragically destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937. This accident could have had far more catastrophic consequences if it had happened in a densely populated area like downtown New York. Nature was the biggest obstacle to overcome because the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. This would cause the back of the ship to swivel around precariously. This is extremely dangerous as it would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street. Finally, there are strict laws against airships flying too low over urban areas. That law would make it completely illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. In conclusion, because of these three major reasons, the mooring mast of the Empire State Building was fated to never achieve its intended purpose.
904	15737	6	3	The obstacles the builder of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there included noticing that the dirigibles would be dangerously and unsafely dangling high above pedestrians on the street. There were numerous risks when landing the huge dirigibles, and there was also a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made it illegal for a ship to even approach the area. Famous and important dirigibles had a great deal of trouble with their landings. For example, on December 1930, the U.S Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough because of the strong and forceful winds. The dirigible could move uncontrollably and crash into the sharp spires on other buildings around it. In spite of once having the potential of becoming the transportation of the future, dirigibles had given way to airplanes due to these insurmountable problems.
905	15738	6	3	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in allowing dirigibles to dock there are many, mainly it is a safety concern. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"", stated the article. ""They would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street [which] was neither practical nor safe."" This clearly shows that the dirigibles are not only impractical but also pose a great danger to both the people inside the dirigibles and the people on the street below. Due to these safety - related issues, it was almost impossible for the builders to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building."
906	15739	6	3	The greatest obstacles the builder of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was one of safety. Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York. The flames could have spread rapidly and caused catastrophic damage. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. These erratic winds made it extremely difficult to control the dirigible during docking. The other practical reason why dirigibles could not dock at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The wind would blow the dirigible onto the sharp spires of other buildings in the area, which would puncture the dirigible's shell, and the captain could not even take his hands off the control levers. This lack of control would put the entire operation at great risk, making it clear that docking dirigibles at the Empire State Building was not feasible.
907	15740	6	3	"In the story ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, there were many problems to face to allow dirigibles to dock on top of the Empire State Building. These obstacles composed of the dirigibles themselves, nature's winds, and laws that prevent dirigibles being allowed to dock. Some dirigibles from outside the state used hydrogen, a flammable gas, and could cause mass destruction to New York City due to being about the same length as four blocks in New York City. A large - scale explosion of a hydrogen - filled dirigible could have devastated the surrounding areas. Wind caused the dirigibles to swivel around even after being tied down. The strong and unpredictable gusts made the docking process extremely unstable. Since there ""was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas,"" doing so could cause the captain of the dirigible to be arrested. This legal constraint added another layer of difficulty, ultimately making the idea of docking dirigibles at the Empire State Building unworkable."
908	15741	6	3	"The obstacles the builders faced in building the Empire State Building were nature. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" These shifting winds made it a challenge to perform any construction or docking - related operations. ""Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe."" The risk of the weights falling and injuring people below was too great. The size was a problem along with how high they were in the sky. ""A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" This additional stress could potentially compromise the structural integrity of the building over time. Nature, size, and safety concerns were the obstacles that made it very difficult to make the dirigible - docking plan at the Empire State Building a reality."
909	15742	6	3	"In this excerpt, The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, there were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to have dirigibles dock there. One obstacle they faced was that they lacked a suitable landing area. Because of this, they came up with the idea of having the passengers get on and off the dirigible by walking down a gangplank to an open observation platform. However, this solution had its own set of risks, such as passengers being exposed to the elements. Another obstacle they faced was that ""The stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" This long - distance transmission of stress could cause wear and tear on the foundation over time. Another main obstacle that the builders faced was that ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" This modification would require significant time and resources. In the end, the idea of the mooring mast was a failure. The builders didn't think about potential problems that could occur. For example, nature itself, the law against airships flying too low over urban areas, and even fires, due to the gas (hydrogen) used in some dirigibles. These unforeseen issues ultimately led to the abandonment of the plan."
910	15743	6	3	If the Empire State Building were to dock dirigibles, there would be many problems in the way. They had a lack of landing area for an almost one - thousand - foot blimp. This large size of the dirigible made it extremely difficult to find a proper place for it to land safely. This dirigible being held by a single tether to the Empire State Building would put a large amount of stress on the building's structure, risking a possible collapse if continued. The constant strain on the building's framework could lead to structural failures. If they were to use the Empire State Building, they would have to modify it and use thousands of dollars in the process. The cost - effectiveness of such a modification was highly questionable. Even then, if the dirigible held onto the Building, the back of the blimp would sway with the high winds and that might risk the safety of the passengers. The passengers could be thrown around or even ejected in the event of a strong gust. All in all, the idea of landing a dirigible on a gigantic building is just a bad idea as it presents too many safety, structural, and financial challenges.
911	15744	6	3	Dirigible docking would have been a great addition to the Empire State Building. There were many obstacles the architects had to go through to complete this goal. The building's original structure wasn't strong enough. If they had tied a dirigible to the top of the original Empire State Building, the force exerted by the dirigible would have pulled the building until it fell over. The architects had to carefully upgrade the frame to ensure it was safe enough to withstand the additional stress. Now that the frame was safe, they had to worry about the dirigible itself. If only one end of the dirigible was tied to the mast, the other end would blow in the wind. This would make unloading cargo and people very difficult. Also, dirigibles could catch fire, which was a significant risk for the people on the ground. In the end, considering all these factors, it just wasn't safe to dock a dirigible at the Empire State Building.
912	15745	6	3	While the Empire State Building was being built, the builders faced many obstacles. Al Smith, the one in charge of this project, had a clear goal to build the tallest building. Right from the start, the first problem occurred. The Chrysler Building had a secret 185 - foot spire inside, and as of a certain date, it made this building 46 ft taller than the Empire State Building. The first sign of hope shone upon Al when he saw an opportunity for the Empire State Building. Dirigibles needed a landing area, and the mooring mast could do the trick. The mast, added to the top of the building, allows dirigibles to anchor for a while to refuel and to have service done. This design took some time to develop but soon became unfeasible. Safety was a major factor. Most dirigibles from outside of the United States were run on hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is very flammable and can cause tragic accidents. For example, on May 6, 1937, a German dirigible was destroyed by fire in New Jersey. If something like that would happen in a heavily populated area like New York City, then there would be a huge problem. These were a couple of the many obstacles faced while building the Empire State Building, ultimately making the original plan challenging to execute.
913	15746	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The obstacles included safety issues, nature, and the law. Safety issues were a major problem because, as the excerpt states, ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This clearly explains why they couldn't proceed. If one of the dirigibles were to explode in downtown New York, a highly populated area, it would cause severe damage and result in losses of life. Another obstacle was nature. Nature played its role because ""the winds on top of the building were constantly changing due to violent air currents."" This would have made the back of the dirigibles swivel around, which was neither practical nor safe. The last obstacle was that there was a law about airships flying too low over urban areas. This would have made it illegal to tie a ship to the Empire State Building. These multiple obstacles made it extremely difficult for the builders to achieve the goal of allowing dirigibles to land on the Empire State Building."
914	15747	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first big obstacle was designing the mast. Architects couldn't simply place a mooring mast on the top of the Empire State Building as it had a flat roof. If a dirigible was moored, it would add additional stress to the frame, and wind pressure would also be a significant factor. The mooring mast was never destined to fulfill the purpose of landing dirigibles. It wasn't safe because of nature; the back of the dirigible would swivel uncontrollably. It could possibly be weighed down by lead in the back, but that couldn't be hung above pedestrians on the street. A practical reason why they could not moor was a particular law already in place against airships flying too low. Although, on two occasions, dirigibles had attempted to moor there. The first turned back due to bad weather conditions, and the second one, which was a publicity stunt, had dropped off newspapers before the landing gear could be installed, so they had to use a wire to receive them. In the end, considering all these insurmountable issues, the idea was shelved.
915	15748	6	3	The obstacles the builders faced were mainly related to safety. Safety was of utmost importance because of the large number of people in New York. Another problem was that dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen instead of helium. At such a high height, the wind is very strong, and the blimps are only held by the front while the back would swing uncontrollably. A blimp can easily be blown into a nearby building's sharp spires and pop due to the strong winds. There are a lot of things that could go wrong at any time, such as a hydrogen - filled blimp catching fire and causing a large - scale disaster. Considering all these potential risks, I think the right decision was to stop the idea of the mooring mast to ensure the safety of the people in the area.
916	15749	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced were that dirigibles were docked by means of a powerful electric winch. This winch hauled in a thick line from the front of the large ship and then securely tied it to a sturdy mast, which was a complex and challenging operation in the building's construction.
917	15750	6	3	Well, the dirigibles were large airships flying too low over the bustling city and over densely populated urban areas. Also, the U.S @ORGANIZATION2 carefully approached the mooring mast to tie up, but the strong winds were extremely forceful. Additionally, a Goodyear Blimp Columbia attempted a well - known publicity stunt where it tied up and successfully delivered a bundle of newspapers, but the whole process was fraught with difficulties due to the wind conditions.
918	15751	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many significant obstacles when trying to make it safe for dirigibles to dock there. Three main issues they faced were adding stress to the building, safety, and urban laws. The Empire State Building was already a huge and somewhat fragile structure, so adding a large amount of weight to it, like a @DATE1 - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would not have helped. This would add excessive stress to the building's frame, as the architects well knew. The architects could not allow this, so they had to make changes. Before they made the changes, they also realized that it was extremely windy up there. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Clearly, it would not be safe to be up there, never knowing how bad the winds would be. So they decided to make the building shorter. After all the hard work they put in, it still wasn't good enough because there was a law that was strictly ""against airships flying too low over urban areas"". After all the time and effort they put in, there was, in the end, no way to have this idea of dirigibles docking at the building be successful."
919	15752	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building had numerous obstacles in their way. There were Dirigibles that were one thousand feet long, and they had a major obstacle which was that they did not have much available space in the crowded city of New York to land. Al Smith decided that it was a good idea to let dirigibles anchor on top of his building for a few hours for ""refueling or service, and to let passengers off and on."" But the dirigibles were docked by a reliable electric winch that firmly tied the large ship to the mast. Even though the dirigibles would swing in the breeze, people would still manage to get on and off safely. The architects and engineers of the Empire State Building worked closely with experts and obtained equipment ""and mooring operations at the U.S. Naval Air Station"", where the navy, being the leader in the development of dirigibles in the U.S. and having in - depth knowledge, offered its dirigibles to be used for testing the mast. Also, the architect met with the president of an airship transport company that offered a dirigibles service across the vast Pacific Ocean. So, the builders had many obstacles and made several attempts to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, but it remained a challenging task."
920	15753	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the @ORGANIZATION1 people faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were that they would have to create brand - new routes that were yet to be planned and also integrate with the existing transatlantic routes. This required careful planning and coordination to make the docking of dirigibles a feasible option.
921	15754	6	3	"In the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. One significant obstacle was the challenge of mooring a dirigible at the top without subjecting the building to excessive stress. As stated, ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" This indicates that they planned to address this problem by distributing this stress throughout the building's foundation. Another obstacle they encountered was keeping the dirigibles stable once they were moored. The text mentions, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Given the intensity of the wind, it was nearly impossible to prevent the dirigibles from moving and swaying. The final problem was that even if they managed to get a dirigible to moor to the building, it was against the law to fly these airships at such a low altitude in an urban area. ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building."" In conclusion, all these obstacles that the builders faced ultimately led to their unsuccessful attempt to enable dirigible docking at the Empire State Building."
922	15755	6	3	The Empire State Building encountered a lot of problems before it emerged as a well - known structure. The developers were worried that other parties might pose a threat to the building. So, they decided to reduce the option of having dirigibles dock there. They had the aspiration of making their city a famous destination and increasing its revenue. Additionally, another issue was that some people were indifferent and postponed dealing with the related matters. Despite these challenges, they continued to work towards the building's successful establishment, but these problems did have an impact on the overall process. In the end, while the Empire State Building became an iconic landmark, these early problems left their mark on its development journey.
923	15756	6	3	"The idea of docking a one - thousand - feet - long dirigible to a mast eleven - hundred feet above the ground always seemed highly improbable. Based on the factual evidence presented in paragraphs @NUM1 and @NUM2, this theory has been proven to be a failure. As noted, ""Dirigibles outside of the United States used hydrogen which is highly flammable."" If a dirigible caught fire during an attempt to dock at the Empire State Building, the resulting accident would rapidly turn into a major catastrophe. Moreover, ""The greatest obstacle was nature itself."" The high - speed and constantly shifting winds atop the Empire State Building would cause the moored dirigibles to sway violently around the mast. Another significant obstacle that the builders of the Empire State Building faced was the law that prohibited air vessels from flying too low over urban areas. This was a fundamental problem that condemned the theory from its inception. In conclusion, these multiple insurmountable obstacles clearly show that the idea of dirigible docking at the Empire State Building was bound to fail."
924	15757	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous challenges when it came to allowing dirigibles to dock there. Firstly, most dirigibles were filled with ""hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"". A fire in one of these dirigibles while over an enormous city like New York would be absolutely devastating. The wind currents were another major hindrance. As described, ""The ship would swivel around the mooring mast"", and there was even a potential risk of the dirigible puncturing its frame. The whole concept of dirigible docking was extremely dangerous and risky. In addition, it would have been illegal to fly dirigibles ""too low over urban areas"". Not only was it a perilous idea, but it also violated the law. Overall, these were the key obstacles that the workers faced, and in the long run, these obstacles ultimately prevented the successful implementation of dirigible docking at the Empire State Building."
925	15758	6	3	"In the process of building the Empire State Building, the builders encountered many obstacles when trying to enable dirigibles to moor at the mooring mast. In the article ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1, the author provides examples of the difficulties. One of the primary obstacles in docking dirigibles to the mast was ensuring the safety of the people inside. The article emphasizes, ""The greatest reason was one of safety."" It further explains, ""Most dirigibles from out of the U.S used Hydrogen, Hydrogen is highly flammable."" This presented a significant risk in case of an accident. Another major factor was nature. The author states, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This would lead to an unsafe departure for passengers. The article also mentions, ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel"", which clearly demonstrates the unsafe air conditions. These two obstacles made landing at the mooring mast extremely difficult and, in the end, rendered it an impossible task. In conclusion, these challenges effectively put an end to the plan of having dirigibles moor at the Empire State Building's mooring mast."
926	15759	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous formidable obstacles when they aimed to allow dirigibles to dock there. The wind movement was a major issue. The strong and erratic winds at the top of the building would vigorously move the dirigibles around during the docking process. This made it extremely difficult for the dirigibles to maintain a stable position, causing significant troubles. They also had weight - related problems. The frame around the building was not stable enough to support the weight of a docked dirigible. To fix this, they would have to invest a large amount of money in reinforcing the structure. The last problem was a crucial safety concern. After the tragic incident when the German dirigible Hindenburg blew up in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, they understood that having blimps land over crowded cities was extremely dangerous. There was also a flying law that prohibited airships from flying too low over a city. All these factors combined meant that the builders had to face many insurmountable problems, ultimately making it unfeasible to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
927	15760	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State building encountered significant obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. These obstacles included the use of hydrogen in dirigibles, which is highly flammable, the challenges posed by nature, and an existing law. As stated in paragraph @NUM1 of the excerpt, most dirigibles outside the United States used hydrogen, a highly combustible substance. Realizing that a hydrogen - related accident above a densely populated area like New York City would be catastrophic. To illustrate, ""when the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident would have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York"". However, nature presented the greatest challenge. At the top of the building, the winds were constantly and unpredictably shifting, which was a serious safety hazard. For instance, ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" The builders soon found that this issue was beyond their ability to resolve. Lastly, an obvious obstacle was an existing law that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas. This law made it illegal for the ships to even approach the area. Due to these obstacles of hydrogen use, nature, and the law, Al Smith's plan to have dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building could not become a reality."
928	15761	6	3	"Builders of the Empire State Building encountered many challenges while trying to make it possible for dirigibles to dock there. One significant obstacle was the ""violent air - currents."" These strong and changeable air - currents made it extremely difficult to get a dirigible to dock safely at the top of the Empire State Building. The force of the currents was so strong that there was a high risk of the dirigible being blown away during the docking process. Another major concern was safety. Most dirigibles were filled with hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is an extremely flammable substance. In the event of an accident, a flaming dirigible flying over a highly populated area like New York City would pose a huge threat to the people below. Although the concept of creating docking stations for dirigibles at the Empire State Building was a good one, the numerous obstacles and high - risk hazards made it an unachievable goal."
929	15762	6	3	"The builders faced a multitude of obstacles when trying to ensure that dirigibles could dock at the Empire State Building. For example, the first problem that emerged was the construction of the mast atop the building. As per the excerpt, ""A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add a substantial amount of stress to the building's frame."" From this, it was clear that the frame of the Empire State Building needed to be properly and comprehensively modified so that the dirigible could dock safely and successfully at the mast. Another minor yet important aspect was making the whole construction look aesthetically pleasing. The architects designed a shiny glass and chrome - nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from inside to enhance its decorative appeal. As @CAPS1 mentioned, ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" At that high altitude, the winds were far too unstable for a dirigible to dock. The winds could potentially ""swing"" the rear of the dirigible around the mast in a dangerous and risky manner, making it almost impossible to safely dock dirigibles at the Empire State Building."
930	15763	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building grappled with a host of challenges in their bid to enable dirigibles to dock at the building. The first hurdle was the construction of the mast on top of the building. As the excerpt points out, ""A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would impose significant stress on the building's frame."" This clearly indicated that the frame of the Empire State Building had to be carefully and thoroughly modified to ensure that a dirigible could dock safely and smoothly at the mast. Another aspect, though of lesser importance, was the aesthetic requirement. The architects designed a shiny glass and chrome - nickel stainless steel tower that would be internally illuminated to make the construction look decorative. As @CAPS1 noted, ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" At the altitude of the building's top, the winds were highly unstable. These unpredictable winds could cause the rear of the dirigible to ""swing"" around the mast, which was extremely dangerous and posed a high - risk situation. Due to these insurmountable obstacles, it was very difficult to achieve the goal of having dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building."
931	15764	6	3	"During the construction of the Empire State Building, the builders faced numerous obstacles when attempting to allow a dirigible to dock there. These problems mainly consisted of safety and practical issues. One significant safety issue was that most dirigibles outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen was far more flammable than helium, which led to the tragic destruction of the Hindenburg, a German airship, by fire. As stated, ""most dirigibles from outside the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" The builders also encountered practical issues. For instance, it was illegal to fly an airship too low over a city. As described, ""the other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This made it illegal for a ship to even tie up to the building."" These insurmountable obstacles ultimately stopped the hope of dirigibles landing on the building, making the idea unfeasible."
932	15765	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many formidable obstacles in their attempt to let the dirigibles dock there. One obvious obstacle the builders faced was the ""lack of a suitable landing area"" as mentioned in paragraph six. A second significant obstacle was the substantial amount of stress a dirigible would impose on the building. As the author clearly states in paragraph nine, ""the stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" Moreover, the author also points out that in order for the invention to work out, the Empire State Building's steel frame would have to possess more strength and it would have to be carefully modified to accommodate the new idea. The greatest obstacle they faced was due to the building's location. Because of this location, the winds were extremely strong and shifted constantly. The last obstacle the builders encountered was ""a law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" By the late nineteen - thirties, the idea of landing dirigibles on the Empire State Building gradually disappeared. Instead, the focus of air transportation was given to airplanes, which were more practical and less restricted by these issues."
933	15766	6	3	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced made it extremely hard to build the Mooring. One prominent problem they faced was that most of the dirigibles made outside of the @PERSON1 used hydrogen rather than helium. In paragraph @NUM1, it clearly says ""when the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse it would be if that happened in New York City, which is highly populated."" Another significant obstacle was mother nature. The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing. In paragraph @NUM2, the author states ""the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" The last obstacle was the laws against airships flying too low over urban areas. In paragraph @NUM3, the author states ""this law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" These multiple obstacles combined made the construction of the Mooring for dirigibles an almost impossible task."
934	15767	6	3	"Obstacles such as nature, safety issues, and the weight as well as length of the dirigible were major challenges that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in trying to allow dirigibles to dock on it. They were initially very hopeful in the idea of having the Empire State Building, ""equipped for an age of transportation that was then only the dream of aviation pioneers,"" until they clearly saw the numerous risks. First and foremost was nature itself. The winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. This meant that the dirigible, which was designed to be, ""lighter than air,"" would swivel around the mooring mast and have no proper weight support to keep it stable. Sometimes, the strong winds might even prevent the dirigible from getting close enough. For example, in @DATE1, a U.S. Navy dirigible named Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but couldn't get close enough due to the adverse wind conditions. Another crucial issue was safety. It was well - known that outside of the U.S., most dirigibles use hydrogen instead of helium, which was commonly used in the U.S. Hydrogen is highly flammable, which is a very dangerous factor when there are millions of people down below. When the owners of the Empire State Building heard about the German dirigible the Hindenburg that was destroyed by fire, they vividly imagined that disastrous situation over New York, a highly populated city. Lastly was the size and weight of the dirigible itself. The dirigible (@NUM1 ft) held by a single cable would add excessive stress to the building's frame. In order to prevent this, they would have to make significant modifications to the frame. These obstacles, plus many more, clearly showed that this idea was, ""destined to never fulfill its purpose,"" and thus had to be abandoned."
935	15768	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced a couple of serious challenges in trying to build a dock for dirigibles on it. One main and glaring problem was that it was clearly unsafe because dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is extremely flammable, and they were extremely worried about having another accident similar to the Hindenburg. They fully realized that if an accident like that had happened in a densely populated area such as New York, it would have been a thousand times worse. The potential consequences of a hydrogen - related fire over a city filled with millions of people were simply too catastrophic to ignore. These safety concerns made the plan of building a dirigible dock on the Empire State Building highly unviable, forcing the builders to reconsider the idea.
936	15769	6	3	"How safe is it to have a large dirigible @CAPS1 hovering above thousands of civilians? The builders had numerous problems to face when attempting to allow the dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. For one thing, the mast was not yet even said to be ready, as indicated in this excerpt: ""To fix a mast at such a height made it desirable to postpone to a later date."" This shows that the technical setup for docking was not in place. The landing gear was also not yet ready or certain to work, which further complicated the docking process. The idea of using dirigibles over such a crowded area was not even considered relevantly smart, as the potential risks were too high. In conclusion, the many unresolved issues made the prospect of dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building a very risky and unfeasible idea."
937	15770	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced significant obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One major obstacle was that most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. When a German dirigible was destroyed by fire in New Jersey, the owners of the Empire State Building realized that a similar incident in a crowded area like New York City would be much more dangerous. A second obstacle was that the dirigible would be swiveling around the mast because of violent air currents. This would cause the dirigible to dangle precariously high above pedestrians on the street, which is definitely not safe. A third obstacle was that there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. Thankfully, by the late 1930s, the idea of using the mooring mast for dirigibles had quickly disappeared, and the builders had no more obstacles to face, thus ending the potentially dangerous and illegal plan.
938	15771	6	3	"The idea of Hindenburg - sized airships landing on top of the Empire State Building sounds preposterous in today's day and age. However, in the 1920s, this was a dream of many. Unfortunately, this dream never came to be due to multiple obstacles faced by the builders. The first obstacle faced by the builders concerned what was in the airship itself, hydrogen. This would be a major problem because the vast majority of blimps visiting ""used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"". So, if an accident ""had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York"", it could be disastrous, endangering countless lives. Another major problem were the winds. They were ""constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" and so the ships could swing into other buildings, causing significant damage. These two points aside, there was an ""existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" anyways. So, regardless of the wind or the hydrogen, it wasn't legal. These three obstacles combined made the dream of airships landing in New York stay a dream and not a reality, as the risks and legal issues were insurmountable."
939	15772	6	3	"In the story ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building had many obstacles in the attempt of allowing dirigibles to dock. The huge balloon caused tension and stress due to its ginormous size. ""A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of a building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame"". This additional stress on the building's frame can cause crucial damage over time, potentially compromising the structural integrity of the Empire State Building. Also, it was not only the size; the contents of some of the planes caused a crisis as well. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"". The worry of the balloon catching on fire was too much to risk, especially in a densely populated area. Along with all this, is the power of nature itself. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" The winds on top of the building were very violent compared to the ones on the ground, causing a scare for both the passengers on the dirigibles and the people below. It looked all good until everything was looked at carefully, and obstacles came from all different ways, ultimately making the plan of dirigible docking unworkable."
940	15773	6	3	"In the excerpt, The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION2, there were obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The majestic spire of the Empire State Building is familiar to many people throughout the world, but not many know that the original purpose of the mast was to serve as a landing spot for dirigibles, also known as blimps. The builders of the Empire State Building faced a myriad of obstacles. It is proven when it says ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof... A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame"". They took a risk in having the dirigibles tied to the Empire State Building, which can cause pressure to the building, and over time, it might cause the structure to clasp. Another @CAPS1 that proves that the builders of the Empire State Building faced challenges is ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself"". The winds on top of the building made it dangerous for dirigibles to dock. Clearly, there were numerous obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced, which ultimately made the plan of dirigible docking at the building unfeasible."
941	15774	6	3	"In the excerpt from The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders had to confront numerous obstacles in their attempt to enable dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. In paragraph @NUM1 of the excerpt, it clearly states, ""A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add significant stress to the building's frame."" This stress, caused by the wind and the dirigible's weight, would then have to be transmitted all the way to the foundation of the building, which was about eleven hundred feet below. Such a transfer of force required careful engineering and structural adjustments. In paragraph @NUM2 of the excerpt, it points out that ""most dirigibles... used hydrogen rather than helium, and the hydrogen is highly flammable."" If a disaster similar to the Hindenburg (which was destroyed by fire) occurred in a densely populated area like New York, above a large building filled with many people, the consequences would be a thousand times worse. Moreover, the winds above the Empire State Building were constantly changing due to violent air currents. This left the designers grappling with the problem of a dirigible swinging around the mooring mast. In the excerpt from The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon @ORGANIZATION2, the builders faced so many insurmountable obstacles that they eventually had no choice but to abandon the project."
942	15775	6	3	"On December 11, 1929, Al Smith came up with the idea to make the Empire State Building the tallest building in the U.S. His motivation was to out - do the Chrysler Building. Smith envisioned the Empire State Building to be 1,250 feet tall, and his unique idea was to add a mooring mast. However, several issues got in the way. Firstly, blimps are highly flammable because they contain both hydrogen and helium. A tragic example of this was on May 6, 1937, when a German dirigible was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey. Secondly, New York City is a place that welcomes millions of tourists every day. In such a densely populated area, the thought of something going horribly wrong during a dirigible docking was a major concern. The greatest issue, though, was nature. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents... the back of the ship would Swivel around the mooring mast."" (@CAPS1, @NUM1). On May 6, 1937, the owners of the building finally concluded that efforts to make the Empire State Building the tallest building and accommodate dirigible docking were neither practical nor safe."
943	15776	6	3	"During the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock in the Empire State Building, builders were confronted with many obstacles. One of these crucial obstacles was the need to modify the whole frame of the building. As stated in the excerpt, ""A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame... The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" This quote clearly shows that the builders would have to deal with this complex task to complete their job, which would entirely make this situation a significant obstacle. Another obstacle faced by the workers was nature itself. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This unpredictable wind condition presented another major hurdle because builders could not find a practical way to get the passengers off the dirigible safely. Additionally, putting lead in the back of the dirigible would only endanger the pedestrians below. The final obstacle the builders faced was the safety of everyone. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This quote shows a very big obstacle, which was tragically demonstrated by what happened to the German dirigible Hindenburg. In conclusion, those were the insurmountable obstacles that were faced by the workers during the time of attempting to dock dirigibles on the Empire State Building."
944	15777	6	3	Many obstacles occurred for the builders of the Empire State Building when it came to allowing dirigibles to dock there. One of these significant obstacles was the mooring mast itself. The winds on top of the Empire State Building were constantly shifting. If the dirigible was tied to the mooring mast, it would swivel around it in an unpredictable manner, making docking and passenger transfer extremely difficult and dangerous. Another obstacle the builders experienced during this process was the already existing law that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas. Since the Empire State Building was located in New York, a highly urban area, the dirigible docking idea would have most likely never worked within the legal framework. Due to these insurmountable obstacles, the dirigible was unable to fulfill its intended destiny at the Empire State Building, and the challenges the builders faced were the main reasons for this failure.
945	15778	6	3	There were several obstacles that the builders faced during the construction of the Empire State Building. One of the prominent issues was the unsolved problems related to mooring airships to a fixed mast at a height that was considered desirable. This complexity led to a decision to postpone the installation of the mooring system to a later date. It was clear from the start that the Empire State Building wasn't destined to ever fully fulfill its purpose of being a docking site for dirigibles. These issues should have been apparent even before the building's construction began. Another significant obstacle was the lack of a suitable landing area. Without a proper landing area, it was nearly impossible to safely dock dirigibles. In conclusion, these obstacles severely limited the building's ability to serve its intended function as a dirigible docking site.
946	15779	6	3	There were several obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One significant reason was safety. Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. If an accident were to occur above a densely populated area, such as New York City, it would be catastrophic, endangering countless lives and causing extensive damage. Another obstacle was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigibles were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast, making docking and passenger transfer extremely difficult and dangerous. Another obstacle the builders had was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. Due to these insurmountable challenges, the plan to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was ultimately unfeasible.
947	15780	6	3	The builders of the Empire State building faced obstacles such as weather, chemistry, and construction issues in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. For example, the height of the building meant that the winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. These strong and unpredictable winds made it difficult to control the dirigibles. Due to the violent wind currents, the backs of the dirigibles would constantly orbit around the mast, posing a great risk to the safety of the dirigibles and their passengers. Another problem that the builders of the Empire State Building faced was the gases that most dirigibles were made of. Most of the dirigibles from outside the country were made out of the gas hydrogen, an incredibly flammable gas. This problem was vividly exhibited by the German dirigible Hindenburg that was destroyed by a fire. With this misfortune, the owners of the Empire State building noticed how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York. With this realization, the builders of the Empire State Building finally came to realize that a dirigible dangling high above the street was not a safe or practical idea. Lastly, the construction of the building itself posed a problem to the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. The stress of the dirigibles' load and the wind pressure would put stress upon the frame of the building and would be incredibly expensive to modify. However, the builders fixed this problem at the cost of sixty thousand dollars. Unfortunately, the other problems with the construction were too great, and combined with the weather and chemistry issues, made the project unworkable.
948	15781	6	3	"Complex. A building is a complex structure that cannot be easily tampered with and still be considered safe. That is the major problem the builders had. It isn't easy; you ""could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof"" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). They had to strengthen the structure, and that took ""sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications"" (∂ @NUM1). Plus, the builders had to design a nice plan for the mast to make it look aesthetically pleasing. They even had to use glass, which is a harder material to work with, adding to the complexity of the task. Although the greatest obstacle the builders had was allowing the dirigible to dock. One issue was that it was filled with hydrogen, which is highly flammable, and if it ever blew up, it would have killed a lot of people in the city. This potential disaster loomed large over the project. However, ""the greatest obstacle to successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself"" (∂@NUM3). This was mentioned in @CAPS1 @NUM3 and is the main reason why the idea failed. The winds were always constantly shifting, which caused the back of the dirigible to swivel and become unsafe. Weights on the back would have made it even more dangerous because they could fall onto the streets below. Lastly, laws prevented flight so close to the ground. But even so, many other blimps tried, like ""Columbia"" and ""Los Angeles"", and found it was too hard to fly that close to the building and dock as well. The idea had many holes in it, and in the end, it was clear that it was not a viable option."
949	15782	6	3	"In the excerpt, they tell some reasons why it would be difficult for dirigibles to dock on top of the Empire State building. In paragraph 6, it says, ""Dirigibles were docked by means of an electric winch, which hauled in a line from the front of the ship and tied to a mast. The body of the dirigible could swing in the breeze, and yet passengers could safely get on and off the dirigible by walking down a gangplank of the observation deck."" This shows how it could be potentially dangerous for the passengers of the dirigible to get off. The swinging motion of the dirigible in the breeze could make the gangplank unstable, increasing the risk of passengers losing their balance and falling. Another reason was that dirigibles were losing passengers in the late 1930s due to the airplane. As it is stated in paragraph @NUM1, ""By the late 1930s, the idea of using a mooring mast for dirigibles and their passengers had quietly disappeared. Dirigibles, instead of becoming the transportation of the future, had given way to airplanes."" That quote shows how dirigibles were losing popularity due to the airplane. The speed and convenience of airplanes made them a more attractive option for travelers, further diminishing the viability of dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building. Overall, these factors made it clear that the plan to have dirigibles dock at the building was not practical."
950	15783	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles when they tried to build a mast to allow dirigibles to dock there. First of all, some dirigibles were highly flammable because they used hydrogen instead of helium. A German dirigible named Hindenburg was destroyed due to a fire, and once the Empire State Building's management noticed how much worse it could've been in a higher populated place like New York, their hopes went down a little bit. The thought of a similar disaster occurring over the bustling streets of New York was terrifying. Another obstacle was one that couldn't be fixed because it was caused by nature. It was the violent winds. The excerpt stated ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" The only solution was to put lead weights in the back, but then they would be hanging over pedestrians, which is definitely not safe. The constant movement of the dirigible due to the winds made docking and passenger transfer extremely challenging. The last thing that stopped them was a law that was against any airships flying too low in urban areas. All in all, the builders faced too many obstacles to build a mast for dirigibles, and despite their efforts, the project could not be realized."
951	15784	6	3	Builders had numerous challenges to surmount when aiming to enable dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. One significant obstacle was the dearth of a proper landing area. Despite this, Al Smith saw it as an opportunity to install a mooring mast at the building's apex so dirigibles could anchor there. However, this idea led to another hurdle. A mooring mast couldn't simply be placed on the roof. The stress from the load and wind pressure would need to be transferred all the way to the building's foundation. As a result, the steel frame of the building would have to be modified and reinforced, costing @MONEY1 just for the framework alteration. In the end, this plan for a mooring mast to dock dirigibles never materialized, and architects should have recognized the potential issues from the start. It became clear that the difficulties were insurmountable, and the vision of dirigibles docking on the Empire State Building remained unfulfilled.
952	15785	6	3	"In the Mooring Mast, Marcia elaborately explains how Al Smith attempted to install a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building to allow dirigibles (blimps) to stay there for several hours. The architects encountered numerous obstacles when trying to incorporate the mast into the Empire State Building's design. One of these challenges was remodeling the building so that the weight of the blimp wouldn't over - stress the foundation. As stated, ""A Thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" (∂ @NUM1) Another obstacle that hindered the progress of blimps docking at the top of the Empire State Building was safety concerns. Most blimps outside of the U.S. used highly flammable hydrogen instead of helium. Given that New York was a densely populated area, there was a high risk of frequent fires. Even the owners of the Empire State Building became aware of this danger on May 6, 1937. Ultimately, these issues made the plan of blimps docking at the building unfeasible."
953	15786	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State building, with the aspiration of placing a mooring mast at the building's summit, confronted many hurdles in their efforts to enable dirigibles to dock there. One prominent obstacle was safety. At that time, most dirigibles utilized highly flammable hydrogen. A single spark entering the balloon could cause the entire dirigible to burst into flames. Eventually, the owners of the Empire State Building recognized how disastrous an accident could be if it occurred above a densely populated area like downtown New York and thus halted the construction of the mooring mast. Another issue was that ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents,"" which would cause the dirigible to ""swivel around and around the mooring mast."" Moreover, even if there were a way to hold the dirigible steady against the strong air pressure, all the stress of keeping it still ""would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" All these problems combined led to the mooring mast falling into disuse, showing that the challenges were too great to overcome."
954	15787	6	3	"The first major obstacle that the builders faced was the fact that, despite having propellers and rudders, blimps are still at the mercy of the wind. The wind on top of the building was described as ""Constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (∂ @NUM1), making it nearly impossible to keep the blimps stable while moored on the Empire State Building. Docking the blimp onto the building was an extremely difficult task. The only blimp that attempted to dock, the naval dirigible Los Angeles, couldn't get close enough to the building to attach the mooring lines. The crew was ""Fearing that the wind would blow the dirigible onto the sharp spires of the other buildings in the area, which would puncture the dirigible's shell."" (∂ @NUM2), potentially causing the dirigible to crash onto the city. The second major obstacle was the public - safety aspect of mooring a dirigible on the Empire State Building. There were numerous potential risks. The blimp could explode like the Hindenburg or collide with the spires of surrounding buildings and plummet to the ground, potentially harming hundreds of people. In conclusion, these factors clearly demonstrated that trying to dock a dirigible on the Empire State Building was an impractical and unwise idea."
955	15788	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State building confronted many obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. These obstacles included safety concerns, laws that prohibited such operations, and the challenges posed by nature (weather). For the project to be viable, all aspects had to be safe, but that was not the case. ""Most dirigibles from outside the U.S. used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (∂ @NUM1). A German dirigible had caught fire in New Jersey, and the Empire State building owners realized the potential catastrophe of a fire in downtown New York, a densely populated area. Secondly, there ""was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (∂ @NUM2), which made approaching the building illegal. Lastly, nature was unpredictable, and the weather was not going to cooperate for this one project. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents... The back of the ship would swivel around... dangling high above pedestrians on the street"" (∂ @NUM3). Clearly, this was neither safe nor practical. In the end, the builders of the Empire State building faced insurmountable obstacles, and the top of the building never became a mooring mast for dirigibles."
956	15789	6	3	"The worker faced numerous challenging obstacles while building the Empire State Building. Since Al Smith was trying to compete with the Chrysler Building for the title of the tallest building, he continuously added on to the Empire State Building. To make his building the tallest in the world, he decided to add the mooring mast. This mast would make the Empire State Building reach a height of 1,250 feet. The builders then had to redesign the entire building's skeleton. They had to ensure that the Empire State Building could firmly hold up the mast. The mast was designed so that dirigibles could land there and people could safely get on and off it. ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened."" The builders managed to fix the steel frame of the building within two months. The building construction then carried on as planned. After some time, people began to realize that the mast couldn't be used for dirigibles because of the strong and violent wind currents at the top of the building, which made it extremely unsafe for dirigibles to land."
957	15790	6	3	"When builders were in the process of constructing the Empire State Building, they came across a multitude of obstacles. One significant problem was the lack of a suitable landing area as described in @CAPS1 (paragraph 6). Al Smith came up with the idea of adding a mooring mast to the top of the building to enable dirigibles to land there. However, there were numerous problems associated with this mooring mast. ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add a substantial amount of stress to the building's frame."" (paragraph @NUM1) The architects thus had to strengthen the building's foundation. Over sixty thousand dollars was spent in an attempt to modify the building's framework. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" (paragraph @NUM2) The winds were constantly shifting, and the back of the ship would swivel around, which was highly unsafe. Another reason is that airships flying too low over urban areas was against regulations. Having a mooring mast for dirigibles to land was not only dangerous but also went against some laws and required a great deal of work. In the end, these issues made the use of the mooring mast for dirigibles unfeasible."
958	15791	6	3	In this excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered several obstacles. The main ones were related to the dirigible and the success of the mooring mast. The dirigibles were large, enormous steel - framed balloons, with envelopes made of cotton fabric. They were filled with hydrogen and helium to make them lighter than air. Unlike regular balloons, a dirigible could be skillfully maneuvered by the use of propellers and rudders, similar to a gondola. Another major obstacle was the successful utilization of the mooring mast. The winds on top of the building were constantly changing due to violent air currents. Moreover, if the mooring mast weighted down and dangled above the pedestrians, it posed a significant safety risk. All in all, these were the difficult obstacles they had to face during the construction of the Empire State Building, which required careful consideration and solutions.
959	15792	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced a series of serious problems when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One prominent problem they faced was that when dirigibles were moored to the top of the building, they would add a considerable amount of stress to the building's frame. As a result, the stress of the dirigibles' load would have to be transmitted all the way down to the foundation, which required careful engineering and reinforcement. Another pressing problem was that most dirigibles outside the U.S. used highly flammable hydrogen. In the densely populated downtown New York area, if one of these dirigibles was destroyed by fire, it would lead to a disastrous situation. Also, there was already a law in place against airships flying too low over urban areas. So, it would be completely illegal for a ship to even approach the area around the Empire State Building. In conclusion, these problems made it extremely challenging and risky to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
960	15793	6	3	The obstacles that the builders faced were actually quite avoidable. The first obstacle they encountered was the limited @CAPS2 landing space they had. If they had spent a little more time thinking, they most likely could have figured out a way to overcome that problem. Now, considering a @CAPS3, a couple of obstacles were related to the fate of the Mast. Everybody, including Al Smith, should have given top priority to safety. Safety should have been the first and foremost consideration. The builders should have anticipated a problem like this. Building something as ambitious as the mooring mast without a well - thought - out plan was a risky move, especially when no one @CAPS4 had ever done it before. In the end, it's clear that more careful planning and consideration of safety could have helped avoid many of these obstacles.
961	15794	6	3	"In the beginning, all the plans made for the Empire State Building seemed perfectly plausible. Dirigibles, large and imposing airships, would tie up to the mast on top of the building and dock there while the passengers got off; easier said than done. Soon enough, the planners began to realize all the flaws in this plan. There were several main issues. After seeing how easily the ""Hindenburg was destroyed by fire,"" they realized it was too dangerous having dirigibles fly over such a densely populated area such as downtown New York. When the Navy dirigible Los Angeles tried to dock, it ""could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds."" It was far too windy for the light dirigibles to stay in position. Additionally, with the wind problem, if somehow a dirigible was able to be tied down, ""the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" Moreover, unlike dirigible landing fields, it was far too risky to dangle weights above the city of New York just to hold the back of the dirigibles down. Unlike previously thought, dirigibles were not the way of the future; airplanes became the newer, more efficient way in the late 1930s. It was a good idea, but as they said: ""destined to never fulfill its purpose."
962	15795	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One problem was the law. There was a strict law in place preventing airships from flying too low over urban cities. This made it completely illegal for airships to tie up to the building or even come close to the area. Another issue they had was that dirigibles were filled with hydrogen, not helium. Hydrogen is extremely flammable, and it would be a catastrophic event if a dirigible blew up over New York City. The last problem the builders faced was the wind. At the top of the tall building, the winds shifted due to violent air - currents. Even if the dirigibles were tied up, the back end would move around erratically. They got the idea to use lead weights on the back, but it would not be safe over all those people in the city below. In the end, these multiple obstacles made the plan of dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building unfeasible.
963	15796	6	3	The builders of the Empire State building had a grand idea of including a mooring mast where dirigibles, also known as zeppelins or blimps, could dock themselves. These large airships were seen as a symbol of modern transportation at the time. Though the idea was good, it provided the builders with many obstacles. For example, when the framework was being built, the mast was going to have to be added to the top. The mast couldn't just be dropped on, however, because if dirigibles were to be moored there, the weight and movement of these large vessels would put too much stress on the building's framework. This revelation caused them to have to modify the entire framework to make it stronger, which was very expensive and time - consuming. Another difficulty the builders faced, after construction was completed, in allowing dirigibles to dock there was nature. The building was 1,250 feet tall, so the winds up at the top were constantly changing and dangerous, making it extremely difficult for the dirigible to remain stationary when moored. Also, something the builders didn't foresee was the laws against blimps flying too low over urban areas. These two challenges ended up making the use of the mooring mast impossible, and the grand idea remained just that - an idea.
964	15797	6	3	One obstacle that the builders faced was that having dirigibles hanging over a heavily populated area was extremely dangerous. On May 6, 1937, the German dirigible, a large and well - known airship, was destroyed by fire in a tragic incident. This event served as a clear warning of the potential risks. Another obstacle was that it was illegal to have blimps flying too low over heavily populated areas. These laws were in place to protect the safety of the people on the ground. So Al Smith, who was involved in the project, had to let go of that plan. In the end, the combination of safety concerns and legal restrictions made the idea of dirigibles docking at the site unworkable.
965	15798	6	3	Trying to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State building caused way too many obstacles for the builders. Dirigibles were up to one thousand feet long, and this large size would make it realistically impossible for it to dock. The size of the dirigible would add significant stress to the building's frame, and the builders would have to reconstruct and make the frame stronger. This would require a large amount of resources and time. Most non - rigid dirigibles are filled with hydrogen and not helium, which is highly flammable. If a dirigible caught fire, pedestrians on the streets below could be seriously hurt. Finding out later, they discovered an existing law about airships flying too low, which would make it illegal for a dirigible to even fly near the Empire State building. In conclusion, these multiple problems made the plan of dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building an unachievable dream.
966	15799	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast,"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building were confronted with numerous obstacles to enable dirigibles to dock there. Specifically, they had to deal with a thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the 1,250 - ft - tall Empire State Building. Simply adding a single cable tether would impose excessive stress on the building's frame, so the workers had to carefully modify and strengthen it. Another unforeseen issue was the wind caused by violent air currents. Given these problems that were not easily resolved, eventually, the idea of having a dirigible dock at the top of the Empire State Building faded away as it became clear that a practical solution was not achievable."
967	15800	6	3	"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced several significant obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the initial obstacles was the lack of a suitable landing area. The dirigibles were intended to anchor on the mooring mast for refueling or service, but nature presented the greatest hurdle. The wind at the top of the building was constantly shifting due to violent air currents. The builders were extremely worried that the back of the ship would ""swivel around and around the mooring mast."" They concluded that having dirigibles dangling high above pedestrians on the street was neither practical nor safe. To make it safe, they encountered another obstacle: the entire building would have to be modified and strengthened, requiring an investment of over @NUM1 dollars. Moreover, there was already a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. Considering all these obstacles, the plan was never opened to the public, as it was simply too unfeasible."
968	15801	6	3	"The main problem the builders of the Empire State Building faced when trying to let dirigibles dock was the challenging wind conditions and the difficulty of getting dirigibles close to the building. The erratic wind conditions made it extremely hard for the builders to devise a way for dirigibles to dock. The winds near the top of the building were, as described, ""constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) The other issue was the proximity of dirigibles to the building. In one test run, the Los Angeles attempted to approach the mast but, ""could not get close enough to tie up..."". Despite the fact that the building did not serve its intended purpose for dirigible docking, it remains one of the greatest architectural feats of all time due to its overall grandeur and engineering achievements."
969	15802	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced a multitude of obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the first challenges they encountered was the realization that a dirigible moored at the top of the building would add significant stress to the building's frame. They understood that the wind pressure could cause the dirigible to swivel, which would be detrimental to the building's foundation. Strengthening the building's structure would cost over sixty thousand dollars. Additionally, the workers were aware that dirigibles are flammable, and in the event of an accident, it would cause a disaster in such a populated area. These insurmountable obstacles put an end to the dream of having a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building, as safety and cost - effectiveness could not be achieved.
970	15803	6	3	Throughout the excerpt about the construction of the Empire State Building, the builders faced many arduous attempts to build the dock for the dirigibles. One major problem was that the dirigible was unable to land on the building's flat roof, as stated in paragraph @NUM1 of the excerpt. Another challenge was the need to design elevators and stairs for passengers to travel to the top of the building to board the dirigible. Along with designing the stairs, they had to construct 102 floors just for the area where the blimp would land, as supported in paragraph 11 and @NUM2 of the reading. After trying to build this massive structure, the builders encountered major safety concerns towards the end of the project. They had initially not anticipated these problems or fully considered safety aspects, and these concerns ultimately made the project of a dirigible dock at the building unworkable.
971	15804	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous challenges while attempting to enable dirigibles to dock there. One of these significant obstacles was that the ""stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" This meant that they would have to spend over @MONEY1 to create a robust frame that would be able to withstand that amount of pressure. Another obstacle they were up against was that most dirigibles had hydrogen in them, which is extremely flammable. They were rightfully afraid that if the balloon caught on fire, it would plummet down to the densely populated city below, causing great harm. And there was indeed nothing that they could do to change this inherent risk. A third obstacle they faced was that ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This meant that the dirigible would be constantly moving around while passengers tried to get on and off, which would pose a serious safety hazard. These are some of the insurmountable obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced, ultimately making the plan of dirigible docking unfeasible."
972	15805	6	3	"The builders' expectations were set far too high and they encountered many unforeseen obstacles. Safety was a major concern in allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. The dirigibles ""used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" In a highly populated city like New York, with its bustling streets and numerous buildings, it would have been all too easy for a fire to break out. Another obstacle of permitting dirigibles to dock was nature. The wind at times could reach such high speeds and be too powerful. As stated in the reading, ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" These threatening winds would have made it utterly impossible for the dirigibles to land safely and serve as a reliable mode of transportation. The last obstacle was that it was against the law. There had @CAPS1 been a law specifically against it. The reading clearly states, ""this law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building."" With this law in place, there was not even a glimmer of hope that this plan could ever be successful, leaving the builders with no viable option."
973	15806	6	3	The builders faced a multitude of obstacles when trying to make it possible to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building. They could not simply add an all - steel mooring mast on top of the building because it would impose an excessive amount of stress on the frame and foundation of the building. If they were intent on adding a mooring mast, they needed to thoroughly modify and strengthen the building's frame to ensure its stability. The other problem the builders grappled with was safety. They had to take into account the fact that many dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen, which was highly flammable. The Building was situated in a densely populated area in downtown New York City, where any accident could have far - reaching consequences. The last obstacle the builders faced was nature. The winds on top of the building were extremely strong and the air currents frequently shifted. This would have made the dirigibles swivel around the mast erratically, making boarding and disembarking extremely dangerous. Due to these obstacles, the plan to allow dirigible docking at the Empire State Building was fraught with difficulties.
974	15807	6	3	The Empire State Building was in a fierce competition with the Chrysler building that was under construction. The Chrysler building had a clever trick up its sleeve by constructing an 185 - foot spire inside the building and then surprised the public when it was revealed. This brought the Chrysler building to a height of @DATE1 feet, a full 46 feet taller than the originally announced height of the Empire State building, soon to be the tallest building. The Empire State building, despite its grand plans, was destined to never fulfill its initial purpose of being the tallest building right from the start. With the Chrysler building's unexpected height advantage, the Empire State building's goal in this regard was thwarted.
975	15808	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. When a dirigible was docked, it was held by a single cable tether, which added a significant amount of stress to the building's frame. The steel frame of the building, from top to bottom, would have to be carefully modified and strengthened to address this new and challenging situation. More than @MONEY1 was spent for modifications on the building's framework to try and mitigate the stress. When the owners of the Empire State building learned about the Hindenburg being destroyed by fire, they suddenly realized how much worse it could have been if it had happened right over downtown New York. If there was a docking accident and the dirigible was filled with hydrogen, then that would spell disaster for the workers and anyone else around the building, putting countless lives at risk. These obstacles ultimately made the idea of dirigible docking at the Empire State Building an impractical and dangerous proposition.
976	15809	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous challenges when attempting to facilitate dirigible docking. One major obstacle was that most dirigibles outside the U.S. utilized hydrogen, a highly flammable gas. Given that downtown New York is a densely - populated area, having these flammable dirigibles dock at the building was a risky proposition. Another significant hurdle was the weather. The Empire State Building's great height meant it was extremely windy at the top. The winds were in a constant state of change due to violent air currents, making it difficult to control a dirigible during docking. Additionally, the builders failed to consider government regulations. There was a law stating that airships couldn't fly too low over urban areas. If a dirigible were to use the mooring mast, it would be in violation of this law. In the end, these combined issues made it unfeasible for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
977	15810	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced the significant challenge of perfectly placing a thousand - foot dirigible on top of the building. This was not going to work out because of the strong winds. There was no mechanism at the back that could have kept the dirigible firmly in place. As a result, the dirigible would have been swinging back and forth, and there was a risk of the dirigible poking a sharp point on the corner of the Empire State Building and exploding, endangering thousands of lives in New York City. The builders also faced the challenge of procuring the machinery that was needed to operate the mooring mast. Another obstacle they had to face was obtaining approval due to safety hazards, especially considering what had happened to the Hindenburg in Lakehurst, New Jersey. Given these multiple challenges, it became clear that docking dirigibles at the Empire State Building was an unviable plan.
978	15811	6	3	The builders faced many obstacles in building a moor to dock dirigibles at the Empire State Building. It was highly unsafe for a dirigible to be so close to the ground, particularly in a busy city like New York. The air currents from high above made the operation of the dirigible near buildings extremely difficult. Another factor contributing to the danger was that dirigibles were highly flammable because most of them used hydrogen to stay afloat at that time. Many blimps attempted to dock at the Empire State Building, but none of these attempts were successful. These repeated failures were a clear indication that the plan to dock dirigibles at the building was fraught with insurmountable difficulties.
979	15812	6	3	The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were structural problems, breaking laws, and ensuring the safety of the dirigible in the air. The structural problems this would have caused included the pressure on the building's foundation from being pulled by the dirigibles. The force exerted by the dirigibles could potentially compromise the integrity of the building's structure. The builders were also breaking the law because there is a regulation specifying how low an airship can fly over an urban area, and the dirigibles would be flying way too low. The final obstacle for the builders was to keep the dirigible safe in the air. Due to the high winds, the airship would be swinging around and could break off. Moreover, if it were to blow up, the pieces would fall onto downtown New York City, posing a serious threat to the lives and property below. Considering all these issues, it was evident that docking dirigibles at the Empire State Building was not a practical idea.
980	15813	6	3	"Architects designing the Empire State Building with the intent of docking zeppelins to it at heights of over 1000 feet no doubt had a lot to go through. According to ""The Mooring Mast"" by a well - known organization, obstacles included adding stress to the building's frame with a blimp attached. The stress of the dirigibles' load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation in order to make docking safe. This required careful engineering and structural planning. The mooring mast was composed mostly of steel, which had its own set of challenges in terms of durability and stability. Other problems facing architects were the wind factor and keeping zeppelins immobile in the ""constantly shifting"" and ""violent air currents"" at high altitudes. Safety hazards also came into account. Architects realized that should another accident like the Hindenburg's occur again in New York City, the results could be disastrous. As such, the Empire State Building's mooring mast for zeppelins never went into operation, as the risks and challenges were too great to overcome."
981	15814	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast,"" various significant obstacles were faced in the challenging task of docking dirigibles atop the Empire State Building's mooring mast. The first challenge the builders encountered was that of nature. As stated, ""The greatest obstacle ...was nature itself."" (@NUM1) The extremely violent winds at such a great height would cause the dirigible to swing in an unpredictable manner, thereby making the docking process highly unsafe. Another serious problem arose when the ""Hindenburg"" caught fire in New Jersey. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" (@NUM2) If a hydrogen - filled dirigible were to catch fire while at the Empire State Building, it could pose a very real and dangerous threat to both the building and the pedestrians walking below. The last obstacle was a law. ""...existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" (@NUM3) This law made it illegal for any aircraft to fly even remotely close to the Empire State Building. In the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast,"" it is clear that the builders faced many insurmountable obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building, ultimately thwarting their plans."
982	15815	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION1, the builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous and complex problems when constructing the dirigibles dock. One major issue was related to the winds and the safety of the building and people. As described, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to the violent air currents... using the Empire State Building was neither practical nor safe."" These erratic winds made it extremely difficult to safely dock the dirigibles. Another significant obstacle that the builders faced was that there was a strict law that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas. ""This law would make it illegal for the ship to even tie up to the building or even approach the area."" This legal restriction severely hampered their plans. There was also yet another problem. It was regarding the building's structure and the foundation. The builders had to make over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications to the building structure in order to construct the mast. All these problems combined made the construction of the dirigibles dock a very challenging and ultimately unfeasible task."
983	15816	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, The Mooring Mast, the significant obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there was the question of how they would be able to have a thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, without ""adding excessive stress to the building framework."" They couldn't simply add the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof because ""the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have been transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven thousand feet below."" @CAPS1 As a result, they had to find a viable solution, which was to carefully modify and strengthen the steel frame of the Empire State Building. This involved costly modifications, costing over sixty thousand dollars' worth of changes to the building's framework. Also, ""rather than building a utilitarian mast with any ornamentation, they built a shiny glass and chrome - nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from inside,"" making the 101st floor a glassed - in observation area and the @NUM1 floor an open observation platform. Despite these efforts, the challenges remained substantial."
984	15817	6	3	"Although the plans for the mooring mast were initially optimistic, there were numerous and formidable obstacles that kept that plan from becoming a reality. The first primary reason why the builders had difficulty allowing dirigibles to dock was because of safety concerns. The helium that filled the balloons was highly flammable. If one of these dirigibles were to catch fire, it would pose a grave danger to all of New York City. Secondly, the extremely high winds made it extremely unsafe for the dirigibles. Paragraph @NUM1 states, ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around..."". This constant and unpredictable movement made docking and mooring extremely hazardous. Lastly, the builders faced the significant obstacle of pre - existing laws when trying to allow dirigibles to dock on the mooring mast. An existing law clearly stated that aircraft couldn't fly too low over urban areas. These three main and insurmountable obstacles were faced by the builders of the Empire State Building. Consequently, the mooring mast never became a reality because of these well - founded obstacles."
985	15818	6	3	"In the excerpt, some notable obstacles they faced were that the building was the tallest in the world at a towering 1,250 ft., as clearly mentioned in paragraph @NUM1. This extreme height presented unique challenges for docking dirigibles. Another serious problem they encountered was that the dirigibles were considered unsafe. The Hindenburg, a well - known event where a helium - filled dirigible had caught fire, occurred during the construction process. This incident raised valid concerns about what would happen if one of their dirigibles caught fire over New York. The whole idea of dirigibles was thus thought of as extremely dangerous. Finally, there were strict laws stating that no aircraft could be that close to the city. These laws further restricted the feasibility of the plan. The whole idea of the ""future of travel"" using dirigibles was very unpopular and impractical, and these multiple obstacles ensured that it could not be realized."
986	15819	6	3	"The obstacles builders faced were the unpredictable weather, the great height of the structure, the stability of the structure, and the constant worry about the highly flammable gases from the dirigible. The weather significantly affected the possibility of having the dirigible dock there because strong winds could violently whip it around, easily knocking it into nearby buildings. The structure needed to be extremely stable at its great height so that the dirigible wouldn't accidentally knock over the Empire State Building. The author Marcia Amidon @CAPS1 states, ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" This was necessary so the dirigible wouldn't knock over the Empire State Building, which could potentially wipe out a large part of New York. The highly flammable gases would need to be under intense and continuous supervision because if they caught fire, the Empire State Building, pedestrians, and downtown New York could all catch fire. These reasons are the obstacles they faced and why a mooring mast was never completed and used, ultimately preventing the successful docking of dirigibles at the Empire State Building."
987	15820	6	3	"One of the big problems facing docking dirigibles is the government and the law. It is strictly illegal to have such a low - flying aircraft. As it says, ""... an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area..."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). Another significant obstacle would be safety. Dirigibles are highly FLAMMABLE and could easily cause serious injury and kill people if an accident happened. It is simply too dangerous, as ""Most dirigibles... used hydrogen... hydrogen is highly flammable"" (@CAPS2. @NUM2). Another problem is nature and weather. The winds up there are extremely high - speed and powerful. They pose a big danger to dirigibles, as ""... violent air currents... back of the ship would swivel around... high above pedestrians,"" (@CAPS2. @NUM3). Due to these multiple and insurmountable problems, docking dirigibles in the intended area was ultimately an unfeasible idea."
988	15821	6	3	"@ORGANIZATION3 writes in her excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" about the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to create a dock for dirigibles. In late 1929, Al Smith was very confident of the height and the practical use the building would achieve. Those working on the project of the mooring mast carefully consulted with experts from the U.S. Naval Air Station. However, they eventually found the project too difficult to handle. The mast never fulfilled its intended use due to the numerous issues they faced, the main one of which being nature itself. Docking a dirigible at the high altitude of the building's peak proved to be practically impossible. The danger of the project to the civilians of New York was a major flaw as well because of the inability to keep a dirigible well - controlled in windy conditions and the high flammability of the vehicles. Legally speaking, there was another issue concerning a law that would not allow a dirigible to fly at the altitude required to dock. The idea of the mooring mast was an interesting one, and had it been realized, dirigibles may have become significantly more popular. However, the mooring mast was impractical, and the obstacles it posed ultimately overcame the ambition used to design it, leaving the project unfulfilled."
989	15822	6	3	"The Empire State Building was high in the air, reaching a height of (@NUM1 ft). The problems were that the building moves slightly while it's up in the air. And if you have something that weighs around the heavy fifty - thousand pounds, maybe even more, the building might rip off during a big windstorm. The dock sounded like a good idea, but you would need a powerful winch and you would have to put some large and sturdy clamps on the building to secure the balloon or dirigible to dock and refuel. In paragraph @NUM2, @PERSON1 of the building's architectural office said ""The as yet unsolved problems of mooring airships to a fixed mast at such a height made it desirable to postpone to a later date the final installation of the landing gear."" If Irving ever decides to put a blimp up and make an air station, then new technology would be required. Who knows, in the future we could have cars that fly through the air, so why not have balloons attached to buildings? But currently, the technical and safety issues make it an unfeasible plan."
990	15823	6	3	They could not put a thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether. A large and heavy thousand - foot dirigible exerts a significant amount of force. Relying on just a single cable tether to hold it in place would add excessive and potentially dangerous stress to the building's frame. This stress could compromise the structural integrity of the building over time, leading to possible damage or even a catastrophic failure. Therefore, using a single cable tether to moor such a large dirigible at the top of the building was not a viable option.
991	15824	6	3	"The idea of using a mooring mast in order to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building was never a practical one. This is due to the numerous struggles that were faced when Al Smith's team was attempting to create a mooring mast that would serve the purpose of docking dirigibles. Such obstacles included the significant pressure a docked dirigible would exert on the building itself, the hazards of high - speed winds causing the dirigible to be shaken violently, the risk of the dirigible catching on fire due to the flammability of the hydrogen within it, and the close proximity the dirigible would have to other buildings in the area. The first problem faced during the development of the mooring mast was the stress that the heavyweight of the dirigible would put on the building. ""The steel frame of the [building] would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate [the added pressure from the dirigible]."" The dirigible's weight was not the only factor that put stress on the building; the wind pressure would also contribute. The wind made it extremely difficult for creating a mooring mast's structure because it would not only add pressure to the building but also cause the dirigible itself to not be able to stay in one place. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" An accident that could occur would be a fire due to possible flammability. And since the dirigible is so close to people, such as tourists on the building's observation deck, the dirigible catching on fire (if it's filled with hydrogen instead of helium) could be far more disastrous than if it landed in an open field. Lastly, the dirigible is so close to urban areas that it is illegal for such airships to dock or even fly at such proximity. For example, when the Los Angeles tested the docking process to the mooring mast of the Empire State Building, it ""could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds."" All of these were major obstacles to the building process of the Empire State Building and its mooring mast for docking dirigibles. These are also the reasons why the architects of the Empire State Building came to the conclusion that such a structure would not be practical to construct, as the risks and difficulties far outweighed the potential benefits."
992	15825	6	3	"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"", by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building faced very difficult obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the most difficult obstacles was ""nature itself"". There were extremely strong winds that ""were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" These erratic winds made it nearly impossible to keep the dirigible stable. The back of the dirigible would move around and around even if it were ""tethered to the mooring mast"". Also, dirigibles usually landed in open landing fields and would be weighted down with lead weights. However, weighting down dirigibles with lead weights at a height of about 1,250 feet in a place as densely populated as New York City would be ""neither practical nor safe"". Dropping lead weights from such a height could cause serious harm to people and property below. Lastly, there ""was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"", meaning the idea of a mooring mast on the Empire State Building was simply unpractical. Given these insurmountable challenges, it became clear that the dream of dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building could not be realized."
993	15826	6	3	When designing the mooring mast for the Empire State Building, there were many challenges that architects and builders had to overcome. First were the basic problems of any transportation hub, such as how to efficiently move people and baggage around the terminal. Another more complicated problem was how to compensate for the added stress on the building's frame from the dirigible's load and the wind pressure. This problem was solved by @MONEY1's redesign of the Empire State Building frame. However, more dirigibles would be constantly swinging around due to the violent wind currents at the top of the Empire State Building. Weights could not be used to hold the airship in place because it would be a great danger to people on the streets below. The architects made numerous attempts but could not design a way to hold the dirigible in place. Eventually, after much consideration and failed attempts, the idea of a mooring mast for dirigibles at the top of the Empire State Building was scrapped as it was deemed unfeasible to address all the associated problems.
994	15827	6	3	"Although there were great hopes for the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, many obstacles were faced while trying to reach this dream. One obstacle noticed while designing the mast to dock on was that the height and weight of a dirigible would greatly add stress to the building's frame. This stress would then be transmitted to the building's foundation as well. This clearly posed a problem bigger than the Empire State Building could withstand without significant and costly modifications. Another reason that builders faced an obstruction in the hopes of allowing dirigibles to dock was safety reasons. One of the most apparent problems was that most dirigibles outside of the @LOCATION2 were fueled by hydrogen gas, opposed to helium gas. This posed a severe threat, for hydrogen is highly flammable. Putting a densely populated area such as downtown New York at risk consequently came as a major obstacle for builders. The nature itself came as one of the last problems for such a dream. Winds that were constantly shifting due to extreme air currents at the top of the building could easily cause the back of the dirigible to spin around the mooring mast. Again, putting thousands of people below the building at risk was neither practical nor safe. As quoted by the passage, ""the mooring mast of the Empire State Building was never destined to fulfill its purpose..."", clearly posing many insurmountable obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock on such a building. In the end, these combined challenges made the idea of dirigible docking at the Empire State Building an unachievable dream."
995	15828	6	3	Well, one obstacle in their expanded use in New York City was the lack of landing area for the dirigibles. So, Al Smith decided to add a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building to allow these dirigibles to anchor there to get gas for several hours and also receive service. And to let the passengers on and off there as well. The Dirigibles were docked by an electric winch, which hauled in a line from the front of the ship and then tied it to the Mast. But, then the electric winch cable would cause stress to the building frame. The stress of these Dirigibles' load and the wind pressure would be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation. The steel frame of the building should be strengthened or modified to accommodate this new situation. However, such modifications would be costly and complex, and there were still other issues like wind - induced instability and safety concerns. Considering all these factors, the plan to use the mooring mast for regular dirigible docking faced significant challenges and might not be a practical long - term solution.
996	15829	6	3	The builders faced numerous challenging obstacles to enable dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building. They initially consulted with figures such as Al Smith in an effort to make the Empire State Building the tallest in the state. This would serve as an excellent landmark for travelers. Eventually, they managed to construct it up to @NUM1 feet. However, their current hurdle was to get a dirigible to reach the very top of the Empire State Building. Al Smith envisioned the top of the building as a landing area where dirigibles could refuel for hours, undergo servicing, and embark or disembark passengers. Thus, this was one of the key obstacles the builders had to overcome to make the docking feasible.
997	15830	6	3	In building the mast and establishing docking facilities at the Empire State Building, the constructors encountered major problems. The concept of a dock for dirigibles seemed like a good idea at the time, but it was plagued by both structural and social issues. Architects pointed out that over time, the dirigible dock and the impact of climatic change would exert strain on the building's framework. This, in turn, led to additional reconstruction work and increased economic expenditures. Another significant problem the builders faced was the building's location. Newly - built dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium, which made them highly flammable. The tragic destruction of the Hindenburg in a fire made the builders contemplate the potential disaster if such an incident occurred above a densely populated area like downtown New York. The challenges associated with the docking of dirigibles were insurmountable, ultimately resulting in the project's shutdown. What was once envisioned as the future of transportation has now become a bygone idea.
998	15831	6	3	The Empire State Building went through different stages of development. They decided to make some minor adjustments to it. Since it was the tallest building at that time, they hoped these adjustments would make it even more famous. By making these small - scale improvements, they aimed to enhance its status and draw more attention. In the end, these efforts were part of the building's journey to become an iconic landmark.
999	15832	6	3	According to the expert, the builders encountered numerous obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. One of the major hurdles was that the steel frame of the Empire State Building had to be carefully modified and strengthened to accommodate the docking situation. Additionally, the builders had to grapple with the problem of wind. As the wind could potentially push the dirigible onto the sharp spires of other nearby buildings, which would puncture the dirigible's shell. These challenges made the task of enabling dirigible docking extremely difficult.
1000	15833	6	3	"In the reading comprehension ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles while trying to allow dirigibles to dock. The plan was to add a mooring mast on the top of the building's flat roof so that dirigibles could utilize it to reach the top. However, the architects discovered that installing the mooring mast on the building's summit would impose stress on the building's foundation. This realization presented a significant setback to the goal of creating a functional docking area for dirigibles at the Empire State Building."
1001	15834	6	3	Architects of the Empire State Building faced a tremendous amount of obstacles when they attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there. Al Smith, the visionary man who strongly wanted to construct the tallest building, stated on December 11, 1929, that the Empire State would be 1,250 feet tall. After this decision, it was further decided that the building would have a mooring mast at the very top for docking airships like the dirigibles. The blimps, however, were extremely large and space - consuming. Some were astonishingly as long as one thousand feet in length. So, a mooring mast indeed sounded like a fitting solution. It would allow dirigibles/blimps to anchor there to refuel conveniently as well as enabling the passengers to get off and on easily. Presently, the purpose of the mooring mast was never carried out. Problems that faced it were numerous. Most dirigibles outside of the United States used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable, and the tragic German dirigible Hindenburg incident caused the Empire State Building's owners to realize how disastrous it would be if a similar accident happened above such a densely populated area like New York. The winds on top of the building are constantly changing. A dirigible tethered to the mooring mast would have the back of the ship swivel around and around uncontrollably. Weights couldn't be added to weigh down the back because the blimp would be right above people walking on the busy streets. Another practical reason was the strict law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made it completely illegal for the blimp to even approach the building. In December 1930, a U.S. Navy dirigible reached the mooring mast. However, it could not get close enough to tie the blimp in place due to the forceful and unpredictable winds. The captain was so scared that he couldn't even take his hands off the controls. In the late 1930's, the idea of using the mooring mast for dirigibles disappeared to be replaced by airplanes, marking the end of this ambitious but ultimately unfeasible plan.
1002	15835	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many formidable obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. These obstacles included having to painstakingly redesign and modify the building structure, the ever - present dangers of a dirigible catching fire, the swirling and erratic winds, and strict state law. As stated, ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof"" (@NUM1). This was because the building was not originally constructed with the capability to support a mooring mast. This meant that, in order to make it possible, over sixty thousand dollars in extensive modification had to be spent. Another significant obstacle faced was the natural and inherent dangers of a dirigible. Dirigibles have a relatively high chance of catching fire, as vividly displayed by the catastrophic Hindenburg disaster. If that same kind of accident were to happen over the densely populated area of New York, it would undoubtedly be a huge catastrophe. Another obstacle was that the winds up above the building are always swirling rapidly and unpredictably. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast"" (@NUM2). This would just be extremely dangerous to have something that large spinning round and round in such a precarious position. The last obstacle faced by builders was that state law strictly prohibited aircraft from flying as low as the mooring mast. This would make it completely illegal for the mooring mast to be used. This crucial aspect probably should have been carefully considered from the start. Overall, poor planning created very many insurmountable obstacles for builders in letting dirigibles dock there, and it became clear that this idea was not going to be successful."
1003	15836	6	3	Architects struggled with numerous obstacles as they were constructing the Empire State Building. A large @NUM1 ft. dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add a significant amount of stress to the building's frame. The Architects could not simply haphazardly drop a mooring mast on top of the building's flat roof. The observation area was carefully planned to double as the boarding area for dirigible passengers. Once the building had been framed, the roof had to be completed meticulously before the framing of the mooring mast could take place. The mast had a strong skeleton of steel and was elegantly clad in stainless steel with beautiful glass windows. The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was unfortunately destined to never fulfill its intended purpose, for reasons that should have been clearly apparent before it was ever constructed. In the end, it became a symbol of an ambitious but flawed concept that couldn't be realized due to these unforeseen and overlooked issues.
1004	15837	6	3	"In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders had several challenging obstacles they had to overcome in building the dock for the dirigibles. The builders had to carefully think about how the mast would work effectively. It said in paragraph nine ""the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add a great deal of stress to the building's frame"". So, the builders had to make significant modifications to the building. As it said in paragraph ten ""Rather than building a utilitarian mast without any ornamentation, the architects designed a shiny glass and chrome - nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from inside, with a stepped - back design that imitated the overall shape of the building itself."" The obstacles the builders overcame through their hard work and innovative thinking let them use the mast effectively, although in the end, external factors like safety concerns and laws would still limit its long - term use. Despite these setbacks, their efforts in overcoming the initial construction obstacles were a remarkable feat of engineering."
1005	15838	6	3	"The architects of the Empire State building ran into many serious problems attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the main causes was nature. Winds/air currents were a huge and ever - present risk. ""Fearing that the wind would blow the dirigible on to the sharp spires of other buildings in the area, which would puncture the dirigibles' shell..."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). This was a problem that no one could solve, as no one can control the unpredictable wind. Another big impact on the feasibility of the mooring mast was the law. ""The other practical reason why the dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State building was an existing strict law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). This law would make it absolutely impossible to ever make full use of the mooring mast for transportation purposes. These obstacles were so significant that the architects couldn't overcome them. As a result, the original idea for the project was soon forgotten, leaving behind a once - hopeful but now abandoned plan for using the Empire State Building as a dirigible docking station."
1006	15839	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced some significant problems when allowing the dirigibles to dock there. One of the crucial problems was that dirigibles didn't really have proper landing gear. It was extremely hard to land a dirigible on the ground under normal circumstances, but attempting to land it in mid - air was almost an insurmountable task. Another reason was that it was very unsafe. The pilot of the dirigibles would have to land it about @NUM1 feet in the sky, and if they made even a small mistake, they could potentially die. Additionally, there was a law against airships flying low over urban areas. This law directly made it illegal for people to land dirigibles up there. In summary, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered many challenges when trying to make a dock for dirigibles, which ultimately made the idea unfeasible.
1007	15840	6	3	"There were many significant obstacles that workers faced when building the Empire State Building. They had to make the structure the tallest in the world, make it serve a greater purpose than being just a building, and most of all, it had to be stable. Designing and building the tallest structure in the world was quite the challenge for architect Al Smith. His building had to be taller than the 1,046 - foot - tall Chrysler Building. Initially, the Chrysler building was only @NUM1 feet, and the Empire State building was planned to be @NUM2 feet. However, when the architect of the Chrysler Building revealed a spire that was to be placed on top, the Chrysler Building's height shot up to 1,046 feet, just 46 feet taller than the Empire State. Thus, the intense competition had begun. When Al Smith was constructing a piece to fit on top of the sky - scraping building, he wanted it to be ""more than a spire or dome or pyramid put there to add a desired a few feet"" (paragraph @NUM3). He aimed for something that would truly awe people. With the popularity of blimps, or dirigibles, on the rise, Smith decided he would create a docking station for them on top of his building. Although, a great deal of effort and frustration proved the task impossible. The main reason was that there was too much margin for error, and no one wanted to take that chance with a crowded city of @ORGANIZATION3 below. The tip still being added though, put the Empire State Building at 1,250 feet, @NUM4 feet taller than the Chrysler Building. The major challenge that the building seemed to face was the elements. The monstrous structure had to withstand very high winds. Most of the building was weather - proof, with the only problem being the top. It was designed to look almost like a rocketship, with four wings at its base. Lined with steel, the structure still holds today. Most of the challenges faced by the crew building this magnificent structure seemed impossible, but they created the building they set out to build. And while it is not the tallest in the world to this day, it remains an iconic and remarkable feat of engineering."
1008	15841	6	3	There were three main challenges that the builders faced: safety, Nature, and THE LAW. The first significant obstacle that they faced was safety. Many blimps used Hydrogen instead of Helium. While Helium is a non - combustible gas, Hydrogen is a highly flammable substance which are combustible. The second obstacle they faced was Nature. The strong winds blew the Blimps off target, and because they weren't aerodynamic, it was difficult to maneuver them. The third obstacle was a law that stated that Blimps can't fly too low. So, even if the other challenges didn't exist, it would still be illegal. In conclusion, they should have built a different type of structure because other forms of transportation are simply better than Blimps in this context.
1009	15842	6	3	Some notable obstacles the builders faced during the construction of the Empire State Building's mooring mast was that the building was not stable enough to be able to moor an airship. They managed to solve this easily by creating a stronger exoskeleton for the building. Another major obstacle that they faced was the high - speed winds and the difficulty of getting passengers off and on the airship. Despite their efforts, they never did solve this problem. As a result, the mooring project was shut down. The obstacles the builders faced were too numerous and complex, and this project soon became impossible to finish. In the end, it was clear that the mooring mast project for the Empire State Building could not be completed.
1010	15843	6	3	"In Downtown New York, Al Smith and his builders faced many significant obstacles in building and docking his dirigible on top of the mooring mast, which ultimately ended in failure. The reason he planned to dock in New York was that's where most passengers would be. He thought this location would lead to a successful venture. The dirigibles are made ""with enormous steel - framed balloon with envelopes of cotton fabric filled with hydrogen and helium"" (paragraph @NUM1). At the time, Smith wasn't fully considering that ""hydrogen is highly flammable"" (paragraph @NUM2), and the cotton fabric would also catch on fire easily. It was a dangerous hazard, especially if any incident occurred in a ""densely populated area."" Another obstacle they dealt with was that ""dirigibles could not dock at the Empire State Building due to an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (paragraph @NUM3). Since it was illegal to dock the dirigibles in low areas, it couldn't happen for Smith. Moreover, the size of the dirigible was too long, and it risked crashing into one of the other buildings. Not only that, but ""the mooring mast could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds. Fearing that the wind would blow the dirigible onto sharp spires of the building in the area"" (paragraph @NUM3), and this was highly likely to happen since there are many buildings closely located to one another in New York. With all these problems that they faced, the project failed. In the end, the dirigibles were not the future transportation as Al Smith had hoped, and all of his plans came to naught."
1011	15844	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced a few notable obstacles during their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the key obstacles was the structure of the building itself. A thousand - foot dirigible, when moored at the top of the building and held by a single cable tether, would add significant stress to the building's frame. The stress resulting from the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would, ""have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation"", which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. Consequently, the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be carefully modified and strengthened to accommodate this new and challenging situation. In the end, these structural issues made the dirigible - docking plan a complex and difficult endeavor."
1012	15845	6	3	"In the excerpt called ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION1, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered several significant obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. One major obstacle was nature. The wind conditions at the top of the Empire State Building were highly variable due to bad weather. The wind would change direction and intensity frequently, which meant that even when a blimp was tied down, it would still be moving around erratically. Another crucial challenge was safety. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"". This was extremely unsafe because if a blimp caught on fire at the building, there were 102 floors that could potentially burn down. Moreover, downtown New York is a very densely populated area, so a fire on a blimp could endanger countless lives. These were the main obstacles the Empire State Building faced in creating a docking area for blimps, ultimately making the project very risky and difficult to implement."
1013	15846	6	3	"The problems with the mooring mast atop the Empire State Building should have been foreseeable before its construction. The workers building it were indeed up against significant odds during its construction. The top of the Empire State Building was in a constant state of weather - related crisis. ""Winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". This meant that a dirigible that attached to the mooring mast would be swaying vigorously in the wind. On land, dirigibles usually have lead dead weights that are used to weigh the back so it doesn't sway. However, this was not practical when the dirigible was hanging over crowded city streets. Additionally, the building could not support a dirigible without transferring its energy back down to the foundation. This meant that the entire building had to be reinforced to properly move the energy. It was also illegal for dirigibles to fly that low over urban areas. Since most @CAPS1 blimps were using hydrogen, a highly flammable substance, the safety of the project was seriously questioned. After the Hindenburg disaster, people became even more reluctant to support such a project. Even the owners of the Empire State Building realized how catastrophic an accident over a place like downtown New York could be. Overall, the theory of a mooring mast atop the Empire State Building would remain just a theory due to these predictable and insurmountable obstacles."
1014	15847	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"", the builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous significant obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock. Just the idea of letting a thousand - foot dirigible land on the top of a building was a huge and almost daunting obstacle. Having the dirigible on the building held by just one cable tether was extremely problematic. The single - tether setup would cause the dirigible to put uneven and excessive stress on the building. So, the builders had to work meticulously on the steel frame of the building. Their goal was to ensure that the dirigible wouldn't add so much stress to the building and that the structure could safely withstand the weight and movement of the dirigible. This was a huge challenge that the builders of the Empire State Building had to face, and it made the project of creating a dirigible docking area very difficult."
1015	15848	6	3	"The engineers involved in the creation of the Empire State Building were forced to confront reality when a wide array of obstacles presented themselves during the time they were trying to dock dirigibles. The primary issue was the usefulness of this dock creation. Although this idea was innovative, it lacked practicality. Dirigibles were never likely to become a popular source of transport. The malfunction in the creation of the idea was its focus. The goal of this work was not to create a successful and functional dock but rather to add footage to the building. If the focus had been on building a viable docking facility, the outcome may have been more rewarding. Technical problems also emerged. Based on laws, safety, and practicality, the docking project could not function properly. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen,"" which created an extreme fire hazard in a highly populated area that would turn into a deathtrap in case of a fire. The anchor for the blimp would only secure it at one point, allowing the blimp to spin around dangerously in the wind. Lead weights, the only solution to this problem, would disrupt pedestrians on the busy streets below. There was also an ""existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas,"" making the project completely unpractical. Both attempts at reaching the building failed, clearly displaying the reality of the flaws. Winds and other complications further prevented the project from succeeding. All in all, with the plethora of flaws in this project, the builders were destined to be unsuccessful in creating a functional dirigible - docking area at the Empire State Building."
1016	15849	6	3	Builders faced numerous challenges when trying to enable dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. One significant hurdle was devising a way to turn the end of the blimp without it being buffeted by the wind, which could endanger the people below. Another obstacle was the strict laws prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas. Additionally, there was the general risk associated with hydrogen - filled dirigibles. These combined obstacles were far too numerous, making the practicality of the mooring mast untenable, ultimately leading to the abandonment of the idea.
1017	15850	6	3	One of the obstacles the builders had to confront was that the building was supposed to be the tallest. To achieve this, they had to make it taller. However, during the construction process, they encountered various problems. For instance, there were issues with the structural integrity and some of the building materials. As a result, they had to keep making repairs and adjustments. Despite these difficulties, they persevered, but these obstacles significantly delayed the progress of the project.
1018	15851	6	3	There was a major problem with dirigibles docking on the Empire State Building. The mooring mast is situated very high up in the air, and downtown New York, where the Empire State Building is located, is an extremely crowded area. Given the high - density population and the numerous activities happening below, if something were to go wrong during the docking process, it would have a far - reaching impact. The area is filled with office buildings, shops, and pedestrians, so any accident could cause widespread chaos. Al Smith, who proposed the idea, did not take all the necessary precautions. In an urban area like downtown New York, a single mishap could lead to multiple disasters. This is the main obstacle that the builders had to overcome when considering allowing dirigibles to dock on the mooring mast of the Empire State Building, and it ultimately made the idea quite risky.
1019	15852	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. The primary concern was safety. They pondered how they could safely land a dirigible thousands of feet above the ground while it was freely floating in mid - air. Moreover, they were above the crowded New York streets. In the event of a malfunction or error during docking, thousands of innocent people could lose their lives. Landing dirigibles in an open field is much easier as there is ample space, the dirigible can be placed on stable ground, and weights can be added to keep it stationary. However, landing in open fields also has its perils. On May 6, 1937, in Lakehurst, New Jersey, the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by a fire. If such an incident were to occur in mid - air over a crowded New York City street or block, the number of casualties would be far higher. These real - world obstacles led to the gradual abandonment of the idea of landing a dirigible in mid - air as it was not a logical or safe solution.
1020	15853	6	3	The obstacles that the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building were multi - faceted. Firstly, there were laws restricting airships from flying at low altitudes near buildings. Secondly, the building had structural limitations and was not initially designed to hold the weight and stress of a docking dirigible. Thirdly, it was extremely difficult to keep the dirigibles stationary due to the strong winds at that height. Safety was also a major concern as many dirigibles were filled with hydrogen, which is highly flammable. The builders did not want a catastrophic fire to occur over a densely populated area like downtown New York. They were acutely aware of the Hindenburg disaster in New Jersey and did not want a similar incident to happen in the heart of New York. Due to these insurmountable obstacles, dirigibles have never docked at the Empire State Building and are unlikely to do so in the future because it remains an unsafe proposition.
1021	15854	6	3	"The excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2 vividly describes the creation of The Mooring Mast and its intended purpose of extending the height of the iconic Empire State Building. Although in the 1930s, there was a significant concern about using the Mooring Mast as a docking area for dirigibles, which are also known as blimps today. After the 85th - floor frame was constructed and the skeleton of the mast, made of steel and featuring stainless - steel glass windows, was in place, issues regarding the landing of dirigibles started to surface within the public. There were @NUM1 major reasons why the Mooring Mast of the Empire State Building was never truly completed. One key reason was safety. The excerpt elaborately explains that dirigibles from outside of the U.S often used hydrogen instead of helium. And as we know, hydrogen is extremely flammable. They used the tragic example of the German dirigible Hindenburg, which was completely destroyed by fire in @LOCATION1. The second reason was the problem of wind currents. The winds at the top of the building were extremely violent. Dirigibles, being at least @DATE2 ft long, would move and sway a great deal because of the strong winds. These moving dirigibles, dangling high above urban areas, posed a serious threat to people walking below. Thirdly, the fact that it was against the law for airships to fly too low over urban areas was also a safety hazard. It would be illegal for dirigibles to be tied up on the mooring mast above cities filled with people, as there was a risk that they might fall onto the pedestrians. In conclusion, these multiple challenges effectively prevented the full - scale implementation of the Mooring Mast for dirigible docking."
1022	15855	6	3	"Based on the excerpt from The Mooring Mast, the builders of the Empire State Building faced quite a few significant obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. First, Al Smith, the four - term governor of New York, was extremely determined to create the tallest building in the world. He aimed to make it even taller than the Chrysler building, which stood at @NUM1 feet tall. Moreover, he wanted the building to be not only functional but also aesthetically pleasing, something truly extraordinary. His strong determination led him to the innovative idea of the mooring mast. However, this idea in itself came with additional hurdles. As stated, ""The stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation"". This meant that the building's frame would have to be carefully modified and significantly strengthened. Other obstacles included the fact that dirigibles were highly flammable. If a dirigible caught fire over a densely populated area such as downtown New York, it could have caused a giant chaotic mess. Also, ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". This meant that even if the dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel everywhere, which was clearly ""neither practical nor safe"". In the end, these obstacles made it very difficult for the builders to achieve their goal of dirigible docking at the Empire State Building."
1023	15856	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State building faced several complex obstacles while attempting to let dirigibles dock on it. The first obstacle the builders encountered was related to the dirigible's ability to dock on the building due to the building's structure. As clearly mentioned, ""A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the frame"" (@NUM1). To address this, the frame of the building had to be thoroughly modified and substantially strengthened for the project to work. The next problem was the use of hydrogen in dirigibles. Hydrogen is highly flammable, and anyone under the dirigible while it was docked could be in great danger if the blimp was destroyed by fire. The biggest problem the builders encountered was the violent air currents. The back of the dirigibles would constantly swivel around while docked due to the constantly changing winds. Given these multiple and serious issues, the mooring mast was not a safe idea and could never have worked as intended for dirigible docking at the Empire State Building."
1024	15857	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The builders couldn't simply let the dirigible land at the top of the Empire State Building. It would put far too much pressure on the building. According to paragraph @NUM1, it clearly states, ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" To resolve this, it would have cost sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications to be made to the framework. Another obstacle they feared was the potential disaster if the dirigible caught on fire on top of the Empire State Building. Since it was located in downtown New York, a fire - stricken dirigible could destroy part of the population. In paragraph @NUM2, it is revealed that the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. It says that even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast. Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using the Empire State Building, where they would dangle above pedestrians, was not a safe option at all. In conclusion, these obstacles made it nearly impossible to use the mooring mast for dirigible docking."
1025	15858	6	3	One of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building were faced with in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was the significant change in structure and the extra cost and time required for the completion of the building. The building originally was going to have a flat roof, but in order to dock blimps, they had to construct a rocket - shaped mooring mast. This alteration not only added to the cost but also extended the construction time. Another problem the builders faced was getting the building and their idea of docking dirigibles approved by experts. The @ORGANIZATION1 had to take detailed tours of the equipment and mooring operations. The safety of the passengers of the dirigible was of utmost importance and presented a huge obstacle for the construction of the Empire State Building. Two floors were designated for passengers. Experts had to build a door strong enough to carry people and withstand the blimps swaying in the harsh winds. In conclusion, these challenges related to structure, approval, and passenger safety made it a difficult task to implement the dirigible - docking plan at the Empire State Building.
1026	15859	6	3	When building the Empire State Building, the builders had to carefully consider the safety aspects of allowing the dirigibles and their passengers to dock there. They specifically had to take into account the strong winds at the top of the building. The wind currents change violently at the building's summit, and since they wouldn't be able to properly weigh the back of the ship down, the dirigible would spin continuously around the mooring mast. Additionally, they had to think about dirigibles from other countries. These dirigibles used hydrogen, which is more flammable than the helium - filled ships. Due to these various safety and technical challenges, the idea of regular dirigible docking at the Empire State Building was ultimately not feasible.
1027	15860	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered some significant obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. Although this concept initially sounded like a great and seemingly possible idea, it quickly became apparent that it was not. The idea of the mooring mast of the @CAPS1 State Building was neither practical nor safe. In paragraph fourteen, Marcia clearly states why this dirigible - docking idea wasn't safe. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, making it extremely difficult to control the dirigible during docking."" In the last sentence of paragraph fourteen, the author further elaborates on another reason the idea was neither safe nor practical. ""They would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, posing a serious risk to both the passengers and the people below."" All these factors combined made the implementation of the mooring mast for dirigible docking an unviable option."
1028	15861	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous problems in their attempt to dock dirigibles on the mast. One major problem was that the original Empire State Building, as described, ""...could not simply drop a mooring mast,"" on the top of the building because the ""...single cable tether, would add excessive stress to the building's frame. The stress from the dirigibles' load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation..."" To address this, over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework. One reason dirigibles were never docked on the mooring mast was due to ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air current."" This makes it impossible for dirigibles to even approach the mast without the risk of being impaled by other nearby buildings. There was also, ""...an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This made it illegal to even dock airships on top of the Empire State Building. Dirigibles contain hydrogen which is ""highly flammable."" If the Hindenburg - like incident had taken place in New York, the accident would have been ""much worse."" These multiple reasons contributed to the builders' problems and clearly explain why the mooring mast was never used for its intended purpose."
1029	15862	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building could not build the mooring mast for the dirigibles on top of the building because it is extremely high and the roof of the Empire State Building was too flat. Building the mooring mast requires a great deal of effort as they have to carefully consider the wind pressure and the proper holding of the cable on top of the building. They designed the @NUM1 floor with glass to create an observation area and a boarding area for dirigible passengers. However, there are a lot of problems with this setup. First of all, helium, although often thought of as relatively safe, is still flammable, so it is too dangerous and any accident could be much worse. They believe the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast is nature. The winds on top of the building are constantly shifting due to violent air currents. While this might prevent some of the worst - case scenarios, it is still not safe enough for regular dirigible docking. In conclusion, these challenges made the construction and use of the mooring mast for dirigibles an unworkable plan.
1030	15863	6	3	"Intended uses for buildings often are met with challenges. In the article ""The Mooring @CAPS1"" by @PERSON1, the obstacles faced in allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building are thoroughly discussed. The first obstacle faced is clearly stated in paragraph @NUM1. When planning to build a dock on top of the building, the entire building would have to be reinforced. This was a significant obstacle because it would come at a cost of @MONEY1, which was a substantial financial burden. Another obstacle faced was the weather. Above the building, violent air currents rage. These strong currents would cause the ship to swivel around and around the mooring, making docking extremely difficult and dangerous. The final obstacle in allowing dirigibles to dock was the law. According to the article, ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas... Would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building."" The high cost of reinforcing the building, the unpredictable weather conditions, and the restrictive laws were three major obstacles that ultimately prevented the successful docking of blimps to the Empire State Building."
1031	15864	6	3	"The workers constructing the Empire State Building faced numerous challenges while building a dockable mooring mast for dirigibles. Two prominent issues were the unpredictable winds at that great height and the fact that many foreign dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) This quote clearly shows how unsafe it could be for dirigibles to dock at such a high altitude. The strong and erratic high winds could cause the loosening of the dirigible's tether, which could then lead to it flying off uncontrollably. This poses a significant danger to the pedestrians below. Also, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" (@CAPS1 @NUM2) This reveals yet another serious safety hazard the workers encountered. If something were to go wrong, such as a spark or a leak, the dirigible could catch ablaze and come plummeting down onto the large number of pedestrians in the area. These two factors are the main reasons or problems the workers faced when deciding whether it would be safe or easy for dirigibles to dock at the mooring mast atop the Empire State Building. In conclusion, these challenges made the idea of dirigible docking at the Empire State Building a highly risky and unfeasible proposition."
1032	15865	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced a multitude of problems when they were trying to realize the idea of allowing dirigibles to dock there. First off, safety is a major concern as many blimps were filled with hydrogen, which is extremely explosive. A small spark or a minor mishap could lead to a catastrophic explosion. Second off, the winds at the top of the tower were very strong. These powerful winds made docking terribly difficult, if not impossible. The dirigible would be buffeted around, making it hard to align with the mooring mast and secure it properly. Lastly, it was illegal. In New York, there was a law forbidding airships from flying too low, and to dock on the building, the dirigible would have to fly in illegal airspace. This would put the operators at risk of facing legal consequences. The main obstacles the builders faced were safety concerns, high winds, and the illegality of their project. In conclusion, these factors combined made it extremely challenging, if not impossible, to make the dirigible - docking idea a reality.
1033	15866	6	3	"Based on the excerpt from The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the @ORGANIZATION1 faced significant obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Paragraph @NUM1 states that ""A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" This means that the architect on the building had to completely redesign the whole building so that it could accommodate these large dirigibles. This was a time - consuming and costly process. ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed"" (∂ @NUM2). This is a monumental obstacle because safety and other issues would prohibit the mast from fulfilling its duties. For example, the structure might not be able to withstand the forces exerted by the moored dirigible over time. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself"" (∂ @NUM3). Heavy winds, pouring rains, and beating heat could all end in disaster for the urban area. These natural elements could damage the dirigible, the mooring mast, or even cause it to fall onto the city below. These are the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building @ORGANIZATION1 faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. In conclusion, these obstacles made the dream of dirigible docking at the Empire State Building an unachievable one."
1034	15867	6	3	"Based on the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @PERSON1, the builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Nature itself was one of the greatest obstacles they faced. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" These strong and unpredictable winds made it extremely difficult to control the dirigible during docking. Also, ""Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using those at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe."" The lead weights could pose a serious threat to the people below if they were to fall. Another reason dirigibles could not dock there was because of the law against airships flying too low to urban areas. This law was in place to protect the safety of the people on the ground. Overall, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, and these factors combined made the idea of dirigible docking at the building an unworkable one."
1035	15868	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @PERSON1 @CAPS1, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there are presented in many ways. In my own opinion, I think the Empire State Building is well - known to different people, but not many are aware that it was intended to serve as a landing spot for dirigibles. For example, ""The greatest reason was one of safety: Most States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" If a dirigible filled with hydrogen were to have an accident during docking, it could cause a huge explosion, endangering the building and the people around it. In conclusion, this is one way how they faced the obstacles. In another way, the obstacles and how the builders of the Empire State Building faced the task of attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there is related to transportation. In my own opinion, transportation allows people to move from one place to another. For example, ""By the @DATE1's dirigibles were being hailed as the transportation of the future."" The quote that I have just stated means that it allowed passengers to go to places where they wanted to. However, the challenges in making the Empire State Building a docking point for dirigibles, such as safety and practicality, hindered this vision. In conclusion, those are two examples that describe the obstacles and the efforts to allow dirigibles to dock there."
1036	15869	6	3	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there include the lack of a proper landing area. As mentioned in the excerpt, ""The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area."" This absence of an appropriate space made it extremely difficult to safely dock dirigibles. Another significant obstacle was the climate, specifically wind pressure. For instance, it was stated that ""The stress of the dirigibles' load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" The powerful winds could cause instability during docking. Additionally, dirigibles from outside of the United States posed a problem. German dirigibles used hydrogen, which is highly flammable. As noted, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" These various obstacles collectively made it a challenge for the builders to enable dirigible docking at the Empire State Building."
1037	15870	6	3	"Based on the article, ""the Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, there are numerous obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building encountered in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. @ORGANIZATION2 clearly states in paragraph @NUM1, ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons that were apparent even before it was ever constructed."" One crucial reason was safety. Dirigibles made outside of @LOCATION1 contained hydrogen instead of helium, which is a serious issue because hydrogen is highly flammable. This flammability posed a significant risk to both the building and the people in the vicinity. Another reason was the unpredictable winds. The winds constantly change, are violent air currents, and can move the dirigible erratically. These wind conditions made it extremely difficult to dock the dirigibles safely. The most important reason, however, is that it was illegal for dirigibles to moor at the Empire State Building. There is a law against airships flying too low over urban areas, and for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach it was a violation of the law. In conclusion, the builders had to face these multiple and complex obstacles in their endeavor to allow dirigible docking at the Empire State Building."
1038	15871	6	3	Just like in life, there are numerous obstacles. When you're trying to build a new invention, it's definitely not an easy task. So, there were many challenges when constructing a docking area for dirigibles on the Empire State Building. One major obstacle was the wind. People have no control over the wind or the elements within it. When it was very windy, the back of the dirigibles would swing back and forth wildly. When the Navy attempted to tie up the dirigibles, they couldn't get them close to the mooring mast because the winds were so strong. This made the docking process extremely difficult and dangerous. Another significant obstacle is safety. The dirigibles used gas instead of helium, which made them very flammable. Moreover, they don't have a great deal of control. If a dirigible were to come crashing down, it would pose a serious threat to the many pedestrians on the ground. If the Navy could find solutions to these obstacles, then the idea of using dirigibles for docking at the Empire State Building could be viable. However, these problems are hard to fix, though perhaps possible. In the end, the better idea might be to abandon the concept altogether.
1039	15872	6	3	The builders faced a multitude of obstacles when constructing the Empire State Building. They had the challenging task of building it higher than any other building while ensuring its stability at the same time. This required careful engineering and precise construction techniques. They also had to make the top of the building perfectly level and suitable. If the top was not in the right condition, the dirigibles would not be able to land safely. After a great deal of hard work and effort, eventually, it was made safe enough for the dirigibles to land. Once the dirigibles landed, people could disembark and take a tour of the top part of the building, experiencing the unique view from such a great height. In conclusion, despite the many difficulties, the builders managed to achieve their goal of making the building suitable for dirigible landings and providing a new experience for visitors.
1040	15873	6	3	While building the mast for dirigibles to be able to dock there, the architects unfortunately neglected to notice many flaws that were bound to cause problems. First of all, it was against the law to have aircraft flying that low to the ground. This legal restriction was a major hurdle that they failed to account for. Most of the dirigibles were mainly composed of hydrogen, which is highly flammable. Having these flammable dirigibles flying above a heavily populated area was extremely unsafe. The wind currents at the top of the building were also very strong. These powerful winds could push the dirigible into the side of a building, and it could get punctured by a sharp object, leading to a potentially disastrous situation. In conclusion, the entire idea of having dirigibles landing on the Empire State Building was indeed an accident waiting to happen, as these unaddressed flaws made the plan fraught with danger.
1041	15874	6	3	The architects of the Empire State Building faced numerous challenges when attempting to create a dock for dirigibles. First and foremost, there was the critical matter of safety. If a hydrogen - filled zeppelin were to catch fire while hovering over the bustling New York City, the consequences would be truly disastrous. It could easily ignite a huge city - wide fire, endangering countless lives and causing extensive property damage. Additionally, the wind conditions at that height were extremely capricious. These unpredictable winds would make it extremely difficult not only to dock the dirigibles but also to keep them docked securely. The Navy made an attempt to dock a dirigible, but they were unsuccessful. The erratic wind simply did not allow them to even get close to the docking mast. Thirdly, there were strict laws in place preventing airships from flying too low over cities. These laws effectively put an end to the whole idea of using the Empire State Building as a dirigible dock. Despite being a really awesome concept, the plan was fraught with danger from the very start, and in the end, it had to be abandoned.
1042	15875	6	3	Based on the excerpt, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were quite significant. The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was located a full eleven hundred feet below. This meant that the building's structure would have to bear an immense amount of force, posing a great engineering challenge. But the greatest obstacle was the wind. The wind on top of the building was constantly shifting due to violent air currents. These shifting winds made it nearly impossible to control the dirigible during docking and while it was docked. In the end, these obstacles were insurmountable, and the plan to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building had to be scrapped.
1043	15876	6	3	"From the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon @ORGANIZATION1, the builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock there. One major obstacle was the lack of a suitable landing area on the roof. The existing space was simply too limited, and for that reason, they needed more room to safely dock the dirigibles. To address this, they later had to install a steel needle on top of the building so that the balloons could dock and let people out. Another significant obstacle was the use of hydrogen. Most dirigibles from outside the U.S. used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. Placing a hydrogen - filled dirigible on top of the building was a huge risk. If it were to blow up, the building and the surrounding area could be severely damaged. Additionally, there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The forceful winds in the area could cause the balloon to be blown in different directions, and if the winds were strong enough, it could hit other buildings. These obstacles were substantial, and in the end, they made it very difficult, if not impossible, for the builders to achieve their goal of having dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building as described in the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION1."
1044	15877	6	3	"The success of the mooring mast of the Empire State Building was prevented by a multitude of obstacles. Safety was one of the most prominent reasons. As stated, ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen was flammable."" A fire starting from a hydrogen - filled dirigible in a densely populated city like New York could cause extensive damage and harm a large number of people. Nature also presented a significant obstacle. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. This would cause the dirigible to ""swivel around and around the mooring mast,"" a situation that was neither practical nor safe. Once the dirigible was tied to the mast, it would be extremely difficult to control because of the violent motion it was in. There was also an existing law ""against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This law made it illegal for any dirigible to even approach the mooring mast or tie to it. All of these challenges were faced by the builders of the mooring mast. In the end, these insurmountable obstacles led to the abandonment of the idea of using the mooring mast for dirigible ships."
1045	15878	6	3	Based on the excerpt, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced were ultimately all for nothing. They went to the trouble of spending extra money to restructure parts of the building in an attempt to make it suitable for dirigible docking. However, there was no real need for this expenditure. Even if they had somehow managed to find a way to get the dirigibles to dock successfully, it was already illegal for aircraft to fly that close to cities. This meant that any effort and money spent on making the docking possible was wasted. In the end, the builders' attempts were in vain, and the idea of dirigible docking at the Empire State Building had to be given up due to the existing legal restrictions.
1046	15879	6	3	Though the idea to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was seriously considered, safety and reality made it an unrealistic feat. In order for the mooring mast to successfully hold a dirigible, over @MONEY1 worth of modifications had to be made to the framework of the building. These modifications were necessary to withstand the additional stress that a docked dirigible would exert. Still, @CAPS1 got in the way, the greatest being safety. Most dirigibles from outside the @LOCATION2 used hydrogen gas rather than helium, which is highly flammable. The owners of the Empire State Building realized how bad a dirigible fire would be, and more so if it took place over the densely populated city of New York. A single spark during refueling or a minor accident could lead to a catastrophic explosion. Wind also was a serious factor that disassembled the idea. If the dirigible were to be tied to the mast, the back of the ship would swing around, and lead weights were out of the question. Blocks of lead hanging above pedestrians in the streets of New York was neither a practical nor safe idea. An additional obstacle was the existing law that would not allow airships to fly low or too close to urban areas. Even if it was attempted, ships would have a hard time docking because of forceful winds. These @CAPS1 were all stumbled across in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the building, an idea that is no longer considered as it was simply unfeasible due to these numerous challenges.
1047	15880	6	3	"Builders of the Empire State Building faced a few obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there such as safety, weather, and policies. One of the most obvious issues was the safety of the docking. Blimps run on hydrogen, which is highly flammable. If something were to happen while refueling the dirigible, like a small leak or a static - electricity spark, it could potentially cause extreme harm to the densely populated area underneath it. The resulting explosion and fire could spread quickly, endangering countless lives and causing massive property damage. Another stumping factor was the weather at such high altitudes. At 1,250 feet above the ground, the wind is constantly changing directions because of the ""violent air currents"" so high up. These erratic winds made it extremely difficult to predict the dirigible's movement. Also, it proved to be difficult to tie the blimp because since the winds were so strong, the dirigible could not get close enough to the building. The force of the wind would push the blimp away as it tried to approach the mooring dock. One last obstacle that was apparent was the law that was made stating that airships could not fly low over urban areas. This made the mooring dock illegal if used and made captains of the blimps aware that being so low and close to many buildings makes it challenging and dangerous to dock the dirigibles. Due to these multiple and insurmountable obstacles, the plan to use the Empire State Building as a dirigible docking station was ultimately abandoned."
1048	15881	6	3	"In the excerpt The Mooring Mast, by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, we are informed of the many obstacles standing in the way of landing a dirigible at the top of the Empire State Building. One obstacle can be found in paragraph @NUM1. It says, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" As you can see, the use of hydrogen would provide a great hazard to New York City as a dirigible was landing on the top of the building. It is a highly populated spot, and a hydrogen - related accident could lead to a large - scale explosion and fire. The flames could spread rapidly, endangering the lives of thousands of people in the area below. Another example of an obstacle can be seen in paragraph @NUM2. It stated that ""the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" @CAPS1 due to the wind. L¸sted informs us of the terrible hazard of the air currents at the top of the Empire State Building. These strong and unpredictable air currents could toss the dirigible around, making it almost impossible to safely dock. All in all, many obstacles stood in the way for allowing dirigibles to dock, and in the end, that is why it wasn't successful as these challenges were too great to overcome."
1049	15882	6	3	The Empire State Building was meant to be great, the tallest building in the world. Although they did achieve their goal of height, the true purpose of the building was never used. The building was supposed to serve as a holding dock for these new airships called dirigibles. However, this was not the case. There were reasons that were apparent before it was ever built. One of the greatest obstacles was nature itself. The winds at the top of the building were too strong for the dirigible to be safely secured. The powerful gusts would make the dirigible unstable, and the back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast. Trying to weigh it down with bricks was impractical as it would be difficult to install and could pose a risk of falling. Another problem that was faced was the law that would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. This law was in place to protect the safety of the city's residents. But two ships did try to land. The U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles failed in landing because it was too dangerous. The strong winds and the legal restrictions made it impossible to complete a safe docking. In the end, the Empire State Building never served as a station for dirigibles due to these insurmountable obstacles.
1050	15883	6	3	"In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1, the builders of the Empire State Building faced some obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. These obstacles included the added stress to the building's frame. The excerpt states in paragraph nine ""A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether would add stress to the building's frame."" This additional stress over time could weaken the building's structural integrity. It could cause cracks in the walls, damage to the foundation, and in the worst - case scenario, cause the whole building structure to collapse which could cause death and a lot of destruction. The safety of the building's occupants and those in the surrounding area would be at stake. Another obstacle included nature. The excerpt states in paragraph fourteen ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" These violent air currents could cause the dirigibles to lose control and hit the building and other buildings around it. The impact could not only damage the dirigible but also cause significant harm to the nearby structures. The stress being added to the Empire State Building and nature itself were the two main obstacles for the builders, making it extremely difficult, if not impossible, to use the building as a dirigible docking station."
1051	15884	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building had to face a lot of obstacles to try to get dirgibles to land there. One of those obstacles was making ""changes to existing plans for the building's steel frame"". These changes were complex and required careful engineering to ensure the building's structural integrity. Another thing was nature; the strong winds would not let a blimp land there safely. The wind patterns were often unpredictable, making it extremely challenging for dirigibles to approach and dock. But the greatest reason was safety: ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"". Due to this high - flammability risk, it was a major deterrent to the successful operation of dirigibles at the Empire State Building."
1052	15885	6	3	"In the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast,"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was in paragraph 6, the excerpt says, ""one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area."" This means that the architects needed to build enough area to land the dirigibles, precisely and carefully, taking into account the size and maneuverability of the dirigibles. Another obstacle was in paragraph @NUM1, which said, ""the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" This is explaining that while the outcome of nature can be predicted to some extent, it cannot be controlled. The amount of ""violent air currents"" can severely disturb the landing of dirigibles and it is ""neither practical nor safe"" for the dirigibles to dangle high above the pedestrians that are on the street. Unfortunately, Al Smith's plan to enable the dirigibles to moor at the Empire State Building was unsuccessful. There was a law stated in paragraph @NUM2, that made ""it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"". Instead of using the mooring mast, the dirigibles gave way to airplanes, as the obstacles proved insurmountable."
1053	15886	6	3	"The builders of the dirigibles faced many obstacles trying to allow them to dock. One obstacle was that it was illegal for ""airships to fly too low"" over urban areas. It was also illegal for it to ""tie up to the building."" The purpose of the dirigibles was to be able to dock at the mast. If it couldn't fly up to the mast and dock, there was no purpose in the mast or dirigibles. If they were to be able to dock they would need to be weighted down by lead weights. The problem with the weights was they would dangle above pedestrians. That was ""neither practical nor safe"" for the pedestrians on the street. If the dirigible docked at the top of the building, they would be held by a single cable. All the pressure on the cable would stress out the building's frame. If that were to happen they would then have to strengthen and modify the building's foundation, which would be a costly and time - consuming process. Overall the major obstacle they faced was not thinking through their plan of the dirigible. If they had thought it through these obstacles could have been prevented, and the dirigibles might have had a better chance of successful docking."
1054	15887	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in attempting to dock dirigibles there. Many foreign dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium to keep it afloat. Hydrogen is extremely flammable, and has proven to be. On @DATE1, a German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed in a massive fire caused from hydrogen, in New Jersey. When the owners of the Empire State building realized the severity of this happening, they were turned off. Nature, if anything, was the biggest obstacle of them all. Considering the building was so tall, ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent wind currents"", making it very difficult for dirigibles to approach and dock safely. The law, if anything, was pretty important to get approved, and there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. So it would make it illegal for the dirigible ships to ever tie up to the building or to even approach the area. In the end, these combined obstacles made it impossible for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building."
1055	15888	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced a lot of obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. A few of these problems included designing the mast and making sure that it was safe enough for dirigible to dock on. According to the excerpt, ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" This meant that the builders would have to change the plan of how the building could be built to be able to hold the dirigibles, which involved complex engineering and construction work. After they constructed a new layout for the building the conflict of safety came into play. Stated in paragraph @NUM1, ""The greatest reason was one of safety: Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly inflammable."" Another big safety issue was ""nature itself."" ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The air currents made it so that they had to tie down the dirigible, but even then it is dangerous because it would be dangling over pedestrians on the street. The design and safety of the building both were big obstacles that the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, ultimately making the plan unfeasible."
1056	15889	6	3	They had to worry about the safety for the people, to keep the situation stable as they docked. They were concerned about how they would manage it and the possible outcomes if something did go wrong. In the end, they understood that being vigilant was crucial to avoid any mishaps.
1057	15890	6	3	"When the builders of the Empire State Building were constructing the mooring mast for the dirigibles, they faced obstacles that could have jeopardized the project. There were two aspects that the builders had to pay extra attention to, namely structural integrity, and design. Since ""the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Building's flat roof,"" the builders had to carefully modify the building's frame. These modifications, which involved detailed engineering work, cost over @MONEY1. The other aspect that posed an obstacle was design. The architect, John Tauranac, described the plan to make the mast ""more than ornamental,"" and ""more than something as mundane as a water tank."" So, to fulfill the architect's high aspirations, the builders constructed a ""shiny glass and chrome - nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from the inside. This required a lot of extra work for the builders. Despite the obstacles, the builders got the job done, successfully creating a mast that met the initial vision."
1058	15891	6	3	"In the excerpt, The Mooring Mast, there were numerous obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle being that the architects could not have a mooring mast on top of the building because the dirigible, which would be, ""... held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame"" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). This would cause the building to have too weak of a frame from the dirigible's load, as well as the wind pressure. Then the stress would be transmitted down to the foundation of the building. As a result, the building's frame was modified, costing ""Over sixty thousand dollars'"" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). Another obstacle was designing the mooring mast so passengers could be brought, ""... down to the eighty - sixth floor, where baggage and ticket areas would be located"" (@CAPS1 @NUM3). In order for this to be completed, builders had to carefully finish the roof. Lastly, ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the moor mast was nature itself"" (@CAPS1 @NUM4). When the winds came into action at the top of the building, the dirigible would swivel around the mast. This would cause a significant safety hazard for pedestrians on the street. The Mooring Mast supported many reasons as to the obstacles builders had to face in attempting to allow dirigible to dock at the Empire State Building, ultimately showing the complexity of the project."
1059	15892	6	3	"In the excerpt, The Mooring Mast, by @PERSON1, the author describes many obstacles builders faced to allow dirigibles to dock. The first problem was the modifications that had to be made to the building's framework. ""Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made,"" clearly showing how expensive this project was going to be. A second potential problem was that, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting."" This could cause many different complications. One of which would be how ""the wind would blow the dirigible onto sharp spires,"" a consequence greatly feared by the pilot of Los Angeles. Another problem brought up by the winds shifting would be the ship spinning, potentially resulting in a major catastrophe. They accommodated for the use with some unpractical things, eventually leading to the downfall of the mooring mast, which was a setback for the initial docking plans."
1060	15893	6	3	"In the excerpt, the builders and architects building the Empire State Building had numerous problems trying to build the mast on the top of the building. One reason was that they built it before even considering the problems it may cause. The biggest problem was safety: ""the hydrogen used in the dirigibles was highly flammable."" This posed a constant threat of fire and explosion. Another problem was wind: ""they would never be able to use the mooring mast because of the violent winds shifting at that height."" If the dirigible was ever tied to the building, ""its back end would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" The dirigibles moored in fields could be held down with lead weights but using those @NUM1 feet above downtown New York would not be safe at all. The final problem was a law against airships flying that low over cities and pedestrians. So, needless to say, it wouldn't work out, and the plan to use the mast for dirigible docking had to be abandoned."
1061	15894	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced were numerous. The architects couldn't simply place the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building, which was only held by a single cable tether. Doing so would add excessive stress to the building's frame. To handle the dirigible's load, the steel frame of the Empire State Building would need to be modified and strengthened, a task that would cost over sixty thousand dollars. Another major obstacle was nature. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting. These shifting winds could cause the back of the ship to swivel around and around the mooring mast, making it extremely difficult and dangerous to dock dirigibles. Due to these insurmountable obstacles, the idea of using the mooring mast for dirigible docking was ultimately abandoned.
1062	15895	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced several significant obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the key obstacles the architects encountered was the stress the cable tether would impose on the building's foundation. As mentioned in paragraph @NUM1, L¸sted states, ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" This was a very expensive problem to fix, as it would require significant modifications to the building's structure. Another major challenge the builders faced was the lack of safety. Dirigibles from outside of the United States typically used Hydrogen, a highly flammable gas. In paragraph @NUM2, L¸sted notes, ""The owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse [an] accident could [be] if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" The most significant obstacle, however, was nature itself. The violent winds on top of the building were constantly shifting. In paragraph @NUM3, L¸sted reasons, ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" This would be neither practical nor safe for the passengers, crew, or the people below. Given these overwhelming obstacles, the idea of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building quietly faded away."
1063	15896	6	3	"From the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, it details the numerous obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock. The mooring mast of the building was unfortunately destined to never fulfill its intended purpose. One prominent issue was that most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen. In contrast, the United States mainly used helium, which is non - flammable unlike hydrogen. Fortunately, the owners of the Empire State Building were aware that there could have been a terrible accident if hydrogen dirigibles were used at the building. Another significant obstacle was nature. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to the violent air currents. These shifting winds made it extremely unsafe for the pedestrians down below, as a dirigible could potentially be blown out of control. These challenges were insurmountable, and thus, the plan to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was ultimately abandoned."
1064	15897	6	3	"Marcia @CAPS1's article ""The Mooring Mast"" explains the various obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. Initially, nobody involved in the project realized that the building wouldn't be sturdy enough to support a thousand - foot dirigible. The pressure from the dirigible, combined with the wind pressure, would be ""transmitted to the building's foundation."" As a result, the steel frame would also need to be reinforced, an expensive endeavor that would cost over sixty thousand dollars. Several other problems emerged due to pedestrian safety concerns. Most foreign dirigibles used highly - flammable hydrogen fuel instead of helium. Everyone involved in the project recognized that if the hydrogen were to cause a fire, the many people living in downtown New York could lose their lives. Since the dirigible would be dangling 1,250 feet over crowded streets, it would endanger countless pedestrians. Moreover, there was a law banning airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it ""illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" Despite the Empire State Building never achieving its goal of dirigible docking, it remains an iconic international landmark in the heart of New York."
1065	15898	6	3	"In their attempts to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, the builders encountered multiple obstacles that ultimately halted the entire idea. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (@NUM1 line @NUM2). Because of these changing winds atop the building, there would be no reliable and safe way to moor a lighter - than - air dirigible on top of such a high structure. The wind also presented another problem. If the captain let go of the controls, the dirigible might impale itself on another pointy spire, meaning that the other high - rise buildings in the area became an additional obstacle. The law of the day also became a significant hurdle. ""An existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (@NUM3 line 1) was in place. Even though the building itself was high up, it still wasn't legal for any airship to moor at the top due to height restrictions. These attempts at building a mooring dock atop the Empire State Building had the potential to propel New York forward in innovation, but the obstacles were too great to overcome, and the plan was eventually scrapped."
1066	15899	6	3	"There were some great obstacles for the dirigibles to be able to land and dock on the Empire State Building. At first, the idea of dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building was great and staggering people's minds, but when the mast was being built, the people realized it would not work. The first problem for the dirigible was the law for airships to be so low over urban areas, which makes it illegal for the ship to even be that close to the building. The second problem was that ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents (paragraph @NUM1)"", which means it would be very dangerous for the passengers to be coming on and off the board of the dirigible. The last problem is that foreign dirigibles use hydrogen, which is flammable, and to put it over a densely populated area like New York could cause horrific damage. These precautions would have to be taken, which were significant obstacles for the Empire State Building's plan to accommodate dirigibles."
1067	15900	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced three main challenges while attempting to make the mooring mast accessible to dirigibles. Most foreign dirigibles still used hydrogen, a highly flammable gas. A fire involving a dirigible on the streets of New York would be a truly disastrous event for the city. There were also fierce, ever - changing wind currents above the building. These winds would make the back of the dirigible ""swivel around and around the mooring mast"", making the docking process extremely difficult and dangerous. Additionally, there was a law in place preventing dirigibles from flying too low when over urban areas. This law made it illegal for dirigibles to tether to the building or even approach it closely. Those three factors made the mooring mast ""neither practical nor safe"" for the intended purpose of dirigible docking."
1068	15901	6	3	"There were many obstacles the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. One obstacle they faced is ensuring the safety of the passengers when the dirigibles would dock and that the framework of the building wouldn't collapse under the additional stress. I know this because in between paragraph @NUM1 and @NUM2 the excerpt says, ""'One set of engineers are here in New York is trying to dope out a practical, workable arrangement and the government people in Washington are figuring on some safe way of mooring airships to this mast.'"" The mast weighs a great deal, so they're afraid it will put too much pressure on the Empire State Building's structure. The engineers were also afraid of the dirigibles blowing up because the dirigibles use hydrogen. Hydrogen is way more flammable than helium. I know this because in between paragraph @NUM3 and @NUM4 it says, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" These were a few of the many obstacles the workers faced in this ambitious project."
1069	15902	6	3	"In this excerpt, the architects/workers had to face several obstacles while trying to construct a docking area on the Empire State Building for dirigibles. They had to find a way for this huge mast not to cause damage to the building frame. The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add significant stress to the building's frame. They had to find a way to make the load less bearing on the building. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" To fix this, architects and workers must modify the steel frame because of the new situation. After this was built and done, they had to face the facts that this was either impossible to do or not allowed. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" The architects and workers went through so many obstacles only to then find out that it was dangerous and against the law for dirigibles to fly so close to urban areas, ultimately thwarting their plans."
1070	15903	6	3	In attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, the builders went through many obstacles. Dirigibles are steel - framed balloons, with envelopes or cotton fabric filled with hydrogen and helium to make them lighter than air. Dirigibles could be maneuvered by the use of propellers and rudders, and passengers could ride in the gondola, which is located under the balloon. A dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add a substantial amount of stress to the building's frame. The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. Over @MONEY1 worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework to withstand this stress. Also, there is the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building, making the entire endeavor of dirigible docking at the Empire State Building unfeasible.
1071	15904	6	3	The obstacles that the builders of The Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were numerous. They had to ensure that the dirigibles could anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and also provide a safe way for passengers to board or disembark. The dirigibles were docked by means of an electric winch, which carefully hauled in a line from the front of the ship and then securely tied it to a mast. Even though the body of the dirigibles could swing gently in the breeze, passengers could safely get on and off the dirigible by walking down a well - constructed gangplank to an open observation platform. They had to overcome all these obstacles in order to build the docking facilities at The Empire State Building, but unfortunately, many challenges remained insurmountable, and the plan was ultimately not fully realized.
1072	15905	6	3	"Al Smith, a well - known former governor of New York, took the lead in constructing the Empire State Building. This building was being constructed with the clear goal of being the tallest building, surpassing the Chrysler building which stood at @NUM1 feet tall. In order to make the Empire State Building taller than the Chrysler building, Al Smith came up with the idea of adding a mooring mast to the top for docking dirigibles. However, this idea faced many significant obstacles. First, as the passage states, ""The steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" This modification would cost a large amount of money to construct. Also, ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" Additionally, the passage points out the issue that ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The builders realized many problems after the mooring mast was constructed. They should have carefully considered each situation before building the mast, as it ended up costing a lot of money. Although the mast was no longer used, the Empire State building still stood at the height of @NUM2 feet, remaining the tallest building built at that time."
1073	15906	6	3	"Builders of the Empire State Building never achieved their goal of making the mooring mast functional for dirigibles. They had failed to accurately predict the potential problems that they would face during the process. First of all, they couldn't proceed to attempt to land the dirigible on the Mooring Mast because it would pose a great danger. Indeed, ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used Hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (paragraph @NUM1). They vividly remembered the complications it would imply if there were to be an incident similar to the one in New Jersey. Also, nature presented a major obstacle to the project; ""The winds on top of the building were constantly changing due to violent air currents"" (paragraph @NUM2). Consequently, due to the strong winds, the back of the dirigible would be swinging erratically around the mooring mast, which would pose a huge danger to the streets below. As a final point, dirigibles wouldn't be able to moor at the Empire State Building because there was a pre - existing law strictly concerning how low airships could fly over urban areas. In the end, these multiple issues led to the failure of the mooring mast project."
1074	15907	6	3	The architects didn't realize how many potential problems the mooring mast would bring until it had clearly failed. The greatest reason why the dirigibles couldn't land was purely related to safety complications. Many dirigibles at the time used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable, which posed a significant risk of explosion. Another main reason was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were extremely violent and could easily push a dirigible in the wrong direction, making it almost impossible to land safely. Before these problems, there was an already existing law against the flying of airships too low over urban areas. Due to these safety concerns and legal restrictions, dirigibles could not dock at the Empire State building, and the mooring mast project was ultimately a disappointment.
1075	15908	6	3	"In the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building had many obstacles to deal with. They had to make sure that the dirigibles could reach the required height and that it would be safe for passengers to board and get off safely. The builders had to handle a great deal of complexity. As stated, ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of @ORGANIZATION1 roof."" Because of the building's great height, they were unable to make things work as planned. The dirigible was too large and heavy, and it added excessive stress to the building's frame. To unload things, it was extremely difficult as the floor it needed to be on was too low. ""The as yet unsolved problems of mooring airships to a fixed mast at such a height made it desirable to postpone to a later date the final installation of the landing gear."" The project was so difficult that they had to quit the task and plan to expand at another time. The workers were devastated by the setback, but they hoped for a better solution in the future."
1076	15909	6	3	"There were many problems to overcome in the construction of the mooring mast on the Empire State Building. The first problem to overcome was the stress a thousand - foot - long dirigible would add to the building's frame. This additional stress could potentially compromise the structural integrity of the building. It was solved by spending over @MONEY1 in modifying the building's framework, which involved reinforcing key support elements. Another problem was a law against airships flying too low around urban environments, brought up in paragraph @NUM1. This law was in place to ensure the safety of the city's residents. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" @CAPS1 is writing about the wind. At 1,250 feet high, the wind is violent, and would swing a dirigible around too much to be safe. Moreover, the ends of the dirigible could not be weighed down for fear of injuring a pedestrian on the ground. Those were three significant reasons the mooring mast failed, ultimately making it an unviable addition for regular dirigible docking."
1077	15910	6	3	In attempting to let dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building, the builders faced many problems. The first problem was the fact that most dirigibles from outside of the U.S. used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable, and having a hydrogen - filled dirigible over a city full of pedestrians was a huge risk. A single spark could cause the dirigible to catch on fire and rain debris down on the people below, potentially causing severe injuries or even fatalities. Secondly, the winds at the height of the Empire State Building were always shifting, which presented great risk to pilots. If their dirigible got blown off course, it could collide with other tall buildings in the city. For instance, the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles got blown off course by the strong winds, and the pilot could not take his hands off the controls in fear of hitting other buildings. Lastly, there was a pre - existing law that would have made it illegal for a dirigible to have entered the airspace around the Empire State Building. Due to these multiple insurmountable problems, the plan to let dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building had to be abandoned.
1078	15911	6	3	It @CAPS1 like a very hard test for them because they're trying to make an age of transportation with the thoughts of the pioneers. They aimed to bring about a new era of air - based transportation, which was a bold and innovative idea. But once the architects designed the mooring mast and made changes for the building skeleton, they faced a sequential construction challenge. After they have framed the 85th floor, the roof had to be completed before the framing could progress further. This was a crucial step in the overall construction process, and any delay or misstep could have affected the entire project. In the end, they had to carefully follow this sequence to ensure the successful construction of the mooring mast and the related infrastructure.
1079	15912	6	3	During 1929 when Al Smith announced that he was going to make a docking port for blimps at the top of the Empire State Building, there were many obstacles in the way of the architects' building design. Building a dock for blimps at the top of the world's tallest building is no easy task. They should have realized, prior to the project, that this was a lost cause because of the numerous technical and practical difficulties involved. However, they tried it anyways. The architects on the project had to devise a plan that would strengthen the main support beams of the building. This was necessary to withstand the weight and forces exerted by the blimps during docking. At the same time, they had to control the movements of the back of the dirigibles due to uncontrollable wind conditions. Unfortunately, they never found a way to successfully complete this task. As a result, the Empire State Building could never dock blimps, and the ambitious plan remained unfulfilled.
1080	15913	6	3	In the 1930's, this would have been a difficult obstacle to face. The idea altogether was doubted by many people. The first @CAPS1 was comparing in height with the Chrysler Building. This height comparison was significant as it raised questions about the practicality and safety of the mooring mast. The mooring mast would have worked in theory, but in reality, it had too many problems. The high - altitude wind conditions, potential structural stress, and safety concerns were just some of the issues. It was a potentially dangerous attempt, as any malfunction or accident could have had serious consequences for the building, the dirigibles, and the people below. In the end, the numerous problems made it clear that the idea was not feasible.
1081	15914	6	3	When the Empire State Building was constructed, it ran into numerous problems while attempting to dock dirigibles there. One significant problem they encountered is that most overseas blimps were still filled with hydrogen, a highly flammable gas. The constructors were extremely cautious and did not want to re - create the tragic Hindenburg accident over a densely populated area such as New York City. The greatest obstacle to the mooring mast was nature itself. The wind currents atop the building were not only violent but also constantly shifting. Docking a dirigible there in those conditions would cause it to swivel around the building, making it extremely unsafe for passengers. That is why the mooring mast never fulfilled its intended purpose.
1082	15915	6	3	The building of the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building was very poorly thought out. This lack of proper planning is the root cause of why they faced so many obstacles during the process. From the very start, Al Smith, the key person involved, never gave due consideration to the safety of the people. When other countries used hydrogen rather than helium in their dirigibles, this posed a high - risk of flammable disasters. If an accident like the Hindenburg could happen in New Jersey, one can only imagine how much worse it would be in a densely populated place like New York City. I could never fathom walking down the street and having a lead weight dropped on my head. In New York, there were violent air currents, and when the dirigibles would be tied up, they would sway uncontrollably. The idea was to hold them in place by lead weights, but this solution was neither practical nor safe. One crucial aspect that should have been thought of before it was ever constructed was the law. It was clearly illegal for an airship to fly low over urban areas or even to tie up to buildings. In conclusion, everything should have been thoroughly thought out before creating hype about something that was not safe and that was illegal, as it could have avoided a lot of trouble and potential risks.
1083	15916	6	3	"By reading the passage ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, it is quite evident to see the numerous complications associated with landing a dirigible on top of a 1,250 - foot building. For one, there is the natural effect of wind. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" These strong and ever - changing winds would make it extremely difficult to land any floating aircraft anywhere, especially if the back of the aircraft wasn't able to be weighted down properly. Another obstacle the builders faced was that the frame had to be strong enough to hold a @NUM1 - foot long dirigible. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" To address this, the workers then had to spend over @MONEY1 to remodel the framework of the Empire State Building. Another issue is that anchoring the blimps would be illegal. According to ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" All these safety troubles and legal violations, when combined, would all together make the ""mooring"" an impossible feat, highlighting the impracticality of the whole plan."
1084	15917	6	3	The architects and builders faced large problems in the construction of the docking platform, even though they had not noticed them at first. Initially, the project seemed to be progressing smoothly, and they were unaware of the looming issues. The builders did not notice any large problem until after the dirigible Hindenburg crashed in Lakehurst. This tragic event served as a wake - up call. The building's owners became greatly concerned for the safety of the people inside and below the building if a blimp fell into the same situation as the Hindenburg. They realized that the potential consequences of a similar accident in a more populated area like New York could be catastrophic, and this concern led to a re - evaluation of the docking platform project.
1085	15918	6	3	"When Al Smith first came up with the plan to use the Empire State Building as a mooring mast, he had absolutely no idea how many obstacles they would face in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One large and obvious obstacle was safety. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) The reason this is so unsafe is because if the gas inside ever happened to catch on fire, the entire craft would explode in a massive ball of flames. This is not only a hazard to those in the ship but also to those walking in the streets below. Another obstacle was the high winds at the top of the building. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" (@CAPS1 @NUM2) This was a major problem because it would cause the dirigible to move erratically all over the place. The idea of using lead weights to weigh it down was proposed, but these lead weights would pose a real danger to pedestrians below if they were to fall. A third and final obstacle they faced was the stress a dirigible would cause on the building's frame. The building's original design was not capable of handling the stress of a dirigible tied to its mast. Without changing the design, the dirigible would probably tear the building apart. The only solution was to strengthen the building. ""Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework,"" (@CAPS1 @NUM3). That is an incredibly large and ridiculous amount of money they had to spend just to make it possible for the dirigible to dock. It is easy to see how difficult the project was based on the many obstacles the builders had to face, and it makes one question the viability of the initial plan."
1086	15919	6	3	The builders of the Empire State building faced not so many but difficult obstacles. One of the obstacles was the crowded air - space they had for the dirigible. The crowded air - space in the vicinity of the building can cause the dirigible to hit or bump into another building, and in a worst - case scenario, it could even pop the dirigible. The wind conditions were also a major concern. The wind could make the dirigible sway uncontrollably and hit another building. Another obstacle was the stress the building was having because the dirigible was tied to it. If the wind blew hard, the dirigible would put a lot of tension on the building, and this excessive stress could lead to structural damage or other unforeseen problems. Despite these challenges, the project still moved forward, but these issues had to be carefully considered.
1087	15920	6	3	While attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, the builders faced many obstacles. The first obstacle they dealt with was the fact that mooring such heavy blimps would add stress to the building. In fact, 'the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation,' which meant that the entire structure had to bear the additional weight and forces. Another obstacle they endured was the fact that the hydrogen gas used in the dirigible was very flammable. As bad as the Hindenburg explosion was, it could have been much worse, 'if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York,' endangering countless lives. It was also very dangerous that the blimps would fly so low over an urban area, increasing the risk of accidents. Lastly, the strong winds would make mooring difficult. Winds that high up on a building are, 'constantly shifting due to violent air currents,' making it hard to keep the dirigible stable. The workers clearly had many problems in building the mast, and due to these insurmountable obstacles, it just couldn't be completed.
1088	15921	6	3	"From the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"", there were multiple obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the obstacles the builders faced was the regulations against airships flying too low over urban areas. The law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or ever approach the area, creating a significant legal hurdle. Another obstacle the builders faced was forceful winds. ""The U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds."" The greatest obstacle was that the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to the violent air currents. The back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast, making it extremely difficult to secure. The last obstacle was that the dirigible wasn't safe to have dangling high above pedestrians. All these obstacles combined made the task of enabling dirigible docking at the Empire State Building a nearly impossible feat."
1089	15922	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION1, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. For example, one big problem they faced was that the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. This operation would not be possible because ""A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's foundation, which is nearly eleven hundred feet below."" The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation, which was a complex and costly process. One big obstacle they faced was a major safety problem. ""Most dirigibles from outside the @CAPS1 used @CAPS2 drogen rather than @CAPS3 lium, and @CAPS2 drogen is very flammable, posing a serious fire risk. The biggest obstacle to face was nature itself. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to the violent air currents. Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using them at the Empire State Building, where they would be hanging on top of pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe. These are the numerous obstacles the Empire State Building project faced in its attempt to enable dirigible docking."
1090	15923	6	3	There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Some obstacles were the lack of a suitable landing area, which made it difficult for the dirigible to approach and land safely. Another obstacle was that they could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the building's flat roof. A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame. Also, if they wanted to do this, the stress would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below, putting a huge strain on the entire structure. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. To reduce this, dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down with lead weights, but the obstacle to this is having weights dangling high above pedestrians was neither practical nor safe. All these obstacles, yet these people were still able to build the Empire State Building with a mooring mast, which is a remarkable testament to their engineering skills and determination.
1091	15924	6	3	"In the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION1, the builders of the Empire State building faced numerous and challenging obstacles. As stated in paragraph 1 of the excerpt, in the @DATE2's, the Empire State building was planned to be the tallest building in the world. However, the architect of the Chrysler building constructed the building to be 46 ft taller than the Empire State building. Governor of New York, Al Smith, was determined not to lose the title of the tallest building. In paragraph 6, it reveals Smith's idea: A mooring mast was added to the top of the building, which would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers on & off. But safety issues did not allow the mooring mast of the Empire State building to fulfill its purpose, as said in paragraph @NUM1. Most dirigibles from outside the @PERSON2 used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. Because of the pointy buildings in the area, this was extremely dangerous. As stated in paragraph @NUM2, the greatest obstacle was nature. On top of the Empire State building, the winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, and there was also a law restricting flying too low. By the late 1930's, the mooring mast plan disappeared, succumbing to these insurmountable challenges."
1092	15925	6	3	Builders of the Empire State Building faced several significant obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First, there was the complex problem of having a large dirigible moored to the top of the building held by a single cable tether. This would add a substantial amount of stress to the frame of the building, transmitting the forces all the way to its foundation. To fix this, the frame of the Empire State building would need to be significantly strengthened. Another major problem was the safety of the citizens on the streets below. Dirigibles using hydrogen could burst into flames, posing a serious threat. Also, high winds would make it extremely difficult for the dirigible to tether to the mooring mast. The dirigible could not be weighed down since the weights would dangle over pedestrians on the streets, creating a dangerous situation. The effectiveness of these winds was clearly shown when the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles attempted to dock. During this attempt, the winds were very strong, and the captain of the dirigible feared that it could be punctured by other buildings' sharp spires. These are several clear examples of what the builders of the Empire State building had to face, highlighting the immense difficulties in realizing this ambitious docking plan.
1093	15926	6	3	Some obstacles the builders faced were the excessive stress on the building's frame. The stress would have to transmit all the weight and pressure of the dirigible, held by a single cable called a tether, all the way to the building's foundation. Another obstacle was an existing law stating that one can't moor a ship there because the flying altitude is too low. In December 1930, the @ORGANIZATION1 dirigible attempted to park there. The crew was afraid that the strong wind could knock the dirigible into another building. Therefore, they encountered a few difficult obstacles. However, in the end, they managed to address these issues, make necessary adjustments, and finally made the mooring concept a reality, overcoming the initial challenges.
1094	15927	6	3	"Dirigibles, modernly called blimps, were widely regarded in the @DATE1's as the latest and most advanced form of transportation available at that time. These dirigibles required quick means of refueling and unloading passengers both efficiently and with a high level of safety. At the very time these dirigibles became popular, modern - day skyscrapers such as the Empire State Building and the Chrysler Building were dominating the skyline in New York City. Al Smith, a former governor of New York who was leading the efforts to construct the Empire State Building, came up with the innovative idea of building a mooring mast on the top of his building. This mooring mast would help dirigibles dock, refuel, and unload cargo quickly and efficiently. Although, at the time this idea was thought of as both ""practical"" and ""workable,"" it was never put to use because of safety concerns later discovered by architects. These safety concerns included the fear of the ""constantly shifting"" winds ""due to violent air currents"" as well as air - space restricting laws that prohibited ""airships from flying too low over urban areas."" Although this idea seemed revolutionary at the time, many significant obstacles stood in its path to success, ultimately preventing its implementation."
1095	15928	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were extremely difficult to overcome. One major obstacle for the builders was trying to ensure that the building itself could handle the stress of the dirigibles tied to it. With the wind pulling at the dirigibles and causing them to sway back and forth as the wind direction changes, the building had to withstand a great deal of force. Also, the location was too low for dirigibles to be flying because of the surrounding buildings, which restricted their maneuverability. The most important concern was the highly flammable gases inside the dirigible. A fire or explosion would be a devastating event for the people below in New York City. In the end, these numerous and severe obstacles made it nearly impossible to achieve the goal of regular dirigible docking at the Empire State Building.
1096	15929	6	3	"The Hindenburg, a large and well - known dirigible, was destroyed by a sudden and fierce fire in @LOCATION1 on @DATE1. The sight of this catastrophic event was a wake - up call. The owners of the Empire State Building quickly realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York. In ""The MOORING MAST"", it was stated that dirigibles had some remarkable capabilities. They had a top speed of eighty miles per hour and could cruise at a steady seventy miles per hour for thousands of miles without needing to refuel. Some of these dirigibles were as long as four city blocks in New York City. However, the one significant obstacle to their more widespread use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area, which limited their practical application in the bustling metropolis."
1097	15930	6	3	"In the @DATE1's, Al Smith, a visionary with big dreams, hoped to build the world's largest dirigible dock in the vibrant city of New York. However, during the construction of the Empire State Building's mooring system, things did not go as planned. It ran into many persistent problems. One major obstacle was the harsh winds high above New York. In paragraph @NUM1, the author precisely says, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" These unpredictable winds caused the dirigibles' tail end to move erratically while docked, making landings and take - offs extremely unsafe. Another obstacle faced was a strict law that prohibited airships from flying low over urban areas. This law was put in place out of fear because of the tragic Hindenburg crash in 1937. The building officials were well - aware that if such a crash were to happen in New York, the damage would have been truly catastrophic. The final obstacle faced by the Empire State Building's mooring system was that many blimps from overseas used hydrogen instead of helium to fly. Hydrogen is extremely flammable, and if a crash had occurred over New York, the damage would have devastated the city and would have caused a tremendous amount of casualties. In the end, these multiple obstacles made the realization of the dirigible dock at the Empire State Building an impossible dream."
1098	15931	6	3	"Based on ""The Mooring Mast"" written by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building, with high hopes and grand plans, faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Constructed in the 1930s, the Empire State Building was originally built with the specific goal of exceeding the height of the Chrysler Building; it was going to stand at a whopping 1,250 feet tall. What added to this building's imposing height was its great mooring mast that stood proudly atop the building. Dirigibles, which were very similar to balloons, were steadily gaining popularity in the aviation world at that time. However, there were many significant issues that held back the progress of this project. Most of these issues were related to safety. One practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was because of an existing strict law against airships flying too low to urban areas. Another crucial reason was the flammability of these ships. Most of them ran on hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is very flammable, and if the ship were to explode, many innocent civilians and passengers would be killed. In summation, because of these serious safety risks, the mast of the Empire State Building could and was never used for its original intended purpose."
1099	15932	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced several challenging obstacles. As clearly stated, ""... the lack of suitable landing area."" (@CAPS1 6). This meant that it was extremely difficult to land the dirigibles safely and smoothly. Another problem they faced was nature. The wind and ever - changing weather conditions could make landing the dirigibles a very dangerous endeavor. ""Dirigibles were docked by means of an electric winch, which called in a line from the front of the ship, and tied it to the mast."" (@CAPS1 6). This means that if the wind blows in the wrong direction, or competes with the electric winch, it would be not only difficult but also extremely dangerous to land the dirigible. Another significant obstacle was the expenses. ""Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). This means they had to pay a large amount of money, which was a substantial financial burden. That was definitely an obstacle they had to face, and in the end, these combined obstacles made the task of making the building suitable for dirigible docking a very difficult one."
1100	15933	6	3	The builders of the @ORGANIZATION1 were full of enthusiasm, thinking that they had a great and innovative idea and that they were true pioneers in the field. They soon, however, realized that there were some serious problems with their ideas. One major problem was safety. As noted in paragraph @NUM1, most @LOCATION3 dirigibles used hydrogen, a highly flammable substance. New York, being one of the biggest and most densely populated cities in the United States, was far too crowded to take such a huge risk. Another problem was the wind. At those great heights, the wind currents were completely unpredictable, and the winds could reach very high speeds. If the dirigible were to be blown around while in the downtown area and were to hit a spire of one of the many tall buildings, there would certainly be quite a few casualties. After carefully weighing the risks and rewards, they came to the conclusion that it just wasn't worth it. The potential for disaster far outweighed any possible benefits, and so they had to abandon their initial plans.
1101	15934	6	3	The obstacles that the architects of the Empire State Building faced were extremely harsh. They had to carefully figure out how they were going to get the dirigibles to land safely on the mooring mast. Another problem was that the government was getting impatient as the project was taking longer than expected. What made things worse was that Al Smith was being sneaky and untruthful. He blatantly lied about how high the actual height of the structure is. He also lied about how he would fix the problems that were associated with the mooring mast. They were also legitimately afraid that a dirigible would blow up on the mooring mast, just like the Hindenburg. So, they just put the dirigible - docking plan aside and, over time, created the world's highest soda fountain and tea garden for the use of sightseers, which became a popular alternative attraction.
1102	15935	6	3	One significant problem that the builders had was that they had to make the mast big enough to accommodate the large dirigibles. Some dirigibles would be as long as @NUM1 feet. If they simply dropped a mast on top of the Empire State Building, considering the stress of a thousand - foot dirigible held to the Empire State Building by just one cable tether, there would be an enormous amount of stress put on the building's frame. If they did so, the combined weight of the dirigible and the force of the wind would result in all that stress and pressure being transferred to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. This was not safe at all. They had to painstakingly go through all of the different possibilities and also had to make sure that the design was going to be safe. While designing the mast, they had to carefully consider the winds at the top of the building. The winds were constantly shifting due to the violent air currents. If they did manage to design a seemingly good mast, the dirigible would end up dangling above pedestrians, which was clearly not a safe situation. In the end, the safety concerns made it very difficult to implement a suitable mast design.
1103	15936	6	3	"There were three main obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced when they attempted to allow dirigibles to dock at the mooring mast. The first obstacle was ""nature itself"". Specifically, the air currents at the top of the Empire State building were so incredibly powerful that the wind was constantly changing directions in a very unpredictable manner. This meant that if a dirigible could somehow manage to fly through the strong winds and could be tied to the mast, it would ""swivel around and around"" and would end up ""dangling over pedestrians"" which ""was neither practical nor safe."" As in the case of the Hindenburg disaster, a dirigible is not legally allowed to dock at the mooring mast because it would be ""flying too low over urban areas"" and there is an ""existing law"" against such low - flying in urban zones. This is a major problem for the builders because no matter how hard they attempted to allow dirigibles to dock, they would not be legally allowed to dock dirigibles at the Mooring Mast. Lastly, many dirigibles used hydrogen gas as a fuel. Hydrogen gas is ""highly flammable"" and a dirigible using hydrogen gas is therefore also highly flammable and could potentially pose a huge disaster to the ""densely populated area such as downtown New York."" Because of potential fires, city laws, and the powerful air currents, the builders of the Empire State Building were faced with insurmountable obstacles when they tried to allow dirigibles to dock at the mooring mast."
1104	15937	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION3, the builders of the Empire State Building faced several significant obstacles in an attempt to allow dirigibles, or blimps, to dock there. One prominent reason that it was difficult to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State building was safety issues. According to Marcia Amidon L¸sted, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" With New York City and its dense population, this is a risk that simply cannot be taken. Another obstacle faced by the architects of the Empire State Building was nature itself. The start of paragraph @NUM1 states, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" With high winds, the dirigible, even if tethered to the mast, would swivel around the mooring mast in a dangerous manner. Another difficulty in docking the dirigibles was, as mentioned in the excerpt in paragraph @NUM2, ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" Due to this law, it would make it completely illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. A final obstacle the builders faced was the advancement with airplanes. The increasing popularity and efficiency of airplanes made it difficult for dirigibles to be the prime source of aeronautical transportation. Even though the builders spent a great deal of time and effort in making the Empire State Building a national landmark, which it is, they neglected many potential problems with the mooring mast which led to it never accomplishing its full potential as a docking site for dirigibles."
1105	15938	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" written by Marcia Amidon l¸sted, she explained the numerous challenges dirigibles faced when trying to dock to the Empire state building. The architects had to take into account the obstacles related to the make - up of dirigibles, the building structure, and the weather conditions when attempting to create a landing area for dirigibles. A mooring mast on the top of the Empire State Building could never be functional. Dirigibles must be lighter than air to fly. Gases such as helium and hydrogen are used to make blimps less dense. Being highly flammable, hydrogen could easily create a massive fire. The owners of the Empire State Building decided that if the blimp ever caught on fire, it would be an even larger disaster over an area with a large population. Another factor that halted the docking of dirigibles was the building structure. The docking of a dirigible adds extra stress to the Empire State Building. The architects were forced to design the framework of the building so it was strong enough to not collapse under the extra pressure. This took a significant amount of time and ""over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework"". Lastly, the weather conditions tested the architects. On the top of the Empire State Buildings, the winds are quite unpredictable. They often shift because of ""violent air current"". No matter how the builder tie the dirigible to the mast, the blimp will be in an unsafe situation. Due to the winds, the structure of the building, as well as the nature of the blimp, the architects couldn't create a viable docking area for dirigibles on the Empire State Building."
1106	15939	6	3	Work on building docks for dirigibles to land on those attached to the Empire State Building faced many problems. In paragraph @NUM1, it clearly states that dirigibles disappeared and did not become the transportation of the future. As a result, the Empire State Building never got to fulfill its purposes for dirigibles.
1107	15940	6	3	When Al Smith first had his idea to build a mast on which to dock dirigibles, it started out as friendly competition. However, nobody predicted the numerous obstacles that would be encountered while trying to execute the plan. One of these significant obstacles was simply that it was unsafe. Dirigibles used hydrogen, which is highly flammable. If there was an accident, the results would be extremely devastating in a densely - populated place like New York City. Another major obstacle was the wind. The wind currents at the top of the building shifted constantly, causing the dirigible to swing violently from side to side, which was very dangerous for passengers. One more notable obstacle was the fact that there was a law that prohibited airships from flying below a certain height in cities. Clearly, many obstacles were encountered, and in the end, the mast never ended up serving its intended purpose.
1108	15941	6	3	Based on the excerpt, obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was that the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be carefully modified and significantly strengthened to accommodate the mooring mast. Moreover, rather than building a simple utilitarian mast without any ornamentation, the architect designed a shiny glass and chrome - nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from inside. This tower had a stepped - back design that imitated the overall shape of the building itself, adding both to the complexity and the aesthetic but also presenting more challenges in the construction for the dirigible docking.
1109	15942	6	3	"Based on the @CAPS1 ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION1, the builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Many difficulties emerged during the construction of the Empire State building when Al Smith took charge of constructing the whole building. With Al Smith in control, he was determined to outstrip the height of other buildings. He secretly constructed a 185 - foot spire inside the building, which shocked the media and the public when he hoisted it up to the top of the Chrysler building. Another obstacle that was faced during the building of the Empire State building was the idea of having dirigibles being able to dock at the very top of the building. If the dirigibles were to be docked at the top of the Empire State building, they would only be held by a single cable tether, which would add large amounts of stress to the building's frame. The greatest obstacle that came to building the Empire State building with the idea of docking dirigibles at the top was safety. Most dirigibles from outside the U.S. used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is very flammable. If anything were to happen, it could potentially destroy a large part of New York. These are the reasons why the builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in the @CAPS1 ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION1."
1110	15943	6	3	The builders of the Empire State building faced several challenges in the completion of the landing dock for dirigibles. The first major problem was the frame of the building. The existing frame was not strong enough to support the dirigibles when docked, so they had to carefully reinforce the frame to withstand the significant strain that the dirigibles would present. The next problem was the lack of a suitable landing area. They decided to put an anchor on the top of the building to secure the dirigibles when docked. The anchor was a winch at the top of the building, but the violent winds at the top of the building would not allow the pilot of the dirigible to get close enough to the anchor. This was because of the fear that the dirigible might be damaged by a nearby building. Another reason why the dirigibles could not be docked on the top of the Empire State building is because of a strict law against airships flying too low over urban areas. A couple of attempts have been made, but to this day, despite the efforts, nobody has successfully docked a dirigible on top of the Empire State building.
1111	15944	6	3	"The Empire State Building is well - known for its colossal size and distinctive shape in New York City's bustling skyline. However, what most people probably do not know is that the tower on top is actually a mooring mast intended for dirigibles. This is likely a little - known fact because, unfortunately, it could never actually be used to dock blimps for numerous reasons: safety, nature, and the law. The mast would have revolutionized travel in New York if international dirigibles could stop there after long Transatlantic flights. Nevertheless, because of the gas used by foreign blimps, safety would have been a huge issue. In paragraph @NUM1, the author states, ""most dirigibles from outside the U.S used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" There was even a tragic accident with the German Hindenburg. If a blimp caught fire over the densely populated Manhattan, this would be an even greater problem of safety. Nature was also a significant matter of safety that needed to be considered. At such a great height on the Empire State Building, there are strong, unpredictable winds. As described, ""even if the dirigibles were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast"" (paragraph @NUM2). There were no means of anchoring the back of the blimp because heavy weights such as those which would be used in open field landings would pose a serious threat when hanging off the back of a blimp from over @NUM3 feet with pedestrians below. There was simply no practical way to combat the natural elements that prevented the possibility of blimp docking. Finally, it would have been illegal for a dirigible to dock at the mooring mast on the Empire State Building. It was against the law for ""airships flying too low over urban areas"" (∂ @NUM4). The law ended up being the final insurmountable obstacle. So, the Empire State Building never became a docking post for blimps, but it still stands as an incredible architectural feat that continues to amaze visitors from around the world."
1112	15945	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous and significant obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One major hurdle was the structural integrity of the building. They had to add over sixty thousand dollars' worth of extensive changes to the building's framework. This was because docking a dirigible on the building would put an enormous amount of stress on the framework and foundation of the building. The forces exerted by a large - sized dirigible during docking and mooring were substantial, and the original design of the building was not equipped to handle such loads. Another problem was related to safety. Most dirigibles outside the U.S. used hydrogen, which was highly flammable. An accident at this building, located in a densely populated area, would be extremely dangerous. The risk of a hydrogen - filled dirigible catching fire and causing widespread damage was a major concern for the builders. Nature was said to be the biggest obstacle. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" (line @NUM1). These strong and unpredictable winds would cause the dirigible to sway back and forth uncontrollably. This would endanger not only the pedestrians below but also the passengers on the dirigible. Lastly, a law was in place against airships flying too low in urban areas. All of these obstacles combined made docking a dirigible at the Empire State Building an impossible task. In the end, despite the builders' efforts, the challenges were insurmountable, and the idea of dirigible docking at the building had to be abandoned."
1113	15946	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"", the builders encountered many obstacles on the way to allowing dirigibles to dock on top of the Empire State Building. Some of those obstacles were as follows. The main and most pressing concern was the safety of the passengers boarding and unboarding the dirigibles, as well as the people below on the streets of New York. The concern for the people below was heightened by the fact that the dirigible sometimes was floating with hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable, and the builders did not want to take any chances of the dirigible blowing up, which could cause a massive disaster in the densely populated area. Another main concern was an ""existing law over airships flying too low over urban areas"" (par @NUM1). The dirigible, floating with the air and being as long as @NUM2 ft., presented a unique problem. The back of the dirigible, where it wasn't securely fastened, would circle around the mooring mast due to the high - speed wind currents. The winds were shifting all the time, making it a very big safety issue. The constant movement of the dirigible could lead to collisions with the building or other structures, endangering everyone in the vicinity. Another obstacle to the dirigible docking was mainly put into place because of jealousy. The man behind this obstacle was jealous because his competition, Al Smith, was catching up with him before the idea of the dirigible docking came to mind. In conclusion, these multiple obstacles, ranging from safety concerns to personal motives, ultimately made it impossible for dirigibles to dock on top of the Empire State Building."
1114	15947	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were significant. They decided not to pursue it because there were real and dangerous risks. The dirigible could potentially hit other buildings or even itself during the docking process. As stated, ""Could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1 lines @NUM2). These strong winds made it extremely difficult to maneuver the large - sized dirigible into a position where it could be safely tied to the mooring mast on the Empire State Building. The force of the winds could push the dirigible off - course, causing it to collide with neighboring structures or the building itself. This lack of control in the windy conditions meant that it wasn't safe to proceed with the plan of allowing dirigibles to dock. In the end, the safety of the public, the passengers on the dirigibles, and the integrity of the building were of utmost importance, and the decision to abandon the idea of dirigible docking was a necessary one."
1115	15948	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @PERSON1, the builders of the Empire State Building faced a series of challenging obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the primary obstacles they faced was figuring out a practical and safe way to dock the dirigibles. Practicability and safety were closely intertwined challenges because the builders of the Empire State Building were the first to attempt docking dirigibles in mid - air. Since @CAPS1 they had no past trials to refer to, they had to start from scratch. In this project, practicability and safety worked hand - in - hand. For example, ""..engineers [had] to dope out a practical, workable arrangement..."" @CAPS1 so that the airships could be moored to the mast easily and securely. This would not only assure the passengers' safety but also provide stability to the building. Ensuring that the docking process was smooth and reliable was crucial to prevent any accidents during boarding and unboarding. The second obstacle the builders faced was distributing the stress added to the building as the dirigible docked. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" @CAPS2 All of this stress on the foundation was a significant challenge because the foundation ""... was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" Another challenge that arose was that, to accommodate this situation, ""the steel frame [of the building had] to be modified and strengthened..."" The modification to the building's framework was a costly endeavor, worth ""over sixty thousand dollars..."" In conclusion, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many complex and costly obstacles in their attempt to dock dirigibles in their building. Despite their efforts, these challenges ultimately proved to be difficult to overcome, and the plan to make the Empire State Building a dirigible docking site did not come to fruition."
1116	15949	6	3	"Al Smith and several other workers are actively engaged in constructing the Empire State Building. They've been encountering a few obstacles with the project. For instance, they can't build it as high as initially planned. They have to repair the mast skeleton if they wish to proceed further. Take the dirigibles as an example. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States use hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is extremely flammable. When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey on May 6, 1937, this led to the implementation of a law to prevent similar incidents from happening near urban areas. This shows that there were limitations with the Empire State Building project that they had to work around, but despite these challenges, they continued to strive towards completing the building."
1117	15950	6	3	The obstacles that were faced by the Empire State Building builders were numerous. First of all, if they had carried out their plans for the mooring mast without properly considering the weight of the dirigible, the building would surely have an excessive amount of stress forced on the foundation when the dirigible docked. Next, the fact that the dirigible weighs even less than air is both a negative and a positive. The negative aspect is that fierce winds would take control of the back of the dirigible. With many pedestrians in the city below, this idea was quickly deemed unsafe. Lastly, it was filled with hydrogen, which, as is well - known, is highly flammable. The use of hydrogen was very dangerous, and it only added to the negative side of the project. In conclusion, these multiple obstacles made the plan of using the building for dirigible docking extremely difficult to execute.
1118	15951	6	3	There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of those obstacles was that the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure couldn't be effectively transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly 55 feet below. Another thing that was an obstacle for the builders was the high cost; over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework. Also, the architects could not simply place a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. The last obstacle was safety. Most of the dirigibles from outside of the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. This led to an accident on May 6, 1937. The Empire State Building's management realized how much worse that accident could have been if it happened in downtown New York. These are some of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced, which ultimately made the dirigible docking plan unfeasible.
1119	15952	6	3	In, The Mooring Mast, by the architects, there were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One problem was that the architects could not simply drop the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. A thousand - foot dirigible would add a significant amount of stress to the building's frame. This means the steel frame would have to be carefully modified and strengthened. Another setback was that most blimps from outside the United States used hydrogen, and hydrogen is highly flammable. Nature itself was the greatest obstacle. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to the violent air currents. If the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around. Lead weights were an option, but having them dangle above pedestrians on the street was not a safe solution. The other practical reason why blimps could not dock at the Empire State Building was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building. In summary, these various obstacles made the dirigible docking project at the Empire State Building a near - impossible task.
1120	15953	6	3	There were many different obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. The rooftop of the building didn't provide the necessary space and stability for a safe dirigible landing. Another obstacle was that most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. This posed a great risk to the building and the surrounding area. Those were some of the different obstacles they faced which caused the lack of success in making the Empire State Building a viable dirigible docking site. In the end, these challenges proved too difficult to overcome for the project to move forward.
1121	15954	6	3	On December 11, 1929, a well - known man named Al Smith publicly announced that he was undertaking the ambitious project of building the world's tallest building, reaching a staggering height of 1,250 feet. This remarkable building was the iconic Empire State Building located in the bustling city of New York. The initial plan was for it to serve as a docking point for dirigibles, with a special mooring facility. However, there were several unforeseen obstacles that would prevent the successful use of the dirigible mooring. Al Smith announced the construction of this mooring mast with great fanfare but failed to mention the potential challenges the builders of the Empire State Building would encounter when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the most significant obstacles was the wind factor. At such a great height, the powerful winds would cause the dirigible's back end to sway uncontrollably. Another major issue was the safety concern of having foreign dirigibles filled with highly flammable gases moored too close to a densely populated area like New York. Moreover, before any dirigibles could be moored, the constructors had to invest additional time and a substantial amount of money to make the building much more sturdy to support the weight and forces exerted by the dirigibles. Despite the grand vision, these challenges ultimately meant that the dirigible mooring at the Empire State Building never became a practical reality.
1122	15955	6	3	There were numerous and complex obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Firstly, the architects encountered a significant problem right from the start. They couldn't simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. A thousand - foot dirigible, moored at the top of the building and held by a single cable tether, would impose a great deal of stress on the building's frame. The second major problem was that the stress from the dirigible's load, combined with the powerful wind pressure, would have to be transmitted all the way down to the building's foundation. This required a very stable and well - designed structure to handle such forces. The third issue was that the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be extensively modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. It was estimated that it would cost over sixty thousand dollars to reinforce the building's framework. Unfortunately, despite all the efforts and considerations, all these problems remained unsolved. The great height of the building made the project seem more difficult, and it was decided to postpone it to a later date. In the end, instead of dirigibles becoming the transportation of the future at the Empire State Building, the opportunity was given away to airplanes, which were more practical and less problematic in this context.
1123	15956	6	3	"When the architects first set out to create a safe landing zone for the dirigibles, they inadvertently overlooked several crucial factors. The Empire State Building soars to a height of over @NUM1 feet. At such lofty heights, the winds become extremely powerful and unpredictable. These strong winds would blow the dirigible all over the place, making it nearly impossible to dock safely. This fact was clearly demonstrated in paragraph @NUM2. The well - known Goodyear blimp called the ""Columbia"" made an attempt to reach the mooring mast. Despite having a highly skilled pilot at the helm, he was unable to get the steel - framed balloon close enough to dock on the spire. Another factor that the architects failed to take into account was the nature of the gas used in most dirigibles. Most dirigibles were filled with hydrogen, which is highly flammable. If a zeppelin were to catch on fire while docked or in the vicinity of the Empire State Building, it would result in a massive ball of fire plummeting down onto the busy streets of downtown New York. The tragic incident of the ""Hindenburg"" served as a vivid and terrifying example, which was more than enough to make people change their minds about having a massive flammable balloon hovering over the streets of New York City. In light of these risks, the plan for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was ultimately deemed too dangerous and unfeasible."
1124	15957	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, there were a few significant obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. One important reason was that ""most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" The owners of the Empire State Building were acutely aware that if a dirigible were to be destroyed by fire over a densely populated area like New York, it could lead to a huge and catastrophic accident. One of the greatest challenges, however, was nature itself. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" When the dirigibles attempted to dock, they often found it extremely difficult, sometimes even impossible, to get close to the building because of the strong and erratic winds. Having dirigibles hanging over the pedestrians on the busy streets of New York was considered both impractical and a serious safety hazard. Due to the powerful forces of nature and the pressing safety concerns, the builders of the Empire State Building faced insurmountable problems in allowing dirigibles to dock there, and the plan was ultimately abandoned."
1125	15958	6	3	"In paragraph 6, it was clearly stated that ""New York City was the lack of a suitable landing space"" for dirigibles. This was a major hurdle as dirigibles require a large and unobstructed area to land safely. Another significant obstacle, as described in paragraph @NUM1, was nature itself. The strong winds would push the dirigible around, especially at the back end, making it difficult to control and dock. The erratic wind patterns at the height of the Empire State Building were a constant challenge. Additionally, in paragraph @NUM2, there was mention of the existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This legal restriction added another layer of complexity to the plan of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. These various problems, including the lack of landing space, the interference of nature's winds, and the legal constraints, were the main issues that the Empire State Building's builders faced. In the end, these obstacles made it extremely difficult, if not impossible, to implement the dirigible docking plan at the Empire State Building."
1126	15959	6	3	"The builders and engineers involved in allowing The Empire State Building to dock dirigibles on a mooring mast around one thousand two hundred and fifty feet in the air faced numerous formidable obstacles. In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, taken from The Empire State Building, the reader is taken through the arduous journey of enabling dirigibles, or blimps, to refuel and transport passengers atop the Empire State Building. This was far from an easy task; in fact, it was never achieved. Some reasons for this are related to the very building itself. The mooring mast was to be installed on top of the building, and its height, weight, and the wind pressure acting on the building posed significant dangers. In paragraph nine, it is clearly stated that: ""Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" But even more than just the building itself, the location of the Empire State Building in densely populated downtown New York created a few major hindrances. First, most international blimps used Hydrogen rather than helium, which is highly flammable. A fire or explosion in the location where the mooring mast was to be placed would be utterly devastating to the city. Secondly, there were shifting winds ""due to violent air currents"" atop the building. They caused the backend of the dirigible to swerve uncontrollably. Weights could not be used on the blimp, though, because of the people below and the great height at which everything took place. Finally, there were laws in place against airships flying too low over urban areas. So essentially, the objective of this project could not be reached unless legislation was changed. All of these obstacles made it extremely difficult to dock dirigibles on top of the mooring mast on the Empire State Building. However, two blimps did attempt to land there. The U.S. Navy dirigible ""Los Angeles"" and the Goodyear Blimp ""Columbia"" both were unsuccessful in landing due to intense winds and sharp spires of nearby buildings. This project is a prime example of a beneficial idea which was nearly impossible to execute, highlighting the complex challenges that can arise in ambitious engineering endeavors."
1127	15960	6	3	Based on the excerpt, I don't think they should have attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there. According to the excerpt, I think this because something really bad could have happened, and it's quite likely that something probably has happened. Back then, they really had no choice except for balloons as air - travel options were limited. Given the numerous risks associated with docking dirigibles at the Empire State Building, such as the building's structural limitations and the environmental factors, it was a risky venture. In the end, it seems that the potential negative consequences far outweighed the possible benefits, making the attempt ill - advised.
1128	15961	6	3	"There were significant obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. In the excerpt, the author clearly states that nature is one of the biggest problems for the mast. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" The author further explains that the wind on top of the buildings is extremely dangerous for the dirigible. ""The winds on top of the buildings were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". The author also vividly describes what the dirigible would do as an effect of the wind. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast. These natural wind - related issues made it extremely difficult for dirigibles to safely dock. Overall, these were the major obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, highlighting the power of nature in challenging ambitious engineering plans."
1129	15962	6	3	The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was very hard for them. A dirigible having to dock on the Empire State Building is probably not an easy feat. A mooring mast added to the top of the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling. The obstacles included that Al Smith demanded the builders to make the Empire State Building taller. Also, he wanted it to be more ornamental, and to put in something like a pyramid at the top. The workers were exhausted from these additional demands. One obstacle that the builders faced in expanding their use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. The other obstacles were that the architects and the builders of the Empire State Building consulted with experts, taking detailed tours of the equipment and mooring operations. However, the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was by nature itself, with elements like wind and weather conditions posing constant challenges. In conclusion, these multiple obstacles combined made it extremely difficult to achieve the goal of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
1130	15963	6	3	"This project towards ""transportation of the future"" for the Empire State Building was no easy task. One of the major obstacles was the ""stress to the building's frame"". The workers had to make over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications to accommodate the dirigibles. This would strengthen the frame of the building so that the wind pressure would be ""transmitted all the way to the building's foundation"". Another issue with this mooring mast was the ""violent air currents"" that were ""constantly shifting"" the winds on the roof. This would cause the dirigible to swing around the building while it was docked. Allowing these giant aircrafts to ""dangle high above pedestrians on the street"" was ""neither practical nor safe"". These obstacles, including the structural stress and the dangerous wind conditions, caused the workers and architects to postpone the build. As a result, the ambitious plan for the Empire State Building to serve as a dirigible docking site had to be put on hold until solutions to these challenges could be found."
1131	15964	6	3	One of the original purposes of the Empire State Building was to be a well - equipped loading dock for dirigibles or blimps. This strategic move was meant to help New York firmly establish itself as a leader in modern traveling. Yet, there were numerous and complex obstacles that eventually put an end to the grand idea of a mooring mast. A major problem was nature itself. The wind on top of the building was constantly and unpredictably changing because of the complex air currents. This erratic wind would cause the dirigible to swing wildly around the mast. The idea of weighting the back of the dirigible was immediately ruled out because of the significant danger it imposed on the pedestrians walking on the busy street below. Also, there was a strict law that stated airships could not fly too low over urban areas, which would make it completely illegal for any dirigible to tie up or even approach the area. In the end, these insurmountable issues led to the abandonment of the ambitious plan.
1132	15965	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple and challenging obstacles when trying to enable dirigibles to dock on the top of their building. They encountered a variety of issues like strict laws, serious safety problems, and also natural difficulties when trying to execute this bold and gutsy idea. They first faced the problems of law. An existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas was a major hurdle. This law posed an obstacle for the builders because they would have to dock the blimp without flying in this restricted fly zone, which was extremely difficult to achieve. The second problem was dealing with safety. When the dirigible Hindenburg was tragically destroyed, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been over downtown New York. After blimps were proven to be highly flammable, the builders saw that an accident over highly populated New York City would be far more catastrophic than in a rural area. Finally, the builders faced problems with nature. The dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of the strong and forceful winds. The builders realized that the drastic and unpredictable changes in wind conditions at the top of the building were not appropriate for a blimp. These designers had a remarkable and forward - thinking idea, but it was ultimately shot down by the multiple obstacles that arose.
1133	15966	6	3	"There were many complex obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building had to face. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below"". This clearly shows that the stress of the dirigibles and their shifty movements would put a great deal of stress on the building's foundation, and they didn't want that stress to potentially topple over the building. Also, they said ""The winds on the top of the building were constantly and violently shifting due to the turbulent air current"". This indicates that they were worried that the strong and unpredictable wind might take the balloon away from the building, causing it to injure people on the ground or in the vicinity. These are only a few of the many obstacles the builders had to face, and unfortunately, these issues made the plan of dirigible docking unfeasible."
1134	15967	6	3	The builders faced several significant obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. One of the biggest and most difficult obstacles to overcome was safety for everyone involved. The builders had to worry about the safety of the passengers coming in and out of the dirigible, the people walking on the nearby busy streets, and the people inside the building. Safety was one of the main reasons why the dock was never completed. Another huge obstacle that the builders faced was nature. This is true because the winds at the top of the tall building were always changing in speed and direction, and this would make it extremely hard to land the dirigible safely on it. Like the excerpt states in paragraph @NUM1, dirigibles were weighted down in the back by lead weights, and this would cause a serious problem with pedestrians walking under in the streets as the weights could potentially fall and cause harm. Due to these overwhelming obstacles, the plan of dirigible docking at the Empire State Building had to be abandoned.
1135	15968	6	3	"There are a couple of notable obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of these obstacles is that it would add a considerable amount of stress to the building's frame. For example, in paragraph @NUM1 it says, ""A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add significant stress to the building's frame"". This stress could potentially damage the structural integrity of the building over time. Another obstacle was that the steel would have to be modified. ""The steel of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new and demanding situation."" These are some of the important obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, and these challenges made the plan very difficult to implement."
1136	15969	6	3	"The idea was, from the very start, kind of unrealistic. When these dirigibles attempted to dock to this building, the building's structure simply wouldn't be capable of withstanding the violent winds and the zeppelin. This situation caused numerous problems. For instance, what if the dirigible tried to dock and the heavy winds blew its tail end around to hit a building? The Hindenburg, another well - known zeppelin, was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, @ORGANIZATION1. If a disaster like this were to occur in such a densely populated place, it would surely lead to chaos. Being both impractical and unsafe, this plan clearly wouldn't work. They would need something far more stable. Evidently, the plans of this weren't completely thought through. All these problems, when combined, would cause them to postpone the building of the landing gear. As a result, these plans for the ""new"" age of transportation with dirigibles would never come to fruition. Airplanes were a safer and more efficient new way to travel, and thus became the preferred choice."
1137	15970	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many significant obstacles that prevented dirigibles from docking there. A primary concern was safety. After the Hindenburg, a large German dirigible, was destroyed by fire over New Jersey, it prompted a realization. Had such a disastrous fire occurred over New York, a highly populated urban area filled with skyscrapers and busy streets, it could have been far, far worse. Another major obstacle that was encountered was the bad weather conditions. The winds on the top of the Empire State Building were consistently shifting in different directions due to the building's height and the surrounding air currents, making it absolutely impossible for a dirigible to stay unmoving. If the dirigible was so unsteady, floating precariously above millions of people going about their daily lives, it would be extremely unsafe. Lastly, it was illegal for a dirigible to tie up to the mast or even approach the area. There was a strict law that prevented all airships from flying too low over urban areas to protect the people below. Due to all the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building, it is quite apparent that dirigibles were simply not meant to dock there, and the idea had to be abandoned.
1138	15971	6	3	"The idea of the dirigibles docking on the mooring mast was very smart and could've potentially been a great innovation. However, the builders of the Empire State Building faced a series of problems when trying to achieve that goal. One major problem was that the wind forces were too strong to allow a dirigible to dock at the mast. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast"" (∂ @NUM1). This constant movement made it extremely difficult to keep the dirigible in place. Another reason is the safety of the people. Not all dirigibles were made the same. In other countries, dirigibles had different kinds of gases in them. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (∂ @NUM2). Since hydrogen is highly flammable, the builders had to seriously take into consideration how safe people would be flying in a dirigible, especially when it was close to a populated building like the Empire State. Lastly, there was a law against aircraft flying too close to a populated area. ""... was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area..."" (∂ @NUM3). The docking at the Empire State Building was a great idea but there were too many challenges that faced the builders, making it an unfeasible plan."
1139	15972	6	3	Dirigibles had a top speed of eighty miles per hour, which was relatively fast for their time. Some were as long as one thousand feet, the same length as four city blocks in New York City, making them quite massive. So, one significant obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. Al Smith saw an opportunity for his Empire State Building. He said a mooring mast added to the top of the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours. During this time, they could be refueled or serviced, and passengers could safely get off and on. Dirigibles were docked by means of an electric winch. This winch would haul in a line from the ship and then tie it securely to a mast. Once tied, by carefully swinging the body of the dirigible, the passengers could step on and off the ship. However, despite this seemingly good plan, there were many challenges that would later prove difficult to overcome.
1140	15973	6	3	The problems that the workers had to face in letting the dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building were crucial & @CAPS1. Because first, if they would have tried to put a mooring mast on the top of the building roof and then have a thousand - pound dirigible on top of it, the weight @CAPS2 would be too much for it to hold. And the stress of the dirigible's weight and the strong wind pressure would need to be transmitted to the building's foundation which was 11 hundred feet below. The frame of the building would have to be stronger and properly modified @CAPS3 so that it could work. But it would cost over @MONEY1 to put into the building framework in order for it to succeed. But the most prominent reason why it was difficult for the workers is because of the winds. If the dirigible landed, they would need weights to weigh it down. However, it would be dangling high above pedestrians on the busy streets below, which wasn't practical or safe at all. In conclusion, these problems made it nearly impossible for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
1141	15974	6	3	"While building the Empire State Building, numerous obstacles had occurred. During the meticulous process of planning the specifications of the building, architects started to gradually realize that there could be many intricate complications. Several significant complications emerged during the actual construction process. Architects carefully noticed that the building's original design was not made to easily add additional parts. As an experienced architect said, ""it could not simply drop a mooring mast on the top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" Wind was another harsh and unforgiving factor for the construction of the Empire State Building itself. If ""held by a single cable tether, it would add excessive stress to the building's frame. The engineers would also have to deal much with the building's issues."" The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be thoroughly modified and strengthened to accommodate this new and challenging situation. Safety and nature also had a big and crucial role in the obstacles of the building of the Empire State Building. Architects planned out to maintain the dirigibles very high up. However, wanting to do this could be extremely dangerous. ""Dangling high above pedestrians on the street, it was neither practical nor safe. Building the dirigible would have caused many accidents, injuries, and deaths if made. Nature would also be involved in this plan. ""Open landing fields could be weighed down in the back with lead weights. If any day had very fierce winds, this object could have come down and caused serious danger. In conclusion, these various obstacles made the construction process of the Empire State Building with the dirigible docking plan a highly challenging endeavor."
1142	15975	6	3	"Although the builders of the Empire State Building managed some of the obstacles with allowing dirigibles to dock there, many of the issues were left unsolved. When carefully designing the mast to accommodate the blimp, the architects realized the significant pressure this would put on the building's frame. In order to support the weight of the dirigible, they needed to make ""over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications"" (paragraph @NUM1) to the structure of the building. Also, the builders had to develop a well - thought - out way to tether the dirigible to the building to allow passengers and supplies to unboard. Therefore, the architects designed a ""rocket - shaped mast... of shiny aluminum... which also housed elevators and stairs"" (paragraph @NUM2). However, the builders forgot to incorporate the strong winds at the top of the building. Once the front of the dirigible was docked, the back of the blimp would swivel around radically. Furthermore, the builders disregarded existing laws that clearly banned dirigibles from flying low over cities, as it states in paragraph @NUM3. This precaution was due to the safety hazard that these dirigibles posed since they were highly flammable from the hydrogen used. These imposing obstacles made the use of the Empire State Building as a dock an unrealistic and unfeasible idea. In conclusion, despite some efforts, the numerous unsolved issues made the dirigible docking plan at the Empire State Building impractical."
1143	15976	6	3	In the excerpt of the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders went through many arduous obstacles in the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. At first, Al Smith had a grand vision that this newly designed building would be the tallest one in the world. Now, this 1,250 - foot building aimed to reach new heights by adding a top hat to the building and allowing dirigibles to dock there. Passengers would be able to get off and on the blimp, along with the conductor refueling its engine. Although this was a great and innovative idea, there were many issues that the constructors did not foresee. This is because the thousand - foot dirigible would add a substantial amount of stress to the building's frame. The wind would also cause thousands of dollars in damage. To ensure that no damage or harm would be inflicted on the building or the residents of New York, the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be strengthened. This cost the city of New York over @MONEY1 in the hopes of putting it on the map for modern travel. In conclusion, the high cost and unforeseen issues made the dirigible docking plan a challenging and perhaps not - fully - attainable objective.
1144	15977	6	3	"The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the building were lack of sufficient area, a densely populated area, and the fact that hydrogen is highly flammable. ""Also known today as blimps, dirigibles were actually enormous steel - framed balloons, with envelopes of cotton fabric filled with hydrogen and helium to make them lighter than air."" Hydrogen is extremely dangerous as it's flammable, and the Empire State Building is located in a densely populated area, so it's extremely risky to take such a chance. Also, as the German dirigible ""Hindenburg"" was tragically destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, it clearly proved to the owners of the Empire State Building that it's more dangerous than it appears. Another reason why dirigibles couldn't moor at the top of the building was the existing strict law against all airships flying too low over populated areas. This law was put in place as a necessary precaution due to the significant safety hazard that these dirigibles posed since they were highly flammable from the hydrogen used. In conclusion, these multiple and serious obstacles made it nearly impossible for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building."
1145	15978	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"", by @ORGANIZATION1, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many daunting obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. They had to come up with a safe and well - structured plan which included detailed building designs and figure out problems they failed to notice from the very beginning. The first obstacle was having in - depth meetings with the navy and other experts to come up with a safe and practical plan. They had to find a way to land the dirigibles without adding excessive stress to the building's frame and without spending @MONEY1 to strengthen it. The builders came up with a plan that precisely included what the mast would have to be made of and what would be on each floor. They even had to finish the roof before the mooring mast could take place. The largest obstacle was one they failed to see from the start. In building the mooring mast, they would have to face the daunting obstacles that nature brought, which were simply insurmountable. Safety was the main problem. If a fire occurred, there would be a catastrophic disaster. The winds were too strong due to violent air currents, and there was a law strictly prohibiting airships from flying too low. After all this painstaking work, they couldn't overcome the obstacles, and the mooring mast was never built. In conclusion, the combination of nature - related challenges and legal restrictions made the construction of the mooring mast an impossible task."
1146	15979	6	3	The obstacles the builders faced were numerous. One of the things they faced was that initially, many of them were unsure if they even wanted to build the tower. And another reason was that most dirigibles from outside of the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. Moreover, one of the greater obstacles was nature itself in relation to the mooring mast. In the end, these multiple challenges made the construction a complex and difficult task.
1147	15980	6	3	"Based on the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @PERSON1, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many problems. Their first problem was that ""[t]he architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of... the flat roof."" The weight of the mast would make the framework crumble, so the builders had to carefully modify and strengthen the steel frame of the Empire State Building to handle the additional load. Secondly, most foreign dirigibles were highly flammable, making it extremely dangerous to moor them over the densely populated New York City. Also, nature itself was a significant problem. The winds at the top of the building were so strong that it would be perilous to moor dirigibles there. And finally, there was the law against dirigibles flying too low over urban areas. The mooring mast atop the Empire State Building was a good idea in theory, but it was very dangerous, highly unlikely to be feasible, and against the law, which ultimately led to its non - implementation."
1148	15981	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle they faced was that they could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. As stated, ""The thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame"" (paragraph @NUM1). The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. Thus, the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be carefully modified and strengthened to accommodate this new and challenging situation. The second obstacle of allowing dirigibles to dock there was that ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (paragraph @NUM2), which would make docking and staying stable extremely difficult. Another obstacle they faced was the ""existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (paragraph @NUM3). This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area, effectively putting a halt to the dirigible docking plans."
1149	15982	6	3	"The Empire State Building was built as the tallest building in the world and even today still remains one of the tallest. It had design plans with more of a purpose than just being the tallest building. It was supposed to serve as a passenger exchange and a refueling dock for dirigibles. Most people do not know this though because there were many complications involved with the architectural designs of this plan for the mast. Architects knew it would not be easy to build such a creation and that they ""could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building."" They knew, for example, that the building needed to be carefully modified to accommodate for the added stress from the mast, and the height of the building would need to be slightly increased to better suit the docking needs. They made the necessary changes to the building, but the realities of the project soon set in, and the mast was never built. As stated, ""the greatest reason being for safety."" The hydrogen used to power the dirigibles was highly flammable and endangered the citizens of New York. Also, according to the article, ""the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" There are powerful winds at that high of an altitude that would blow and make it extremely difficult for the dirigibles to be properly controlled and navigated, which ultimately led to the abandonment of the mooring mast plan."
1150	15983	6	3	"Based on ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple obstacles in their attempts to allow dirigibles to anchor at the top of the building. A dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether adds stress to the building's frame. The architects needed to find a way to effectively transmit the stress of the wind pressure and the dirigible's load to the @ORGANIZATION1 foundation to ensure the building's structural integrity. Safety had played a major role in the fate of the mooring mast. Outside the United States, most dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. If a dirigible was to catch fire above a densely populated area like New York City, there would be a disastrous outcome. The greatest obstacle to the use of the mooring mast was nature. Above the Empire State Building, the wind was constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if a dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the dirigible would still be unstable, making it nearly impossible to land safely. In conclusion, these multiple obstacles made the plan of allowing dirigibles to anchor at the top of the Empire State Building unfeasible."
1151	15984	6	3	"In the excerpt written by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, she vividly describes the numerous obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. In the excerpt, the author clearly told the readers that after building the Empire State Building, the builders had to painstakingly reconstruct the entire building, making it stronger to firmly support the top. ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be carefully modified and strengthened to accommodate this new and challenging situation"" (paragraph @NUM1). The workers of the building also had to carry out their difficult tasks at a dizzying height of 1,250 feet. They not only had to laboriously rebuild the foundation and enhance the strength of the building but also make crucial improvements to the top. ""Two months after the workers joyously celebrated framing the entire building, they were back at work to raise an American flag again - this time at the very top of the frame for the mooring mast."" These are just some of the many arduous hardships the workers had to face, highlighting the immense challenges in this ambitious project."
1152	15985	6	3	"Obstacles the builders had to face with the Empire State Building were that they did not have the sufficient technology to safely land a dirigible on the mooring mast. In February 1931, @CAPS1 Clavan of the building's architectural office seriously said, ""The as yet unsolved problems of mooring airships to a fixed mast at such a great height made it highly desirable to postpone to a later date the final installation of the landing gear."" After @CAPS1 Clavan made this statement, the use of dirigibles gradually disappeared. By the late 1930s, the dirigibles had been completely replaced by airplanes. Also, the builders had to construct an electric winch and a gang plank. The electric winch is used to haul in a line from the front of the ship and then securely tie it to the mast, and the gang plank leads to an open observation platform. These additional requirements added to the complexity of the project, ultimately contributing to the abandonment of the dirigible - docking plan."
1153	15986	6	3	"It was once wisely said, ""Where there is a will, there is a way."" However, they didn't include the part about the numerous obstacles you will have to go through. For instance, there was a strong will and an initial way for the docking of dirigibles on the Empire State Building, but the architects just didn't thoroughly work out all the possible problems of their grand idea. Like the fact that only American dirigibles used helium instead of hydrogen, which limited the availability of suitable dirigibles. Also, the wind currents have a much stronger force that high up in the air than at the regular life level, making docking extremely difficult. Moreover, the un - ideal place they were trying to use presented a major challenge. They should've taken heed to the businessman's slogan ""@CAPS1, @CAPS1, @CAPS1."" Ignoring these factors ultimately led to the impracticality of the dirigible - docking plan."
1154	15987	6	3	"At sporting events, people have long gotten used to seeing the @CAPS1 blimp or the Goodyear blimp gracefully floating in the sky. Now they are commonly used for advertising, but not many people know that they were once seriously thought of as a form of transportation. The excerpt ""The Mooring Mast,"" by @ORGANIZATION2, clearly shows not only that the original purpose for the mast of the Empire State Building was for mooring blimps but also reveals the many significant problems faced with blimp travel. Safety was a huge and critical issue because the blimps, or dirigibles, were filled with Hydrogen, which is highly flammable. It would be an unimaginable and catastrophic disaster if one of them exploded over New York City. Another problem was that the winds were constantly changing, and there was no reliable way to keep the dirigibles from moving erratically in the wind, which could be extremely dangerous. There was, also, a strict law about how low you can fly over urban areas, and in order to land correctly, you would be breaking that law. Flying that low would risk the wind pushing the dirigible into the top of the building and puncturing it. Al Smith had a good and innovative idea for the Empire State Building's mast, however, there were simply too many insurmountable problems to make it a reality."
1155	15988	6	3	"There were many significant obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The man who came up with the bold plan was Al Smith, who keenly saw the great opportunity to add a mooring mast to the very top of the building. This addition would allow dirigibles to stably anchor there for several hours for refueling or necessary service and to safely let passengers on or off. But with this ambitious plan came a great deal of hard work. And they couldn't simply casually drop a mooring mast on top of the building. The architects had to carefully make detailed plans on how they were going to precisely set up the mooring mast. In the story, it clearly says, ""Once the architects had meticulously designed the mooring mast and made necessary changes to the existing plans for the building's skeleton, construction proceeded as methodically planned. When the building had been framed to the 85th floor, the roof had to be completely finished before the framing for the mooring mast could take place. The mast also had a strong skeleton of steel and was elegantly clad in stainless steel with glass windows."" Despite these efforts, the challenges in making the dirigible - docking a reality remained substantial."
1156	15989	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders faced numerous obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. An acute problem they faced was that a thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, added significant stress to the building's frame. The stress of the blimp's load, combined with wind pressure, would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation. To handle this, the steel frame of the Empire State Building had to be carefully strengthened to accommodate this unique docking situation. In the end, despite the challenges, they managed to make some modifications to ensure a certain level of safety for the docking process."
1157	15990	6	3	They had to build the tower with utmost precision or else there would be serious landing problems. If they added the sightseeing feature, they believed people would pay any price. However, the cost and effort of keeping the tower stable while accommodating the dirigibles were not worth it. In the end, the people involved were optimistic about making this a very popular thing. But it was not entirely up to them as wind and landing issues always stood in their way. So, they spent a large amount of money to restabilize the building. This investment, surprisingly, ended up being a profitable venture and offered visitors a once - in - a - lifetime ride.
1158	15991	6	3	During the construction of the Empire State Building, there were several notable obstacles the builders faced to have the dirigibles be able to dock on the Empire State Building. The first major obstacle the builders faced was carefully figuring out how to modify and strengthen the steel frame of the Empire State Building to accommodate the mooring mast on top of the building. These modifications would cost over sixty thousand dollars, which was a substantial amount of money back in the @DATE1's. Once the builders finished framing the entire building, the greatest obstacle to constructing the mooring mast emerged. This obstacle was nature itself. Violent air currents would cause the back of the blimps to swivel around and around the mast. The blimp would need weights to hold it steady, but these weights would be hanging over people on the street, and this was neither practical nor safe. In conclusion, these challenges made the dirigible docking plan extremely difficult to execute.
1159	15992	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building encountered significant obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Dirigibles were initially hailed as the transportation of the future. However, in New York City, there was a lack of a suitable landing area. The speed at which dirigibles traveled, combined with the area's high - altitude wind speed, raised serious concerns. The dirigible plan became more and more unreasonable, especially after an accident occurred in @LOCATION2. Considering the height, wind, speed, and location, using dirigibles for docking at the Empire State Building was no longer a viable idea. In the end, they had to abandon the plan for safety and practicality reasons.
1160	15993	6	3	"In ""The mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced were significant, especially for the designers who strived to make it perfect. They went through a great deal of hard work, put in a lot of effort, and spent a considerable amount of time on the project. They tried to make various arrangements for the government people. The dirigibles were always in close proximity to the mooring mast, and the builders were constantly afraid that it would knock over one day. They also hoped that dirigibles would become the transportation of the future, competing with airplanes. However, instead, the dirigibles' area became the world's highest soda fountain and tea garden for the sightseers. So, their original plans didn't quite work out as they had envisioned, but everything else, such as the building's overall functionality and its popularity as a tourist spot, seemed to work out okay."
1161	15994	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders faced numerous obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock. One significant obstacle was figuring out how to attach the mooring mast on top of the building. As stated in paragraph nine, ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" They had to devise a safe and reliable way to attach it securely. Another major obstacle was that they had to strengthen and modify the building. Paragraph nine mentioned that ""A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" This required careful engineering and construction work. The last notable obstacle was described in paragraph nine when it was explained that ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" The stress might be so excessive that it could potentially cause the building to collapse. In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon @ORGANIZATION2, the builders faced many challenges as to allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building in New York City, and these obstacles ultimately made the task extremely difficult."
1162	15995	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"", the builders of the Empire State Building would have faced a multitude of consequences in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. A regular - sized dirigible was made of ""enormous steel - framed balloons."" These dirigibles could reach speeds of up to ""eighty miles per hour and could cruise at seventy miles per hour."" The Empire State Building would have encountered issues as ""a dirigible dangling high above pedestrians on the street was neither practical nor safe."" Even if the dirigible managed to land there, the ship would ""swivel around and around,"" which would make the building more unstable. Moreover, even if the ship landed, it was ""illegal for a ship to ever tie up the building or even approach the area."" Considering all these factors, it became clear that allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building was an unfeasible idea."
1163	15996	6	3	"Other than making amendments to building plans, the builders of the Empire State Building faced significant obstacles in terms of safety, practicality, and legality. The hydrogen used in most foreign dirigibles is highly flammable, presenting an extreme safety hazard ""above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" Any accident involving a hydrogen - filled dirigible could lead to a large - scale disaster. Also, due to the natural, violent wind currents at the altitude of the mooring mast, it would be not only more difficult but also extremely dangerous to weigh down docking dirigibles. The strong winds could cause the dirigibles to sway uncontrollably. Lastly, the building plans for the Empire State Building did not align with existing laws. Laws strictly forbade airships from traveling at low altitudes over urban areas; therefore, the use of the mooring mast would be illegal. Before the builders were able to finish the Empire State Building, they had to carefully take each of these obstacles into account, and it was evident that these issues posed serious challenges to the plan of allowing dirigibles to dock."
1164	15997	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Originally, the most pressing problem the builders faced was strengthening the building's foundational base to support the stress of the dirigibles' load and the wind pressure. To address this, @MONEY1 worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework. Unfortunately, most of the complications of the mooring mast were not considered until after it was built. A crucial one was safety, as many foreign dirigibles used hydrogen to float, which is highly flammable. A disaster similar to the Hindenburg disaster over New York City was far too dangerous to risk. Another factor preventing the use of the mast were the winds at the top of the building that were constantly changing due to the violent air currents. The swaying dirigible could not be secured with hanging weights because of the danger of dropping one over a very populated New York City. A huge complication in making the dream a reality was a law preventing airships from flying too low over urban areas. This would make it illegal for a docking to ever take place. The many obstacles that faced the builders of the Empire State Building in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there eventually led to the abandonment of the idea altogether, as it was simply not worth the risks and legal issues.
1165	15998	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced a lot of obstacles in trying to dock dirigibles there, but they had to find a way around them. The architects firmly believed that the mooring mast would work and thus they started building. Soon enough, insurmountable problems emerged. One of the problems was that dirigibles typically use more hydrogen than helium, making them very flammable. If a dirigible had an accident over New York, a large number of people would be hurt. Another significant factor was the wind currents. The wind was so strong that the dirigible would be swirling around even if it was tied up. Although they could use lead weights to keep it still, if the weights fell, they would hurt pedestrians walking below. Furthermore, the state law made it illegal for airships to fly too low, which made it impossible for dirigibles to be tied to the mooring mast on the Empire State Building. After all these problems, the architects decided not to add the landing gear to the mooring mast because they knew that it would not be used as intended, and the idea of dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building was ultimately abandoned.
1166	15999	6	3	The Empire State builders encountered significant obstacles when attempting to enable dirigibles to dock there. Most dirigibles arriving from outside the United States typically used hydrogen instead of helium as their lifting gas. Hydrogen is highly flammable, posing a major safety risk. When the German dirigible Hindenburg was tragically destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building quickly realized how much more catastrophic such an accident could have been if it occurred above a densely populated area like downtown New York. Additionally, the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if a dirigible managed to be tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mast, making docking extremely difficult. Another obstacle the builders faced was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law effectively made it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. Although two dirigibles did attempt to reach the building, the entire idea was eventually dropped due to these insurmountable challenges.
1167	16000	6	3	"It is clearly stated in the article that ""[t]he mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose,"" and this prediction has proven to be true. The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous formidable obstacles in their attempt to have dirigibles dock at the building. For example, one significant obstacle they encountered was that most dirigibles are filled with hydrogen, which is an extremely flammable gas. If a dirigible were to be destroyed by fire, similar to the Hindenburg disaster, it could cause a terrible accident in a heavily populated area like New York. Therefore, the builders faced a serious safety issue with the dirigibles in case one caught on fire in the city. Another important obstacle was the strong wind currents at the top of the Empire State Building. These winds caused the dirigibles to swivel around the mooring mast, preventing them from getting close enough to the mast. Moreover, the wind created a risk that a dirigible could be blown onto a sharp spire of another building, and if the dirigible were punctured, it would create a dangerous situation for the captain. To counteract the swiveling caused by the wind, the controllers would have to use lead weights to weigh down the dirigible. However, although the lead weights could lessen the swiveling, it was neither practical nor safe because the lead weights would be hanging above pedestrians on the street, and if a lead weight were to fall, it could be fatal. Lastly, if a dirigible were to moor at the Empire State Building, it would be breaking an existing law. This law clearly states that airships cannot fly too low over urban areas, making it obvious that it is illegal to moor on the Empire State Building. Before starting this project, the builders should have thoroughly researched and accounted for all the obstacles they were going to face to avoid such a failed endeavor."
1168	16001	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced a series of challenging obstacles such as structural support issues, shifting winds, and administrative interference. One major problem emerged when they realized that the force required to hold the blimp in place ""would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation"" (par. @NUM1). This realization meant that the builders had to make substantial changes to the support system of the building itself before they could even begin construction on the mooring device. Once the mast and the necessary reconstruction work were completed, the builders then discovered that ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (par. @NUM2). These unpredictable winds would make docking a dirigible almost an impossible task. The attempts to moor became even more difficult as ""complete dirigible mooring equipment had never been installed"" (par. @NUM3). This situation clearly shows how the builders struggled with bureaucracy in their efforts to build the mooring mast. In conclusion, the shortsightedness of the project led the builders to grapple with the building's structure, the adverse weather conditions, and the owners' somewhat unrealistic vision. Eventually, they had no choice but to abandon the mast project due to these overwhelming challenges."
1169	16002	6	3	The obstacles the builders had to go through were quite arduous. It was difficult mainly because the building was situated so high up in the air. To carry out their work, they needed special gear designed to withstand the high - altitude conditions. Al Smith, involved in the project, had to wait for an official answer before proceeding with building the mast because the operation was extremely dangerous. Moreover, over sixty thousand dollars had to be spent on making improvements to the building framework to ensure its stability. Other obstacles included the complex tasks of safely dropping and allowing passengers on and off the dirigibles. Additionally, there was the challenge of refueling the dirigibles if one were to dock at the building. The overall goal was also to make the building more prominent and functional, but these numerous obstacles made the achievement of this goal very difficult. In the end, these challenges significantly hampered the progress of the project.
1170	16003	6	3	The builders faced many daunting obstacles when attempting to allow the dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. The first major hurdle was that they couldn't simply place the mast on top of the building. Doing so would have put an excessive amount of stress on the building's frame, potentially compromising its structural integrity. Instead, they had to transmit the stress all the way down to the foundation of the building. As a result, they carried out over @MONEY1 worth of framework modifications to the building to ensure it could withstand the forces involved. Their next obstacle was to find a safe way to dock and unload the ships, which proved to be an almost impossible task. First off, the ship couldn't even reach the building because the violent and ever - changing winds were too strong to allow for proper control of the ship. Even if they somehow managed to dock, the back of the ship would have been pushed around and around the mast, making the entire docking process extremely unstable. Another significant obstacle was a law that prevented airships from flying that low over urban areas. This law effectively prohibited the ships from ever approaching the building to tie off to the mast. In the end, these multiple obstacles made it clear that the plan to have dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building was unfeasible.
1171	16004	6	3	"Although the problems with docking a dirigible were not initially considered, the builders of the Empire State Building eventually faced these significant obstacles. Their ""greatest reason was one of safety"" for the passengers and the pedestrians below in the bustling city. Many countries ""used hydrogen rather than helium"" in their dirigibles, and ""hydrogen is highly flammable"" which could have led to several severe problems in the future. A German dirigible called Hindenburg was tragically destroyed in Lakehurst, New Jersey because of fire. It was after that well - known incident that the owners of the Empire State Building realized that an accident like that could not take place ""above a densely populated area such as downtown New York,"" as too many people could be seriously injured. Even though safety was a major problem, ""the greatest obstacle... was nature itself."" When a dirigible was ""tethered to the mooring mast,"" the strong and violent air currents at the top of the building would cause the ""back of the ship [to] swivel around and around."" The air currents not only made it difficult to hold the dirigible steady, but it also made it extremely challenging to even reach the mooring mast. The idea of using lead weights to hold down the end of the blimps was not employed because dangling weights above New York City ""was neither practical nor safe."" One last obstacle the builders faced was the existing ""law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This law prevented any dirigibles from being tied to or even approaching the building. However, two blimps (Los Angeles from the U.S. Navy and the Pilgrim from Goodyear) did attempt to reach the building but were stopped due to the high wind speeds. The several obstacles that presented themselves to the builders of the Empire State Building ultimately prevented the mooring mast from being used for the future of transportation."
1172	16005	6	3	In the early days of construction planning in New York City, the @CAPS2 Mast by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous formidable obstacles. The largest obstacle they faced was safety. Most dirigibles that were coming from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is very flammable, posing a huge risk. Another obstacle was just nature itself. The winds were constantly shifting, caused by the violent air currents swirling around the tall building. Another significant obstacle was that there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The builders should have realized all the hazards they were facing and simply dropped the idea of using the mooring mast for dirigibles and their passengers. In the end, these insurmountable issues made it clear that the original plan was unfeasible.
1173	16006	6	3	In this short passage, it discusses how architects had a vision to build a mooring mast on the iconic Empire State Building in the state of New York. This mast would serve to dock dirigibles, which in modern - day are commonly called blimps. The mooring mast is a skinny tower located at the very top of the Empire State Building, specifically designed to dock the dirigibles. The Empire State Building stands @NUM1 feet tall without the mooring mast at its peak. The stress of a dirigible on a mooring mast at @NUM2 feet is an enormous amount of weight at such a great height of the structure. They invested @MONEY1 in modifications for the base area of the building to try and handle this stress. An important downfall about the dirigibles is that with helium in them, they're very flammable and could cause several millions in damage. If the zeppelin caught on flame over such a densely populated land area, it could claim a large number of lives. I think the mooring mast was a great idea as it helped the building be the tallest building at one time. They should still explore the possibility of using the mooring mast today, perhaps with improved safety measures.
1174	16007	6	3	Due to the architects being blind to the potential problems of the mast, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many difficult obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. There was a strict law stating that airships could not fly too low over urban areas. This made it completely illegal for a ship to even go near the building. But let's say a ship somehow got tethered to the mooring mast. The back end of the ship would swivel around the mast due to the constantly shifting winds caused by the violent air currents. Dirigibles are normally moored in open fields, which allows the backs to be weighted down with lead weights. This was dangerous for many reasons, but mainly because the weights would be hanging precariously over downtown New York. Without the dirigible being held down properly, the violent winds would push the ship into the sharp spires that would rip the shell. With the wind pressure and the dirigibles' load itself, there would be too much stress being added to the building's frame. To handle this stress on the building's steel frame, over sixty thousand dollars in modifications would have to be made so the stress would be able to be transmitted nearly eleven hundred feet down to the foundation. Most of the dirigibles that were made outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is more flammable, so the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse the accident could have been if it were over downtown New York. With all of these obstacles in their way, the owners and builders of the Empire State Building voted to postpone the installation of the landing gear, as it was just too risky and costly.
1175	16008	6	3	"In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lusted, the builders went through many tough obstacles to get their project done. The builders initially thought they had everything all set and under control. When they were making their plans, they had planned for the mast to be a big and important part. However, when they had made the mast, it just wasn't right. ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose."" Then they faced more problems because a law was being passed that the ships could not tie themselves to the buildings. As a result, they worried that they wouldn't have anyone visit the building. But they managed to solve that problem by having the airplanes bring the passengers. Even though the builders went through many obstacles, they still managed to find ways to get past them, showing their determination and resourcefulness. In the end, they overcame these hurdles and the building still stands as an iconic structure."
1176	16009	6	3	"In the excerpt, The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1, the reader thoroughly learns about the numerous obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building encountered in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. The most crucial obstacle to surmount was safety. The United States made the choice of using hydrogen rather than helium to power the dirigibles. As clearly stated in @CAPS2 @NUM1, after the tragic destruction of the Hindenburg, the owners of the Empire State Building vividly realized how truly catastrophic the accident would have been if it had occurred over a densely populated area such as New York. Another significant obstacle they faced was the brutal winds that frequently occur at such a high altitude. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (@CAPS2 @NUM2). The final obstacle the builders grappled with was that there was a strict law, ""against airships flying too low over urban areas."" (@CAPS2 @NUM3) which made it completely illegal to tie a dirigible to a building. In conclusion, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many insurmountable obstacles, and yet in the end, ""Dirigibles, instead of becoming the transportation of the future, had given way to airplanes"" (@CAPS2 @NUM4), highlighting the failure of the plan to use the building for dirigible docking."
1177	16010	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building encountered a multitude of obstacles in their ambitious attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. One very clear and prominent obstacle was the law that had firmly existed at the time, strictly making it against the law for airships to fly too low over urban areas, as detailed in (paragraph @NUM1). Also, another substantial obstacle in their endeavor to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building was that most dirigibles originating from outside of the United States were constructed using hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is extremely highly flammable. For instance, on May 6, 1937, the German dirigible Hindenburg met a tragic end, being destroyed by a massive fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey. The owners of the Empire State Building were acutely aware and realized just how much worse the accident could have been if it had taken place right in downtown New York, a densely - populated area. (paragraph @NUM2). The greatest obstacle they faced was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly and unpredictably shifting due to violent air currents. If the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast, creating a dangerous situation (paragraph @NUM3). In the end, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced were simply too overwhelming to allow dirigibles to dock on the mooring mast, thus thwarting their initial plans.
1178	16011	6	3	"Throughout the excerpt, it becomes evident that the obstacles the builders faced were extremely difficult. Many of these challenges fell under the category of being able to let dirigibles dock at the site. Some of the difficulties they encountered were that outside the United States, more dirigibles were being constructed, but with ""hydrogen rather than helium"", as they clearly stated, ""hydrogen is highly flammable"". There was a palpable fear for the people, considering that New York was so densely populated. In the event of an accident, the consequences would be dire. There were also weather - related problems. The winds were constantly shifting, causing great instability. As described, ""Ship would swivel around and around"". Realizing the extreme danger these situations posed, all the builders could do was shut down the plan to allow dirigibles to dock, as it was simply too risky to proceed."
1179	16012	6	3	"In the construction of the Empire State building, the @CAPS1 faced a plethora of problems both before and after the making of the mast. There were laws that strictly prevented the docking of the dirigibles, several incidents that had occurred, and notable flaws in safety. The first problem they should have seriously turned their attention to was the law against low - flying aircraft over urban areas. It is specifically said that ""this law would make it completely illegal for a ship to ever tie up or even approach the area."" Another significant problem they faced was the tragic burning of the Hindenburg. The U.S. chose to use helium to keep their dirigibles afloat, while other countries were using highly - flammable hydrogen. This posed a huge threat, and the @CAPS1 even started to wonder ""how much worse that incident would be if it had taken place above a densely populated area like downtown New York. The final problem was the extreme lack of safety in having a dirigible swaying in the intense winds near the building. The cargo on the dirigible would send it out of control in these strong winds. The mast on the Empire State Building had too many intractable problems for the @CAPS1 to solve. It was clear from the start that the plan to use it for dirigible docking would never succeed."
1180	16013	6	3	To allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, the @CAPS1 had to confront many complex obstacles. Some of these obstacles were such that a mooring mast could not be simply dropped and a thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top, as it would add excessive stress to the building's frame. The architects could not just haphazardly drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. The greatest obstacle to the mooring mast was nature itself. The @CAPS1 of the Empire State Building faced these insurmountable obstacles, and ultimately, it became clear that the plan to use the building for dirigible docking was unfeasible and would have to be abandoned.
1181	16014	6	3	"In the excerpt, the builders had faced numerous and significant obstacles in order for dirigibles to dock there. They encountered a wide range of challenges. One of the primary concerns was safety. Al Smith had commented, stating, ""They were trying to figure out some truly safe way of mooring airships to this mast,"" among many other safety - related issues. In the end, ensuring safety remained a key hurdle that they struggled to overcome."
1182	16015	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced by attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were extremely harsh. The builders, in theory, naively thought that everything would work out perfectly. They later had to confront the fact that they had not done enough due diligence to see if there would be any problems with having the dirigibles dock there. As I read, I clearly noticed that the building never fulfilled its intended purpose. This was because most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen, not helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. On May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building vividly realized how much worse a fire could have been if it were to happen above a densely populated area such as downtown New York. So, in reality, this idea was not safe, and the builders had to go through the entire process of building it, getting it all completed. Then they finally realized that the idea was not pursuable, and it had to be abandoned.
1183	16016	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building were so resolutely determined to make sure that everything would work out fine. They put in a great deal of effort and had high hopes. However, the building just wasn't meant for dirigibles to dock there. Despite their best intentions and efforts, the fundamental design and conditions of the building were not suitable for this purpose, and thus, the idea had to be discarded.
1184	16017	6	3	"When the builders of the Empire State Building attempted to construct a mooring mast for dirigibles, they were faced with several significant obstacles that would ultimately defeat them. The first and most obvious obstacle was the extreme danger of crashing. When the Hindenburg crashed in New Jersey, the builders clearly realized how much more catastrophic the horrific crash would have been if it had occurred in downtown New York. Another more immediate obstacle was the strong wind at the top of the tower. As stated in paragraph @NUM1, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" That, combined with the lightweight nature of dirigibles, would make mooring much more difficult compared to an open field. The last obstacle faced by the builders was the existing laws that made it illegal. There were laws that strictly prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas like New York City, though these laws were largely ignored. All these obstacles eventually led to the clear realization that the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building was neither practical nor feasible, and the plan had to be scrapped."
1185	16018	6	3	"Based on the information I just read, the main obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building had was to find a viable way to allow the dirigibles to dock there. There are rooms in the building that have never been opened to the public and it has the highest observation desk. They had to make space for a dock, but they simply didn't know how. One of the problems the builders faced was that the city authorities didn't want ""dirigibles to moor at the Empire State Building because of the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. They also had complications as the captain of the dirigibles couldn't let go of the control levers easily. The sharp spires of other nearby buildings could potentially pop the dirigibles. The wind was also a major problem as it could blow the dirigibles in a completely different direction. In conclusion, these multiple obstacles made it nearly impossible for the dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building."
1186	16019	6	3	"The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there include: hydrogen gas being highly flammable, high winds and wind shifts at the top of the building, and laws that airships could not fly too low over cities such as New York City. The problem of hydrogen gas became apparent to them when a blimp blew up in New Jersey. After this incident, the owners realized how disastrous it could have been if such an event occurred over the densely - populated city. When it comes to high winds, the excerpt says, ""... if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around..."" This constant swiveling due to the wind made docking extremely difficult. Also, the law mentioned would have made it illegal for blimps to come close to the Empire State Building, thus posing a significant legal hurdle. In conclusion, these multiple obstacles made it a challenging task for the builders to achieve the goal of allowing dirigibles to dock."
1187	16020	6	3	"The builders had many troubles with the building of the Empire State Building. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. This is one trouble they had because if there ever was an accident above New York City, it would be extremely bad as New York is a highly - populated and polluted city. The potential for a large - scale disaster was very real. Another problem was that ""they could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" This was a big problem because now they had to re - evaluate and fix their design, which would take time and additional resources. Lastly, another problem was the competition. ""Al Smith realized that he was close to losing the title of the world's tallest building. Al Smith was so engrossed in his design that he did not realize the competition. So when he found out, he knew he had to make his building taller to regain the lead. In conclusion, these troubles made the construction process of the Empire State Building a complex and challenging endeavor."
1188	16021	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was that a dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable, would add significant stress to the building's frame. The rigid frame of the building would have to be carefully modified and strengthened to withstand the stress of the dirigibles' load and the strong wind pressure. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, causing the ship to swivel around and around the mooring mast, making docking a precarious and almost impossible task. Another major obstacle was that there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This would make it illegal for the ships to ever tie up or even approach the building, adding a legal roadblock. The last obstacle the builders had to get around was the issue with safety. Most dirigibles used either helium or hydrogen, both highly flammable gases. When the Hindenburg was destroyed by fire, the builders realized how dangerous it could be to have such flammable - gas - filled dirigibles over a populated area. These are just some of the many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building had to take into consideration when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. In conclusion, these obstacles made the goal of allowing dirigible docking a very difficult one to achieve.
1189	16022	6	3	The obstacles builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock include making sure they don't bump into other buildings in the busy New York City skyline. They use ropes to drop down papers, perhaps as a means of communication or to guide the dirigibles from a distance. They are also trying to make sure that the dirigibles do not pop if it touches the buildings. The delicate nature of the dirigibles' structure made this a crucial concern. It is also about keeping the dirigibles at a safe distance so they don't get too close. That's why they are dropping the papers down with ropes. If they built a little tunnel so the dirigibles can go in, they won't have to worry about them getting popped if they touch a building. In conclusion, these obstacles required creative solutions to enable successful dirigible docking.
1190	16023	6	3	"In this excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced a few obstacles in the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock at the mooring mast. One of the greatest obstacles was one of safety. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" An accident where the German dirigible caught fire and was destroyed shocked the builders deeply. After this incident, they realized it could have been far worse if such a disaster occurred over a densely - populated area like New York. Nature itself was also a problem. ""Winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The back of the ship would ""swivel"" around even if it was tethered, making docking extremely difficult and dangerous. Also, there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. All of these examples would cause the builders to face significant obstacles. In conclusion, these combined factors made it a challenging and almost insurmountable task for the builders to achieve the goal of allowing dirigibles to dock at the mooring mast."
1191	16024	6	3	"Many problems faced the construction workers of the Empire State building, especially in allowing dirigibles to dock. To begin, constructing docking facilities for dirigibles on the Empire State building was extremely dangerous. Dirigibles couldn't perform many basic docking operations at the building. For example, ""dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building."" (@CAPS2 @NUM1) Mooring was impossible because it violated ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" (@CAPS2 @NUM1) This made it illegal for a ship to tie to the Empire State Building. Also, the greatest threat to dirigibles was nature. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" (@CAPS2 @NUM3) Because of this and the fact that construction on such a high building at the time was impractical, dirigibles never touched the Empire State building. So, in conclusion, the difficulty of building dirigible landing gear and of landing dirigibles ultimately ended the viability of the Empire State Building docks."
1192	16025	6	3	"In their attempt to build a docking mast on the top of the Empire State Building, the builders encountered structural, safety, and practicality obstacles. In order to have the mast on top of the building, the builders had to strengthen the steel, spending ""Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications"". Also, they had significant safety concerns about letting a dirigible dock in a city, on a skyscraper. One of these concerns was the use of the flammable gas hydrogen that was used in non - American dirigibles. If a dirigible caught fire over the city, the consequences would be extremely bad. Furthermore, the tether system of the mooring mast was at the mercy of nature. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting, this meant the dirigible on the mast could then swivel around, posing a danger to citizens. The mast was also impractical, due to a law that prohibits airships from flying too low over urban areas. And finally, in later years dirigibles had ""given way to airplanes,"" thus making the mooring mast for dirigibles useless. The builders of the Empire State Building never succeeded in their attempt of putting an active mooring mast on top of the building, because of the structural, safety, and practicality obstacles that they stumbled upon."
1193	16026	6	3	"When the builders of the Empire State Building attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there, they came across many issues. One major issue is the stress on the building from the added mast. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way down to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" This clearly shows how the stress factors on the building troubled its construction. Another obstacle to its construction was that ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". When building the dock, constructors ran into numerous issues which eventually overcame them and led to the dock's uselessness. In the end, these problems made it impossible for the builders to achieve a functional docking facility for dirigibles on the Empire State Building."
1194	16027	6	3	"In attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, the builders faced a few problems. First, they had to figure out a practical way this could be done. When they decided to construct a ""rocket - shaped mast"" that the dirigible could attach to, they realized that the roof had to be built first. After the building of the mast was completed, safety became a serious issue. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" (paragraph @NUM1) If there were ever an accident with a foreign dirigible, the safety of New York City would be at great risk. Also, the dirigibles could not be tied down with weights like they can in an open field. This would also pose a significant danger to the people of New York. The main obstacle the builders faced with safety, which is a big and insurmountable issue. Therefore, due to these safety and practicality problems, the dirigibles could not dock on the Empire State Building."
1195	16028	6	3	"In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION1, the builders faced one giant obstacle. They faced the very real risk of blowing up the building. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) This is a prime example from the excerpt that could turn into the biggest obstacle. If one were to explode above this building, then not only would the building be severely damaged or destroyed, but also a large number of people would die. That is one of the most significant and insurmountable obstacles they faced, ultimately preventing the successful implementation of dirigible docking at the Empire State Building."
1196	16029	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building encountered numerous obstacles while trying to set up the mooring mast for dirigibles. These included a weakened framework, the forces of nature and unpredictable weather, potential fire hazards, and strict U.S. laws. Since the building was not initially designed to hold dirigibles, its frame was not sturdy enough to withstand the pulling and shifting of the blimp in the air. At the 102 - storey top of the building, dirigibles would vacillate in the high and erratic winds. Besides the risk of pulling loose or damaging the building, the dirigibles could be punctured by another building's spire. Any damage to the dirigible was extremely dangerous as the area around the Empire State Building in New York City is densely populated. If the dirigible were to catch fire and explode, like the German Hindenburg blimp, many pedestrians and other structures could be severely damaged. This kind of catastrophe was also likely due to the flammable gases, such as hydrogen, used to keep the blimps afloat. Finally, the builders faced problems with the U.S. government, whose laws prohibited airships from getting too close to urban areas like New York City. It would be illegal for a dirigible to fly near enough to the building to moor to it. In conclusion, many issues emerged for the builders as they attempted to transform the Empire State Building into a docking station for dirigibles, ultimately making it an unfeasible endeavor.
1197	16030	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were quite significant. The goal was to enable people to get off and unload or load up their ships at the building. However, various challenges stood in the way. There were structural concerns with the building to support the docking process, as well as safety and regulatory issues. These obstacles made it a complex task for the builders to achieve the desired functionality of the Empire State Building as a dirigible docking site. In the end, these combined challenges made it difficult to successfully implement the plan.
1198	16031	6	3	The problems the Empire State Building faced with building dirigibles to dock there were multi - fold. Firstly, there was a lack of suitable land area. The mooring mast could not simply be placed on the Empire State Building's flat roof. Moreover, a dirigible a thousand feet up, held by a cable tether, would add a great deal of stress to the building's frame. The stress from the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way down to the building's foundation. This put a huge strain on the structural integrity of the building. Another reason was a safety concern. Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable, which posed a serious fire risk in a densely populated area like New York City. In conclusion, these issues made it extremely challenging to make the Empire State Building a viable docking site for dirigibles.
1199	16032	6	3	"Builders of the Empire State Building were faced with many obstacles of construction, especially when it came to allowing dirigibles, or blimps, to dock there. From the start, they had to deal with very high expectations. One of these expectations was achieving the desired title of ""world's Tallest Building"". With this title came many underlying obstacles related to the building's frame and support. Another obstacle emerged as the building aimed to be ""equipped for an age of transportation,"" as John Tauranac put it. The desire to be a dock for what was then known as the ""transportation of the future"" brought even greater challenges. These included the responsibility of safely getting passengers off the dirigibles. One of the biggest obstacles was the constantly shifting winds and violent air currents. While this problem was usually solved in open fields using dangling weight belts, it was nearly impossible to address in populated New York City. The final obstacle that really led to the operation's demise was the law against airships flying too low in urban areas. In conclusion, these numerous obstacles made it unfeasible for the Empire State Building to become a successful dirigible docking site."
1200	16033	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were the lack of land area, the currents of the wind, and the gas used to make dirigibles float. The lack of land area was a major problem because some dirigibles were as long as 800 ft., which is the same length as four blocks in New York City. In a densely populated area like New York, having large objects flying to and fro so close to the ground put people in danger and would also obscure light. The wind currents were a significant factor. At 102 floors above the ground, the wind would buffet large dirigibles around, posing a danger to the building's frame. The wind pressure would have to be transmitted to the building's foundation. The final obstacle was the gas used in many foreign dirigibles of the time, which was hydrogen. Hydrogen is a highly flammable and dangerous gas to have in densely populated areas like New York City. When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in New Jersey, people realized how much worse the accident could have been in New York. In conclusion, these obstacles made it very difficult for the Empire State Building to serve as a docking station for dirigibles.
1201	16034	6	3	"There were numerous obstacles that hindered the landing of dirigibles on the Empire State Building. The majority of these issues were related to the building's framework and safety. Even before workers began constructing the mooring system, they encountered problems with the new plan of mooring blimps. To support the air - crafts, the building's frame would need to be carefully ""modified and strengthened."" Otherwise, there was a high risk that the building might not remain stable during the docking process. Safety was the primary concern when it came to fulfilling the plan of mooring blimps to the Empire State Building. After the construction was completed, it soon became evident that the ""mooring mast was destined to never fulfill its purpose."" One reason for this was that foreign dirigibles were mainly filled with hydrogen, which is extremely flammable and highly unsafe. Additionally, simply attaching a dirigible to the mast was perilous because the winds were ""constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Not only was it unsafe to moor dirigibles to the tallest building in the world, but it was also against the law. Airships were prohibited from flying too low over populated areas. As a result, after the construction of the mooring mast, it was clear that it would never be put to use."
1202	16035	6	3	In the story The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered numerous obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. The three main obstacles they faced were the high flammability of hydrogen, the unpredictable winds from nature, and the existing law against airships. The first significant obstacle was the presence of hydrogen and helium in the balloon. Since hydrogen is highly flammable, the builders had to create a secure place for the dirigibles to dock to prevent any potential fire hazards. The second major obstacle was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly changing direction due to the violent air currents, making it extremely difficult to safely moor the dirigibles. The last obstacle was the law that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas. This law made it illegal for ships to tie up or approach a building in that area. Despite the many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there, in the end, dirigibles, instead of becoming the transportation of the future, gave way to airplanes, which were more practical and safer.
1203	16036	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there included the lack of a proper landing area. A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by just a single cable tether, would put excessive stress on the building's frame. To reinforce the frame and make it suitable for docking dirigibles, they would need a substantial amount of money, approximately sixty thousand dollars. Another crucial factor was safety. Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable, posing a significant risk. However, the greatest challenge to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were in a constant state of shift because of the violent air currents, making it nearly impossible to safely moor dirigibles. In conclusion, these multiple obstacles made it unfeasible for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
1204	16037	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building encountered a great deal of problems when trying to allow dirigibles to dock. In the story, it is mentioned that dirigibles typically use hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is extremely flammable. If the dirigible were to get a hole in its structure, there was a high probability that it would catch fire, endangering both the building and the people nearby. Another major problem was nature. The winds on top of the building were constantly changing their direction due to the violent air currents, which made it very difficult to safely moor the dirigibles. The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas. These factors combined presented significant obstacles for the builders. Ultimately, these challenges meant that the plan to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building could not be realized.
1205	16038	6	3	There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. This flammability posed a serious threat during the docking process. Even if the dirigible were successfully tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would spin around the mooring mast. Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights. However, using these weights at the Empire State Building, where they would dangle high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe. The risk of the weights falling and injuring people on the ground was too great. Considering all these factors, it is clear that these were significant obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there, and they ultimately prevented the successful implementation of the docking plan.
1206	16039	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the greatest obstacles they had to face were the strong winds at the top of the building because the winds were constantly shifting due to violent air - like air currents in the upper atmosphere. It also wasn't safe having the dirigibles weighed down with lead weights so it won't swivel around the mooring mast. Moreover, sixty thousand dollars worth of significant modifications had to be made to the building's framework to ensure its stability. They were scared that weighing the ship down with lead weights would be dangerous because of all the people below in the bustling city. It must have been very hard to construct the mooring mast, and these challenges ultimately made the plan of dirigible docking quite unfeasible.
1207	16040	6	3	On December 11, 1929, Al Smith released to the public that the Empire State Building would reach a towering 1,250 feet, becoming the world's tallest building at that time. To achieve this unique feature, they were going to add a mooring mast to the top of the building to dock Dirigibles. The builders were initially unaware of the numerous obstacles to come. They were faced with many architectural, safety - related and nature - based dilemmas. When designing the mast, they realized they could not just simply place the mast on top. The strong wind pressure mixed with all the stress of the dirigible being held by one cable would send the stress throughout the building, and even down deep to the foundation. To do this it would cost over a substantial @NUM2$ to make the framework strong enough to hold the stress. Another obstacle that came into play was safety. In the @LOCATION2, hydrogen is commonly used to fuel the dirigibles. Hydrogen is highly flammable so if anything ever happened over downtown New York, a densely populated area, it would be a huge catastrophe. The greatest obstacle was said to be nature itself. The violent air currents are unpredictable and the dirigible would be shifting around even if weighted down. But it is not practical or safe to weigh the balloon down with pedestrians below. Overall the outcome of the mast was a fail due to the blindly seen and the blindly predicted obstacles of nature, architecture, and safety.
1208	16041	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. In the reading they talk about how there is not much suitable landing area in @ORGANIZATION2 but, although adding space for landing, the great height of the mast would be extremely dangerous, not only for the passengers on the dirigibles but for those who were on the ground level of the busy city. Also, the thousand plus pound craft would add a significant amount of stress to the building's frame; so the frame would have to be carefully modified and strengthened to accommodate the @LOCATION2. (Which would cost over a hefty @MONEY1) The idea proved to be unsafe when the German dirigible blew up at a @ORGANIZATION1 - they realized how dangerous that could be above a densely populated area like New York City, with its countless lives at stake.
1209	16042	6	3	Based on the excerpt to The Mooring Mast, the builders who constructed the Empire State Building had faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the building. One of many obstacles was nature itself. The strong winds that are on top of the building were always shifting, because of the violent air currents caused by weather systems in the region. If the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of it would swivel around & around the mooring mast, as said in paragraph @NUM1. Another obstacle was that the dirigibles from outside of the U.S. used hydrogen rather than helium, & hydrogen is highly flammable. This high flammability posed a great risk to the building and the surrounding area. As you can see there are quite a few of obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building had to face when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on this building, making the plan very difficult to execute.
1210	16043	6	3	"Based on the excerpt it is evident that the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the reasons for the idea's failure was the fact that there was already a strict law in place making it illegal for a dirigible to even approach the area, as it states in paragraph @NUM1. Also, it could've been an extreme fire hazard if a blimp had ever reached the Empire State Building. This is proved in paragraph @NUM2, where it states, ""the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire..."" which caused the owners to realize, ""how much worse that accident could have been in the densely - populated New York."" On top of all this, the weather proposed an even bigger problem. The violent air currents made the idea of a mooring mast ""neither practical nor safe."" I believe the most important reason that the idea failed was because technology was simply advancing beyond predictions. In paragraph @NUM3, it says, ""Dirigibles instead of becoming the transportation of the future, had given way to more advanced airplanes."" With these multiple challenges, it was clear that the plan to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was bound to fail."
1211	16044	6	3	"In the passage, The Mooring Mast, Marcia Amidon L¸sted thoroughly discusses several adversities and obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the numerous obstacles they encountered was ""the lack of a suitable landing area."" Typically, dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighed down in the back with lead weights. However, using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above the pedestrians bustling on the street, was neither practical nor safe. Before even thinking about landing dirigibles, the architects had to figure out a viable way to get the mooring mast on top of the building. They ""could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the building's flat roof."" As @CAPS1 indicates, ""the steel frame of the building would have to be modified and strengthened."" Most of the problems were avoidable, except for the fact that ""the winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" These challenges ultimately made the plan of using the Empire State Building as a dirigible docking area unfeasible."
1212	16045	6	3	"There were numerous obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. One significant obstacle was related to the type of gas used in dirigibles. Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen in their blimps instead of helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. The builders of the Empire State Building did not initially realize that this was a major problem. It was not until May 6, 1937, when the German dirigible Hindenburg caught on fire in New Jersey (paragraph @NUM1), that they truly understood the potential disaster if a dirigible caught fire right over the large masses of people in New York. Another obstacle was nature. The winds on the top of the building were always violently changing, causing the dirigible to swivel around over the heads of the people in @LOCATION2. As stated in paragraph @NUM2, such a problem could theoretically be easily solved by weighting down the dirigible with lead weights. However, using lead weights that could accidentally fall on the people below was an extremely unsafe way to keep the dirigible still. Lastly, as written in the beginning of paragraph @NUM3, there was an ""existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" By law, the whole idea of using the Empire State Building as a docking area for dirigibles was illegal, and rightfully so. There were too many complications, and one spark or strong breeze could put countless lives at risk. These reasons are why by the 1930s the plan to create a mooring mass for the dirigibles on the Empire State Building was dropped."
1213	16046	6	3	Governor Al Smith of New York had a grand vision. He strongly desired to have a building constructed that would surpass the current tallest building in the world, The Chrysler Building. With determination and effort, he succeeded in doing so. The Empire State Building was now the tallest building in the world, standing at an impressive 1,250 feet. But there were more ambitious plans for this building. At the time, aviation pioneers were filled with dreams of travel by dirigible, and thus a mooring mast was to be built at the top of the building for docking these airships. However, what should have been a carefully - planned and cautious project turned out to be a dangerous one. There should have been a great deal more precaution taken into this project. Dirigibles could be extremely dangerous in a densely populated area like New York City. If the dirigible were to catch fire and explode, a large number of people could get hurt. And at such a high altitude, the risk was quite likely. People only started to truly understand the dangers of this project halfway through its implementation, which is why it was called off due to the lack of safety. In the end, the safety concerns outweighed the allure of this innovative idea.
1214	16047	6	3	"The main obstacle that the builder faced was making sure that the building was stable enough to support a mooring mast. The architects were well - aware that they could not just casually drop a mooring mast on the Empire State Building. Al Smith commented and said that the mooring mast was at an okay level and how they were actively working on improving things. A dedicated set of engineers were hard at work finding workable and faster arrangements. Meanwhile, the government was trying to figure out a safe way for the mooring airships to connect to the mast. ""A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add significant stress to the building's frame (@NUM1). The challenges that the builders went through were significant. If a big dirigible was to be placed on top of the building, it would add stress by weighing it down. Moreover, it would reach a point where it would affect the very frame of the building. They had to use a steel frame in order for things to work out. But, at the top of the building, the winds caused violent shifting due to air currents. Having a dirigible dangling over the pedestrians below was not only very unsafe but also far from ideal. The builder of the Empire State Building faced many significant challenges in their attempt to allow the dirigibles to dock there, and these challenges ultimately made the project extremely difficult to execute."
1215	16048	6	3	"The Empire State Building was always highly famous and well - known, but it seemed to crave more attention. The Governor of New York, Al Smith, was enthusiastic about the idea of allowing dirigibles to dock on the building for transportation. He was confident that it would work and actually went ahead with the plan of building the necessary infrastructure. The builders faced many obstacles while trying to make this dream a reality. To make this possible, the builders would have to modify and strengthen the building. This was not going to be inexpensive. ""Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" It was a very costly endeavor. The builders designed a ""shiny glass and chrome - nickel stainless steel tower."" Additionally, the mast would have four wings at all its corners. They also planned for observation areas, and even designed elevators and baggage areas. They had meticulously planned everything out and even raised an American flag at the top to signify their hopes. Unfortunately, nobody fully considered all the potential dangers of docking dirigibles. Despite all the hard work of the builders, the plan never came to fruition. They tried to dock two dirigibles, but it did not work out. Eventually, the building was transformed into the world's highest soda fountain and tea garden for sightseers, a far cry from its original intended use."
1216	16049	6	3	When building the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building, the architects encountered numerous unforeseen obstacles. These challenges ultimately led the designers to never effectively use the mooring mast as they had initially hoped. The first problem they faced was that a thousand - ton dirigible would exert significant stress on the building's frame. To address this, the designers had to spend a substantial amount, @MONEY1, to reinforce the building's frameworks. This initial obstacle already sowed doubt in the builders' minds, making them realize that this project would not be easy. The next issue they discovered was related to hydrogen dirigibles, which were extremely flammable. If a huge dirigible were to catch fire and fall onto New York City, it would be a catastrophic event. Knowing about this great risk further dampened their enthusiasm for the work. The wind above the building was constantly shifting due to air currents, which would toss and turn the dirigible tethered to the mast. The designers realized that this situation was neither practical nor safe, especially considering the pedestrians on the ground. The last obstacle, which really killed their mooring idea, was airship laws. The law clearly states that dirigibles cannot fly that low over urban areas, thus putting an illegal mark on their plans. Due to these multiple obstacles, the designers of the mooring mast were unable to use their mast as intended.
1217	16050	6	3	"There were many unforeseen obstacles that the architects faced while building the docking station for the dirigibles. One of these challenges was the height of the docking station and the lack of safety that came with it. In @DATE1, the German dirigible ""Hindenburg"", which used a highly flammable hydrogen, caught fire in New Jersey as described in paragraph thirteen. If such an incident were to happen to a dirigible docked high over New York City, the airship would plummet to the ground where many New @CAPS1 would be going about their daily lives. The largest obstacle they faced, however, was nature. Air currents and storms would cause the dirigible, which was only tethered to the mooring mast by a rope, to ""swivel around and around the mooring mast... dangling high above pedestrians on the street."" As pointed out in paragraph fourteen, this situation was neither practical nor safe. The third obstacle they encountered was a pre - existing law against airships flying too low over urbanized areas. Even though the Empire State Building is very tall, it was still impossible to legally dock at the new mooring mast. Due to safety concerns, the challenges posed by nature, and state law, Al Smith's idea of using the docking station finally had to be abandoned."
1218	16051	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many hurdles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was that the weight of the dirigible ""or blimp"", along with wind pressure, caused excessive stress on the building's frame. The architects managed to overcome this obstacle by strengthening the iron frame of the building so that it could withstand the added stress. Unfortunately, the other obstacles proved insurmountable and led to the abandonment of using the mast for docking dirigibles. The most significant problem was safety. Many blimps used hydrogen rather than helium to stay afloat, and hydrogen is highly flammable. There was a high risk of the blimp catching fire and falling onto the city. Nature also presented a huge obstacle. Wind would blow the blimp into surrounding buildings, and since it was only tethered to the mooring mast by a rope and floating in the air, weights couldn't effectively keep it stable. Finally, there was an existing law stating that aircraft could not fly too low around urban areas. Due to these combined factors, the plan to use the mast for dirigible docking had to be scrapped."
1219	16052	6	3	The problems that were faced were that the ships could be easily blown by the wind and hit nearby buildings. To address this, they thought of putting weights on the ship. However, there was a significant risk that these weights could fall off and hit people on the ground. This double - edged problem made it extremely difficult to find a practical solution for the safe operation of the ships, and it became clear that the proposed methods to deal with the wind - related issue were not viable.
1220	16053	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, many obstacles were described that hindered the plan of allowing dirigibles to dock on The Empire State Building. One obstacle was that the Empire State Building had a flat roof, and the framework of the building would have to be significantly strengthened to install the mooring mast. The architects could not simply place a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. It cost more than @MONEY1 to modify the framework, which was a substantial expense. Another obstacle was the law. ""Flying too low over urban areas"" was illegal, so it would be impossible for a dirigible to even approach the Empire State Building. Lastly, the biggest obstacle was safety. Blimps being flown around New York were made using hydrogen, which is flammable. Also, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" It would not be safe to hook a blimp up in those winds where it would be constantly shifting. Of course, it was also a safety hazard because thousands of pedestrians would be walking on the road below, ""Where [the dirigibles] would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street."" It would be a terrible situation if one fell. Considering all these obstacles, it should have been obvious from the start that hooking dirigibles to a mast on the Empire State Building was not going to work."
1221	16054	6	3	"On the excerpt, there were a multitude of obstacles during the attempt to build the Empire State Building and make it safe for dirigible docking. The first hurdle in constructing the Empire State Building was that the engineer Al Smith aimed to make it ""the world's tallest building."" When the Empire State Building was conceptualized, it was planned to be taller than the newly - constructed Chrysler Building. The problem was that the architect of the Chrysler Building secretly installed a 185 - ft spire inside the building. Al Smith came up with an idea that would not only make the Empire State Building taller but also better. His idea was more than just an ""ornament."" He believed that the top of the building would serve a higher purpose. The Empire State Building would be equipped for an era of transportation that was then merely the dream of aviation pioneers. He thought he could use the building as a dock for dirigibles, allowing people to board and disembark. However, the frame design would not work. ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose."" They attempted to land dirigibles several times, but in the end, they were unsuccessful. In December 1930, the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but couldn't get close enough. Despite their efforts, they could not resolve the issue, and the dream of using the building as a dirigible dock remained unfulfilled."
1222	16055	6	3	"The Empire State Building initially emerged as a colossal skyscraper. Then, Al Smith, driven by competition, set his crew to full - scale work. The crew encountered numerous obstacles to overcome. First, they had to carefully modify and strengthen the building's steel frame, an expensive task that cost over sixty thousand dollars. Second, the men crafted a shiny glass and chrome - nickel stainless steel tower, which was illuminated from the inside, creating an eye - catching feature. Next, they added four wings made of shiny aluminum to support a conical roof that would house the mooring arm. Fourth, the crew installed stairs and elevators to accommodate the ""blimps"" passengers, ensuring a smooth boarding and disembarking process. Lastly, they added a couple of well - designed observation rooms on the @NUM1 and 102 floors. Smith's men worked diligently and overcame many challenges in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. Despite the difficulties, their efforts demonstrated their determination to turn the vision into reality."
1223	16056	6	3	"Architects and builders encountered several significant obstacles when trying to construct the Empire State Building and enable dirigibles to dock there. One of the major challenges they faced was maintaining a safe environment. Dirigibles fueled by hydrogen are extremely prone to being destroyed by fire. A prime example of this danger is described in paragraph @NUM1, where ""the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey."" Another substantial obstacle was the high wind speeds and violent air currents. These natural forces made the docking process perilous as the back of the dirigible would be swung around the mooring mast. Lastly, they had to deal with a legal hurdle. As stated in paragraph @NUM2, ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" restricted dirigibles from being able to dock or even fly in the vicinity. All of these obstacles proved insurmountable, and in the end, the mooring mast failed to serve its intended purpose, highlighting the complexity of the project."
1224	16057	6	3	"There were numerous obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. For instance, they sought to add more height to the Empire State Building so that it could be ""equipped for an age of transportation that was then only the dream of aviation dream,"" as @PERSON1 mentioned. Al Smith had the vision of adding a mooring mast at the top of the Empire State Building. This mast would enable dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or servicing, and to facilitate the boarding and disembarking of passengers. A significant amount of work was required. Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework. They designed a shiny glass and chrome - nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from inside, with a stepped - back design mirroring the overall shape of the building. The rocket - shaped mast would have four wings at its corners, made of shiny aluminum, and would rise to a conical roof that would house the mooring arms. The roof construction had to be completed before the mast could be installed. The most challenging obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself, with factors like high winds and unpredictable air currents. In conclusion, these were the diverse obstacles the builders faced in their pursuit of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building."
1225	16058	6	3	"It is our inherent obligation as human beings to have dreams and strive to turn them into reality. Al Smith's dream of having dirigibles land on the Empire State Building is, in my opinion, rather far - fetched. From the very beginning of the project, there were numerous obstacles that indicated its likely failure. It was evident early in the construction process that this idea was unrealistic because ""the one obstacle to their expanded life in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area"" (paragraph 6). The thought of dirigibles cruising through a large, densely - populated city should have been clearly unfeasible to Al Smith, even before the building's construction began. Safety was also a crucial concern. Since ""most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable,"" it posed a significant risk. This safety issue was further compounded by the existing laws regarding objects flying too low over urban areas (paragraph @NUM1). In the end, these multiple obstacles made it nearly impossible for Al Smith's dream to come true."
1226	16059	6	3	"The first obstacle was to make the Empire State Building the world's tallest building by adding a distinctive top or ""hat"" to increase its height slightly. And the second obstacle was to safely drop people from the mooring mast to the Empire State Building's flat roof. After considering these challenges, it became clear that significant engineering solutions would be required to overcome them, but despite the difficulties, the concept held a certain allure for those envisioning the building's unique functionality."
1227	16060	6	3	The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the building were quite apparent. One obstacle was that of nature; the winds atop the building were at high, unpredictable speeds and constantly changing direction. This would make the dirigible highly unstable and extremely difficult to dock safely. Another obstacle they faced was that of the passengers' and bystanders' safety. The dirigible could easily become uncontrollable, putting many lives at risk in the densely populated area below. The last obstacle the builders faced was that of a law against flying airships too low over urban areas. This legal restriction would make it illegal for a dirigible to dock on the Empire State Building. The many obstacles that the builders faced ultimately blocked the completion of having a dirigible dock atop the Empire State Building, highlighting the complex interplay between engineering, safety, and legal considerations.
1228	16061	6	3	The obstacles the builders would have to face would be things such as structural integrity concerns, and worrying about future technological advances. Even if they found out how to land a dirigible on the platform, what about potential advances in dirigibles themselves or the emergence of new transportation methods that could render the docking facility obsolete. The structural integrity issue was a relatively quick fix; by reinforcing the supports to the building itself, they could address the immediate concern. However, the long - term viability of the project remained uncertain due to the ever - changing technological landscape.
1229	16062	6	3	"There were many obstacles faced by the builders in the creation of the mast. One obstacle was the building's flat roof. A dirigible that was moored to the building by a single cable would cause significant stress on the building's frame. Due to this, the builders had to carefully modify and strengthen the frame to solve this obstacle. Another problem was that other countries still used hydrogen in their dirigibles, and an explosion over New York would be utterly devastating to the city and its inhabitants. One of the greatest obstacles was ""nature itself."" The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing, causing the back of the ship to move erratically around the mooring mast. They had to solve this in a safe manner. In fields, the back of a dirigible would typically be weighed down by lead, but this could not be done in the urban setting of New York. It would be unsafe to allow the lead to dangle over civilians' heads. On top of all these obstacles, there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. In the end, the mooring mast was a failure because not all these obstacles could be solved and fixed, showing the limitations of the ambitious plan in the face of multiple challenges."
1230	16063	6	3	The first obstacle came when the Chrysler Building had changed its height. They created the mooring mast and made the Empire State Building 200 ft. higher. Then they figured out that the mast would add excessive stress to the building's frame, which could compromise its structural safety. Then, with the new laws restricting airship operations and the tragic Hindenburg disaster, it became clear that the mooring mast would not work out. So, they gave up trying to make it useful, realizing that the combination of structural, legal, and safety factors made the project unfeasible.
1231	16064	6	3	First item: First, there was no practical way to anchor any dirigibles securely. They couldn't make the back of the dirigibles stable; the only option was to add lead weights. However, having lead weights dangling above a crowded street was not a good idea. Second, there were strict laws in place clearly stating that a dirigible couldn't fly that close to buildings. Also, when the German blimp Hindenburg was destroyed by fire near a New Jersey naval base, people thought about how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York. Moreover, the wind that high up was extremely fierce and strong, making it nearly impossible for a blimp to even get close to the building. All in all, it was an unfeasible and bad idea.
1232	16065	6	3	"Second item: In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many significant obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One major obstacle that was faced was the building's foundation. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure will have to be transmitted, nearly eleven hundred feet below."" This became a formidable obstacle because the building had already been constructed, so they'd have to carefully work around the existing foundation. Another obstacle that was faced was a law. The law clearly stated ""no airships are allowed to fly low over urban areas."" This became an obstacle because they had to thoroughly convince government officials that it was safe. Finally, the greatest obstacle was nature itself. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This was an obstacle because winds could get so severe that the dirigible tied up could potentially rip the roof off and seriously hurt the people below. In conclusion, that is how the builders in the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, faced many insurmountable obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, ultimately making it a very challenging and perhaps unachievable task."
1233	16066	6	3	Third item: The task of allowing dirigibles to dock on The Empire State Building was met with many significant obstacles. The first one to come into play was the support of the building. The dirigible's substantial load and the strong wind pressure would greatly reduce the stability of the building. To address this, over sixty thousand dollars' worth of investment went into carefully modifying the building's framework. Another problem was the dirigibles themselves. Most dirigibles coming from outside of the United States were filled with hydrogen. As clearly seen in the tragic Hindenburg incident, hydrogen is highly flammable. The owners of the Empire State Building concluded that an accident such as this would be even more devastating over a densely populated area. After being faced with all these serious obstacles, the idea of dirigibles docking atop the Empire State Building was sensibly put to rest for the safety of the people in the area.
1234	16067	6	3	Fourth item: When constructing the mooring mast on top of the empire state building it seemed as if the engineers looked past all of its obvious flaws. Safety was probably one of the biggest issues for the mooring mast. It was said most dirigibles outside the United States used hydrogen instead of helium. This usage of hydrogen thus caused a significantly higher risk of explosion. After the tragic events of the Hindenburg in Lakehurst, New Jersey, they were very afraid of what would happen if a similar incident occurred above downtown. Nature was believed to be its biggest obstacle. Winds at the top of the air always shifted violently due to air currents. The back of the ships would swivel around and around the mooring mast. Regulations were another major reason. Dirigibles were not allowed to fly below a certain height over urban areas. This made it completely illegal to even approach the area where the building was. Al Smith really should have done some more in - depth studying about what could have gone wrong with his mooring mast to avoid such a flawed design.
1235	16068	6	3	Fifth item: The builders of the Empire state Building faced numerous complex technical and safety problems in creating the building's dirigible mooring mast. First off, a dirigible moored to the mast by just one cable would put an enormous amount of stress on the frame of the building. To ensure the building's integrity, the building's frame had to be strengthened first to allow such a project. When the mast was finally finished, several other problems emerged and prevented its use. The mast was designed to make the building a center of travel, but most dirigibles from other countries used hydrogen to fly, instead of the safer helium. Earlier, the German blimp Hindenburg had been destroyed because hydrogen was so highly flammable. It was realized that such a disaster would be much more catastrophic should it happen over a densely populated city like New York. Also, blimps moored to the mast would be blown around by violent winds, possibly pushing them into nearby buildings. The lead weights normally used to prevent this would have had to be left dangling over pedestrians, which was a major safety concern. Moreover, there was a law strictly prohibiting dirigibles from flying too low over urban settlements, making use of the mast completely illegal. These problems doomed the mooring mast project from the very start, making it an unviable and ill - fated endeavor.
1236	16069	6	3	The fact that these dirigibles are quite large and filled with hydrogen and helium means that even a minor protrusion like the point at the top could potentially pop the gas - filled structure. Moreover, the winds were consistently too strong. Under such high - wind conditions, they would never be able to safely connect the blimp to the building. Lastly, considering how the German dirigible, Hindenburg, burned so catastrophically, people were extremely afraid of a similar incident occurring. This fear was especially acute in a crowded area such as New York, where the consequences of a dirigible fire would be devastating. So, overall, these factors made it highly unfeasible to use dirigibles in such an environment.
1237	16070	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building were faced with numerous challenges when attempting to construct a mooring mast for dirigibles. The first major problem they encountered was related to the building itself. As stated, ""The stress of the dirigibles' load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" Given that the building was the tallest in the world at that time, it simply could not withstand such pressure. They could potentially have strengthened the building, but this would have come at a very high cost for a structure that was already expensive to build. The architects' next obstacle was safety, especially in a highly populated area like downtown New York. They found the dirigibles to be too dangerous and difficult to control in a city full of towering buildings. The normal processes of docking a dirigible would have to be completely changed to accommodate the mooring mast. Soon after the Hindenburg incident, laws were enacted to keep airships away from populated areas. Yet, some still dared to try and dock at the mast, such as the Los Angeles and Columbia. However, the mast was never put to good use, which clearly shows the difficulties in innovating on something as well - established as the Empire State Building."
1238	16071	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced a multitude of obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. A significant safety concern was that most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable, which posed a great risk in the event of an accident. Another issue was related to the docking process. When dirigibles moored in open landing fields, they could be weighted down in the back with lead weights. But using these at the Empire State Building would not be practical due to the highly populated nature of New York. Dangling lead weights over pedestrians would be extremely dangerous. Additionally, there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made it illegal for a dirigible to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. Even if it could somehow bypass the legal restrictions, there were concerns that the dirigible would be punctured by other obstacles on surrounding buildings. In the end, these combined factors made it nearly impossible to use the Empire State Building as a dirigible docking site.
1239	16072	6	3	"Architects and builders working on constructing a docking platform on top of the Empire State Building for dirigibles faced a series of obstacles. The first problem the builders encountered was the possibility that the building's framework might not be strong enough to support a dirigible's weight. As mentioned in paragraph nine, ""the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way down to the building's foundation, and that was too risky."" Another obstacle was ""nature itself."" Since some dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium, it was feared that the winds on top of the building would be too intense and violent. These strong winds could potentially cause the dirigible to be destroyed by the flammable gas it carried. The next obstacle the builders faced was public safety. There was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. Due to this law, dirigibles could not approach the dock over the area for the safety of the citizens of New York. All of these problems eventually led to ""the idea of using the mooring mast [to be] shelved,"" highlighting the complexity of implementing such an innovative but risky project."
1240	16073	6	3	After reading the excerpt, it is clear that there were many obstacles the builders faced in attempting to dock dirigibles on top of the Empire State Building. Firstly, there was a lack of a suitable landing area. The builders were well - aware that they had to add a mooring mast to the top of the building so that the dirigibles could land safely and passengers could board and exit. Another problem they faced was the issue of stress on the building's frame. Placing a thousand - foot dirigible at the top of the building would exert a significant amount of stress. This pressure, combined with the wind pressure, would have to be transferred all the way to the building's foundation. Lastly, the biggest obstacle was nature. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting because of violent air currents. These shifting winds would allow the back of the ship to swivel around the mooring mast, making docking extremely difficult. Although the idea of using dirigibles to improve transportation was a bright one, this concept never worked in practice as it was not thoroughly thought out. In conclusion, these multiple challenges made it unfeasible to use the Empire State Building as a dirigible docking station.
1241	16074	6	3	Based on the excerpt given, the idea for allowing dirigibles to land on a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building in New York City was not practical. One significant obstacle that proves this point is that most dirigibles are filled with hydrogen, a highly flammable gas, rather than helium like a balloon. This highly combustible nature of hydrogen raises serious safety issues for the bustling urban city. Another obstacle that prevented this idea from being practical was that certain laws were passed stating that dirigibles and airships could only fly so low over urban areas due to the presence of violent winds and the high risk of destruction. In the end, the mooring mast was and isn't practical for the landing of airships and is mainly useful as a tourist attraction.
1242	16075	6	3	"The architects of the Empire State building faced several obstacles when constructing the mooring mast. One of these was that for the purpose it was supposed to serve (docking dirigibles), the original design of the building could not handle it. In paragraph @NUM1, it clearly says ""A thousand - foot dirigibles would add stress to the building's frame."" Because of this realization, they had to make ""sixty - thousand dollars worth of modifications"" (paragraph @NUM1). Another obstacle they would have to face would be the additions of new floors. They originally designed the building to be about @NUM3 floors, but with the addition of the mooring mast, the builders had to construct an extra top floor and do it with such meticulous detail so that it could function as both an observatory and a boarding dock. These first two obstacles, although they were difficult, nevertheless they were solvable. Some of the obstacles the builders had to face were not fixable. The first was that dirigibles from @LOCATION2 were filled with hydrogen (which is highly flammable). Due to the location of the Empire State building (downtown New York), a minor accident could cause huge problems in the densely populated city. Also, they did not take into full consideration the winds at the top of the building. The Empire State building would be at such a high altitude that there would be very strong and unpredictable winds. These winds would cause the dirigibles to be unstable, which was also not safe. With these last two obstacles, the mooring mast was still built, but it ended up serving as a mere design element instead of a functional dock."
1243	16076	6	3	"In the excerpt, the obstacles the architects of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was the ""lack of a suitable landing area"". (p. @NUM1) The architects were trying to create a suitable landing area to allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers off and on. They tried to implement an electric winch. This winch ""would swing in the breeze and yet passengers could safely get on and off the dirigible by walking a gangplank to an open observation platform."" The biggest obstacle the architects of the Empire State building had to face was ""nature itself"". This meant that dirigibles were typically moored in open landing fields, but here they would be high above pedestrians on the street, which was neither practical nor safe. The architects of the Empire State attempted these measures to allow dirigibles to enter on the property of the Empire State Building, but ultimately, the challenges posed by nature and the lack of a proper landing area made it a difficult feat."
1244	16077	6	3	"In this excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, there were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced. The safety of the people was at stake, nature was also a great obstacle, and another reason was that dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State building because it was against the law. First of all, the obstacle that the builders completely forgot about was the safety of the people. Most of the blimps from outside of the @LOCATION2 used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is extremely flammable. In a densely populated area like New York, they did not want to risk anyone getting hurt in case of an accident. Also, another big obstacle was the power of nature itself. At times, the winds would be extremely violent and would blow back and forth. If a blimp was attached to the mast, it would be dangling violently over the citizens, which was far from safe. Lastly, it was illegal to have airships flying close to urban areas, and New York was a highly dense city. The reason for this law was to ensure that nothing bad would happen to the citizens. In conclusion, there were many obstacles the builders had gone through, and they were so focused on the project and eager to get it done that they forgot about safety. As a result, the intended function of the mooring mast for dirigible docking could not be realized."
1245	16078	6	3	There would have been multiple obstacles when allowing a dirigible to dock at the top of the Empire State building. First, as the area develops, it may get very densely populated with taller buildings. This would create a congested air - space around the Empire State building, making it difficult for dirigibles to approach and dock safely. Since they had never built a docking facility for dirigibles on top of such a tall building before, there was a high probability that something could go wrong during the construction or operation of the docking system. And last, just like the Hindenburg disaster, another similar catastrophe could happen, but this time in a densely populated city like New York. The consequences of such an event in a place with a large number of people would be far more severe. In conclusion, these multiple obstacles made the idea of allowing dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State building a very risky and impractical proposition.
1246	16079	6	3	"While constructing the Empire State Building, the builders encountered numerous challenges when trying to enable dirigibles to dock there. One of the most significant obstacles was safety. They had to figure out a way to dock the dirigibles to the mast without having them swing wildly in the wind. As noted in the source, ""Even if the dirigibles were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" Another hurdle was designing the mast. The architects couldn't simply place a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. The building's steel frame needed to be reinforced to bear the weight of the mast. In the end, these difficulties made the plan of having dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building unfeasible."
1247	16080	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles during the construction of the mast. The first major obstacle was related to the building's stability. As the excerpt states, ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened."" This indicates that to build the mast, the entire structure of the building needed to be adjusted to accommodate its use. The second obstacle they faced, in the actual operation of the mast, was nature. In the hope of docking dirigibles to the mast, nature proved to be a hindrance. As described in the excerpt, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air - currents."" They also warned that with these air currents, passengers would not be able to disembark from the dirigible safely as the end of the dirigible would float rapidly when undocked. Moreover, they were concerned that if the end of the dirigible was docked, it could pose a danger to pedestrians below, just as the helium in the dirigible might. Considering all these factors, it became clear that building a functional mast for dirigible docking was extremely challenging."
1248	16081	6	3	"The builders faced several obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock on the mast of the Empire State Building, and eventually, they gave up. According to the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Løsted, the Chrysler building in New York City was about to reach the planned height of the yet - to - be - built Empire State Building. The weight and force of a dirigible could potentially damage the whole building, so it had to be strengthened and modified to enable the blimp to land. The engineers also had to find a way to manage the flammability that dirigibles typically possess. In paragraph @NUM1, Løsted mentions a dirigible that exploded in New Jersey not long ago, and constructing a landing pad over the densely populated New York City could have disastrous consequences. The constructors of the mooring mast finally concluded that the plan was ""neither practical nor safe"" (@NUM2). Blimps are held down with lead weights, and if something were to go wrong, this could have a negative impact on pedestrians. The builders of the Empire State Building had a lot to consider when it came to constructing the dirigible dock, and in the end, it was a wise decision to abandon the plan."
1249	16082	6	3	"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"", the author, Marcia Amidon Løsted, explains that the spire of the Empire State Building was initially intended to be used as a mooring mast. However, this purpose was never realized due to the numerous problems and obstacles the builders faced in trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. Some of the most significant problems were unpredictable and violent winds, the flammability of dirigibles, and air laws. The winds were a major issue because even if the front of the dirigible was tethered to the mast, the back would swing freely in the wind, potentially crashing into another moored dirigible. The winds also made it extremely hazardous for the dirigible to approach the Empire State Building. The use of hydrogen in dirigibles was a problem as it is a highly volatile gas that can explode, which would be extremely dangerous over a densely populated area. Lastly, the air laws were an obstacle because the United States has a law that prohibits airships from flying too low over urban areas, making a mooring at the Empire State Building illegal. Given these challenges, it was clear that the plan was unworkable."
1250	16083	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Løsted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple obstacles such as the use of hydrogen, air currents, and existing laws when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the building. The first obstacle they encountered was the use of hydrogen in most dirigibles outside the United States. Hydrogen is highly flammable, posing a significant safety risk. A German dirigible was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey. As stated, ""The owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" If such an accident had occurred in New York, the damage would have been far more severe. Another obstacle was the violent air currents. As mentioned, ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" This is extremely dangerous for pedestrians on the street. The final obstacle was an existing law that prohibits airships from flying low over urban areas. As it says, ""The law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to a building."" This law effectively prevented dirigibles from approaching New York. Considering all these obstacles, it was evident that allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was not a viable option."
1251	16084	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were quite significant. The stress of the dirigibles' load and wind pressure could have caused severe problems to the building's foundation. A thousand - foot dirigble, held by a single cable tether, would add a substantial amount of stress to the building's frame. This stress would not only affect the upper parts but also have to be transmitted all the way down to the foundation. Safety was another major issue. Most dirigbles outside the United States used hydrogen, instead of helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable, which poses a great risk. On May 6, 1937, the German dirigble Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in New Jersey. The accident would have been far more dangerous in New York because the city is densely populated. Another reason why they faced problems to allow dirigibles to dock is because there was an existing law against airships flying too close over urban areas. In December 1930, the @ORGANIZATION2 dirigble did attempt to reach the mooring mast but could not reach because of the strong winds. The pilots were fearing that the winds may blow the dirigble onto the sharp spires of other buildings, which would puncture the dirigble's shell. Due to these multiple obstacles, the plan to use the Empire State Building for dirigible docking faced insurmountable challenges.
1252	16085	6	3	"Without a doubt, the builders of the mooring mast that was to rest at the top of the Empire State Building were highly innovative and ambitious. They had grand plans for the use of the mooring mast, envisioning a new era of air - travel docking. However, it is also clear that they faced many difficulties that they both overcame and were overcome by. One major difficulty that they faced was that a one thousand foot long dirigible being tethered to a 1,250 foot tall building with extreme wind currents around the top would put a great deal of stress onto the building. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation... Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" Through hard work and engineering expertise, @CAPS1, the builders were able to overcome this problem. After the building was completed, however, the mooring mast was not able to be used for its full purpose because of more challenges that it faced. After the tragic accident with the Hindenburg, ""the owners realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" Another concern was that with such strong winds and only being able to tie the front of the dirigible to the moor, the back would swing around. ""Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe."" The final challenge facing the mooring mast was the pre - existing law against low - flying aircraft. This put an end to Al Smith's dreams, as the combination of safety concerns and legal restrictions made the full - scale use of the mooring mast unfeasible."
1253	16086	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, the obstacles the builder of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were quite complex. My prediction is that he doesn't want it around because the Empire State Building is extremely high, and the blimps would be floating right above it. Something may go wrong, and that's what I think Al Smith is worried about. My backup answer is the statement he said ""it's on the level, all right. ""No kidding"". We're on the thing now. One set of engineers here in New York is trying to figure out a practical, workable arrangement and the Government people in Washington are figuring on some safe way of mooring airships to this mast"". It seems like he is confused about the whole situation, as there are so many factors to consider, such as the building's structural integrity, safety of the public, and the practicality of docking dirigibles in such a high - rise and urban environment. Due to these uncertainties and challenges, the plan to use the building for dirigible docking was fraught with difficulties."
1254	16087	6	3	There were many obstacles builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle they faced was that some dirigibles were @NUM1 feet long, which was equivalent to four blocks in New York City. This was a significant obstacle because when it was attached by a single tether, it would add a large amount of stress to the building's frame. In order for this to happen, the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be strengthened and modified. The next obstacle they faced was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. For example, in the excerpt it said that the U.S. navy dirigible Los @CAPS1 approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of the forceful winds. The strong winds made it extremely difficult to control the dirigible's movement. Also, the captain could not even take his hands off the lever as the winds were so powerful. The next obstacle they faced was the safety issue. The builders of said the dirigibles are weighted down by lead but if they did that it would be a safety issue. It would be a safety issue since the dirigible would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, posing a risk of the weights falling and causing harm. The last obstacle they faced was the law against flying too low over urban areas. It would make it illegal for a ship to tie up to the building or even approach the area. All these obstacles combined made it very challenging for the builders to achieve the goal of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
1255	16088	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on its mooring mast. The first obstacle they had was the extreme winds. The winds were constantly shifting, and as a result, the dirigibles would be violently blowing through the air. This made it extremely difficult to control the dirigible's approach and docking. The shifting winds could push the dirigible off - course or cause it to collide with the building or other structures. Another obstacle was that the foreign dirigibles used hydrogen, instead of helium. Hydrogen is extremely flammable, which means that any small spark or ignition source could lead to a catastrophic explosion. This was a major safety concern, especially considering the high - rise and densely populated location of the Empire State Building. The last obstacle the builders faced was the law that did not allow airships to fly too low over urban areas. This law was in place to protect the safety of the people on the ground. The builders of the Empire State Building dealt with a number of reasons when they attempted to dock dirigibles on the building's mast. Due to these multiple obstacles, the plan to use the building for dirigible docking was ultimately not successful.
1256	16089	6	3	Many obstacles were confronted when attempting to dock dirigibles on the Empire State Building. Such as the danger posed by non - U.S. dirigibles docking. These non - U.S. dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium in their construction. Hydrogen is a highly flammable gas, which made these dirigibles extremely risky to operate near a densely populated area like downtown New York. People vividly recalled the German dirigible crash and shuddered at the thought of a similar accident occurring right above the bustling streets of New York. Another significant issue was nature's wind force. The wind on top of the Empire State Building was constantly and aggressively shifting. Using lead weights, a common practice when dirigibles land in open fields, would pose a great hazard to the people walking below. Finally, the law was an insurmountable hurdle. The law clearly stated that it was illegal to fly dirigibles this low over urban areas. Though two dirigibles attempted to dock, they both experienced firsthand the numerous dangers involved, which ultimately made the idea of regular dirigible docking on the Empire State Building unfeasible.
1257	16090	6	3	"Based on the expert's analysis, builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Allowing a dirigible to dock on top of the Empire State Building was never considered an easy task to achieve. As clearly mentioned in the article, the idea of the dirigible docking at the Empire State Building was ""destined to never fulfill its purposes."" One major obstacle the builders would face was safety. Since most of the dirigibles from outside the U.S.A used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is much more flammable, it presented a very real and dangerous situation. Fire itself is extremely perilous, and having a highly flammable dirigible over a populated area was a nightmare scenario. The greatest obstacle, however, was nature itself. If the winds were shifting violently, the dirigibles could be pulled down and left dangling high above the pedestrians. This would not be safe for the people on the ground or the builders working on the project as it could cause serious harm. Another obstacle the builders would face was that there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made it illegal for a ship to ever tie up or get close to the area, which further complicated the builders' efforts to accomplish the docking goal as it was against the law, making the entire endeavor a near - impossible feat."
1258	16091	6	3	"In ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION1, there were numerous obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building were faced with in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. One such obstacle was that if a dirigible were tied to the building by a single tether, it would ""add stress to the building's frame."" To address this problem, over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's structure. These modifications were crucial to ensure the building's stability when a dirigible was attached. Another significant problem was that some dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable, and having a flammable dirigible over a densely populated area like New York City was extremely dangerous. The ""greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" By this, L¸sted means that there are many violent air currents at the top of the building. These air currents would cause the ship to swivel around and around uncontrollably. To prevent this from happening, lead weights would have to be used. However, having lead weights ""dangling high above pedestrians"" was neither practical nor safe. In the end, people realized that there were far too many problems involved in the use of a mooring mast at the top of the Empire State Building, and the idea was ultimately abandoned."
1259	16092	6	3	To start off, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered a multitude of obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. Many of these obstacles were directly related to the dirigible itself. For example, by the 1930s, dirigibles were highly unsafe and flammable. The tragic incident when the German dirigible was destroyed by fire in New Jersey on May 6, 1937, served as a stark reminder. People quickly realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area, such as downtown New York. Another major obstacle that the builders faced was nature itself. The winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. It would be extremely dangerous for a dirigible to fly that close to a mooring mast under such windy conditions. Also, dirigibles could not fly near the Empire State Building because of an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or approach the area. Al Smith had a grand dream of making the Empire State Building suitable for transportation, but unfortunately, sometimes dreams don't always come to fruition due to the many practical and legal obstacles.
1260	16093	6	3	The experts faced a few major obstacles in the building of the Empire State Building. One of those major obstacles was the framework. When you're going to build a 1,250 - foot building and have an aircraft land on it, you need a good and well - designed frame. To address this, they added stainless steel and chrome - nickel windows to cut down on pressure. They also spent over sixty thousand dollars on modifications to the skeleton of the Empire State Building to ensure its structural integrity when an airship was attached. The other main issue was the air currents. You can't simply strap a dirigible and expect it to be stable with the back of it swaying back and forth. When you're almost 1100 ft in the air, the wind can be very violent at that height. If the dirigible ever came off or unhooked before they were done refueling, it would crash and burn, endangering hundreds of pedestrians on the ground below. Al Smith had a great idea, but he did not fully realize all the complex problems that would arise in making the Empire State Building a suitable docking place for dirigibles, which ultimately made the implementation of his vision a challenging and unachievable task.
1261	16094	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. They had to carefully consider the stress on the building. Adding docking facilities to the top of the building would inevitably increase the stress. The steel frame, which was originally designed for normal use, would have to be thoroughly modified and significantly strengthened to meet the new requirements. Also, it would cost over @MONEY1 worth of modifications. The builders also faced the obstacle of safety. Most dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable, so allowing dirigibles filled with it to dock on the building wouldn't be safe at all. There was also an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, which was another hurdle. Facing all these insurmountable obstacles, the builders decided not to go through with this idea.
1262	16095	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One main concern was the dirigibles themselves because they typically use hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is very flammable. If a dirigible were to explode above a densely populated area like New York City, it would be disastrous. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the building's mooring mast was nature. A mooring mast is specifically used for docking airships such as a dirigible or a zeppelin. With these large air - crafts, docking them on top of a building where winds are violently shifting is extremely dangerous. The back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast, posing as a @CAPS1 threat. Usually, dirigibles are moored in open land fields where they can be weighed down with lead weights. But with a dirigible moored over the Empire State Building, it would dangle high above pedestrians, which is neither @CAPS2 nor practical. Constructing the Empire State Building had @CAPS3 more challenges and obstacles than its architects would have hoped for, and these issues ultimately made the idea of dirigible docking unfeasible.
1263	16096	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building had various problems to @CAPS1 in allowing dirigibles to dock there. The nature of the ships, added stress to the building, and safety were all against the ludicrous idea of landing blimps on the Empire State Building. The nature of the ships would cause the body to sway in the wind. One problem that comes from this swaying is tangling the mooring cable. To combat this, captains would have to use lead counterweights. These counterweights were highly impractical to use because they would be hanging over crowded streets, posing a risk to the people below. Another problem was the added stress to the building's foundation. Since the building was not ordinarily designed for this role, extensive modifications would have to be made to its foundation. The cost of these renovations was over sixty thousand dollars, which was a significant expense. The most obvious problem was safety. These airships were filled with highly flammable hydrogen. The area surrounding the building had other buildings with sharp spires on top. If a ship hit one of these, there was no stopping the disaster, making the idea of dirigible docking on the building completely unviable.
1264	16097	6	3	"Based on the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. These obstacles include the weather, safety, previous dirigible tragedy, and the law. The wind at the top of the Empire State building was a huge safety hazard. Even if the dirigible was secured, the back would swing and cause a potential hazard due to the unpredictable winds. To fly a dirigible, they are filled with hydrogen instead of helium. This is also dangerous because hydrogen is very flammable. On May 6, 1937, the Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, @LOCATION3. So, the owners took into consideration that this could have been much worse if the accident had taken place above a densely populated area such as New York. Dirigibles are very unsafe, and these factors created many obstacles for the builders of the Empire State Building to allow dirigible to dock there, making the plan an unwise and risky one."
1265	16098	6	3	The obstacles that the builders faced are flying blimps too low in the area and making the Empire State building taller than its actually supposed to be. Like in @CAPS1, three Al Smith realized that he was in danger of losing his title for the world's tallest building. On December 11, 1929, he announced that the Empire State building would reach a height of 1,250 ft. All he had to do was add a top or a hat to the building, and that would make it even taller than any other building in the city. Another obstacle they faced was a law about airships flying too low above urban areas. They made this law to ensure that no airship would ever tie up with a building. Flying too low is a huge safety hazard; it could take the lives of hundreds of people. Due to these significant obstacles, the idea of allowing blimps to dock at the Empire State Building faced serious challenges and was difficult to implement.
1266	16099	6	3	In the excerpt there were multiple challenges the builders encountered when aiming to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. First, they had to enhance the strength of the building's steel frame to withstand the forces exerted by the dirigibles. The builders also made the Empire State Building reach 102 stories in height, with the 101st story designed as an observatory. The final hurdle they faced was the actual construction of the Empire State Building itself. These were the main obstacles that the builders had to overcome during the construction of the Empire State Building.
1267	16100	6	3	In the excerpt “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, there were numerous obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the significant problems was that if a huge dirigible was held at the top of the building by a single cable, it would place excessive stress on the rest of the building. To make the upper half of the building more stable, they would have to invest sixty thousand dollars in modifications. Nature also posed a key issue. The winds were highly unpredictable due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigibles were tied to the mast, their backs would swivel around. Additionally, having large dirigibles dangling above pedestrians was a significant safety concern. Another reason why dirigibles could not be docked at the top of the Empire State Building was that there was a law prohibiting airships from flying so low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal to ever dock ships there. Overall, these were some of the obstacles faced while building the Empire State Building.
1268	16101	6	3	Coming from “The Mooring Mast,” by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the Empire State Building was initially envisioned to be much more. The hazards associated with the gases in some of the dirigibles were a huge risk as some of these gases were highly flammable. Having the mooring mast in the middle of a huge city posed potential threats to the safety of the city and its population. Alongside the safety threat, the winds were uncontrollable. Since the mast would be located so high up, it was nearly impossible to predict the ever - changing winds. Due to the winds, the dirigibles would not be able to stay in one place, which was another safety issue that the architects had overlooked. After considering all the safety issues and weather - related problems, there was still the fact that a law prohibited the idea. This made the mast idea completely unfeasible. With all the risky and dangerous tasks they would have had to deal with, the mast was never built. It was very unfortunate that after all the planning, there was absolutely no way the dirigibles could ever land there.
1269	16102	6	3	In the excerpt “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon @ORGANIZATION2, the architects faced multiple reasons that hindered their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. Initially, the architects couldn't install a mooring mast because it would add significant stress to the building's frame. To address this new situation, they had to modify and strengthen the steel frame of the building. Before putting up the mooring mast, the architects designed a shiny glass, chrome - nickel stainless steel tower to give the overall shape of the building an appealing look. Even before constructing the mooring mast on top of the building, the roof had to be completed. When they finally attempted to put the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building, it didn't work out. During the test, the dirigible didn't get close enough to be tied up. So, in the end, the concept of “The Mooring Mast” by @ORGANIZATION2 did not succeed.
1270	16103	6	3	The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced were related to their aspiration to create something greater and more spectacular. They aimed to develop a structure that would not only be a remarkable feat of engineering but also a symbol of progress and innovation. However, they had to deal with various challenges in the process, such as the complexity of the design, the availability of materials, and the safety requirements. Despite these difficulties, they persevered in their hope to achieve a greater and more spectacular outcome. In the end, the Empire State Building stands as a testament to their determination and vision.
1271	16104	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building had great and ambitious plans to allow dirigibles, also known as blimps, to dock there. They were filled with high hopes and kept their expectations at a lofty level. However, they faced numerous and significant obstacles while trying to make this happen. The first problem they ran into was the fact that the steel frame of the building would have to be substantially strengthened due to the immense stress of the dirigible's hefty load. So, the architects had to painstakingly make changes to the building's skeleton. Safety was also a major and pressing issue because hydrogen made the blimps highly flammable, which could potentially cause a massive destruction by fire. There was also an existing law clearly stating ""airships can't fly too low over urban areas."" As a result, dirigibles wouldn't be allowed to tie up to the building, let alone even reach that area. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" Due to the strong and heavy winds, the dirigibles would swivel around too much, and the area was not open enough to weigh down the back with lead weights. In the end, the architects of the Empire State Building faced too many insurmountable obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to successfully dock there, making the plan unfeasible."
1272	16105	6	3	When the Empire State Building was initially conceived, it was planned to be the tallest building. However, not many people know that the original purpose of the mast was to serve as a landing spot for dirigibles, also known as blimps. In the 1930s, dirigibles were being hailed as the transportation of the future, seen as a revolutionary and exciting mode of travel. The Empire State Building was going to have a mooring mast at its top for docking these new airships. However, in trying to do this, the builders faced many challenges and obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Some of these dirigibles were as long as one thousand feet, and this is where the first obstacle they faced comes into play. Since the dirigibles were so long, the first obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. Also, the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's roof. That, plus a 1000 ft dirigible moored at the top, would put a great deal of stress on the building's frame. This would be another obstacle the workers encountered. The mooring mast was destined to never fulfill its purpose, due to the safety of many people. This was yet another obstacle the workers faced. The final obstacle and the practical reason why dirigibles couldn't moor at the building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. These are the many obstacles the builders faced in attempting to dock dirigibles on the Empire State Building, ultimately making the plan fall through.
1273	16106	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many significant obstacles to allowing dirgibles to dock there. One major obstacle was the wind at the top of the building. The winds there were ""constantly shifting due to violent air currents,"" creating a highly unpredictable and dangerous situation. This made it extremely dangerous for a dirigible to stop there as it could be easily tossed around by the strong and erratic winds. Another obstacle was a law against flying dirigibles over cities. The law made it ""illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" Since they were banned from doing this, no pilot would ever risk docking there. A third obstacle was the decreasing use of dirigibles. With the tragic Hindenburg incident on May 6, 1937, which was a huge setback for the dirigible industry, and the increasing use of airplanes, not many people flew on airships anymore. In conclusion, several insurmountable obstacles prevented the docking of dirigibles to the Empire State Building, making the original plan unworkable."
1274	16107	6	3	"In attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, the builders faced many difficult obstacles. In order for the dirigibles to anchor there, a mooring mast must be added. The architects then had to find a way to add ""a thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building"" without adding excessive stress to the building's frame. This required careful planning and engineering. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" Architects knew that they could not control the weather, and this worried them a great deal. Unpredictable winds and storms could pose a serious threat to the safety of the dirigible and the building. Another obstacle the builders faced was the ""law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" If dirigibles were able to reach the building, something could go terribly wrong. Builders ""feared that the wind would blow the dirigible onto the sharp spires of other buildings in the area,"" endangering the lives of passengers and people on the ground. The obstacles the builders faced soon became pointless when ""the idea of using the mooring mast for dirigibles and their passengers had quietly disappeared,"" as the challenges were too great to overcome."
1275	16108	6	3	In attempting to build a working mooring dock for dirigibles on the Empire State Building, the workers set themselves a very hard task. First, they had to make sixty thousand dollars worth of extensive modifications so that the building would withstand the weight and added wind pressure of a moored dirigible. These modifications required a lot of time, effort, and resources. Also, a pre - existing law made it absolutely impossible for dirigibles to come as low to the city as they needed to be to dock. This law was a major roadblock to the plan. Finally, constant changes in wind current and other weather conditions made a safe docking at the Empire State Building nearly impossible. The dirigible might get blown into the sharp roofs of nearby buildings and instead of being weighted down by lead like they would when they landed in fields as they normally would, they would be tied up, dangling over pedestrians, posing a serious risk to public safety. In the end, these numerous and difficult obstacles made it clear that building a working mooring dock for dirigibles on the Empire State Building was not a practical or achievable goal.
1276	16109	6	3	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced were comprehended too late. First, they had to carefully figure out a proper way to go about this complex task. Moreover, they also needed to convince government officials that it was a truly safe way to execute Al's plan. The roof couldn't be flat, so they had to creatively design something else for the dirigible to land on. But the dirigible being held on by one cable ""would add significant stress to the building's frame"" and would transfer that stress all the way down to its foundation. This meant they would have to thoroughly modify their model of what the Empire State building was going to be. One of the worst obstacles the builders had to face was the fact that dirigibles are highly flammable. And there are many people and other buildings in @CAPS1 that could be put in great danger. Also, the weather takes a substantial toll on how the dirigibles are going to act in the air. If it's rough, it could cause major safety problems. There was and has been a law restricting airships from ""flying too low over urban areas."" Given these many issues, this idea was over from the start, but unfortunately, no one took the time to realize it."
1277	16110	6	3	The obstacles of The @CAPS1 of Them Empire state building were some quite big ones which led to some notable Problems. For @CAPS2, there was a serious lack of a proper Landing area for the Dirigible. This lack made it extremely difficult to achieve the goal of dirigible docking. But the @CAPS3 reason was the significant lack of safety. Due to this critical short - coming, this dream could not be accomplished, and the plan had to be abandoned.
1278	16111	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, the obstacles the builders of the Empire Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there are as follows. The first crucial challenge was to find ""a practical, workable arrangement"" so that the engineers would be able to work well and safely in this demanding situation. Another difficult problem the builders faced was how to safely put a ""thousand - foot dirigible moored"" into a building that was 1,046 feet tall. The main obstacle they faced was the fact that the dirigible moored ""would add a great deal of stress to the building's frame"" which may cause it to fall due to its heavy weight. For the builders to overcome this challenge, they would have to carefully modify and give more strength to the ""steel frame of the Empire State Building."" Despite all these difficulties, the builders went through a lot of obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the building. In the end, it was all worth their hard work as it helped Al Smith keep his winning title."
1279	16112	6	3	"When attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, the builders faced numerous obstacles regarding laws, safety, and even the nature of the mast itself. There was a strict law at the time prohibiting aircraft from flying low over cities. In paragraph @NUM1, the narrator clearly says, ""This law would make it completely illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" This did not stop some daring dirigibles from attempting it, but it was extremely dangerous around other buildings. The next major obstacle was about safety. From the excerpt, ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" An incident like the one with the Hindenburg over a city like New York would be utterly devastating. The third significant obstacle was that the mast was simply not well - suited for holding a dirigible. The narrator points out, ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" There was no practical way to hold the back end of the dirigible. In light of all these insurmountable issues, builders were finally forced to admit that the mooring mast on the Empire State Building was indeed destined to fail."
1280	16113	6	3	"In the excerpt called ""The Mooring Mast, by Marcia Amidon L¸sted on pages 1, @NUM1, @NUM2, @NUM3. She is basically explaining in detail the obstacles of the builders of the Empire State Building and the difficulties it faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Examples can be clearly seen on page 1. ""They said that the Empire State Building would be more than just ornamental, more than a simple spire or dome or a pyramid put there to add a desired few feet to the height of the building or to mask something as mundane as a water tank."" This shows the high - hopes and complex plans that were initially in place for the building's use with dirigibles. However, as we learn from the rest of the text, these plans faced many challenges that ultimately affected the feasibility of the docking idea."
1281	16114	6	3	While dirigibles were being invented in the early 1930's, numerous workers, financial men, and women encountered problems when trying to dock these airships. A dirigible was like a large, live propeller, and passengers who boarded it could enjoy a unique ride. It featured a closed compartment situated under the balloon. Getting back to the point of these inventions, dirigibles were a dangerous device, as the passage indicates. Outside the United States, they commonly used hydrogen instead of helium. The consequence of using hydrogen is that it is highly flammable. The German dirigible, specifically named Hindenburg, tragically exploded due to a fire on May 6, 1937, in Lakehurst, New Jersey. Dirigibles were extremely dangerous devices back in the 1930's. So, by the late 1930's, the idea of using dirigibles for transportation faded away. Later, they took the passenger baggage area of the dirigible and repurposed it into the world's largest soda fountain and tea garden, marking the end of an era for these once - promising airships.
1282	16115	6	3	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were safety, nature itself, and the law. Safety was a major concern because dirigibles were mostly made of hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. An accident could easily occur, just like what happened to the ""German dirigible Hindenburg,"" which was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey. Nature presented the second problem because the violent air currents at the top of the building could shift the dirigible unexpectedly, potentially causing damage and endangering pedestrians on the ground. Law was the last reason as there was a strict law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The statement in the excerpt says, ""This law would make it illegal for ships to ever tie up to the building."" Considering these multiple obstacles, it really seems quite pointless to have even built the docking facility in the first place, as the dirigible docking attempt was doomed from the start."
1283	16116	6	3	"In this excerpt of ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, we learn about how the spire on top of the Empire State Building was actually intended to be a landing spot for dirigibles. However, it could never actually have a dirigible dock there, for various reasons. The builders of the Empire State Building faced many significant obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to tie up at the mooring mast. First, they could not because dirigibles were mostly made of hydrogen, which is very flammable. This is an especially big problem since a dirigible could possibly catch fire right above New York City, putting countless lives and properties at risk. Next, there was the problem of winds. The wind at the top of the mast is extremely violent, and the back of the dirigible would constantly be swinging around wildly. Using lead weights to hold it down was a theoretical possibility, ""but using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the busy street, was neither practical nor safe."" The last problem, and possibly the most obvious, is that there was a law that prohibited airships, like dirigibles, from flying too low over densely populated areas. Therefore, this ""would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" In this excerpt of ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, it's clear that the builders of the Empire State Building faced many insurmountable obstacles, though they perhaps should've foreseen these issues, in trying to get dirigibles to dock at the mooring mast."
1284	16117	6	3	"Construction always has challenges. In the excerpt from The Mooring Mask by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, there are many challenges that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to land dirigibles there. Some of the significant obstacles the builders faced included the enormous size of the dirigibles, the need to modify the building's frame, the high cost involved, and nature itself. Landing the dirigibles would be an extremely hard task. For one, the dirigibles are truly enormous; they are ""a thousand - foot"" long flying devices. This sheer size would make it extremely difficult to land just because of the substantial weight. The stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation. This is a major struggle because the ""steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified."" This modification would take a great deal of effort and meticulous planning. Plus, modification also brings up the problem of cost. There would have to be ""over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications."" That cost is truly mind - blowing and would create challenges regarding how to obtain that large sum of money. In addition, nature itself was a formidable obstacle. Winds at the top of the building were ""constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Nature would present countless challenges for the builders to have to work around. Overall, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many insurmountable obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there, making the idea ultimately unfeasible."
1285	16118	6	3	"The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, talks about the height of the buildings, namely the Empire State Building and the Chrysler Building. The architect who built the Chrysler Building was secretly hiding something. The secret was that he constructed a 185 - foot spire inside the building. When it was hoisted up to the top of the Chrysler Building, it shocked many people and the media. Now, the Chrysler Building reaches a height of 1,046 feet, which is 46 feet taller than the height of the Empire State Building. One obstacle to the expanded use of dirigibles in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. Al Smith thought that adding a mooring mast to the top of the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or to let passengers on and off. However, the mooring mast couldn't just be simply dropped on top of the building. Adding a mooring mast to a cable tether could add excessive stress to the building's frame. After much effort, they finally built the mooring mast and then raised the American flag again, but the practical use of dirigibles at this location still faced many challenges."
1286	16119	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced several problems in the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. Safety was a crucial issue for the builders. Many of the dirigibles made outside of the United States were filled with hydrogen. This became a significant safety issue because ""hydrogen is highly flammable"", which could lead to disastrous fires. On top of the building, the wind is always shifting because of ""violent air currents"". The shifting winds would be a major problem because they would cause the end of the ship to ""swivel around and around the mooring mast"", making docking extremely difficult. Another problem the builders faced was the ""law against airships flying too low over urban areas""; this law made it illegal to dock the dirigibles. The builders also feared that the high winds could ""blow the dirigible onto the sharp spires of other buildings in the area"", causing great danger to the city. There are many obstacles the builders faced that made it clearly impossible for the dirigibles to dock on top of the Empire State Building."
1287	16120	6	3	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to have dirigibles dock there include wind, weather, and especially safety issues. The excerpt states ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". This clearly shows that nature was a great and persistent obstacle for the plan of dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. The other largest obstacle was safety. The excerpt says, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This flammability posed a huge risk. Another main safety concern was that the use of lead weights to anchor the dirigible was neither practical nor safe above the city full of pedestrians. Overall, these obstacles made the docking plan extremely challenging."
1288	16121	6	3	"Allowing dirigibles to dock to the Empire State Building was never a safe idea. ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed."" Various obstacles arose once the idea got thrown around. Builders soon realized that docking the dirigibles to the Empire State Building would cause significant stress to the building; ""Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" Safety was a major and obvious obstacle because dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen that was highly flammable. Then the obstacle of wind came into play. Usually they would weigh them down but that was not ideal being so close to other buildings and hovering over thousands of people. ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not dock at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" The idea was never successful due to the numerous and insurmountable obstacles presented."
1289	16122	6	3	Some obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were the law, and the spires that were on other buildings. Another problem was constructing the mooring mast. This was a difficult problem because it would add a great deal of stress to the building. And safety was a major issue. I said that the law restricted this because you can't put a blimp over urban areas because if something goes wrong, a large number of pedestrians will be killed. Putting up the mooring mast was no easy task; it was very hard to make it strong enough to support a blimp because there would be too much pressure on the building. Lastly, safety was a concern as there were blimps that caught fire because of the gases they worked with. If that were to happen in New York, a large number of innocent lives would be lost. In conclusion, these obstacles made the docking plan unfeasible.
1290	16123	6	3	"The builders faced many different obstacles in their attempt to allow blimps to dock there. There were two major and prominent obstacles. ""The greatest reason was one of safety: Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (@NUM1). If a blimp had an accident like the Hindenburg, not only would the Empire State building be at risk of going down, it would also affect other buildings and a large number of people too because of the city's dense population. Lastly, the other large effect on the building was the weather. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (@NUM2). The winds could have easily knocked it over with a blimp attached to it for this reason: ""the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast"" (@NUM2). As a result of this, the blimp would be so close to the mast that if a strong enough wind was blowing, the blimp's weight could take the mast with it. All in all, weather and hydrogen - filled blimps were the builders' two major and insurmountable obstacles."
1291	16124	6	3	"Al Smith's plan to add two hundred and fifty feet of height onto the Empire State Building by attaching a resting stop for traveling blimps was plausible in theory. The concept seemed feasible as it promised to bring a new era of transportation to the iconic building. However, as the plan was put in motion, the workers had to face multiple obstacles that ultimately made the attempt unsuccessful. The easiest and the only fixable obstacle was the issue of the added stress the blimp put on the building's frame. The weight and movement of the blimp would exert additional pressure on the structure, so the whole building had to be strengthened to adjust to the pressure. The workers spent considerable time and effort on this task, carefully reinforcing the necessary areas, and eventually got the construction done. Nevertheless, the biggest thing that hindered the mooring mast from being successful was nature itself. The winds at such a great height in the air were constantly shifting violently. The high - altitude air currents were unpredictable, causing strong gusts that made it extremely difficult to control the blimp. So, even if the dirigible had been attached to the mast, the back of it would swivel around uncontrollably. Unfortunately, because they would have landed high in the air, using lead weights to control the back of the aircraft was impractical. These weights would have posed a risk to the people below and were difficult to manage in the windy conditions. The prevention of nature's problems is not possible, and similarly, nothing could have been done to fix the issue of unsafety. Most blimps outside of the @LOCATION2 used a more flammable gas inside of them. Landing a dirigible filled with such a flammable substance high above New York City was an extremely dangerous idea. There was nothing the workers could have done to solve other countries' blimp composition. Finally, if nothing else, there were solid laws that made it illegal to ever have anything tied up so low over an urban area. These laws were in place to ensure the safety of the public. Obviously, this obstacle couldn't have been overcome without waiting years and a lot of legal business. Placing the mooring mast on the Empire State Building with the hope to land dirigibles seemed good, but during the actual process, many obstacles were presented, most of which had no solution. In the end, the hope to ""equip [the building] for an age of transportation"" had to be given up as it became clear that the challenges were insurmountable."
1292	16125	6	3	The problems that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were primarily related to issues of safety. As said in paragraph @NUM1, the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. These high - altitude air currents created strong and unpredictable gusts that made it extremely difficult to control the dirigibles during docking. Also, as mentioned in paragraph @NUM1, there would be lead weights dangling above pedestrians on the street. These weights, if not properly secured, could pose a serious threat to the people below, potentially causing injury or even death. Another problem they faced were the existing laws against airships flying too low over urban areas. These laws were put in place to safeguard the safety and well - being of the urban population. Given these multiple safety - related issues, it became evident that allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was a very challenging and perhaps unfeasible endeavor.
1293	16126	6	3	"The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there would be things such as the different usage of air. A sentence I found to follow this reason would be in paragraph @NUM1 when it was said, ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This would cause many problems and face many obstacles. Using hydrogen in dirigibles meant that there was a significant risk of fire or explosion, especially when docking in a densely populated area like New York City. Another reasoning I found was wind. As stated in paragraph @NUM2, ""The stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" This would be something difficult to fix. The building's structure would need to be modified and strengthened to withstand the additional forces exerted by the dirigible and the wind. As other obstacles, I found such as the size and density, I find these two to be the best reasoning. The large size of the dirigibles made it challenging to maneuver them in the limited space available on top of the building, and their density affected how they interacted with the wind and the mooring system. Considering all these obstacles, it was clear that allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was a complex and difficult task."
1294	16127	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were that most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. This flammable gas posed a significant risk, especially when considering docking above a densely populated area like New York City. A fire or explosion could have catastrophic consequences. The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. The addition of a mooring mast would change the building's load - bearing characteristics, so the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. The engineers had to carefully analyze the structure and determine the best way to reinforce it to handle the weight and movement of the dirigible. When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse the accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area, for example, downtown New York. This incident served as a stark reminder of the potential dangers associated with docking dirigibles. The greatest obstacle was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. These high - altitude air currents were erratic and strong, making it almost impossible to keep the dirigible stable. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast. Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe. The weights could fall and cause harm to the people below, and they were difficult to manage in the windy conditions. In conclusion, due to these numerous and significant obstacles, the plan to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building ultimately had to be abandoned.
1295	16128	6	3	Based on the excerpt, there were a few main obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One problem was that the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. Doing so would add unwanted stress to the building frame. The additional weight and forces from the mooring mast and the dirigible would put a strain on the existing structure, potentially compromising its integrity. Another issue was the gas used to fill the dirigibles. Hydrogen, being very flammable, could cause a dangerous fire above a densely populated area, like downtown New York. A fire or explosion in such a location would have disastrous consequences for the people and property below. Towards the top of the building, violent air currents caused another problem. The high - altitude winds were strong and unpredictable, creating a challenging environment for docking. Even if the dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mast. This made it difficult to control the dirigible and ensure a safe docking. A final dilemma was an existing law that prohibited airships flying too low over urban areas, such as New York. These laws were in place to protect the safety and well - being of the urban population. Due to these obstacles, the ability to dock a dirigible to the top of the Empire State Building was destined to fail. The combination of structural, safety, and legal issues made it an unfeasible project that could not be successfully implemented.
1296	16129	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State building faced numerous challenges when attempting to make dirigibles able to dock there. One significant problem was that most blimps outside of the United States used hydrogen instead of helium to fly. ""Most dirigibles outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This meant that the blimps posed a major safety risk to the people being transported, and as a result, they were unable to be used. Another obstacle was the rough air currents at the top of the Empire State building. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" Typically, dirigibles are put down in open fields where their back ends can be secured with lead weights. Having blimps dangling high above pedestrians was neither practical nor safe. In the end, the builders of the Empire State building encountered many insurmountable obstacles in their attempt to make dirigible docking possible."
1297	16130	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast,"" the builders of the Empire State building had to overcome a multitude of obstacles to complete their job. In paragraph 1, it states that Al Smith announces that the Empire State building will reach a height of 1,454 feet. This presented a huge challenge for the builders as they had to risk their lives working at such a great height just to construct the building. Another significant obstacle for the workers was having to work in close proximity to the dirigibles. As the excerpt states, dirigibles are extremely flammable. If a dirigible were to come into contact with fire, the workers could suffer serious injuries. All in all, the builders faced substantial risks and difficulties during the construction of the Empire State building."
1298	16131	6	3	"In the non - fiction text ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted, the builders of the Empire State building faced numerous hurdles to enable dirigibles to dock there. One major obstacle to the expanded use of dirigibles in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. Finding a proper space for the dirigibles to land safely was a complex task. Another challenge was getting the passengers on and off the dirigibles safely. Ensuring the safety of passengers during boarding and disembarking was of utmost importance. In conclusion, I have shown the various obstacles that the builders of the Empire State building had to face."
1299	16132	6	3	"The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lusted describes the multiple problems that the builders of the Empire State Building faced. These included the significant amount of stress that the dirigibles would add to the frame of the building, safety issues and laws, and the strong winds around the mast. Any dirigible attached to the mast would add an enormous amount of stress to the already constructed frame of the building. The builders had to complete ""over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications."" Although these changes were made quickly, safety concerns such as a potential fire or ""flying too low over urban areas"", (which was actually illegal), still remained. The ""greatest obstacle"" of building the mast was the violent winds that surrounded the Empire State Building. These winds were ""constantly shifting"", making it almost impossible for a dirigible to stay in one spot without swiveling around the building. In a densely populated city like New York, it was not even feasible to weigh down dirigibles for landing. This long list of obstacles clearly indicates that the mooring mast was not well - thought - out before construction began. The builders should have focused more on the practical aspects of their work instead of trying to exceed everyone's expectations and pursue something as ""a higher calling."" In essence, proper planning could have avoided many of these issues."
1300	16133	6	3	"There were many significant obstacles that the builders needed to face to make it possible for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. First and foremost was the stress that would be placed on the entire building if a dirigible was attached to a mast at the top. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way through to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" (6) This problem was relatively easily solved by strengthening the frame of the building. Another major problem was the strong wind at 1,250 feet in the air. The wind blows very hard and violently at that altitude. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" (7) The combination of the wind and the fact that a dirigible was filled with hydrogen was a dangerous one. Hydrogen is a very combustible gas. If a dirigible were to run into the building and there was a spark, the entire mass of the ship would burst into flames. Overall, the challenges of making dirigible docking at the Empire State Building a reality were substantial."
1301	16134	6	3	"The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow blimps to dock there was primarily the height of the building. For instance, in paragraph @NUM1 it clearly states ""the steel frame of the building would have to be modified, over six thousand dollars worth of modifications"". This clearly proves that the height of the Empire State Building was a major hurdle because the city had to pay significant modification fees to make it suitable for blimp docking. Also, because the building is so tall, the mast is not that stable. As stated in paragraph @NUM2, ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". This demonstrates that having the mast in those turbulent currents and not being stable enough could pose a very real and dangerous threat to downtown New York. Lastly, even state laws became an insurmountable obstacle for the dirigibles. As mentioned in paragraph @NUM3, ""this law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building"". This justifies that this legal restriction was also a significant obstacle that the builders faced. In conclusion, the combination of the building's height, mast instability, and state laws made it extremely difficult for the builders to achieve the goal of allowing blimps to dock at the Empire State Building."
1302	16135	6	3	The obstacles the builders had to face were very substantial obstacles. One of the most prominent ones was the Mooring Mast itself. The building, in its original design, was not strong enough to hold an airship. So, the building had to be carefully Modified and Strengthened to accommodate this challenging situation. They would add a rocket - shaped tower built out of shiny glass and chrome - nickel Stainless steel. This tower would not only add a unique aesthetic but also serve a functional purpose. It would illuminate from the inside, creating an eye - catching sight. Which would bump the building from @NUM1 floors to 102 floors, significantly altering its structure and height. I got all this detailed information from paragraphs @NUM2. In conclusion, the need to modify the building to support the Mooring Mast was a major challenge that the builders had to overcome during the construction process.
1303	16136	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, some significant obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there included the laws regarding @CAPS1 plane height, the fact that some dirigibles used hydrogen fuel instead of helium, and lastly, at such great heights, the strong wind currents were a persistent problem as well. The restriction of plane height was quite strict. Planes could not fly too low above cities without being a clear safety hazard. As clearly stated, ""An existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"". (The MOORING MAST). This law directly limited the dirigibles' ability to approach and dock at the building. Another obstacle related to the fact that some outside the U.S dirigibles used hydrogen fuel in place of helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable, and having a hydrogen - fueled dirigible docking at the Empire State Building could cause a major problem because the risk of a fire was very real. As noted, ""From outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium"". (The Mooring Mast). Lastly, strong winds were an unrelenting obstacle as well. The high wind currents would blow the dirigibles all around as they attempted to dock at the Empire State Building, which would pose a significant safety problem. As described, ""Winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". (The Mooring Mast). In conclusion, the builders of the Empire State building faced many complex and challenging obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, and these obstacles ultimately made the endeavor quite difficult."
1304	16137	6	3	There were many significant obsticles the builders of the Empire State Building faced to allow the dirigibles to dock. One of the primary issues was the weight. The architects could not simply place the mooring mast on the building, as it would put excessive stress on the structure and might even cause damage. So, they had to invest over sixty thousands of dollars into strengthening the framework. This shows that the weight of the mooring mast and the dirigibles was a major concern. Another problem was safety issues. Other countries used Hydrogen as their dirigibles' gas. Hydrogen is highly flammable, and the thought of it catching on fire above New York was extremely dangerous. A fire in the sky above a major city like New York could have catastrophic consequences. Another problem was the violent weather at the top of the building. The dirigibles would sway back and forth due to the harsh weather, making it extremely difficult and dangerous to get passengers on and off board. Also, there is a law in New York prohibiting low - flying vehicles, so the dirigibles could not legally dock there in the first place. In conclusion, the combination of weight, safety, weather, and legal issues made it almost impossible for the builders to achieve the goal of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
1305	16138	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous challenges trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. The challenges ranged from the forces of nature itself to strict laws against it. They didn't fully take into consideration the constantly shifting air atop the building. At such lofty heights as the moring mast, violent air currents would cause the dirigible to swivel erratically around the mooring mast. This was also due to the fact that the blimp would only be tethered in the front, leaving it vulnerable to the strong winds. Not only were those large and obvious factors coming into play but laws also came in the way of dirigibles mooring at the Empire State. They didn't think about the existing law which clearly stated that air ships flying too low or over urban areas was against the law. So many complex factors came into play with building such an ambitious project. Overall, it was an overly far - fetched of an idea considering all the natural and legal obstacles. In conclusion, the combination of natural forces and legal restrictions made it highly improbable for the builders to successfully allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
1306	16139	6	3	There were a few obstacles to making this idea work. One of the significant obstacles was to make the mast and the sturdy frame of the large building strong enough to firmly support a huge dirigible swaying vigorously in the gusty wind. There was over @MONEY1 carefully spent on meticulous modification to the well - structured building. Also, they had to carefully add a few well - planned floors to the building, resulting in a total of 102 floors, to meet the overall requirements. All these efforts were in an attempt to overcome the challenges and make the idea feasible.
1307	16140	6	3	"Based on the excerpt 'The Mooring Mast' by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, there are many varied and complex obstacles the builders of the iconic Empire State Building faced in the challenging attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. One main and crucial reason would be the serious safety issues of the dirigible. Most dirigibles used hydrogen to be lighter than air. Hydrogen is a highly flammable gas that could easily catch fire, just like the tragic incident of the Hindenburg. If an accident like the Hindenburg were to happen over the bustling downtown New York, the outcome would be extremely disastrous. Also, dirigibles typically moored in open fields and would need to be firmly anchored with big lead weights. These weights would neither be practical nor safe when dangling above the busy people, and a small mooring on the top of a building is no open field. One last significant obstacle is the sixty thousand dollars needed to just make the strong frame suitable for mooring dirigibles. ""A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of a building held by a single cable tether would add great stress to the building's frame."" Without a doubt, just to make a mooring for dirigibles at the top of the tallest building in the world would come with many different and difficult obstacles the builders would have to face, making the task a formidable one."
1308	16141	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced a few significant obstacles in their attempts to allow dirigible to dock there. First, the Empire State Building was unfortunately destined to never fulfill its intended purpose because the builders didn't carefully notice all the complex problems it had. One notable attempt was the Goodyear blimp Columbia, which attempted a high - profile publicity stunt where it would tie up and deliver a bundle of newspapers to the Empire State Building, as clearly stated in paragraph @NUM1. In paragraph @NUM2 it states that the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The builders had a great deal of hard work to do to actually try and fix the numerous problems, but there were just too many. In conclusion, the builders of the Empire State Building faced a few insurmountable obstacle attempts to allow dirigible to dock there, and it became clear that the goal was very difficult to achieve.
1309	16142	6	3	The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building encountered in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were significant. There wasn't enough sufficient room on the building's top area to safely accommodate the large dirigibles. Moreover, according to the existing regulations, they weren't supposed to have aircraft near the densely populated city. These two major issues made it extremely challenging for the builders to make the dirigible - docking idea a reality, and it ultimately seemed that the obstacles were too great to overcome.
1310	16143	6	3	Despite the pricey investments of sixty thousand dollars that needed to be carefully put into the building for this project to become a reality, there were many more complex obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The greatest and most concerning obstacle they faced was the safety of the people. A large dirigible dangling nearly @NUM1 feet above the busy ground with the ever - present possibility of explosion and numerous pedestrians below doesn't seem like the smartest or safest idea. Another significant problem they faced was the stress that the dirigible, held on by only a single cable, would put on the building's frame. With the strong wind blowing the dirigible around, the load and pressure of it would have to be sent all the way to the base of the building about @NUM1 feet down. In order for this to work, the builders would have to thoroughly strengthen the steel frame of the building. Maybe the most difficult and almost insurmountable obstacle they faced was nature itself. Strong wind streams above the building would have caused the dirigible to swing around wildly once it was docked, as well as running the high risk of being blown off course and into another nearby building. And if they ever wanted this idea to work in the first place, they should have carefully checked the laws first; aircrafts were not allowed to fly that low over urban areas. Builders of this landing dock and the Empire State Building just faced too many overwhelming obstacles, making the project highly unfeasible.
1311	16144	6	3	Based on the excerpt, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were mostly due to the significant dangers posed by violent winds at such a high altitude. These strong winds may cause the aircraft to crash, either into the building's towering structure or down to the crowded ground below. For example, two blimps attempted the docking. One of them could not even come close to the building because of the fierce winds buffeting it. The other was able to deliver a bundle of newspapers, which was carefully hoisted down by a rope. In conclusion, the main problem was the instability of the aircraft being docked, which made the docking process extremely perilous and unfeasible.
1312	16145	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous and complex obstacles in attempting to dock dirigibles there. One of the prominent obstacles they faced was safety, and this was mainly because the dirigibles were filled with hydrogen. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (∂ @NUM1). If the dirigible were to burst into flames in the bustling city of New York, a large number of innocent people would be at risk of losing their lives. Another significant obstacle was nature itself. The winds were incredibly violent on top of the tall building. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast"" (∂ @NUM2). This constant and unpredictable movement would have been very dangerous for both the dirigible and the building. A third insurmountable obstacle was the law, which was impossible to get around. There ""was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (∂ @NUM3). Although this law was broken twice, it was still illegal to dock dirigibles at that low height. As a result of all these insurmountable obstacles, the idea to dock dirigibles at the Empire State Building was ultimately scrapped."
1313	16146	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. They had to meticulously plan out how the docking process would work, considering every detail. They needed to figure out what they would need to use for the dirigible to dock safely and efficiently. This involved determining what kinds of materials would be needed in this complex project and how all the components would work together in harmony. Before actually putting it all together, they had to conduct in - depth research and analysis to ensure the feasibility of the docking plan. In conclusion, the planning phase presented a significant challenge for the builders in their attempt to enable dirigible docking at the Empire State Building.
1314	16147	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building ran into a multitude of problems involving the dirigibles. One problem is that there was no straightforward or easy way to construct a suitable docking station at such a great height. Not only did it need to be functional, but it also had to look aesthetically pleasing, which added an extra layer of complexity to the design. The other, and most significant, reason or problem with the mast for mooring the dirigibles was a major safety issue. Most dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is extremely flammable. So, if something were to go wrong during the docking process, the dirigible could catch fire and explode, and then come crashing down in a densely populated area, endangering countless lives. There were also a lot of safety and structure issues, such as the fact that large lead weights needed to dangle over the busy streets to weigh down the back of the dirigible. However, through hard work and innovation, these issues were eventually resolved, but not without a great deal of effort.
1315	16148	6	3	"In attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, the builders had to face many formidable obstacles. A lot of these obstacles were straightforward but were not fully recognized by the builders. For example, on page three, @CAPS2 @NUM1 and @NUM2 state that it was ""unsafe because the dirigibles were filled with Hydrogen"", which is highly flammable. There were tragic incidents in the history of dirigibles because of their flammable nature; the German Dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire, a clear indication of the risks involved. There were also violent air currents at the height of the building, which made docking extremely difficult and dangerous. Additionally, there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. All these obstacles combined made it nearly impossible to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, and thus the plan was ultimately abandoned."
1316	16149	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. They not only had to deal with the technical and safety aspects but also with external factors. The first issue was related to the type of gas used in dirigibles. Most of the dirigibles outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. This was a major concern because if a dirigible were to catch fire or explode over a highly populated city like New York, a large number of people would be put at risk of being injured or killed. The second issue the builders encountered was the challenging wind conditions. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. These erratic winds would cause the airship to swivel, even when it was tethered to the mooring mast, making it nearly impossible for passengers to board. Moreover, this situation would also be extremely dangerous for anyone aboard the airship. The third issue was the legal restriction. There was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. Since New York City is undoubtedly an urban area, this law made it impossible for airships to even approach the Empire State Building to moor. Overall, there were many significant obstacles faced by the builders in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. Due to these insurmountable reasons, the Empire State Building was never an effective place for dirigibles to dock.
1317	16150	6	3	Trying to construct the Empire State Building in a way that would allow dirigibles to dock on top of it brought up numerous challenges for the builders. There was a huge safety issue associated with having the blimps so close to the city. In paragraph @NUM1, the fear of strong winds that could blow the blimp into other nearby buildings, causing extensive damage to those structures, scared many people. The second major concern was the fact that the blimp was filled with highly flammable gas. If the blimp were ever to burst into flames above a densely - populated city like New York, a great deal of damage would be done not only to the blimp but also to New York City itself. The last major concern, as located in paragraph nine, was the amount of stress the building would take on by having a blimp tied to its top. The whole building would have to be thoroughly reconstructed to help the Empire State Building withstand that stress. In fact, basically every part of the building and the blimp would have to be carefully remodeled in order to keep New York City and the passengers of the dirigible safe. In conclusion, these challenges made the idea of a dirigible dock on the Empire State Building extremely difficult to implement.
1318	16151	6	3	"One of the significant obstacles the builders faced was nature itself. The @CAPS1 clearly states that ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" These unpredictable wind conditions made it very difficult for dirigibles to safely approach and dock at the building. Another obstacle the builders had to deal with was a legal one. There was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The @CAPS1 further states that ""This law will make it illegal for a ship to ever be tied up to the building."" These natural and legal obstacles combined made it nearly impossible for the builders to achieve the goal of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. In the end, these challenges proved insurmountable, and the plan for a dirigible dock could not be realized."
1319	16152	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building had a few significant obstacles to face when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, as written by Marcia Amidon L¸sted in The Mooring Mast. Al Smith, the architect of the Empire State Building, had a grand vision. He didn't want his masterpiece to be just for show, so he gave it a purpose: a dock for dirigibles. However, by adding a ""thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether,"" the building's frame would be under an enormous amount of stress. This would ultimately make the structure unsafe. To alter the frame and deal with the wind pressure, over @MONEY1 would need to be accumulated. Additionally, if an accident were to take place, similar to the tragic incident in Lakehurst, New Jersey, the densely populated city would be in grave danger. Although some of these obstacles might theoretically be overcome with sufficient resources and effort, the obstacle of mother nature herself, with its unpredictable wind patterns and other natural elements, cannot be easily tamed. As a result, the plan to have a dirigible dock at the Empire State Building faced insurmountable challenges."
1320	16153	6	3	"As it was, the idea of a dirigible dock on the Empire State Building was quite far - fetched. The first problem they encountered was the structural strain. Having a thousand - foot long dirigible attached to the Empire State Building would cause a great deal of strain on the building's framework. According to @CAPS1, they would have to completely change the structure of the entire building to strengthen its framework. The largest problem, however, was a matter of safety. Dirigibles use hydrogen, which is extremely flammable. Also, the author states that ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents,"" making the idea of a dirigible dock extremely risky. These problems should have been identified and addressed before so much money was invested in making this dock. In conclusion, the impracticality and high - risk nature of the dirigible dock idea made it an unwise venture from the start."
1321	16154	6	3	"Builders faced multiple obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. One significant obstacle was that if the dirigible landed on the building, the additional weight and force of the dirigible would add an excessive amount of stress to the frame of the building. To make the building capable of withstanding this stress, the building would have to be modified, which would cost over sixty thousand dollars more. Another obstacle was related to the gas inside the dirigible. Some dirigibles used hydrogen, which is extremely flammable. Given that New York is a highly populated area, if something were to go wrong, such as a hydrogen leak and subsequent ignition, it would pose a great threat to public safety. Also, the winds at the top of the building were very strong. The back of the dirigible would be ""swivelling around the mooring mast,"" making it difficult to control and dock safely. The last obstacle was that it is ""illegal for a ship to ever tie up or approach a building."" Due to these numerous and insurmountable obstacles, the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building ultimately failed."
1322	16155	6	3	"In ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1, the builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles to allow the dirigibles to dock there. For instance, as the author said, ""the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" This clearly shows that the building not only had to be designed to bear the load of itself but also that of the dirigible. Moreover, the author stated that, ""A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top by a single cable tether."" This presented a complex situation where the engineers would have to think of a way to safely dock the dirigible without anyone getting hurt. They had to consider the balance, the force distribution, and the stability of the docking process. In all, the engineers that designed the Empire State building had to overcome many difficult and detailed obstacles to allow the dirigibles to dock there, and their efforts were a testament to their engineering skills and determination."
1323	16156	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. For example, ""A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add a substantial amount of stress to the building's frame."" The builders could not simply ""drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof"" because it would be an unstable and unsafe solution. The builders now had to find a well - thought - out way to add this mooring mast for dirigibles without putting too much pressure on the building. In addition, ""The steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" They now had to add ""over sixty thousand dollars"" worth of modifications to the building, which involved careful planning and construction. In conclusion, ""Architects designed a shiny glass and chrome - nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from the inside, with a step - back design that imitated the overall shape of the building itself."" Evidently, the architects went through much painstaking work not only to make the mooring mast for dirigibles successful but also to make it beautiful. The excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"", @ORGANIZATION2 shows the many challenges and efforts the architects faced while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there."
1324	16157	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in their attempts to allow dirigibles to dock there. The builders' main obstacle was the wind currents the dirigibles had to face in trying to dock nearly eleven hundred feet in the air. The harsh winds at the top of the building were constantly changing because of the complex air currents in the area. The U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles could not even get close enough to tie up to the mast. ""The captain could not even take his hands off the control levers"" (L¸sted @NUM1) in fear that the outer shell of the dirigible would be punctured by the mast due to the strong and unpredictable winds. Additionally, if a dirigible was tied to the mast, it would be moving all around the mast based on the ever - changing and unpredictable air currents, making the docking process extremely difficult and dangerous. However, safety was also a major factor. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (L¸sted @NUM2). With the high population density around the Empire State Building, attempting to tie dirigibles to the mast was very unsafe. In the end, the numerous and severe obstacles the builders faced were simply too much to overcome, and the plan to allow regular dirigible docking was not feasible."
1325	16158	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles, also known as blimps, to dock there. The initial problem was that the blimp couldn't land on a flat surface. So, the builders came up with the idea of making a ""mooring mast"" so blimps could be connected by an electrical winch to the building. But this solution caused problems too. They couldn't just drop the mooring mast on top of the building because it would be unstable and might topple over in the wind. Moreover, since the winds at the top of the building kept changing direction and intensity, the mooring mast and the blimp attached to it would never stay still, making the docking process very difficult to control. Another major concern was the problem of foreign blimps using hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable, and with the large number of people in the vicinity of the Empire State Building, it made the situation far too dangerous to the public. In conclusion, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many complex and challenging problems in trying to let blimps dock, and these obstacles ultimately made the regular docking of blimps an unachievable goal."
1326	16159	6	3	"There were numerous obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the many challenges the dirigibles had to confront was the lack of a suitable landing area, which I discovered in paragraph six. Another significant obstacle can be found in paragraph @NUM1, where it states that ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" Nature itself posed yet another hurdle for the dirigibles because ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Last but not least, there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This means it is illegal for a dirigible to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. In conclusion, these were some of the many obstacles a dirigible had to face, making docking at the Empire State Building an extremely difficult, if not impossible, task."
1327	16160	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building bit off more than they could chew when constructing a mooring mast there. The first of several major problems was that the presence of a thousand - foot long dirigible would exert a tremendous amount of stress on the frame of the building, and @MONEY1 worth of extensive modifications would have to be added. Safety was another pressing and crucial issue. In 1937, the tragic crash of the Hindenburg made the owners of the building realize how disastrous it would be if a zeppelin crashed over densely - populated New York. Not only was there an existing law that strictly forbade airships to fly too low over urban areas, but the factor of nature made the mooring mast idea completely @CAPS1. The winds on top of the building are always shifting due to violent air currents; even the captain of the U.S. Navy ship Los Angeles could not successfully land the dirigible. At this point, it was abundantly clear that the mooring mast idea would not work. And as airplanes, the method of aviation of the future, had arrived, dirigibles were ultimately abandoned.
1328	16161	6	3	While attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building, the builders faced a multitude of obstacles. The first obstacle was carefully modifying the frame of the building to accommodate for the significant stress that the mooring mast would put on it. The load of the dirigible and the intense wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the foundation of the building, which was eleven - hundred feet below. Over sixty thousand dollars worth of costly modifications had to be made in altering the frame of the building. It was a very expensive endeavor. Another obstacle the builders faced was the gas used inside the dirigible, hydrogen. Most dirigibles outside of the United States use hydrogen. Hydrogen is highly flammable, and if a dirigible were to go up in flames above such a densely populated area like downtown New York, the results of the accident would be truly catastrophic. Nature was also another significant obstacle. The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to violent air currents. The dirigible would be swiveling around and around the mast. While lead weights were used in open landing fields, this was completely impractical to do above pedestrians on the street. Above all else, an existing law prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas. This made it illegal for a dirigible to even approach the mast. These numerous obstacles had made it highly impractical for a dirigible to ever dock on the mooring mast of the Empire State Building, effectively ending the possibility of such a docking arrangement.
1329	16162	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The hydrogen in the dirigibles was highly flammable, the winds shifted a great deal, and existing laws made it illegal to dock in such an area. Most dirigibles during that time were floating using hydrogen rather than helium. What the builders found out was that hydrogen is very flammable and it was far too risky to land dirigibles that could catch on fire above an entire city. The excerpt also explained that nature was a huge and insurmountable issue. Air currents as high as those at the top of the buildings were vicious and shifted rapidly, which would make dangling dirigibles from that high up extremely risky. Lastly, there was the obstacle of breaking the law! The law against airships flying too low over urban areas. With all these significant obstacles that would be extremely difficult for the builders to face, this unreal dream of dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building would yet remain just a dream, unable to become a reality.
1330	16163	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many problems trying to allow dirigibles to dock on it. One major problem was carefully designing the building to be able to withstand the intense stress from a thousand - foot dirigible swinging around it in the wind. The builders needed to find a proper way to distribute the wind pressure all the way to the foundation. Another significant problem was the strong and unpredictable winds surrounding the building. When the navy tried to dock a dirigible on it, the dirigible kept being tossed about by the strong winds, and this problem was never successfully solved. A third problem was finding an effective way to actually dock the dirigible, but this was quickly resolved with a winch. A final problem was the fact that the dirigibles were so dangerous and couldn't safely dock, as well as a law that prevented dirigibles from flying close to buildings, which was created precisely for that reason. In conclusion, these problems made it very difficult, if not impossible, for dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, and the idea was ultimately abandoned.
1331	16164	6	3	During this specific time period, dirigibles were widely seen as the transportation of the future, and almost everybody firmly thought that this was a plausible idea. There were underlying problems, however, that nobody managed to see through. For example, the dirigibles were highly regarded to be the next big thing in transportation, but there was absolutely no concrete evidence to support this optimistic view. They spent all of their valuable time, great effort, and substantial resources to construct something for a purpose that ultimately never worked out. There were other easily overlooked problems as well, such as the high wind speed at that considerable height, and even if they could somehow get close enough to the mast, they would need someone to stand on the very top and tie it down, which would be far too difficult for a single person. As the excerpt clearly shows, Al Smith and his architects jumped into this problem too quickly and with insufficient, unreliable information. In the end, their hasty decision led to an unfeasible and unsuccessful outcome.
1332	16165	6	3	"In The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, two architects engagingly play ""battleship"" with each of their dirigibles, fiercely competing for the greatest height. However, when building these ""enormously steel - framed balloons"", the architects didn't fully realize the numerous obstacles that they would have to face during this complex process. The biggest reason was related to safety precautions. Since most dirigibles were predominantly made of hydrogen, they were extremely highly flammable. This dangerous concept, they said, could have been far worse than the tragic incident of the German Hindenburg, which was completely demolished by a massive fire in New Jersey in 1937. However, the most challenging obstacle to the use of the mast was nature. The strong winds caused the mast's to be loudly clanging above human beings, which was neither practical nor safe. In conclusion, these unforeseen obstacles made the use of dirigibles and the masts a risky and unviable option."
1333	16166	6	3	"In their determined quest to allow dirigibles to dock, the architects and builders of the Empire State Building ran into a multitude of problems. One of the more obvious and concerning issues was that of the make - up of the dirigibles themselves. At that particular time, they consisted mainly of hydrogen, which, although it allowed for a lower density, was extremely highly flammable. This dangerous concept was clearly proven and brought to public light by the 1937 crash of the ""Hindenburg"", a well - known and famous dirigible. If a dirigible were to catch fire while docking at the Empire State Building, it would surely crash onto the unsuspecting civilians below, causing great harm. Another topic of intense debate for the architects of the Empire State Building was the issue of high winds at the estimated 1,250 foot altitude of the mooring mast. Such strong winds could easily cause a significant lack of stability for a dirigible which could in turn place added, excessive stress on the building itself. Another problem caused by winds is the fact that the dirigible might crash into other nearby buildings, causing the fabric containing the hydrogen gas to be punctured, and the dirigible to crash catastrophically. In the end, it was a project deemed far too risky to continue, as the potential consequences were simply unacceptable."
1334	16167	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building were faced with many significant obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first major problem was that they weren't entirely sure if the solid structure of the building could hold up to a swaying, large dirigible. As said in paragraph @NUM1, this uncertainty was a major concern. Also, the builders knew that since the dirigible would be hooked to the mast by a single, thin cable, the powerful air currents would make the back of the ship swivel around the mooring mast in an unpredictable way. As said in paragraph @NUM2, this was a dangerous situation. There also was a strict law enforcement against airships flying too low over urban areas. That would make it completely illegal for a ship to tie up to the building. Those are some of the serious obstacles that the builders were faced with, and these challenges ultimately made the dirigible docking plan unworkable.
1335	16168	6	3	The Empire State Building was originally designed to be the tallest building in the World. Al Smith's ambitious plans were to make it taller than the new Chrysler Building, but when a @NUM1 - foot tall spire was added to the top of the Chrysler Building, the Empire State Building was going to come in second. To overcome this initial obstace in building the tower, Smith decided to change the original idea for the tower and add his own unique spire: a mooring mast for dirigibles. Using the tower as an anchor for dirigible balloons, or zeppelins, Smith added another 250 feet to the tower. But to continue with the plan, Smith had to face the difficult obstacle of supporting a floating blimp more than @NUM2 feet above the ground. Smith had the entire building frame carefully modified and significantly strengthened before the building was finished. Smith's final obstacle was one he couldn't control: the weather. The strong winds at the top of the building were too harsh, so the dirigible idea was reluctantly scrapped, but Al Smith's tower had successfully made it to the world's tallest building, achieving his initial height - related goal despite the setbacks.
1336	16169	6	3	"Throughout the process of construction, the Empire State Building contractors faced a couple of obstacles in their quest to dock dirigibles on it. First off, safety was a huge factor in this quest. ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse the accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" Although a balloon and a dirigible may have the same appearance, the two are completely structured differently. Helium causes a balloon to rise, while a dirigible uses hydrogen to fly, which is highly flammable. Secondly, there was already a law put into effect for air trafficking. ""... could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds. Fearing the wind would blow the dirigibles onto the sharp spires of other buildings in the area, which would puncture the shell."" If the dirigible was to ever get punctured, it could collapse into the streets of New York, causing mass destruction. Thus, these are just a few of the many obstacles in the way of landing dirigibles on the Empire State Building, making it a challenging and ultimately unfeasible endeavor."
1337	16170	6	3	The Empire State Building faced a lot of obstacles and challenges while it was being built. The builders constructed a rocket - shaped mast with the intention that the dirigible could be housed in the shaft itself. This shaft also had elevators installed so that people could conveniently go down to the lobby. With these additions, the building would now have 102 floors. The glassed observation room was strategically placed on the 101st floor, offering a great view. Despite the ambitious plan for the dirigible dock, the numerous obstacles meant that this feature was not as practical as initially hoped, but the building still stands as an iconic structure.
1338	16171	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle that they faced concerned safety. Many dirigibles from outside the United States were filled with hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is very flammable, and if it were to catch fire over New York City, the results could be absolutely horrific, endangering countless lives and causing extensive damage to the city's infrastructure. Another obstacle the builders faced concerned nature. Due to the height of the Empire State Building, the wind became a major factor. Wind currents were constantly shifting, and if a dirigible was attached to it, it would be extremely unsafe. The stress of the wind pressure and the load of the dirigible would have to be transmitted to the foundation of the building. This meant that the frame of the building would have to be significantly strengthened, which was a costly and complex engineering challenge. Another obstacle concerned law. There is a law that states that airships cannot fly too low over urban areas. This would make it illegal to tie a ship up to the Empire State Building. In conclusion, the builders of the Empire State Building had to face these numerous and significant obstacles in their ultimately fruitless attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there.
1339	16172	6	3	"The mooring mast seems like a great idea. A landing dock for dirigibles would have jumped travel into the future, revolutionizing transportation in the city. As it turns out, however, architect Al Smith bit off more than he could chew. First of all, the fate of the Hindenburg put worry over the owners' heads. ""The owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that (Hindenburg) accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York"", with the potential to cause a massive disaster. The second problem is that there is an existing law against airships flying too low in urban areas. As stated in paragraph @NUM1, ""This law would make it illegal for the ship to tie up to the building or even approach the area"", effectively blocking the docking plan. The final and most problematic part of the mooring mast was actually revealed to be nature itself. As it turns out, the winds on top of the building were too violent and unpredictable. Even if the dirigible was tethered, ""the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast"", making it impossible to safely dock. Overall, it seems like this was a great idea that unfortunately went bad due to these insurmountable obstacles."
1340	16173	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building had hopes of making this building a dock for dirigibles but were faced with several obstacles. Starting in paragraph @NUM1, the aspiration of the mast on the Empire State Building made the plan seem well - put together, and it appeared that it would soon become a reality. As the project progressed, many details were overlooked, and when the dirigibles were ready to take action, the plan was not feasible. Stated in paragraph @NUM2, safety was a huge issue for the dirigibles made outside of the United States because they contained the flammable gas hydrogen. This is a major problem because of the fear of an accident occurring in a highly populated area, which could lead to a catastrophic event. Another obstacle dirigibles faced while trying to have a dock on the Empire State Building was nature itself, as presented in paragraph @NUM3. The winds on the top of the building had violent currents that were constantly shifting. The problem with the air would have the dirigibles constantly spinning around the building by its back end. This made it unsafe for passengers to get on and off and also for handling the cargo. The greatest obstacle for dirigibles trying to dock on the Empire State Building is the existing law against flying too low over urban areas, which is found in paragraph @NUM4. By a dirigible docking, it would be directly breaking the law. In conclusion, these multiple obstacles combined made it impossible for the Empire State Building to become a successful dock for dirigibles.
1341	16174	6	3	"There were multiple obstacles that made the idea of docking dirigibles foolhardy from the start. ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in a tragic incident in 1937"" (@CAPS1 @NUM1), the idea of such a volatile object hovering over the population became far more of a threat than a luxury. Lead weights needed to support the craft could not be adequately supplied, and would also prove to be hazardous as they dangled high above the streets. Given the Empire State Building's unique nature, the modifications required became hasslesome and added unnecessary difficulty to the already complex task. The winds at that high altitude would also provide significant docking issues and cause instability to the dirigibles. Finally, the airplane overtook the blimp, because it could travel faster and hold the same, if not more, number of people in a relatively small area. Blimps became dangerous and cumbersome, and would not benefit New York as Al Smith had initially hoped, ultimately making the idea of dirigible docking at the Empire State Building unfeasible."
1342	16175	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock were related to nature and the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The greatest obstacle builders faced was nature. ""The winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air - currents, which were unpredictable and strong."" Also, the back - draft of the ships would force the dirigible to spin around from the forceful winds, making docking extremely difficult. Then, using lead weights in the Empire State Building, they would be dangling high above people on the streets below and it is not safe as a fall could cause serious harm. The next obstacle is that a law existed against airships flying too low over urban areas. This made dirigibles illegal to fly over to the building, thus effectively preventing the planned docking and highlighting the impracticality of the idea."
1343	16176	6	3	The Empire State Building was built with great potential, but it would never reach it fully. The Empire State Building was originally supposed to reach @NUM1 feet, being just inches taller than the Chrysler Building. However, when the architect who designed the @CAPS1 Building snuck up and stuck a 46 - foot pole on top, it changed the situation. Of course, the Empire State Building had to be taller, so they set a new goal and reached 1,250 feet on December 11, 1929. Al Smith, @CAPS2 of New York and an Architect, decided that the Empire State Building needed a cherry on top, so he decided to put a mooring mast for zeppelins on top. This plan was destined for disaster: the foundation of the building wasn't stable enough to support the weight and movement of zeppelins. They could easily be blown out of control by the strong winds and onto the sharp tip of the Building. Also, since zeppelins had hydrogen in them, they could explode and fall onto the densely populated @LOCATION1, endangering countless lives. All in all, the mooring mast at the top of the Empire State Building was built for disaster, and it was a flawed addition to an otherwise remarkable structure.
1344	16177	6	3	There are many obstacles the builders had to face while attempting to allow the docking of dirigibles. One obstacle they had to overcome was paying over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications for the building's framework. In paragraph @NUM1, it stated that a thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add significant stress to the building's frame. The stress of the dirigible's load, along with the wind pressure, would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly a hundred feet below. As a result of this issue, the frame of the entire building had to change to accommodate the new situation. More obstacles flooded in after the new modifications. When the building had been framed to the 85th floor, the roof had to be carefully completed before the framing for the mooring mast could take place. The mast also had to have a sturdy skeleton of steel, as stated in paragraph @NUM2, to ensure it could withstand the forces exerted by the dirigibles. In the end, these numerous obstacles made the process of enabling dirigible docking extremely challenging.
1345	16178	6	3	It is clear that there were problems in trying to dock dirigibles on the Empire State Building. The first reason is that the law against flying airships too low over the Empire State Building made it hard to do so, as it restricted the approach and docking maneuvers. Next is that the dirigibles were considered unsafe because some dirigibles use hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable, posing a major fire and explosion risk. A big reason is when the German dirigible got destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, the owners of the Empire State Building then realized how much more worse the accident could have been if it had happened on such a densely populated area such as downtown New York City. The last reason was the thought that they would use lead weights to hold the dirigibles down, but they realized that it wasn't practical nor was it safe as the weights could fall and cause damage. It was clear that there were problems in the docking of dirigibles on the Empire State Building; but it is probably a much safer choice for both the residents/citizens of New York and all of the people who ever work(ed) on it such as architects, engineers, and the aviation pioneers, as it avoids potential disasters.
1346	16179	6	3	"THE BUILDERS FACED A SUBSTANTIAL OBSTACLE IN ENABLING DIRIGIBLES TO DOCK AT THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING. FOR ONE, INSTALLING THE MOORING MAST WOULD IMPOSE ADDITIONAL STRESS ON THE BUILDING'S FRAME. THE COMBINED WEIGHT OF THE DIRIGIBLES AND THE PRESSURE EXERTED BY THE WIND WOULD BE TRANSFERRED DIRECTLY TO THE BUILDING'S FOUNDATION. ""WINDS WERE SHIFTING DUE TO VIOLENT AIR CURRENTS,"" WHICH MADE THE SITUATION EVEN MORE CHALLENGING. ""EVEN IF THE DIRIGIBLES WERE TETHERED TO THE MAST, THE BACK OF THE SHIPS WOULD SWIVEL AROUND UNPREDICTABLY."" MOREOVER, THERE WAS THE LAW THAT PROHIBITED AIRSHIPS FROM FLYING LOW IN URBAN AREAS. ALL THESE FACTORS COLLECTIVELY MADE IT IMPRACTICAL FOR DIRIGIBLES TO DOCK AT THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING."
1347	16180	6	3	"ACCORDING TO THE EXCERPT FROM THE MOORING MAST BY MARCIA AMIDON @CAPS1, THE BUILDERS OF THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING ENCOUNTERED NUMEROUS OBSTACLES WHEN ATTEMPTING TO ATTACH A DIRIGIBLE MOORING UNIT TO THE TOP OF THE BUILDING. IN PARAGRAPH @NUM1, @CAPS1 CLEARLY STATES ""THE GREATEST OBSTACLE TO THE SUCCESSFUL USE OF THE MOORING MAST WAS NATURE ITSELF."" THEN, @CAPS1 DESCRIBES IN DETAIL HOW THE HARSH WINDS COULD RENDER THE MAST UNSTABLE. ANOTHER SIGNIFICANT OBSTACLE IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE MAST WAS A LAW STATING THAT DIRIGIBLES COULD NOT FLY BELOW A CERTAIN ALTITUDE, AND THE SET ALTITUDE WAS HIGHER THAN THE HEIGHT OF THE BUILDING. THE LAST OBSTACLE WAS RELATED TO SAFETY. IN PARAGRAPH @NUM2, @CAPS1 DISCUSSES HOW SOME BLIMPS ARE FILLED WITH HYDROGEN, WHICH IS HIGHLY FLAMMABLE. THE CONSEQUENCE OF A BLIMP FIRE OVER A HIGHLY POPULATED AREA WOULD BE DEVASTATING. THE MOORING MAST ON THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING WAS AN INGENIOUS IDEA, BUT IT HAD TOO MANY OBSTACLES TO BECOME A PRACTICAL REALITY."
1348	16181	6	3	BASED ON THE EXCERPT, THE PRIMARY OBSTACLE THE BUILDERS OF THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING FACED IN ATTEMPTING TO ALLOW DIRIGIBLES TO DOCK THERE WAS ONE OF SAFETY. MOST DIRIGIBLES FROM OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES UTILIZED HYDROGEN RATHER THAN HELIUM, AND HYDROGEN IS HIGHLY FLAMMABLE. WHEN THE GERMAN DIRIGIBLE HINDENBURG WAS DESTROYED BY FIRE IN LAKEHURST, NEW JERSEY, THE OWNERS OF THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING BECAME AWARE OF HOW MUCH WORSE THAT ACCIDENT COULD HAVE BEEN IF IT HAD OCCURRED ABOVE THE DENSELY POPULATED AREAS LIKE DOWNTOWN NEW YORK. THE GREATEST OBSTACLE TO THE USE OF THE MOORING MAST WAS NATURE ITSELF. WHEN THE DIRIGIBLES WERE TETHERED TO THE MOORING MAST, THE BACK OF THE SHIP WOULD SWIVEL AROUND AND AROUND THE MOORING MAST. DIRIGIBLES MOORED IN OPEN LANDING FIELDS COULD BE WEIGHTED DOWN IN THE BACK WITH LEAD WEIGHTS, BUT THIS WAS NOT FEASIBLE AT THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING. THE OTHER PRACTICAL REASON WHY DIRIGIBLES COULD NOT MOOR AT THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING WAS THE EXISTING LAW AGAINST AIRSHIPS FLYING TOO LOW OVER URBAN AREAS. THIS LAW WOULD MAKE IT ILLEGAL FOR A SHIP TO EVER TIE UP TO THE BUILDING OR EVEN APPROACH THE AREA, EFFECTIVELY PRECLUDING DIRIGIBLE DOCKING.
1349	16182	6	3	THE BUILDERS OF THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING ENCOUNTERED MANY OBSTACLES. THERE WERE TWO MAIN ONES: SAFETY AND NATURE. THE BUILDERS SHOULD HAVE REALIZED THAT THE IDEA WAS NOT SAFE BEFORE COMMENCING CONSTRUCTION. MOST DIRIGIBLES FROM OTHER COUNTRIES USE HYDROGEN INSTEAD OF HELIUM, WHICH IS HIGHLY FLAMMABLE. AN ACCIDENT OVER DENSELY POPULATED NEW YORK WOULD HAVE SEVERE CONSEQUENCES. THE BIGGEST OBSTACLE WAS NATURE. THERE WERE VIOLENT AIR CURRENTS THAT CAUSED CONSTANTLY SHIFTING WINDS AT THE TOP OF THE BUILDING. THIS WOULD CAUSE THE BACK OF THE SHIP TO SWIVEL AROUND THE MOORING MAST UNPREDICTABLY. THERE WAS ALSO AN EXISTING LAW AGAINST AIRSHIPS FLYING TOO LOW OVER URBAN AREAS. THIS MEANS IT WOULD BE ILLEGAL TO TIE A DIRIGIBLE UP TO THE BUILDING, ANYWAY. DUE TO THESE INSURMOUNTABLE OBSTACLES, THE PLAN TO ALLOW DIRIGIBLES TO DOCK AT THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING HAD TO BE ABANDONED.
1350	16183	6	3	"IN THE EXCERPT ""THE MOORING MAST"" BY MARCIA AMIDON L¸STED, THE BUILDERS OF THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING FACED MANY OBSTACLES. THEIR GOAL WAS TO CONSTRUCT A MOOR ON TOP OF THE BUILDING TO ENABLE DIRIGIBLES, OR BLIMPS, TO DOCK. IN THE END, THEY WERE NOT SUCCESSFUL. ONE OBSTACLE WAS ""LACK OF A SUITABLE LANDING AREA."" WITHOUT A PROPER LANDING SPACE, THE DOCK WOULD NOT FUNCTION EFFECTIVELY. ANOTHER MAIN OBSTACLE WAS RELATED TO SAFETY. ""MOST DIRIGIBLES FROM OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES USED HYDROGEN RATHER THAN HELIUM, AND HYDROGEN IS HIGHLY FLAMMABLE."" THESE DIRIGIBLES COULD EASILY CATCH ON FIRE AND CAUSE HARM TO MANY INNOCENT PEOPLE. THIS LEADS TO TWO OTHER REASONS. ""NATURE ITSELF"" COULD EASILY START A FIRE WITH THE WIND. THERE WAS ALSO AN ""EXISTING LAW AGAINST AIRSHIPS FLYING TOO LOW OVER URBAN AREAS."" THE DIRIGIBLES COULD POSE A THREAT TO INNOCENT PEOPLE. MANY OTHER OBSTACLES WERE IDENTIFIED, AND AS A RESULT, THIS PLAN TO ALLOW DIRIGIBLE DOCKING AT THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING FAILED."
1351	16184	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. For instance, a person tried a publicity - stunt where they aimed to tie up and deliver a bundle of newspapers to the Empire State Building. The mooring equipment for the workers had never been installed. This put the workers in great danger as they had to catch the bundle of papers on a rope dangling from the blimp. Moreover, the strong wind at the top of the building posed a significant risk to the workers, increasing the chances of them falling off or even dying. In the end, these challenges made it extremely difficult to achieve the goal of allowing dirigibles to dock.
1352	16185	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State building faced many problems when attempting to let dirigibles dock there. There were three major problems explaining why it was so hard to dock them at the Empire State building. These obstacles were the contents of the dirigibles, the ""nature"" of winds around New York, and a new law passed on restrictions of airships. Dirigibles, unlike balloons which are filled with Helium, are filled with hydrogen. Hydrogen is highly flammable. Given that New York is a highly - populated city, this could have led to a terrible disaster if anything caught on fire. Another problem they faced were the high winds of New York. These winds were constantly shifting. So, they considered tying the dirigibles down with lead, but this would be a bad idea because if the lead ever fell, it would injure many people on the ground. Lastly, they recently passed a law against airships flying too low over urban cities. If this law was very strict, then the dirigibles wouldn't be allowed to dock there as it might be too close to the city. In conclusion, there were many obstacles that the architects didn't think about before constructing the docking facility for dirigibles."
1353	16186	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The builders were in a competition to become the tallest building in the world. This made them rush and really strive for this goal. The architects had to find a way to build this mast. ""Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modification had to be made to the building's framework"". They had to fix the framework of the building so that the wind wouldn't affect the rest of the building. ""The stress of the dirigibles' load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" The builders and architects also had to overcome the reality. It was not safe as dirigibles are highly flammable. It would be a terrible accident if one exploded in the city. Also, many laws restricted airships flying low in urban areas. The builders had to face many problems while trying to build the tallest building and make it suitable for dirigible docking."
1354	16187	6	3	"The main obstacle was initially to be the tallest building in the world. That all changed to being able to have a mooring mast so blimps could land on it to drop - off/pick up passengers and refuel. They had ""seventy - five thousand dollars"" in renovations to make the structure of the tower more sturdy. However, they couldn't make the foundations sturdy enough to hold the weight of a 700 - foot ship along with its cargo. In the end, this inability to support the weight became a major hindrance to the plan of using the building for blimp docking."
1355	16188	6	3	"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. ""The stress of the dirigibles' load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below"" is understood in paragraph nine. This was the biggest obstacle the builders had to face. The builders developed a plan. They decided that rather than building a utilitarian mast without any ornamentation, the architects designed a shiny glass and chrome - nickel stainless steel tower. This tower would be illuminated from the inside, with a stepped - back design that imitated the overall shape of the building itself. Although the mast was finished, due to natural factors and a new law, no dirigibles have ever docked at the Empire State Building. In conclusion, despite the efforts in design and construction, these external factors prevented the successful docking of dirigibles."
1356	16189	6	3	"As a result of the visionary idea to build a mooring mast, the builder indeed faced a few formidable obstacles in constructing the mast. The first problem was of a structural nature. The weight of the large dirigible, when tied with a single sturdy tie, would exert great stress on the building. It was said that between the dirigible's heavy load and the strong wind pressure, the stress would be distributed all the way down to the very foundation of the building. Another significant obstacle was safety. Many dirigibles outside the United States used Hydrogen instead of Helium, and Hydrogen is highly flammable. The owners were well - aware of the tragic ""Hindenburg"" incident and realized the potentially catastrophic effects it could have had on downtown New York. The final obstacle stemmed from nature because the winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting. The problem discussed regarding this was that despite the dirigibles being firmly tied, they could swivel around the mast. Due to these many obstacles faced, the mooring mast was not constructed to its full intended purpose, and blimps became less commonly used as a result."
1357	16190	6	3	"The obstacles that the builders faced in their ambitious attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there were the strength of the building's frame, the forces of nature, and certain restrictive laws against it. A major problem with building a landing for the dirigibles on the Empire State Building was the strength of the base. As stated, ""A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single strong cable tether, would add significant stress to the building's frame."" (paragraph @NUM1). Another obstacle that the builders of the landing needed to overcome was the element of nature. The winds at the top of the Empire State Building were always in a state of change due to the violent air currents. A dirigible tethered to a mooring mast had the real potential of wrapping around the mooring mast in the unpredictable winds. The workers could not take the risk of trusting the dirigibles to stay safely on the mooring mast, as a fall could send the dirigible right down onto the thousands of pedestrians walking below. The last obstacle that the workers had to get past was an existing law that strictly prevented airships from flying too low over urban areas. ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building..."" (paragraph @NUM2). All of these obstacles proved to be insurmountable for the workers, and as a result, the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building was never created."
1358	16191	6	3	"The Empire State Building is one of the most iconic and greatest symbols of the United States. With the World Trade Center tragically destroyed, it now stands as the city's highest building. Many people are familiar with its famous spire at its summit, but very few actually know the real reason why it's there. The truth is that it was originally meant to be a mooring dock for dirigibles, or zeppelins, which were large balloons lined with strong steel and equipped with propellers for precise steering. The sad truth is that this plan never came to fruition. According to the article ""The Mooring Mast"", the environmental conditions as well as the safety conditions were far too poor to accommodate dirigibles. Apparently, the wind currents at such a high altitude are extremely fierce, and if a blimp were to be tethered to the top, a great deal of strain would be placed on the building frame. Fixing this strain would be both time - consuming and costly. Also, there would be no practical and safe way to weigh down the balloon without the risk of it falling on civilians. Not only that, but having airships that low over urban areas was against the law. In short, the whole idea was just wishful thinking because it simply couldn't have happened."
1359	16192	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous and significant obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. For instance, in paragraph @NUM1, it vividly describes the Hindenburg bursting into flames over New Jersey. This incident clearly demonstrated how incredibly dangerous it would have been if such an event were to occur over a highly - populated area like New York. The potential for widespread destruction and loss of life in a bustling city like New York was a major deterrent for the builders, making it extremely difficult to proceed with the plan of having dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building.
1360	16193	6	3	During any type of large - scale construction, the builders are bound to face some type of obstacles, and the builders of the Empire State Building were no exception. One significant obstacle the builders faced in their attempt to let dirigibles dock on the Empire State Building was the high flammability of these airships. A well - known German dirigible was destroyed by a devastating fire in New Jersey. If this fire had occurred in New York, a much more densely populated area, the accident would have been far more disastrous, with potentially countless lives at stake. Another obstacle they faced, and perhaps their greatest one, was the powerful force of nature. The air currents at the top of the building were extremely violent, causing the winds to be constantly shifting. This would cause the dirigible to swivel around the mooring mast, even if it was securely tethered to it. One last obstacle they faced was an existing strict law that prevented airships from flying too low over urban areas like New York. After carefully considering all the obstacles they faced, the builders came to the realization that being able to moor a dirigible to the mast on top of the Empire State Building simply was not meant to be.
1361	16194	6	3	"In ""The mooring mast"" by Marcia Lusted, the builders who aimed to make it possible for dirigibles or ""blimps"" to tie up to the mooring mast of the Empire State Building faced several unforeseen problems. These included variations in blimps they hadn't planned for, safety issues, and laws they would have to violate to allow a dirigible to land. When constructing the mast, the builders didn't thoroughly consider any of these aspects. The problems the builders would encounter would surface right after the mast was erected. To begin with, the differences in blimps between countries were a significant factor. Blimps in the United States used helium to keep the dirigible flying, but in other countries outside the states, they used hydrogen, which is highly flammable. This posed a major risk for a densely - populated place like New York. Another safety issue beyond their control was nature. The strong winds atop the building would cause the back of the blimp to sway, and during landing, the wind might push the blimp into the mast, which could puncture the dome. These safety concerns are the reasons why blimps are typically landed on the ground. Moreover, even without these safety issues, there was a legal problem. A law stated that airships can't fly too low over urban areas, making it illegal to dock on the building. Having failed to consider all these factors, the builders put up the mast, but unfortunately, they later had to confront the differences in blimps, safety issues, and legal troubles they hadn't accounted for. In the end, these unaddressed problems made the mooring mast an impractical solution for dirigible docking."
1362	16195	6	3	The Empire State Building was constructed to compete with the Chrysler Building. To gain an edge in this competition, its designers created a mooring mast. The obstacles that restricted the dirigibles from using this mast were multi - fold. Firstly, nature played a significant role. The wind changes on top of the building were extremely drastic. These sudden and strong wind shifts made it very difficult for dirigibles to approach and dock safely. Secondly, some dirigibles had a large amount of hydrogen, which is highly flammable. In a densely populated area like New York, where the Empire State Building is located, a fire caused by a hydrogen - filled dirigible could have catastrophic consequences. Another reason was a legal one. It's illegal for aircrafts to fly low over urban areas. This law made it impossible for dirigibles to land and moor at the Empire State Building. All these complications combined restricted the dirigibles from using the mooring mast, ultimately making the attempt to create a docking site for them at the building unsuccessful.
1363	16196	6	3	"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted, the challenges of creating a Mooring mast on top of a 1,250 - foot - tall building are discussed. In the 1930s, Al Smith, the governor at the time, had the visionary idea of equipping the Empire State Building with its own landing dock for Dirigibles. Throughout the construction process, the builders were faced with numerous obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. The first major obstacle was getting the mast on top of the building. As the text states, ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" If the builders did so, it would cause excessive stress to the building's structure. After much effort and expense, the problem was solved by spending over $100,000 on a steel frame to support the mast. However, most of the builders' problems were insurmountable. Safety was a major concern. Most dirigibles were built with hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. A fire involving a hydrogen - filled dirigible over a densely populated area would be a disaster. Also, the dirigibles would be at such a high altitude that it would be extremely difficult to tie them down securely. Additionally, if the dirigibles did land there, it would be in violation of an existing law. Therefore, the builders were faced with so many obstacles that they were ultimately unable to make the mooring mast a functional docking site for dirigibles."
1364	16197	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced significant obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to land there. One major obstacle was safety. When foreign dirigibles flew in, they most likely contained hydrogen, which is highly flammable. After the tragic Hindenburg crash, people were even more cautious about the possibility of a similar disaster occurring in a densely populated area like New York. An unstoppable obstacle for the builders was nature. The vicious winds on top of the building made it extremely difficult for dirigibles to get tied up and release passengers. According to the article, lead weights were used to land dirigibles in open land during bad weather, but the builders didn't use them, which was a safety measure to prevent the weights from falling and hitting someone. Amid all this trouble, the builders still had the most practical problem: ""There was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" With this legal issue, it was illegal to have a dirigible tied up on the Empire State Building so close to the ground. In conclusion, even though the mooring mast never worked out as planned, the builders went through the process of looking at these obstacles, showing their determination and the ambition to pioneer a new form of transportation, but in the end, the challenges were insurmountable."
1365	16198	6	3	"The competitive spirit of Al Smith, governor of New York, spurred him and his architects to build a docking site for dirigibles atop the Empire State Building. Instead of being daunted by the difficult task ahead, they saw the opportunity to become the forefront of modern travel. When deciding to build a mooring on top of the Empire State Building, the architects were well - aware that they'd face multiple obstacles. The first obstacle they faced was how to adjust the frame of the building to support the docking site. As the architects knew, the building ""would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation"" (par. 4). Through hard work and engineering expertise, they were able to overcome this initial hurdle, but many more challenges loomed ahead. The wind and weather conditions needed to be carefully considered. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting"" (par. 6). Reluctantly, the builders had to admit that nature posed an inevitable obstacle. They began to realize how unrealistic this dream of a dirigible docking site was. Two more significant obstacles lay ahead, and these would ultimately put an end to the mooring dock project. A floating dirigible above a densely populated city was an inherently dangerous idea. It was noted that hydrogen was highly flammable (par. 8), and a fire would be extremely harmful to both the building and the city. The last obstacle they faced was the law, and they were unable to overcome it. They realized that there ""was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (par 10). The impossibility of the plan became clear as there were too many obstacles to overcome. The builders gave up hope, but the moorings still stand atop the Empire State Building as a silent reminder of what could have been in the realm of modern transportation."
1366	16199	6	3	"The early @DATE1's was a dynamic time where everyone was eagerly out to find and build the next best thing. In @CAPS1, two prominent tycoons were fiercely competing to construct the tallest building in the world. Al Smith, the visionary man behind creating the Empire State building, had a brilliant and creative idea to make his building taller and more popular; he planned to build a mooring mast for dirigibles on the top of his building. Though it was a good and creative concept, the obstacles his architects would face would turn out to be far more than they had bargained for. First off, putting a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building was extremely unpractical without changing the whole design. ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and Strengthened to accommodate this new situation"", (@CAPS2 @NUM1). Also, the dirigible would exert so much stress on the foundation of the building. ""The Stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation...,"" (@CAPS2 @NUM1). Nature was also a giant obstacle these architects faced while building this. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself"", (@CAPS2 @NUM3). As you can see, these architects faced numerous challenges while building this mast, but sadly, their efforts never paid off in the end."
1367	16200	6	3	The obstacles the builder of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there are quite significant. The government people in Washington were carefully thinking about some safe way of mooring airships to the mast. They were extremely cautious as they never wanted an accident to occur at the top of the building. The wind on top of the building was constantly shifting due to violent air currents, which made the docking process extremely difficult. Moreover, considering the weights of the build, with the dirigible dangling high above pedestrians on the street, it was neither practical nor safe. Additionally, there were laws in place that prohibited such dangerous and unregulated docking operations. In conclusion, these multiple factors combined made it nearly impossible for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
1368	16201	6	3	"In order to dock these dirigibles, the builders would face many serious problems. These problems, which the builders would be forced to deal with, involve aspects related to the building's structure, the city environment, and natural forces. First off, the building frame was too weak to be tied to a dirigible. This is because it ""would add stress"" to the frame which could ""be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" Due to this, they would be forced to spend ""over sixty thousand dollars"" to strengthen the frame. A second issue they were faced with is that the building is located in a city. Laws had prohibited ""flying too low over urban areas"", let alone ""tie up to the building"". Due to this fact, they would be forced to design a way for the dirigible to dock that complied with the regulations. Finally, ""violent air currents"" would cause more issues. The builders would have to deal with building a piece of mooring equipment that could withstand the wrath of ""nature itself"". All in all, this plan would force many issues on the builders, and it would be extremely challenging for it to function properly."
1369	16202	6	3	Right from the start, the Empire State Building had architectural demands that posed several significant obstacles for the builders, especially when it came to building the mooring mast for dirigibles. Initially, the Empire State Building was primarily built for inside use, so adding a mooring mast would add stress to the building's frame and possibly cause damage to its structural integrity. Secondly, the Empire State Building was constructed in a very densely populated area. If any malfunctions were to occur, such as the tragic Hindenburg incident in 1937, many innocent people down below could be killed. Another problem posed to the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting, and they were very strong as well. This meant that any dirigible attempting to mount on the building was threatened by swiveling and flying off when landing. The masters in the architectural era had made a true mistake when they planned the construction of the Empire State Building with the mooring mast in mind, and it never could have reached its potential for these many obvious reasons.
1370	16203	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles while trying to make a mooring mast for dirigibles. The first obstacle was creating the mooring mast itself. In @CAPS1 four it says, ""This dream of the aviation pioneers was travel by dirigible, or zeppelin, and the Empire State Building was going to have a mooring mast at its top for docking these new airships."" The Empire State Building's frame wasn't strong enough for the mooring mast, so the builders had to carefully modify it. In @CAPS1 nine they say, ""The steel frame of the Empire state Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" An obstacle that stopped the use of the mooring mast was the wind. In @CAPS1 fifteen, it was recorded that the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds. Another obstacle they faced was safety. In @CAPS1 @NUM1 they describe that, ""most dirigibles from outside of the united states used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" There are problems that the builders could fix, like strengthening the frame, but others, such as the wind and safety issues related to hydrogen, were much more difficult to overcome. In the end, these obstacles made it very challenging for the mooring mast to be a practical and safe solution."
1371	16204	6	3	The builders faced some problems such as unpredictable weather conditions. The winds were extremely violent due to the constantly changing wind currents. Another issue was the law regulating how close an aircraft could be to a building. Moreover, the building had to be strong enough to firmly hold a blimp in place. To achieve this, the builders would have to strengthen the building's skeleton, and they successfully carried out this task. Another problem is that some foreign Blimps are made with hydrogen, which makes them highly flammable, while others are made of helium. If the hydrogen in a blimp were to catch fire, it could fall onto pedestrians below. These are the problems they faced and had to deal with during the construction.
1372	16205	6	3	Some of the obstacles that the builders faced while allowing dirigibles to dock there would be that they had a severely lack of a suitable landing area. One of the main obstacles that occurred would be nature. The air currents were constantly shifting in an erratic manner. As a result, the back of the ship was constantly shifting, making the docking process extremely difficult and dangerous. These challenges significantly hampered the builders' efforts to enable successful dirigible docking.
1373	16206	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building made it possible for dirigibles to dock on the top of the building because this addition made the building a lot more prominent and bigger than it was originally. It initially lost its position as the biggest building but then regained it by creating the dock for dirigibles (Blimps). This innovative addition not only enhanced the building's stature but also demonstrated the builders' forward - thinking approach.
1374	16207	6	3	"In The Mooring Mask by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1 the builders of the Empire State building faced numerous Problems trying to dock the dirigibles. One big and obvious obstacle is that the dirigibles were a significant safety hazard. For example, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" If a dirigible had caught on fire while docked in such a densely populated area, many innocent people could have been killed. Another issue was nature. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This would cause the back of the dirigible to swivel around uncontrollably, making it extremely unsafe. The builders faced many insurmountable obstacles and unfortunately could never achieve the goal of docking a dirigible at the Empire State building."
1375	16208	6	3	"In the building of the mast that was to be used to dock and refuel dirigibles the builders and architect @CAPS2 encountered many daunting problems. For one thing, a simple mooring mast could not be placed on the roof of the Empire State Building. The mast would add too much stress to the building's framework and, combined with the immense wind power, cause it to collapse. Another problem was that ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium to inflate their dirigibles. Unlike helium, hydrogen is highly flammable. There was also a law that stated that airships could not @CAPS1 too low over urban areas. One of the final and most important reasons the builders @CAPS2 faced obstacles was the constantly shifting wind due to violent air currents. Even with the dirigibles tethered to the mooring mast, the back end would swivel around the mast along with the wind, making docking and refueling operations impossible. These problems ultimately prevented the successful implementation of the dirigible docking system."
1376	16209	6	3	There are many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One significant issue was the stress the dirigible would add to the building. To address this, over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework. Also, most dirigibles contained hydrogen, which is highly flammable and extremely dangerous. Another dangerous aspect is that this huge piece of material would be dangling high above pedestrians, as opposed to their much safer usual landing of open fields. Lastly, there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, which would also cause docking issues. Due to these multiple obstacles, the plan to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building faced insurmountable challenges.
1377	16210	6	3	The biggest obstacle was safety. The foreign dirigibles use Hydrogen (H₂) gas as a means to fly, but hydrogen gas is highly flammable. The owners of the Empire State Building were concerned because of what happened to the German dirigible, Hindenburg, over Lakehurst, New Jersey. The Hindenburg burst into flames and in less than one minute, there was no dirigible left, just some charred scrap metal. If this incident were to happen in a highly populated area like downtown New York City, it would create a high number of casualties and fatalities. Given such a catastrophic potential, it was clear that allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was a risky proposition that could not be overlooked.
1378	16211	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there because of ""nature itself"" and the past problems that happened. An obstacle that the builders faced was providing safety. After the fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, the builders were worried about the issues that might occur, especially when it takes place in downtown New York, a densely - populated area. Another obstacle was ""nature itself."" Because of the mooring mast being on top of the building, the builders were frightened because of the violent air currents that could affect the dirigibles. The last obstacle was that it was a law that airships could not fly too low over urban areas. So it was illegal for an airship to be tied on a building. The builders faced three main obstacles - ""Nature itself,"" a past accident, and the law. Unfortunately, they were unable to continue their work because the obstacles were just too strong, making the plan of dirigible docking unfeasible."
1379	16212	6	3	"Allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building would have been completely different from anything before, but never continued because of obstacles. The builders faced issues such as safety issues, harnessing nature, and the law itself. The dirigibles presented safety issues including fire, which occurred and builders ""realized how much worse that accident could have been"" (∂ 1). Another safety issue was keeping the blimps stabilized, which would have needed free - hanging weights over the city, posing a risk to the people below. Yet another obstacle was the power of nature; it would have been nearly impossible to keep the dirigible in place. Because of the wind ""the back of the ship would swivel around... the mooring mast"" (∂ 2). The new idea was a good one but the law also was against it, because of how low the blimp would be. As stated, ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building..."" (∂ 3). The masting moor of the Empire State Building caused too many obstacles for the project to be completed. Although it would have opened new doors for means of travel, there were too many safety violations for it to be worthwhile, ultimately dooming the project."
1380	16213	6	3	"While attempting to build a mooring dock on top of the Empire State Building, the builders had some problems to overcome. The winds in New York City were too strong to fly a dirigible in; one driver said ""the captain could not take his hands off the control levers."" Flying so close to buildings in a dirigible was illegal for fear of crashing into ""sharp spires of other buildings in the area."" The only way to prevent the dirigible from swinging violently was to put large lead weights on it, but that would not be practical over New York as it could pose a danger if dropped. In conclusion, docking a dirigible on the Empire State Building was too difficult and it never happened, as the challenges were simply too great to overcome."
1381	16214	6	3	The builders had numerous obstacles while constructing the Empire State Building. They were in direct competition with the Chrysler Building due to its height. Al Smith, the mastermind behind the Empire State Building, was determined to build the tallest and most famous building in the world. He made the building seem invincible, even adding a mooring mast on it so that dirigibles could land. However, this mooring mast was never meant to serve that practical purpose; it was only created for publicity. Without the mooring mast, the building might have failed to gain popularity. Al Smith did everything in his power to make the building what it is today, and it still stands proudly in New York City.
1382	16215	6	3	There were many significant obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced when attempting to allow dirigibles to land there. One major issue was that the weight of the zeppelin, when tied down to the building, would exert immense pressure on the framework, and this pressure would even reach the foundation. The cost of reworking the framework to make it safer would have been a substantial @MONEY1. Another challenging obstacle was public expectations. The building was supposed to revolutionize how we travel forever, all while being a beautiful and magnificent structure. Undoubtedly, the pressure to build the tallest tower in the world affected the builders. These expectations were so unrealistic because most people didn't have enough knowledge to understand the safety risks involved. In the end, these obstacles made the plan of dirigible landings at the Empire State Building extremely difficult to achieve.
1383	16216	6	3	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced were far from easy. They first had to carefully draw out the detailed plan for the mooring mast. The builders had to thoroughly think about the thousand - foot dirigible that would be mooring at the top of the Empire State Building. They needed to take into account the wind pressure and the heavy load of the dirigible. To address these challenges, the builders had to come up with brilliant ideas, such as the ""a shiny glass and chrome - nickel stainless steel tower"" (@CAPS1 paragraph @NUM1) on top of the building. Moreover, the builders had to build and plan the elevators and stairs to bring the passengers of the dirigible from the one - hundred - second floor to the eighty - sixth floor, where there were baggage and ticket facilities. The builders had a tough job as they not only had to think of ideas on how to build the mooring mast of the building but also had to figure out how to bring the passengers in and out of the dirigible smoothly. Throughout the construction process, the builders continuously faced various obstacles."
1384	16217	6	3	"The Empire State Building, at the time it was being built, was meticulously designed to be the tallest building in the world. However, achieving this was no easy feat. The workers had one particularly difficult obstacle to overcome: enabling @CAPS1 dirigibles, or blimps, to dock there. The plan was to construct a mooring mast on top of the building, which would allow dirigibles to dock. If this could be accomplished, it was said to make the Empire State Building ""equipped for an age of transportation..."" Nevertheless, many problems arose. The weight of the dirigibles would have to be held safely, and the architects were well - aware that this weight would put significant stress on the building's frame. As a result, the workers had to carefully modify and strengthen the building's framework. They also built the mast out of a strong, shiny, chrome - nickel material. Another obstacle emerged when considering the mast. The framework was originally stopped at the eighty - fifth floor, so the workers had to finish the roof before they could start framing the mast. Although the workers managed to create a safe mast, the ""Aviation Pioneers Dream"" of regular dirigible docking at the Empire State Building never came to fruition."
1385	16218	6	3	"Al Smith saw a great opportunity for his Empire State Building. He envisioned adding a mooring mast to the top of the building so that dirigibles could anchor there for refueling or servicing and allow people to embark and disembark. In order to achieve this, the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be ""modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" They would have to spend over sixty thousand dollars on modifying the framework. The builders not only had to make the building 102 floors but also had to create a glassed - in observation area along with an open observation platform. Additionally, they had to complete the roof and then proceed to build the steel mast with glass windows. After investing so much time and money in re - creating the building, unfortunately, the dirigibles couldn't dock there. The wind was so strong that the back of the ship would always be in motion. Also, there is a law that airships can't fly too low over urban areas. In the end, all the efforts and expenses were not worth it as the intended purpose of the mooring mast couldn't be fulfilled."
1386	16219	6	3	"Due to several factors, the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. One serious obstacle was that a large dirigible moored at the top of the building, held only by a tether, would exert significant stress on the building's frame. As stated in paragraph nine, ""the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the framework."" Another complication was nature itself. Above the city, strong winds were constantly shifting due to air currents, making it nearly impossible to safely dock a dirigible. In addition to nature working against the mooring mast, the law also presented an issue. Paragraph fifteen mentions ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas,"" which made it illegal for an airship to ever tie up at the Empire State Building. These multiple obstacles ultimately made it unfeasible for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building."
1387	16220	6	3	"The Empire State Building faced a lot of obstacles, as described in paragraph @NUM1, ""A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add substantial stress to the building's frame."" This was one of the many troubles for dirigibles to land on the Empire State Building. In paragraph @NUM2, they eventually came to realize that the mooring mast of the Empire State Building shouldn't have been built because it wouldn't work. The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed. One of the main reasons was nature. As seen in paragraph @NUM3, ""the winds were shifting due to violent air currents."" The mooring mast had a lot of problems right from the beginning when Al Smith added a top to the building, making it 1,250 feet tall. It was unsafe for planes. When they wanted to make the dirigibles land on top of the building, dirigibles that came from other countries often had hydrogen, which is highly flammable. The problem that worked against the mooring mast being built was the strong wind on top of the building, constantly changing because of the air currents. These are the reasons why the mooring mast was unsuccessful on the Empire State Building, highlighting the miscalculations in the initial plans."
1388	16221	6	3	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were significant. As stated, ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would have imposed great stress on the building's frame. The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" These challenges, mainly related to the structural impact of the dirigible on the building, were the main obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. In the end, these difficulties made it extremely hard to implement the docking plan for dirigibles at the Empire State Building."
1389	16222	6	3	When the Empire State Building was built, new and ambitious ideas came into the heads of the architects. Unfortunately, their vision of making it into a @NUM1 dock for blimps proved to be unrealistic. The first challenge they encountered was how to attach a dock for a blimp to the building without creating excessive stress on the building's framework. The building could potentially collapse with the added weight of a blimp unless sixty thousand dollars' worth of framework strengthening was carried out. Another obstacle that the architects faced was nature. At the top of the Empire State Building, the winds were so strong that the blimps would be swaying violently, making it impossible for the pilots to dock them safely. The last reason that blimps could not be docked at the Empire State Building was that there were laws against aircraft flying that low. It was actually considered illegal to dock the blimp there because it would have to fly low enough to approach the building. Due to these factors, including structural, natural, and legal issues, the Empire State Building was unable to become a dock to support blimps, and the architects' vision remained unfulfilled.
1390	16223	6	3	From my reading, I understand that the difficulties of building a mooring dock atop such a structure as the Empire State Building were numerous. An obvious one was ensuring structural stability throughout the entire building. Paraphrased from the passage, the tension from the dirigible pulling on the tether would cause significant stress on the building's frame. Another major issue was the control of the dirigible during docking. The passage explained that the winds above the Empire State Building would shift violently and frequently, making it very difficult to maneuver the dirigible safely. Safety was also a significant concern, especially after the Hindenburg accident in New Jersey, when a German zeppelin caught fire and exploded. This incident raised serious questions about the safety of using dirigibles, and combined with the other difficulties, it became clear that building a mooring dock for dirigibles on the Empire State Building was an extremely challenging and ultimately unfeasible task.
1391	16224	6	3	The obstacles the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on top of the Empire State Building were building a mast, ensuring dirigibles could dock safely on top of the building, and adhering to a law regarding dirigibles. The architects and builders spent a considerable amount of time carefully building the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building. Dirigibles were actively trying to figure out the proper way to dock to the building, yet unfortunately, most dirigibles failed in their docking attempts. There was a law stating that dirigibles were unable to dock in urban areas in case there was a problem within the dirigibles. These were the significant obstacles the builders faced in an attempt to create a mast and allow dirigibles to dock on top of the Empire State Building, ultimately proving to be quite challenging.
1392	16225	6	3	"The obstacles the builders faced building the Empire State Building were safety and time. The safety of building the top of the Empire State Building was a major concern because, being so tall, it was extremely difficult to lift up the glass and steel parts to the top. Another reason why it was unsafe was that if some of the glass or steel parts got accidentally pushed off, the people down below would be in great danger. Additionally, the blimps flying too close to the buildings and hitting one of them was a risk. Also, when the passengers were going on and off of the blimp, the builders needed to find a way that the passengers wouldn't get hurt. The time that they had to build the top of the Empire State Building was not long enough. As one worker said, ""it's on the level, all right. No Kidding. We're working on the thing now."" Despite these challenges, they persevered in the construction process."
1393	16226	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. The builders had a real hard time with the construction of the mooring mast. They had to carefully deal with the framework of the building to ensure its stability. A big obstacle they had was that they didn't have a suitable landing area for the dirigibles, which made docking very difficult. They didn't just have to deal with man - made obstacles, but nature's obstacles as well. The strong wind on the top of the building made it nearly impossible to land safely. As stated, ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation"" (citation). The constructors of the building realized that to make this plan possible they would have to redo the frame of the building. The building wasn't even originally designed to be able to allow dirigibles to land on the top of it. The workers were initially blind to see all the possible problems with the design of the mooring mast. The obstacles the workers had to go through were too much, and unfortunately, the landing of the dirigibles never worked out."
1394	16227	6	3	"To allow Dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, builders would have to face tough obstacles. One obstacle would be that technology was rapidly growing in the 1930's. By the time they were working on the project, planes were invented. The quote ""the as yet unsolved problem of mooring airships to a fixed mast at such a height made it Desirable to Postpone to a later date the final installation of the landing gear"" this evidence proves that they already made technology to land Dirigibles safely but needed to test to see if the mast really worked. This indicates that technology was invented earlier than the builders could even make the mast at the top of the Empire State building. Later on, they figured that a dirigible would be unsafe at the top of a mast because the wind would blow it around and potentially crash into the building. It was a risky endeavor to begin with, and these obstacles made it very difficult to achieve the goal of dirigible docking."
1395	16228	6	3	"In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon, the builders of the Empire State Building had to face a lot of obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle that the builders had to face was when they were building the mooring mast to hold the dirigibles. The single cable tether that would hold the dirigibles would add a significant amount of stress to the building's frame. The builders had to come up with a new, innovative idea that would not put stress on the Building. Another obstacle the builders had to face was ensuring it would be safe for the passengers. Since the building is so high up, the fear of falling out of the dirigible made the passengers and the builders worry. One last obstacle that the builders had to face is the ""existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas,"" which made it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building. The builders faced many complex obstacles while building the mooring mast, and these challenges ultimately made the task of enabling dirigible docking quite arduous."
1396	16229	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous formidable obstacles in their ambitious attempt to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the iconic building. The first significant obstacle was that the steel frame of the Empire State Building, which was originally designed for different purposes, would have to undergo substantial modifications. The excerpt clearly states that ""over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" This financial burden and the engineering challenges associated with these changes were no small feat. Another crucial obstacle was safety. After the tragic incident where the German dirigible Hindenburg caught on fire in a spectacular and deadly event, the builders were acutely aware of how catastrophic the devastation would be if a similar disaster occurred over densely populated New York City. The potential loss of life and property was simply too great a risk. Nature also posed a large and persistent obstacle. The shifting air currents at the top of the building, which were often unpredictable and strong, would make the dirigible extremely unstable. Having an unstable dirigible hanging precariously above the crowded city streets was an unacceptable danger. Finally, at the time, there was an ""existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" These multiple and insurmountable obstacles ultimately dissuaded the architects of the Empire State Building from continuing their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there."
1397	16230	6	3	Builders of the Empire State Building encountered a series of complex problems when they set out to allow dirigibles to dock at the building. One significant problem was that a large dirigible moored at the top of the building, held only by a single cable tether, would add an enormous amount of stress to the frame of the building. The stress generated by the weight of the dirigible and the force of the wind pressure would have to be transmitted almost eleven hundred feet below, all the way down to the building's foundation. This meant that the builders would have to go back and make substantial modifications to the frame of the Empire State Building to ensure it was strong enough to accommodate the dirigibles. Specifically, over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications would have to be made. As the construction process proceeded, once the framing had been completed up to the 85th floor, the roof had to be finished before the framing for the mooring mast could commence. This sequence of construction steps added further complexity and time to the already challenging project, highlighting the difficulties the builders faced in their endeavor to enable dirigible docking.
1398	16231	6	3	"Some of the significant obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there were related to safety, nature, and the law. One of the greatest obstacles was safety. Since blimps needed to be lighter than air to function properly, most are filled with either helium or hydrogen. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This is a major concern because if the blimp is high off the ground of New York City and then catches on fire, the consequences could be extremely disastrous. Another obstacle was nature; due to the violent air currents that are common in the area, which can even make tall buildings sway. This is also a serious issue because if the blimp moves or the building sways into each other, then one or the other could break, potentially causing significant damage and endangering lives. The last obstacle was the law, which strictly prohibited 'airships flying too low over urban areas'. So, if they did build the mast, it would still be illegal to get a dirigible close to the building. These various obstacles presented significant challenges to the builders and ultimately limited their ability to build the Empire State building to dock blimps."
1399	16232	6	3	"There were many substantial obstacles the builders went through in their arduous effort to dock the dirigibles at the top of the Empire State Building. One prominent obstacle, to be exact, was the wind. Although they would be tying the dirigible down at one end, the back part was not fully secured, and the wind would blow the dirigible in unpredictable directions. This movement of the dirigible would have a direct impact on the building. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" With this crucial discovery, they had to make some significant changes to the building, which would inevitably cost them more money and time. Other obstacles they faced were actually being able to have the dirigible dock safely. There was a law in place that prohibited such docking due to concerns for the safety of the people below. ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" These are just a few of the numerous obstacles that the architects had to overcome throughout their attempt to dock dirigibles at the Empire State Building, and these challenges ultimately made the endeavor extremely difficult, if not impossible."
1400	16233	6	3	First of all, the Empire State Building was initially not designed with the intention of landing dirigibles on top of it. The architects, in an attempt to make this happen, had to completely redesign the whole top of the building. However, when they carried out these redesigns, they unfortunately never bothered to install proper landing gear for the dirigibles. In the event that it was a bad day out, weather - wise, such as when there were strong winds or heavy rain, it would be extremely difficult to land a dirigible without the proper landing gear. The dirigible is over 200 feet long, and without a very large and well - equipped landing surface, it would pose a serious danger to the people in the dirigible, the people on the ground, and the people helping to land the dirigible. The lack of proper landing facilities and the challenges presented by adverse weather conditions made the idea of landing dirigibles on the Empire State Building a highly risky and unfeasible proposition.
1401	16234	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous challenges when trying to enable dirigibles to dock there. One significant problem was constructing the mooring mast. Without it, a thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add excessive stress to the building's frame. As paragraph @NUM1 states, such a situation would put undue pressure on the building's structure. Even after the builders managed to build the mooring mast, it was still far too unsafe to moor dirigibles from the building. A major safety concern was that most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is extremely flammable. In the end, the builders were confronted with too many obstacles and were unable to successfully moor the dirigibles to the building.
1402	16235	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were safety, existing laws, and the changes in air currents. Many of the dirigibles ""from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (@NUM1). The owners of the Empire State Building were well - aware that if a hydrogen - filled dirigible were to catch on fire ""above a densely populated area"" (@NUM1), it would lead to a much worse and catastrophic situation. Another practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the top of the building was that there was ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (@NUM3). The airship would be ""dangling high above pedestrians on the streets"", which is clearly a very unsafe scenario (@NUM4). The last obstacle that the builders faced was the unpredictable shift in air currents on top of the building. If the dirigibles were tied to the mooring mast, ""the back of the ship would swivel around and around""(@NUM4). This could pose a great danger to pedestrians on the street, as well as passengers getting on and off the dirigibles. Due to these practical reasons, the idea of the mooring mast had to be abandoned."
1403	16236	6	3	The obstacles that the Empire State Building's builders faced in order to allow dirigibles; blimps to dock there were numerous. One obstacle was building more floors. They needed to construct additional floors so that the people on the dirigibles would have a proper place to load and unload their belongings on the ship. Another major obstacle was building steel frames from the 85th floor to the 102nd floor. This construction work cost them over @MONEY1 worth of modifications, which had to be carried out on the building's framework. These high - cost and labor - intensive tasks made it very difficult to achieve the goal of enabling dirigible docking.
1404	16237	6	3	"According to the excerpt, there were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was that the architects could not simply install a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. Doing so would cause significant stress on the building, so the ""steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened."" Another obstacle the architects faced was a serious concern for safety. As the excerpt mentions, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" Indeed, the greatest obstacle was ""nature itself."" On the top of the building, the winds were constantly shifting because of the violent air currents. As stated in the excerpt, ""the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" In conclusion, according to the excerpt, these are the many insurmountable obstacles faced by the architects."
1405	16238	6	3	The Empire State building faced a multitude of problems when it came to docking a dirigible. First of all, it needed a good and safe dock site. A proper docking area was essential to ensure the stability and safety of the dirigible during the docking process. Secondly, the strong winds at such a high altitude would make it nearly impossible for a dirigible to stay docked. The constant and unpredictable wind forces could easily dislodge the dirigible from its mooring. Finally, the dirigible would be very hazardous to the people below because it was extremely flammable. A fire on the dirigible could have disastrous consequences for the people on the ground. Due to these problems, docking a dirigible at the Empire State Building was an unfeasible idea.
1406	16239	6	3	"In this fascinating story ""The Mooring Mast"" written by author Marcia Amidon L¸sted, it tells about the Empire State Building and its enormous scale. Although constructing this building took workers a great deal of time and physical strength, they didn't exactly understand the purpose of the mooring mast. There were many reasons why they faced conflicts in attempting to let the dirigibles dock in the mooring mast. For example, the dirigible was made up of helium rather than hydrogen, and hydrogen is highly flammable. So, if they were to dock in downtown New York City, it would have been a complete disaster. Another reason is that dirigibles were typically moored in open landing fields so that they could be weighted down. Author Marcia writes, ""but using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the streets, was neither practical nor safe."" That's how, and there are many more reasons why workers had trouble building the mooring mast. In the end, these issues made the use of the mooring mast for dirigibles unfeasible."
1407	16240	6	3	"In the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the Empire State Building faced some significant obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. To begin with, one of the greatest obstacles was the force of nature. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air - currents"", and these unpredictable wind patterns made it extremely hard for the dirigible to have a safe landing. The other obstacle was that there was a strict law in place that went against airships flying low over urban areas. This law was put in place to protect the safety of the people living in the city. In conclusion, the mooring mast of the Empire State Building was not used for landing airships such as the dirigible because it was far too dangerous. In addition, they found other safe purposes for the mooring mast, ensuring that it still had a valuable function within the building's structure."
1408	16241	6	3	In the beginning, the use of dirigibles seemed like an excellent and revolutionary idea. They could potentially be the new form of transportation and appeared to have no obvious flaws. As the development of dirigibles progressed, however, it started to show signs of problems. The engineers initially planned on mooring the dirigible to the mast of the Empire State Building, but that would have added a substantial amount of stress to the building's frame, potentially compromising its structural integrity. They next found that safety was a major issue. Most dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. Also, they would have to use lead weights to hold down the dirigible when it was being moored. It would be extremely dangerous to have lead weights dangling over pedestrians on the street. Without the lead weights, the dirigible would simply swivel in the air, with a real possibility of puncturing its shell. Finally, there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This made it illegal for the ship to even approach the building. There were high hopes for the use of dirigibles, but in the end, they had more cons than pros, making their widespread use unviable.
1409	16242	6	3	"In an attempt to build a dirigble destination in the Empire State Building, the architects had to deal with several critical problems like a dirigble mishap or simply the forces of nature. Problems like a blimp crash would be extremely costly. Lives would be lost in the densely populated city, and the explosion could destroy buildings around and even damage the Empire State Building itself. To prevent this from happening, the Government had already made a law that banned flying aircraft from getting too close to urban areas. To build this docking station, the architects would have to break laws or bend rules. Another conflicting idea that disrupted plans for a dirigble docking station would be nature. Harsh winds could easily sway a blimp, and this swaying could cause the blimp to puncture on a nearby building. ""Even if the dirigble were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would still swivel around the mooring mast."" (Source reference). The swiveling, as mentioned earlier, could hit nearby buildings and harm civilians. The various problems and laws that kept the Mast from being created should have been realized before. In the end, it's clear that this idea will never be possible due to these insurmountable challenges."
1410	16243	6	3	The Empire State Building is well - known as the world's tallest building. The building is located in the bustling city of New York. Al Smith, the head of the project to build the Empire State Building, added a top or a hat to the building, which made the building even more distinctive than any other building in the city. The Empire State Building was initially equipped for transportation. The intended transportation was the dirigible, or zeppelin. The Empire State Building had a mooring mast at its top for docking the new airships. An obstacle that the Building faced was New York's lack of a suitable landing area. Al saw an opportunity to get people to and from the Empire State Building. He saw it as something creative and new. However, the mooring mast of the Empire State Building was never fully utilized. No proper thought of safety was considered before constructing the idea. The greatest reason was that most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, which poses a higher risk for flames. Also, nature itself was a big problem. The idea had safety problems and couldn't afford the risk of flames in downtown New York. In the end, these factors led to the mooring mast not fulfilling its intended purpose.
1411	16244	6	3	Based on the excerpt, the obstacles that the builders faced were that they had to descend to the base of the building to implement measures to make it taller. This arduous process presented significant challenges to the construction work. These were the obstacles that they faced, which undoubtedly added complexity to the building project.
1412	16245	6	3	Many obstacles presented themselves while builders attempted to build a landing dock for dirigibles on top of the Empire State Building. The obstacles included the public's safety, existing regulations that were already put in place, and the unpredictable weather. Many dirigibles use hydrogen gas which is very flammable. After the German Hindenburg went down in a tragic accident, it became glaringly apparent that the public's safety would be in grave danger from the vessels bursting into flame over crowded streets. At the time, there were also strict regulations forbidding aircrafts from traveling too low over urban areas and the landing dock was too low. The final problem was the unpredictable weather. Pilots were worried that the strong winds would blow the tethered vessel into another building or into sharp spires that would ruin the vessel and put the people below in great danger. Many obstacles hindered the construction of the loading dock on the Empire State Building, making it an extremely challenging endeavor.
1413	16246	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were high wind currents, and an already existing law that was against airships flying too low over urban areas. The first reason dirigibles couldn't dock was because of overly - powered wind currents on top of the Empire State Building. It was mentioned in paragraph @NUM1 that ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigibles were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast. Dirigibles moored in open landing fields are weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using these at the Empire State Building where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street was neither practical nor safe."" What was being said here was that it would be highly unsafe for people if the dirigibles were going to dock near the Empire State during violent air currents. The other reason why dirigibles couldn't dock was because of the law saying they were against airships flying too low over urban areas. In fact, this law made it completely illegal for the ships to tie up to the building and even get too close to the area. It was said in paragraph @NUM2 that dirigibles did try to reach the building. ""In December 1930, the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds. Fearing that the wind would blow the dirigible onto the sharp spires of other buildings in the area which would puncture the dirigible's shell, the captain could not even take his hands off the control levers. Since the dirigible was quite big, it couldn't get close enough because of sharp objects on other buildings. It is clear that the builders of the Empire State Building went through challenging obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. All because of very violent wind or air currents and the already existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, which ultimately made the docking plan unfeasible."
1414	16247	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many different obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock there. The major obstacle to allow dirigibles to dock there was the lack of a suitable landing area. To allow dirigibles to anchor at the Empire State Building for several hours, a mooring mast had to be added to the top of the building. The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire Building's flat roof. So, rather than building a plain and utilitarian mast without any ornamentation, the architects designed a shiny glass and chrome - nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from inside. Once the architects had designed the mooring mast, it could be constructed and made useful. However, the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The strong winds and unpredictable weather conditions at that height posed a constant threat. Those are some of the obstacles the builders had to face to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, making the task extremely difficult.
1415	16248	6	3	"After planning and building the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building, the developers found many problems that were not thought of earlier. They hadn't considered the flammability of the gases inside of the dirigibles. Hydrogen, commonly used in dirigibles, is highly combustible, and a single spark could lead to a catastrophic explosion. Nor had they remembered the ""law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to a building"" (lines @NUM1). Also, the heavy winds that would be found that high above the ground would certainly prove to be a danger to all the airships. If they had hit a neighboring building, the results could be disastrous, causing not only damage to the airship but also endangering the lives of people in the surrounding area. These unforeseen problems severely hampered the viability of using the mooring mast for dirigible docking."
1416	16249	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many formidable obstacles in their ambitious attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. One significant problem the builders encountered was that a dirigible being moored to the top of the building would impose additional stress on its frame. As stated in paragraph @NUM1, ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly @NUM2 feet below."" To address this issue, the builders had to invest sixty thousand dollars in making modifications to strengthen the frame of the building. Another major hurdle they faced was safety. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States use hydrogen rather than helium."" Hydrogen is extremely flammable, and after an incident where a German dirigible was destroyed, they realized how perilous it would be to have such a flammable aircraft over a densely populated area. Additionally, nature presented a significant challenge. In paragraph @NUM3, it mentions that ""The winds on top of the building were constantly moving."" These unpredictable winds made it extremely difficult to tie up the dirigible and keep the aircraft steady for passengers to disembark safely. Even a skilled navy pilot ""could not get close enough to tie up because of the forceful winds."" Moreover, there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. Due to all these insurmountable obstacles, the mooring on top of the Empire State Building was ultimately destined to fail."
1417	16250	6	3	"In the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders went through numerous obstacles to enable the dirigibles to dock in the Empire State Building. They had to undertake a major redesign of the top of the building. They needed to make it taller and more appropriately configured for the dirigibles to land safely. One of the initial problems they faced was uncertainty about whether the dirigibles would actually fit on the redesigned structure. Second, they had to design the mast. This involved creating a whole other specialized part for the dirigible to attach to. The builders also had to allocate a substantial sum of sixty thousand dollars into building the mast, which was a significant financial obstacle. Third, the builders constructed a stainless - steel tower for the docking of the dirigibles. This presented an obstacle because the tower was made with glass and chrome - nickel stainless steel, which required careful handling and installation. Despite all the efforts the builders made to overcome these obstacles for the dirigibles to dock, in the end, the dirigibles never did get a chance to dock. As the saying goes, the builders should ""Take a bow, because it's over now"", as their arduous but ultimately fruitless efforts deserve recognition."
1418	16251	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced a multitude of obstacles when it came to allowing dirigibles to dock there, including safety concerns, the challenges posed by nature, and existing laws. In the excerpt, the author highlights that many dirigibles use hydrogen, which is highly flammable. This makes it extremely perilous to dock them on the Empire State Building as they could potentially be involved in an accident. Given that New York is a densely populated city, such an accident would likely cause harm to a large number of people. It is simply not justifiable to risk people's lives for the sake of landing a dirigible. Another significant problem the builders faced was nature. In paragraph @NUM1, the excerpt states that ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This means that the dirigible would be left dangling high above New York, and the unpredictable winds could quickly turn dangerous. According to the excerpt, this situation was neither practical nor safe. To compound matters, the builders failed to consider an already existing law that prohibits airships from flying too low over urban areas. This meant that it would be illegal to dock a dirigible on the Empire State Building. With so many insurmountable obstacles, it was clear that allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building was never meant to be."
1419	16252	6	3	"While builders were trying to figure out a viable way for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, they encountered several significant obstacles. If a dirigible was held by a single cable, it would place additional stress on the building's frame. The dirigible would need to be cabled at the top, which was a difficult task because of the Empire State's flat roof. The flat surface provided limited options for secure attachment. Also, weather was a huge obstacle. As stated, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1, line @NUM2) These erratic winds would cause the dirigible to sway and make it highly unstable. Builders also had to take into account the potential harm to pedestrians. The dirigibles would be flying too close to the ground when approaching the building, posing a risk to those below. The process of planning where these aircrafts could land and refuel was a complex and difficult task for the builders. In the end, these multiple obstacles made it extremely challenging, if not impossible, to achieve the goal of dirigible docking at the Empire State Building."
1420	16253	6	3	"In the excerpt, The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, nature, unsafe docking conditions, and pre - existing laws against dirigibles were just a few of the many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced. The main obstacle ""to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself"". At the top of such a tall building, the wind is in a constant state of change, always switching directions. This would cause the dirigible to ""swivel around"" uncontrollably. Traditionally, blimps or dirigibles always landed in open fields where they could be weighted down with lead weights. However, using this technique in a situation where they would be dangling high above pedestrians ""was neither practical nor safe"". The builders of the Empire State Building also stumbled upon ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"". This law effectively made it illegal for any airship to dock or tie up to the building. Considering all these factors, attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was clearly neither safe, practical, nor legal, and thus was an endeavor that was bound to face insurmountable challenges."
1421	16254	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building had many formidable obstacles they had to face in order to fulfill the @ORGANIZATION1. Standing at a towering @NUM1 feet tall, the Empire State Building presented some unique problems. L¸sted stated, ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the Mooring Mast was nature itself. The winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The wind speed on the top of the Empire State building would be extremely terrible because the Dirigible's tail is basically weightless and it would move around violently. This violent movement could make the support beams give out, or could put people's lives in danger below. L¸sted said, ""But using these at the Empire State Building; where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the busy street is neither practical nor safe."" Another reason as to why the Mooring Mast could not be constructed is the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. L¸sted stated, ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to a building or even approach the area."" It is not legal for the Dirigible to even be in the vicinity of the building, which ultimately makes it impossible to achieve the intended docking."
1422	16255	6	3	"The future of transportation is a matter that any architect has discussed at one point. Whether reality is taken into account, that is another subject. Al Smith had the daunting challenge of turning the dream of docking dirigibles into a reality. Although Smith had high hopes for the project, many significant obstacles stood in the way of the construction of the dock. One problem is stated in paragraph fourteen, ""the greatest obstacle to a successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" Wind power was not thoroughly taken into account at the time, and neither was the fact that thousands of people in downtown New York would be put in danger. In conclusion, dirigibles soon became much more useless with the emergence of the airplane and soon faded away along with the dreams of the mooring mast. Another problem that stood in the way was a law stating that airships cannot fly too close to urban areas. This destroyed any plans of the mast because not only was it risky to build, but it was also illegal. What was once a glimpse of the future soon turned into nothing as @PERSON1 finally confronted the public in saying that the construction will be postponed. The future of transportation took a sharp blow, but with the new success of the airplane, anything seemed possible as the focus shifted to more practical and safer alternatives."
1423	16256	6	3	The Empire State Building was under construction and the building faced many obstacles. First, since they aimed to build the biggest structure in the world, the construction workers had to work extremely hard. The Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its original purpose for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed. These reasons likely included factors such as unforeseen engineering challenges and changing technological trends. Despite the initial grand vision, the building's intended function related to docking dirigibles could not be realized due to these insurmountable issues. In the end, the building still stands as an iconic landmark, but its original purpose had to be abandoned.
1424	16257	6	3	"Despite all the hope and high - anticipation surrounding the construction of the mooring mast atop the Empire State Building, the project was never destined to be a success. In ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, there are many significant obstacles described that the builders faced as they attempted to allow dirigibles to dock on the mast. The first major obstacle that the builders came upon was that when a dirigible was mounted onto the mooring, ""the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation"". This obstacle caused the need for an abundance of extra support on the frame to maintain the sturdiness of the building. The other, and arguably greatest obstacle that the builders faced were the rapid wind currents that surrounded the building. The winds caused serious problems for the dirigible because ""even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast"". This caused a major design flaw for the builders in the way that they would have to maintain control and ensure the safety of the dirigible as it was docked by the mooring. As much as the plan dwarfed others of its time, it was short - lived. The plan had far too many obstacles to overcome and today, it serves better as a memorable characteristic of the Empire State building, a reminder of an ambitious but unfeasible vision."
1425	16258	6	3	Obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were significant problems such as strong, unpredictable winds, a relatively weak structure, and public safety concerns. The strong winds would almost make it impossible to hold the dirigible steady at the top of the building. The wind's force could push the dirigible around, making docking a precarious task. Meanwhile, the weak structure would almost make it impossible to hold the dirigible safely at the top. The building might not be able to withstand the stress and weight of the dirigible during docking and while it was moored. With all of these hazards, it is completely unsafe for people to ride, dock, and board these massive dirigibles at the top of the Empire State Building. Therefore, the idea of using the building for dirigible docking had to be abandoned to ensure the well - being of everyone involved.
1426	16259	6	3	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were quite significant. The first obstacle was related to the building's structural integrity. It says the building's foundation will be under more stress with a thousand - foot dirigible docking. For example, ""A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame. The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" This means that the entire structure of the building would be affected, and it required careful consideration. The second obstacle pertained to safety. It says that it's really dangerous if dirigible - related incidents take place above the building. For example, ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" Additionally, it says the winds on the top of the building are so strong. For example, ""The winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" In conclusion, they still faced too many obstacles, so the idea which let the dirigibles dock on the top of the building is hardly likely to become true."
1427	16260	6	3	"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"", the author, Marcia Amidon L¸sted, is informative on the structural and natural obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building. One obstacle faced by the builders was involved with the structure of the building. The issue was that a moored dirigible, or blimp, would add a significant amount of stress to the building's frame. This stress could potentially compromise the long - term stability of the building. To fix this problem, the ""frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened."" This modification work would require careful engineering and additional resources. Another obstacle faced by the builders involved nature. The winds on top of the building were violent and often shifted directions. These unpredictable wind conditions made it extremely difficult for a dirigible to approach and moor safely. This hindered the ability of a dirigible to moor on top of the building and remained a persistent problem. The final obstacle faced was a restriction on the flight of airships over urban areas. This restriction was put in place for safety reasons, considering the potential risks to the densely populated areas below. This restriction made it impossible for dirigibles to moor on top of the Empire State Building. The excerpt explains the structural and natural obstacles faced by the builders, which ultimately made the idea of dirigible docking at the building a challenging one."
1428	16261	6	3	During the process of building the Empire State Building, the builders had to go through numerous obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on it. Some of these obstacles were changing the design of the building, thinking about the safety of people, and the material the dirigibles were made of. Since a thousand - foot dirigible that moored at the top of the building would add stress to the building's frame, the steel frame of the building would have to be modified and strengthened. This was no small task, as it involved detailed engineering and a significant amount of work. Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be spent. A dirigible was a steel - framed balloon with envelopes of cotton fabric filled with hydrogen and helium. This was a major safety issue; Most dirigibles used hydrogen, rather than helium, and hydrogen is very flammable. A German dirigible was destroyed by fire, and the owners of the Empire State Building realized how bad an accident like that could be over downtown New York. The potential for a large - scale fire in a populated area was a terrifying thought. During construction of the Empire State Building, builders had to go through many obstacles just to attempt to allow dirigible to dock there, and these challenges made the feasibility of the project quite low.
1429	16262	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. A thousand - foot dirigible at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would put a great deal of stress on the building's frame. This stress would not only affect the upper parts of the building but could also have a cascading effect on the entire structure. The steel frame of the building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. The modification process was complex and required precise engineering. Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework. These modifications included reinforcing key structural elements and ensuring that the building could withstand the additional forces exerted by the moored dirigible. These are the obstacles they had to overcome to make the dirigible - docking idea a possibility, but the challenges were substantial.
1430	16263	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced were related to attracting passengers on existing transatlantic routes and new routes that were yet to come. To attract passengers on existing transatlantic routes, they had to compete with well - established transportation options. These existing options had their own loyal customer bases and reputations. The builders needed to offer something unique and appealing about the dirigible docking at the Empire State Building, such as faster travel times or more luxurious amenities. For new routes, they faced the challenge of convincing potential passengers that these new routes were safe, reliable, and worth trying. There were also uncertainties about the demand for these new routes. Overall, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in relation to passengers on existing transatlantic routes and new routes were significant and required careful planning and marketing strategies to overcome.
1431	16264	6	3	There were numerous obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building encountered when attempting to enable dirigibles to dock there. Some relatively minor obstacles were related to the frame and strength of the building. The building's frame needed to withstand the additional forces exerted during the docking process. Other obstacles were major, such as nature, which is beyond human control. In paragraph nine, the author explains that if a thousand - foot dirigibles were to be moored to the top of the Empire State Building, it would impose extra stress on the building's frame. Moreover, with the wind pressure, the building's foundation would also be affected. In order to allow dirigibles to dock, the frame of the building would have to be carefully modified and significantly strengthened. Since nature has a great impact on the use of the mooring mast, it would be almost impossible for dirigibles to be tethered onto the building. As the author describes in paragraph fourteen, the wind would cause the dirigibles to swivel around the mooring mast. Other obstacles the builders faced were that most dirigibles from outside the U.S used hydrogen rather than helium, which is highly flammable. Most landing fields weighed down the back of the blimps, and having the weight dangle over pedestrians would be extremely unsafe. The last problem was that there was an existing law against airships flying low over urban areas. Though the builders of the Empire State building faced obstacles in allowing blimps to dock, it still became a well - known building in @LOCATION1, standing as an iconic structure despite the unfulfilled docking ambition.
1432	16265	6	3	Some of the significant obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced were that inside the dirigibles was hydrogen, a highly flammable gas. The builders were acutely aware of the potential risks and did not want to put any lives in danger or cause damage to the surrounding buildings. They realized that an accident involving a dirigible would be far more catastrophic if it took place in downtown New York, a densely populated area. The greatest obstacle was the wind on top of the building. The winds were constantly shifting due to complex air currents. Additionally, dirigibles would be dangling precariously over pedestrians on the streets below. The last reason is that there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made it illegal for them to tie the dirigible up to the building or even approach it closely. In the end, these obstacles effectively prevented the dirigibles from docking at the Empire State Building.
1433	16266	6	3	"When the architects behind the mooring Mast of the Empire State Building first started their work in designing it, they did not fully take into account the challenges that they would have to overcome to dock a dirigible. In the excerpt, it states that the mooring mast was not originally part of the design structure for the Empire State Building. However, the stresses it would cause in docking a dirigible ""would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" This implies that the builders would need to come up with a way to handle this issue when the building's construction was already underway. Other challenges included those related to safety. The excerpt tells that ""most dirigibles from outside the U.S. used hydrogen"" which is more flammable than helium. This, combined with the fact that there really was no reliable way of securing the tail of a dirigible moored at the mast, could lead to an accident similar to that of the Hindenburg over a ""densely populated area such as downtown New York."" These challenges ultimately made it very difficult to achieve the goal of dirigible docking at the Empire State Building."
1434	16267	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, it shows in some ways that there were significant obstacles that the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles or Blimps to dock there. One of those examples was found in paragraph @NUM1. It clearly stated ""The mooring mast of the empire State building was designed to never fulfill its purpose."" Another one was also in paragraph @NUM1 when they mentioned ""The greatest reason was one of safety: Most dirigibles from outside of the united States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. When the german dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by a fire in lakehurst, New, Jersey, the owners of the empire state building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York. Also in paragraph @NUM3, it says that nature was a major obstacle for the success of the mooring mast. The winds on the tops of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Another reason was because of existing laws that prohibited airships from flying too low over populated or urban areas. These obstacles collectively made it nearly impossible for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building."
1435	16268	6	3	"In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, there were important obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced for the dirigibles to dock and become stationary there. The dirigible was highly flammable, the structure was unsafe, there were laws in place, and the environmental conditions were not permitting for them to dock there. First, the dirigibles are highly flammable to have near a building that holds so much importance to its @CAPS1. ""Today these dirigibles are camo - fabric filled with hydrogen and helium to make them lighter in the air."" These dirigibles in the U.S only have hydrogen, which is the ultimate fire - starter. Second, the structure never passed the safety requirements for a human passenger to get on the structure and ride the blimp. The law states ""aircraft flying low to urban areas is @CAPS2."" This is a key reason why it never could happen. Third, the environmental conditions can never always be right twenty - four seven. The problem is ""winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This put lives in @CAPS5. These were the significant obstacles in the dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building, making the docking plan unfeasible."
1436	16269	6	3	"Builders of the Empire State Building, in their ambitious attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there, faced numerous formidable obstacles. A mooring mast, specifically designed for docking dirigibles, would impose significant stress on the building's frame. It couldn't simply be placed atop the Empire State Building. Instead, the building needed to undergo meticulous ""modifications and strengthening"" to handle this added load. Most dirigibles from outside the United States utilized hydrogen, a highly flammable gas. The building's owners were acutely aware that if an accident similar to the Hindenburg were to occur above a densely populated area like downtown New York, the consequences would be far more catastrophic. However, the builders' greatest challenge was nature itself. The winds atop the building were in a constant state of flux due to violent air - currents. Even if an airship managed to tether to the mast, the back of the ship would continuously swivel around the mooring mast. Additionally, an existing law prohibited airships from flying too low, meaning dirigibles could not legally moor at the Empire State Building. In the end, the mooring mast of the Empire State Building was indeed destined to never fulfill its intended purpose."
1437	16270	6	3	"In the excerpt, ""the mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced several significant obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. One major obstacle was the financial and structural burden. To build a docking facility for dirigibles, they had to invest over sixty thousand dollars in extensive modifications to the building's framework. This was a substantial cost and required careful planning and execution. Another crucial obstacle was safety. Dirigibles were not known for their high - safety standards as they used flammable materials. With the building located in an area surrounded by numerous other buildings and a large number of people, any accident involving a dirigible could have had disastrous consequences. These were some of the key obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in their endeavor to allow the docking of dirigibles, ultimately making the task extremely challenging."
1438	16271	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by author @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building faced some significant obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. A first obstacle the builders faced was the legitimate concern of the building collapsing over time under ""all the weight of the dirigibles."" They would have to allocate more money and invest a considerable amount of time to create a robust frame for the Empire State Building to support the dirigibles. As @CAPS1 @NUM1 supports, ""a thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building would add stress to the building's frame."" A second obstacle that the builders of the Empire State Building encountered in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock at the building was the safety concerns of the thousands of citizens just below the tall building. After the German dirigible caught fire in Jersey, they realized how serious the situation could become. ""Owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" These two obstacles presented major challenges to the builders of the Empire State Building and significantly hampered their plans for dirigible docking."
1439	16272	6	3	In the excerpt, The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many daunting obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of these crucial obstacles was stress. Yes, stress. When a thousand - foot dirigible is moored at the top of the Empire State Building, held only by a single cable tether, it places a tremendous amount of stress on the building's frame. This stress could potentially compromise the long - term structural integrity of the building. Another significant obstacle the builders faced was safety. Most dirigibles have been known to use hydrogen rather than helium. Although one might initially think hydrogen is a viable option, unfortunately, it is extremely flammable, posing a major fire hazard. With the building located in a busy and populated area, safety was definitely a major concern in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building. A final obstacle the builders faced was nature itself. The violent air currents constantly shifted the winds on the top of the building. As a result, even if the dirigible were successfully tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would keep swiveling around and around the mast in a never - ending cycle. There seemed to be no practical solution to this problem. These are the insurmountable obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, as described in the informative excerpt, The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted.
1440	16273	6	3	When the Empire State Building was faced with the prospect of creating @CAPS1, a dirigible docking station, they encountered many significant problems. The first @CAPS2 that the @CAPS3 encountered was the wind. The wind at an altitude of over a thousand feet is never going to be @CAPS4 calm. Once they managed to get the dirigible @CAPS5 close to the tower, there would be no feasible way they could keep it still enough to refuel and allow passengers to board or disembark from the dirigible. The second @CAPS2 they ran into was the flammability of helium. If somehow that helium @CAPS7 caught fire, it would be @CAPS8 a disaster in such a place as downtown New York, with its high population density and numerous buildings. The third and final reason is that it is illegal to have an aircraft flying at such a low altitude in a city. Given these insurmountable problems, there was no way this plan was going to work out. So, they had no choice but to stop moving forward on this @CAPS9 project.
1441	16274	6	3	"The @ORGANIZATION1 spire of the Empire State Building was originally built to be more than just a visually striking feature. The spire was actually designed as a mooring mast intended for docking dirigibles. Dirigibles, or blimps, were at that time thought to be the future of transportation. However, constructing the mast had many obstacles it had to overcome. Al Smith saw an opportunity to place the Empire State Building and all of New York at the forefront of modern travel. The mast would have to support and withstand the weight of a dirigible, so ""over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" The constant threat of wind also made the plans too dangerous. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Finally, most dirigibles were highly flammable and couldn't be safely docked without endangering the public. A disaster like that would have been much worse if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York. In the end, building a mooring mast on the Empire State Building presented numerous insurmountable obstacles."
1442	16275	6	3	"In the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered many significant obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. These issues mainly included safety concerns, challenges posed by nature, and an existing law. Safety was the greatest obstacle. These dirigibles ""used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" Given that the buildings in downtown New York stand so close together, one building such as the Empire State Building catching on fire could have truly devastating effects. The hardest problem to overcome would have been nature. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" It would have been nearly impossible to keep the back of a dirigible from swiveling around. Also, the dirigibles would be hanging high above cars and people on the streets below. The last reason the dirigibles should not be moored at the Empire State Building was because of a law that prohibited ""airships flying too low over urban areas."" This made the entire plan illegal. Although it was initially a seemingly good plan, it was not well - thought - out in the face of these obstacles."
1443	16276	6	3	The builders faced many complex problems trying to allow the dirigibles to dock. The biggest obstacle they had was the wind. At that high elevation, the wind was constantly shifting. If the dirigibles were tethered, the back would swivel uncontrollably. Another problem was that they could not weigh it down. Since it was elevated, if the dirigible was weighted down, it would fall, potentially causing great damage. These difficulties made the docking process extremely challenging. In conclusion, those are some of the major obstacles the builders faced in their attempt to enable dirigible docking.
1444	16277	6	3	"There were many significant obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the mooring mast. One obstacle they faced was the lack of a suitable landing area. They would have to carefully design a mast specifically for the dirigibles. Another obstacle was that the dirigibles were held by a single cable tether, and that would add considerable stress to the building's frame. Next, New York City would have to spend over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications that had to be made to the building's framework. Then the greatest concern of safety came upon them. That was, most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium. And hydrogen is highly flammable. On @DATE1, a German dirigible ""Hindenburg"" was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey. The owners of the Empire State Building realized if that happened in New York, it would cause a huge problem. The final and greatest obstacle they faced to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. Due to all the violent wind and air currents, it would be very hard to tether the dirigibles to the mast. In conclusion, those were the numerous and challenging obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to land there."
1445	16278	6	3	"There were several major and complex obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One such problem was that, ""the stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have been transmitted all the way to the building's foundation..."". It cost over @MONEY1 to make the necessary modifications to handle this. Also, the, ""roof had to be completed before the framing of the mooring mast could take place."" Moreover, they did not solve several other obstacles. Foreign dirigibles normally ""used hydrogen rather than helium..."" And this would cause vast damage if they crashed in ""a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" In addition, being so high, the dirigible could not be weighted down in the back and thus would swivel around the mast erratically. There was also a law prohibiting ""airships flying too low over urban areas."" In the end, there were too many insurmountable obstacles, so the dirigible docking plan was ultimately scrapped."
1446	16279	6	3	There were many obstacles that the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. One of the significant obstacles was dealing with the hydrogen from dirigibles outside of the United States. The hydrogen was extremely flammable, and a fire in such a highly populated area like New York would be catastrophic. Another major obstacle was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast. The unpredictable winds from nature would make it extremely difficult to control the dirigible, causing people to be afraid of the dirigible crashing into the building. These were some of the insurmountable obstacles that were faced, ultimately making dirigible docking at the Empire State Building unfeasible.
1447	16280	6	3	There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Since the German dirigible the Hindenburg was tragically destroyed in New Jersey, it would have been even more dangerous over a densely populated area like New York where the Empire State building was located. The greatest obstacle to the success of the use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to strong air currents. Dirigibles would not be safe dangling high above pedestrians on the busy streets of New York. The major problem the architect faced was that dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State building because there was a strict law against airships flying too low over urban areas. Even though it seemed like a good and innovative idea at the time, it was neither practical nor safe to implement dirigible docking at the Empire State Building.
1448	16281	6	3	"Obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were not easy to overcome. Most dirigibles were massive, as indicated by this quote, and dealing with them was no easy task. ""Some dirigibles were as long as one thousand feet, the same length as four blocks in New York."" This quote clearly shows their massive size and proves how difficult it would be to control and land them safely. Another obstacle the workers had to face was modifying the already - set structure of the Empire State building, which also involved significant costs, as mentioned in this quote. ""The steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be carefully modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" This quote proves that the addition of the mooring mast would be not only tiring for the workers but also a large amount of money would be spent on what ultimately became a failed project. They managed to build their tall building, but were unable to achieve the goal of a functional mooring mast."
1449	16282	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. These unpredictable winds made it extremely difficult to safely maneuver and dock dirigibles. Also, the Empire State Building is located in an urban area, and there is an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law added another layer of complexity to the plan of allowing dirigibles to dock at the building. Considering these multiple and substantial obstacles, it became clear that the use of the mooring mast for dirigible docking at the Empire State Building was not a practical solution.
1450	16283	6	3	The builders were constructing about 1454 ft high above the surface, so safety is a crucial issue. Then a 785 ft dirigible would moor at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether. The weight of the dirigible would add significant stress to the building. Also, the wind pressure exerted on the moored dirigible would have to be transmitted 1454 ft below to the foundation. So, it's a situation that could affect the structural integrity of the building. The dirigible could catch on fire on top of downtown New York, hurting innocent people. And it's costing a lot of money, around $300,000. Taking all these factors into account, it was evident that the plan to allow dirigibles to dock at the building was not a viable one due to safety, structural, and financial concerns.
1451	16284	6	3	Allowing the dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building presented several notable obstacles. First, there was a distinct lack of a suitable landing area in bustling New York City. To address this issue, Al Smith came up with the idea of adding a mooring mast to the very top of the Empire State Building. This mast would enable the dirigibles to anchor securely there for several hours, facilitating essential activities such as refueling, service, and the embarkation and disembarkation of passengers. Another significant obstacle was the stress imposed on the building's frame. With a one - thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building by a single cable tether, the strain was substantial. To accommodate this situation, the steel frame of the Empire State Building had to be carefully strengthened and modified. Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications were necessary to reinforce the building's framework. The final and most formidable obstacle for the successful use of the mooring mast was nature. The winds at the building's peak were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Normally, lead weights were used to weight down dirigibles landed in open fields. However, having lead weights dangling high above the pedestrians on the busy streets of New York at the Empire State Building was extremely unsafe. Due to these insurmountable obstacles, the plan to use the Empire State Building as a dirigible docking site was ultimately abandoned.
1452	16285	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous challenges in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock thousands of feet above the bustling New York streets. One of the most prominent problems was the sheer size of the dirigibles, which could be as long as one - thousand feet. Such a large structure presented difficulties in terms of maneuvering and stability. Another significant problem they encountered was keeping the back of the ship from swiveling around the mooring mast. Typically, the backs of these blimp - like structures were anchored down by lead weights. However, having lead weights dangling high above the crowded streets was not only extremely risky but also highly impractical. Given these insurmountable challenges, the idea of having dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building was ultimately shelved.
1453	16286	6	3	There were numerous obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One major obstacle was the need for a mooring mast so that the dirigibles could anchor. However, they couldn't simply drop a mooring mast on the flat surface of the Empire State Building's roof. Doing so would put excessive stress on the building, and addressing this problem cost over sixty thousand dollars. Another crucial aspect was safety precautions. The dirigibles were mostly filled with highly flammable hydrogen. If a dirigible were to catch on fire, the entire Empire State Building, along with everyone inside, would be in grave danger of being destroyed. Moreover, strong, violent winds could blow and detach the dirigible, posing a significant threat to the pedestrians below. One other obstacle the builders faced was the existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. If they tried to anchor a dirigible on the Empire State Building, it would be a clear violation of the law. Due to all these insurmountable obstacles and the lack of positive results, the whole idea of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building has faded away.
1454	16287	6	3	"The architects, engineers, and workers, or the builders of the Empire State Building, encountered many hurdles when attempting to attach a dirigible dock to the top of the building. The first concerning encounter was that they ""could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building."" The engineers and architects had to carry out repairs worth a substantial amount of money to strengthen the building's framework. Mother nature also presented a significant problem. The constantly shifting winds at the building's peak would make it extremely difficult for the dirigibles to stay landed unless they were weighed down. However, weighing down the zeppelins also posed a threat as there was a risk of a weight falling and causing harm to an innocent person. Lastly, a law prohibited dirigibles from flying too low over a city. If a spike from another building were to hit and pop the balloon of the dirigible, it would result in an absolute disaster. Overall, the multitude of obstacles made it impossible for the idea of a dirigible dock on the Empire State Building to ever become a reality."
1455	16288	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Løsted, the builders faced quite a few problems. When it came to constructing the building, they had doubts about whether they could build it at all. They also had to contend with a harsh climate, which added to the complexity of the construction process. Additionally, they were concerned about the weight of the dirigibles and whether the building could support them. In paragraph fourteen, it mentions that ""Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights."" These are just a few of the many challenges that the workers had to face during this ambitious project. Given these difficulties, the task of making the building suitable for dirigible docking was fraught with uncertainty, and ultimately, the plan may not have been feasible."
1456	16289	6	3	The obstacles he had were that the problems were never truly resolved, and this unresolved situation had led to issues with the wind, which further complicated the overall scenario.
1457	16290	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous problems dealing with the mooring mast. First of all, I would say safety was the number one issue. If the dirigible were to catch on fire, it could land on the main streets of New York City, posing a serious hazard to hundreds of unsuspecting pedestrians going about their daily lives. Also, the weather was another factor. If it were too windy to fly all the time, then the mast would be a complete waste of resources. When I read that they had to spend <@NUM1</@CAPS1> to modify the building's framework, I started thinking of all the other useful things a town could do with @MONEY1, like improving local infrastructure. There was also an existing law that made it illegal for any airships to be even remotely close to the Empire State Building. Overall, the idea of the mooring mast was just a very poorly planned idea that lacked proper foresight.
1458	16291	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. One problem was the builders had to carefully fix the frame of the building in order to effectively transmit the stress of the dirigible to the bottom of the building. Another obstacle the builders faced was the builders had to finish constructing the roof before the framing of the mooring mast could take place. The builders of the Empire State Building also had to make sure that the mast's skeleton was made out of high - quality steel so that the mast looked like the rest of the Empire State Building and did not stick out, maintaining the building's overall aesthetic.
1459	16292	6	3	There were many problems and obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, such as nature itself. At @NUM1 ft., the winds were just too strong and highly unpredictable to safely get close to and dock a dirigible. On top of nature, laws prevented the landing. Airships could not fly low over urban areas, so even attempting to approach the area would be blatantly illegal. This idea still posed a great deal of potential danger even if there were no laws against it and wind didn't exist. Many dirigibles were made using hydrogen, which is highly flammable. In such a highly populated area as New York City, if one were to catch fire, the damage would be truly horrifying, affecting countless lives and properties. I hope Al Smith was willing to pay thousands of dollars for the title of world's tallest building because he didn't get his mast, and the attempt to have a docking facility was ultimately a failure.
1460	16293	6	3	"Constructing a building was hard, but attempting to build the world's tallest building was intense. The mast atop the Empire State Building caused many obstacles for the builders such as having to strengthen the framework of the whole building significantly. ""A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the Empire State building held by a single cable tether, would add a tremendous amount of stress to the building's framework."" The architects also wanted to make the mooring mast ornamental, or decorative. ""Rather than building a utilitarian mast without any ornamentation, the architects designed a shiny glass and chrome - nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from inside."" Additionally, the building had to have two extra floors added, one ""open observation platform"" and a ""boarding area for dirigible passengers."" Even though the mast was doomed to never fulfill its purpose, the building was still hailed as the world's tallest building, a remarkable feat in architecture despite the setbacks."
1461	16294	6	3	"In the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast,"" by @ORGANIZATION2, certain significant obstacles such as foundation support, the unpredictable nature, and strict safety regulations challenged the building of the docking station for dirigibles. The first major problem the architects faced was the docked dirigibles placing an excessive amount of stress on the building. To effectively combat this problem, extensive and drastic changes to the building's structure would have to be made. ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be carefully modified and significantly strengthened to accommodate this new and demanding situation."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1, @CAPS2 @NUM2) This substantial change was stated to cost over sixty thousand dollars. Another formidable obstacle the builders faced upon constructing the mooring mast was nature. At this great height, the wind currents are extremely violent and highly unpredictable. Despite being tethered to the building, the dirigibles would wildly spin and twist around the mast, which was an extremely unsecure and dangerous aspect. Lastly, as the excerpt claims the greatest reason for not being successful, the safety violations of the mast were far too great. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen... and hydrogen is highly flammable. When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire... the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident would have been...above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" (@CAPS1 @NUM3, @CAPS2 @NUM4) The mooring mast provided a severe risk to the safety of the people of New York. This problem served as a serious and insurmountable issue, thus serving as a major obstacle for the builders of the mooring mast. The building's foundations, the forces of nature, and the safety violations all served as significant problems for the builders creating the mooring mast, ultimately making the project unfeasible."
1462	16295	6	3	The builders of the Empire State building faced numerous and complex obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the building. Dirigibles are enormous, steel - framed balloons filled with a combination of hydrogen and helium, which are skillfully maneuvered by the use of propellers and rudders. Al Smith, with a grand vision, wanted to add a mooring mast to the top of the building that would let dirigibles anchor for several hours for refueling or necessary service. But, the stress of the dirigible's heavy load and the intense wind pressure would have to be transferred all the way to the building's foundation. This required over @MONEY1 worth of meticulous modifications to be made to the framework. On May 6, 1937, when the Hindenburg was tragically destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, the builders realized how catastrophically disastrous it would have been if such an incident had taken place above the densely populated area of downtown New York. The winds at the top of the building would constantly and erratically shift due to the harsh and violent air currents, and the back of the ship would constantly swing around in a dangerous manner. Also, the existing strict law against airships flying too low over cities and urban areas would make it legally impossible for dirigibles to moor at the Empire State Building. All in all, the builders of the Empire State Building faced a multitude of insurmountable obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the building, making the plan unworkable.
1463	16296	6	3	"In the excerpt, The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, some significant obstacles the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there are that the winds were extremely strong and most dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium, which is very flammable. The way that the dirigibles would dock to the building was by a sturdy cord firmly attached to the mast. The dirigibles would then be precariously ""dangling high above unsuspecting pedestrians in the street."" (@NUM1). This was clearly ""neither practical nor safe"" (@NUM1) as it would not only endanger the pedestrians below but also the people on the dirigibles. The wind was so powerful that it could easily throw the dirigible into a nearby building. Most dirigibles fuel on hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is much more flammable. ""The German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by a massive fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey."" (@NUM3) The owners of the Empire State building saw this as another huge and insurmountable problem because of how much worse it would be if one caught fire in the densely populated area of New York. Considering all these factors, it became evident that allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was an unfeasible and dangerous idea."
1464	16297	6	3	"The Empire State Building during its construction was being carefully planned to serve as a mast, in which dirigibles could be securely attached to. The builders of the building did not fully realize the severity of the numerous obstacles preventing them from safely accomplishing this ambitious feat. Most of the problems presented, for the most part, were concerning safety. Due to these serious safety issues, the mast was considered an unprofitable and risky idea, and posed far too much of a danger. There were simply too many possible and likely opportunities for something to go terribly wrong. One of these critical issues was that dirigibles contain dangerous flammable gases, that if something went awry, a flaming dirigible coming down on downtown New York City would cause major and widespread damage. Another significant obstacle preventing this idea from becoming reality was that the dirigible tethered to the mast would be ""constantly and violently shifting due to the strong and unpredictable air currents (para @NUM1). Another reason why it couldn't be done ""was an existing strict law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (para @NUM2). All of the problems that could not be plausibly solved were the reason why the mast was an unrealistic and unworkable concept."
1465	16298	6	3	"In The mooring mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the reason for the tall spire was revealed as a mooring mast for zeppelins to land. There were many difficult challenges faced by the builders of the Empire state building in an attempt for zeppelins to actually land there. One major difficulty was the stress added by the weight of the dirigible. ""Over @NUM1 $ of painstaking work was done to the foundation. This was difficult because it can be imagined that adding that much heavy steel to a beautiful and architecturally significant building couldn't be an easy task. Another difficult addition involved ""the mast... would have a conical head which would house a mooring arm."" Think about how difficult it is to take an ornate @NUM2 - foot spire @NUM3 feet to the top; it's not easy at all. Last, ""the winds at the top were constantly and violently shifting due to the strong air currents."" This means all the hard - working framing workers went through a great deal of hardship to make the building. Considering all these challenges, it's clear that the attempt to make the Empire State Building a landing place for zeppelins was fraught with difficulties and ultimately unfeasible."
1466	16299	6	3	"There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One significant obstacle was how much stress would be put on the building's frame. As L¸sted says, ""A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building's frame. The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven feet below. The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be carefully modified and substantially strengthened to accommodate this new situation. If the Empire State Building was going to make this happen, they would have to make precise changes to the frame of it. This was a top obstacle to overcome. Also, an important obstacle they would have to face was people's safety. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. If they were to make this happen, there would always be the lurking risk of someone catching on fire. Making the Empire State Building a dock would have many obstacles to overcome if they wanted to make this a reality, and these challenges made the feasibility of the project quite questionable."
1467	16300	6	3	Many obstacles faced the builders of the Empire State Building. The biggest problem is the fact that it was strictly illegal for a dirigible to fly that low in urban areas, as clearly stated in paragraph @NUM1. Another serious problem was that most of the @ORGANIZATION2's dirigibles used hydrogen, which is extremely flammable. So, if what happened to the Hindenburg happened at the Empire State Building, then the accident would have been much worse. Especially with people constantly walking the streets below, as described in paragraph @NUM2. Another challenging problem was nature. The winds were ferociously strong at the top of the building and were always shifting unpredictably. So, if a dirigible was docked to the mast and the lead weights that keep the dirigible from floating away, like anchors, would be dangling precariously over pedestrians, ready to fall in an instant, as stated in paragraph @NUM3. Also, fears of the sharp edges and forceful winds would cause the dirigible to get punctured and pop, making the entire docking idea extremely risky and difficult to execute.
1468	16301	6	3	"During the @DATE1's, dirigibles were being hailed as the transportation of the future. Dirigibles had a top speed of eighty miles per hour, and they could cruise at about seventy miles per hour for thousands of miles. The main obstacle that the dirigibles would face in landing in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. Another obstacle the architects and Empire State Building builders faced was designing a mast that could allow the dirigible to dock to the building, and also allow people to safely get in and out of the vehicle. Architects knew that they couldn't simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. ""An A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add significant stress to the building's frame."" So, architects had to carefully reconstruct the building's foundation to strengthen the structure of the building. The greatest obstacle that the Empire State Building builders faced was nature itself. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The violent air currents at the top of the Empire State Building would make it extremely dangerous and unsafe for dirigibles to dock with the building, ultimately making the plan a very challenging one to implement."
1469	16302	6	3	"In this excerpt, Al Smith had many obstacles to overcome when he wanted dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. The smallest obstacle was building the top so dirigibles could moor at the building. ""The top would have cost over @ORGANIZATION1 for the needed modifications on the framework"". Another obstacle faced was the fact that there was an existing law in place @CAPS1 this. ""The other practical reason dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against low - flying airships."" The issue of safety was a tricky and crucial obstacle. ""Most dirigibles from outside the @LOCATION1 used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is very @CAPS2. The greatest obstacle was nature. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" In this excerpt, the obstacles for Al Smith and his team were too great and they could not overcome them, meaning the plan to have dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building had to be abandoned."
1470	16303	6	3	"On December 11, 1929, Al Smith, the four - term governor of New York, announced that the Empire State Building would reach the height of 1,250 feet. At the time it would be the world's tallest building, but the builders faced numerous obstacles with the more distinctive part; allowing dirigibles to dock there. First, it would be quite difficult to build a suitable landing area. As described in paragraph @NUM1 of the excerpt, a dirigible held by a single cable would add a considerable amount of stress to the building's frame. Therefore, the steel frame would have to be carefully modified and strengthened so that the added stress would be safely transmitted all the way down to the building's foundation. Also, safety is a huge and non - negotiable issue. In paragraph @NUM2, it stated that ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" The builders came to realize that if one of the dirigibles were to catch fire, like the German Hindenburg in New Jersey, it would cause huge problems due to the fact that New York is densely populated. Lastly, nature itself is an obstacle for the builders. The winds on top of the building are constantly shifting due to violent air currents. As described in paragraph @NUM3, the back of the ship would swivel around and the lead weights would be a real danger for the pedestrians down below. Overall, the construction of the mast was difficult, and unfortunately, it was never to be used as originally intended, making the dream of dirigible docking at the Empire State Building unfeasible."
1471	16304	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first problem, according to the excerpt, is that ""A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add significant stress to the frame."" They would need to spend over @MONEY1, a substantial amount of funds, in order to modify the building's framework. Another issue, of course, was the safety of the mast. Most of the zeppelins from places besides the U.S. did not use helium. Instead, those dirigibles used hydrogen which is highly flammable and would have caused a major disaster if ignited above a densely populated area such as downtown New York. The excerpt also states that, ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building are constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" Moreover, there was already a law in place preventing airships from flying too low over urban areas. Therefore, it would be illegal for a blimp to attach to or even go near the Empire State Building. For the reasons stated, builders were ultimately not able to build a mooring mast atop the Empire State Building, making it unfeasible for dirigibles to dock there."
1472	16305	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many problems in trying to allow dirigibles to dock at the top. As @CAPS1 mentions, ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" This presented a significant challenge, and @CAPS2 indicates that the designers had to find a proper way for the dirigible to dock at the top of the building. Even if they did find a way for it to dock though, ""a thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add considerable stress to the building's frame."" This set the builders back again because even if they did find a way to dock the dirigible, the Empire State Building would need ""over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications,"" which was a large financial burden. Even though such modifications were possible, there ""was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" The builders faced many obstacles that set them back, but they made a valiant attempt to see their dream of dirigibles docking at the building come true. However, due to these multiple challenges, their efforts were ultimately hindered."
1473	16306	6	3	There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One example is that by adding the dirigible, it would add substantial stress to the building. The frame of the Empire State Building would have to be changed due to the considerable pressure that would be put on the building. All of the changes that would have to be made, including structural reinforcements, would add up to over sixty thousand dollars, a significant expense. Now, there would also be 102 floors. The top floor would be designed as the boarding area as well as an observation area, which required careful planning. One more thing they had done for the mooring masts was raise an American flag on top, perhaps for symbolic or navigational purposes. All of these accommodations were made in the hope of helping dirigibles dock on top of the Empire State Building. Unfortunately, the high cost and other potential issues made it difficult to realize this goal.
1474	16307	6	3	"The designers of the Empire State Building faced many challenges in the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock on its peak. ""The greatest reason was safety"" (para @NUM1). The dirigibles were extremely dangerous. Strong winds could blow them in different, unpredictable directions, possibly hitting the building with great force. And if there was a crash, the debris would rain upon New York City, endangering the lives and property of the people below. Since there was wind, they would have to use lead weights to hold a dirigible in place. However, above the city this would be ""neither practical nor safe"" (para @NUM2) as the weights could pose a danger if they were to fall. Finally, there was a law prohibiting airships from flying low over urban areas. This would cause the docking to be illegal. For these reasons, the builders of the Empire State Building faced insurmountable challenges in allowing blimps, or dirigibles, to dock on the building, and their plans had to be abandoned."
1475	16308	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. An example would be from the excerpt when the author writes in paragraph 6 ""The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of suitable landing area."" This quote means the builders were faced with the challenge of limited space to land the dirigibles because New York City was a relatively crowded area with numerous buildings and infrastructure. Another example would be in paragraph @NUM1, when the author tells about the safety hazards. Many dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium, which is extremely flammable. A small spark could lead to a massive explosion, endangering the building and the people in the vicinity. A last example would be in paragraph @NUM2 when the author describes the safety hazards. The builders had to consider the violent winds on the top of the building, which could make it very difficult to control the dirigible during docking. Many obstacles came upon the builders, making it very difficult to achieve the goal of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building."
1476	16309	6	3	There were numerous obstacles for the builders of the mast aiming to enable dirigibles to dock, such as laws, nature, and overlooked details. Laws presented an obstacle due to the safety risks associated with having a dirigible over a densely - populated area, like the tragic Hindenburg accident which served as a stark reminder. Nature was also a significant problem as the strong and violent winds at the top of the mast would cause the ship to become unsteady. The last obstacle was that the mast builders failed to fully consider all the other obstacles and safety risks, which ultimately hindered the successful docking of dirigibles.
1477	16310	6	3	The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was fated to never achieve its intended purpose, for reasons that should have been obvious even before its construction. The most crucial reason was related to safety. Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen. Hydrogen is highly flammable, and after the well - known Hindenburg disaster, the authorities of the Empire State Building realized how much more catastrophic the accident could have been if it had occurred above a densely populated area like downtown New York. This realization made it clear that allowing dirigibles to dock at the mast was too risky.
1478	16311	6	3	"There are many challenges the builders of the Empire State Building encountered while trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. One major obstacle the builders had to deal with was that they needed to make ""over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications to the building's framework."" These modifications were essential to ensure the building could support the docking of dirigibles. Another obstacle the builders faced was meeting with the president of an airship transport company and formulating a plan to offer dirigible service across the Pacific Ocean. These are just two of the numerous obstacles the builders had to overcome during the construction of the Empire State Building."
1479	16312	6	3	Some of the difficulties the builders of the Empire State Building faced when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there include the need to modify and strengthen the steel frame of the building to adapt to this new situation. Specifically, over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be carried out on the building's framework. Another hindrance was that there was an existing law against airships flying too low over suburban areas, which prohibited dirigibles from mooring at the Empire State Building. The most significant obstacle, however, was the violent air currents. These strong air currents would cause the back of the ship to swivel around the mooring mast, making docking extremely difficult and dangerous. In conclusion, these multiple obstacles made it nearly impossible for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
1480	16313	6	3	I believe the main problem the builders faced was ensuring that people could safely disembark from the dirigibles and reach the actual building. They had to design a reliable and secure way for passengers to transfer from the moving airship to the stationary structure. Additionally, they also needed to take precautions to prevent the blimp from bursting into flames if it came too close to or crashed into the Empire State Building. This required careful planning and the implementation of safety measures to avoid any potential disasters. Overall, these safety - related issues were the key concerns for the builders.
1481	16314	6	3	"Based on ""The Mooring Mast"", the builders encountered several significant obstacles when attempting to enable dirigibles to dock there. First of all, they couldn't simply place a mast atop the building because it would exert excessive pressure on the building's frame. This extra pressure would then be transmitted all the way down to the building's foundation, which was 11 hundred feet below the mast. So, before they could start building anything, they had to reinforce the entire structure of the Empire State Building. After a series of efforts, finally, these obstacles were successfully fixed. These were the main challenges the builders had to overcome to make the dirigible docking possible."
1482	16315	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there are as follows. They specifically chose dirigibles instead of balloons because the fabric used in dirigibles is lighter, which is more suitable for docking operations. Second, a major concern was the extended use in New York City. There was a lack of a suitable landing area, and they also had to carefully consider the safety of passengers when getting on or getting off the dirigibles. Overall, these were the key obstacles that the builders needed to address for the successful docking of dirigibles.
1483	16316	6	3	The first obstacle that the builders of the Empire State Building faced was the lack of a proper and suitable landing area. This made it difficult to safely dock the dirigibles. The second obstacle was that the architects could not simply install a mooring mast on the top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. The structure needed to be carefully planned to ensure stability. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, which posed a significant threat to the docking process. In conclusion, these obstacles presented a tough challenge for the builders in enabling dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
1484	16317	6	3	The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow the dirigibles to dock were very difficult. One major difficulty was related to the mooring mast and nature itself. When the dirigibles would approach the building, the winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. The only way they could moor the dirigibles was by weighting down the back. However, using this method at the Empire State Building was neither practical nor safe, especially with pedestrians below. Another obstacle that the builders had to deal with was an existing law. The law prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. Since it was a government - regulated matter, they didn't have many options to overcome this. These are just some of the significant obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in their attempt to allow the dirigibles to dock.
1485	16318	6	3	In the 1920s, dirigibles were widely considered to be the future of transportation. Although they were useful, dirigibles had a major issue: there was not enough landing area in New York City. With this in mind, Al Smith saw an opportunity for his Empire State Building. He planned to construct a mooring mast on the top of the building. This would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours, refuel, and also enable passengers to get on and off. Adding a mooring mast seemed like a fool - proof plan at the time, but this new construction plan faced many obstacles. The first obstacle was figuring out how to add a mooring mast without adding excessive stress to the building's frame. Architects found that the stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. This led to the second obstacle, which was modifying and strengthening the steel frame of the Empire State Building to address the first obstacle. Finally, the third obstacle was the expense. Modifying the building's new framework would cost over sixty thousand dollars. Consequently, Al Smith saw a great opportunity for the Empire State Building, but he was faced with numerous and challenging obstacles that needed to be overcome.
1486	16319	6	3	"In the excerpt @ORGANIZATION2, written by @ORGANIZATION1, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered numerous obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. As stated, ""one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of suitable landing areas."" (paragraph 6). If dirigibles couldn't land properly, it could lead to destruction and pose a great danger to the people below. In paragraph @NUM1, Al Smith says, ""It's on level all right, no kidding, we're working on the thing right now."" His way of speaking makes his words seem almost unreliable to the readers. When devising the plan for dirigibles, a mooring mast had to be added to the top of the building to enable passengers to board and disembark. However, this idea was fraught with safety risks. ""Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe."" (paragraph @NUM2). It's puzzling why they would consider building something that could be harmful to others. In the excerpt The Mooring Mast written by @ORGANIZATION1, the builders struggled greatly in constructing the dirigibles. In the end, it became clear that their efforts to make dirigible docking at the Empire State Building a reality were fraught with insurmountable challenges."
1487	16320	6	3	"There were many significant obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. The most influential of these obstacles was nature. According to the passage, ""the winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting."" This ever - changing wind condition would make it extremely difficult for dirigibles to dock in the first place. Even if they managed to dock, the back of the dirigibles would shift and float around erratically. The only potential solution to this problem would be to add weights to the back of the dirigibles. But having these weights floating high above the heads of pedestrians ""was neither practical nor safe."" Another huge obstacle in the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock was the law. At that time, there was a strict law against any kind of aircraft flying ""too low over urban areas."" As the passage clearly clarifies, ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to even tie up to the building or even approach the area."" Due to these insurmountable obstacles, the mooring mast idea was ultimately dropped, highlighting the reality that safety and legal compliance had to take precedence over ambitious plans."
1488	16321	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced a multitude of obstacles in their attempted endeavor to allow dirigibles to dock there. As stated, ""The architect could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" A thousand - foot dirigible tethered by a single cable would impose an excessive amount of stress on the building's frame. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation. If not, the Empire State Building might fall over."" For the Empire State Building to bear the extra load, the architect would have to carefully modify and strengthen the building's existing framework. Additionally, the ornate mast would be extremely difficult to raise on top of the Empire State Building because of the high winds. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" If the dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the dirigible would swivel around and around the mooring mast. In such a scenario, the dirigible would likely crash into the Empire State Building or other nearby buildings, which would be extremely dangerous for the people on the street. Usually, dirigibles land in open fields where they can be weighted down in the back with a lead weight. But on top of the Empire State Building, having dangling weights above pedestrians was neither practical nor safe. Also, laws were passed restricting a dirigible from getting too close to a building. In conclusion, these various challenges made it impossible for the builders to achieve their goal of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building."
1489	16322	6	3	In the excerpt Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced a plethora of obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. One significant obstacle was that many substantial modifications had to be made to the building's framework. The dirigible's load and wind pressure would have to be effectively transmitted to the building's foundation to ensure stability. Another major reason the builders faced numerous obstacles is that most dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium. This would be extremely dangerous in the event of a fire, especially in a highly populated area like the vicinity of the Empire State Building. Additionally, due to violent air currents, the back of a dirigible would swivel around the mooring mast. As it says on page @NUM1, paragraph @NUM2, the dirigible would dangle above pedestrians on the street, which is clearly not practical or safe. Lastly, there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for dirigibles to tie up to the building or even approach it. In conclusion, the builders of the Empire State Building faced a multitude of insurmountable obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there, and these challenges ultimately made the plan unfeasible.
1490	16323	6	3	"The builders encountered many problems when attempting to build a dirigible dock on the Empire State Building, and these problems ranged from legal, to structural, to logistical issues. Firstly, there was a strict law in place which restricted airships from ""flying too low over urban areas,"" as clearly explained in paragraph @NUM1. This legal constraint immediately put a roadblock in the builders' path. In addition to this legal problem, the builders also faced the significant structural problem of putting a mooring mast on top of a skyscraper like the Empire State Building. According to the article, the stress of the dirigible load along with wind pressure would have to be transmitted over eleven hundred feet to the foundation. Because of this added weight, over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications were made to the building, as cited in paragraph @NUM2. Also, the logistics of docking a dirigible at such a high altitude were quite challenging. In fact, half of the attempted dirigible landings at the Empire State Building were aborted due to high winds. Although a dirigible landing mast would have put the Empire State Building on the forefront of modern travel, it could not be done due to the combination of legal, structural, and logistical problems. These challenges made it clear that the plan to build a dirigible dock at the Empire State Building was not a viable option."
1491	16324	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple obstructions in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on top of the structure. If a thousand - foot dirigible tried to land on the building's summit, it ""would add stress to the building's frame"" (paragraph @NUM1). As a result, the building would then have to undergo modifications to meet these structural demands. Nature also posed a significant obstacle. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (paragraph @NUM2). In such conditions, if the dirigible attempted to land, the back of it would swivel around the landing zone, creating an unsafe environment. Finally, the government also put a stop to dirigibles docking on the building. There was, ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (paragraph @NUM3). These three main reasons effectively prevented dirigibles from landing on top of the Empire State Building."
1492	16325	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced @NUM1 major obstacles during the process of planning for dirigibles to dock there. One major problem was the use of hydrogen in the dirigibles. Hydrogen is highly flammable, and considering the building is located in a highly populated area, any accident could have catastrophic consequences. Another problem was related to laws. Aircrafts aren't allowed to fly too low over urban areas, which directly affected the feasibility of dirigibles docking on the building. Also, the strong winds at that height made it nearly impossible for dirigibles to land safely. Many problems were indeed faced in the endeavor of making the Empire State Building a docking site for dirigibles.
1493	16326	6	3	They had a good idea to construct that building, but the problems were consistently significant. The tasks of formulating a plan and creating a design were extremely difficult. Crafting a viable plan required in - depth research and careful consideration of various factors, while the design had to meet both aesthetic and structural requirements. All these challenges made it an arduous process to build that building.
1494	16327	6	3	Many obstacles were encountered by the workers in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. At first, they were confident that they knew what they were doing, but they soon realized they were wrong. The workers' first obstacle was to ensure that docking at the Empire State Building was safe. Since the building was located above a large number of civilians, if the dirigible ever dropped, the result would be extremely serious, potentially causing numerous casualties and property damage. The second obstacle was the wind pressure. It would have caused an unreliable support of the mast, which would disrupt the docking process of the dirigible. Finally, the nature of the dirigible itself was a recipe for disaster. In the section “The Fate of The Mast,” it is stated that the dirigible is powered by hydrogen, which is extremely flammable. This fact alone indicates that it is not safe for the environment. By far, many obstacles hindered the process of setting up the mast. And docking was an even more complex idea. Many obstacles got in the way of the builders in their attempt to make dirigibles dock there.
1495	16328	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. They had to endure being up in the air for long periods of time, which exposed them to harsh weather conditions and potential safety risks. They also had to face the challenge of docking the dirigible on top of the roof while still ensuring their own safety. This required precise maneuvers and a high level of skill, as any mistake could lead to serious accidents. In the end, these numerous obstacles made the task of enabling dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building a very difficult one.
1496	16329	6	3	To the Empire State Building, it indeed had a flat roof. However, they couldn't simply place the mooring mast on top of the roof because it would impose additional stress on the building's frame. Constructing a mooring mast would cost more than sixty thousand dollars. Building such a mast wouldn't be easy as the wind on top of the Empire State Building would constantly change its direction. As a result, the dirigibles would be swirling around. Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights. But using these weights on the Empire State Building, where they would dangle high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe. Moreover, there was a law stating that aircraft should not fly too low over urban areas. All these factors show that for dirigibles to land on top of the Empire State Building had numerous insurmountable obstacles.
1497	16330	6	3	"In the article ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the various obstacles that builders faced when constructing a mast for dirigibles to dock there are detailed. One significant obstacle that the builders encountered was the issue of how to attach the mast. The architects couldn't simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add substantial stress to the building's frame. Another major obstacle was the accumulated cost of the revisions due to the first problem. Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework. Due to these insurmountable obstacles, the mast was never used for its intended purpose."
1498	16331	6	3	The construction of the mast was initially conceived as a good idea. However, the people involved in its construction never truly realized the inherent dangers of the whole concept. Although they should have been aware, they failed to recognize that since the ship was attached to the mast in one area, on a windy day, the ship was bound to swing around because of the lack of proper weight distribution. The builders also had to keep in mind that as the idea was grand, they needed to execute it perfectly. They had to understand that many other builders would likely attempt this concept in the future, so they had to set a good example. Otherwise, other builders would face major problems, and people would be put in danger. The builders and the men involved thought about using weights to balance off the weight of the ship. They needed to find a safe way to accomplish this, but unfortunately, they were unable to do so. If they had gone through with it, a single accident could have led to the death of many people. The Dirigible was a great idea in theory, but they should have thoroughly thought out the ideas before proceeding with its construction.
1499	16332	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION1, the builders faced a multitude of problems. One problem they had was that the ""dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation"" (@CAPS3. @NUM1). As a result, the builders had to modify and strengthen the building to accommodate the new situation. The dirigible was so big that they couldn't even anchor the back of it to the roof. The builders had a tough time trying to figure out how the dirigibles would land because the wind was constantly changing. With the wind being so unpredictable, the pilot could not even control the dirigible. The builders had to spend another sixty thousand dollars on it because of the necessary modifications. Al Smith was the one who came up with this idea. Then he realized it wouldn't work. Eventually, the builders finished constructing it, but the dirigibles could not dock there."
1500	16333	6	3	"Many obstacles faced the builders of the Empire State Building in their attempts to dock dirigibles or zeppelins. First and foremost, a mooring mast would have to be added to the building. However, according to @ORGANIZATION2, ""over sixty thousand dollar's worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework"" before a dirigible could be moored to the mast. Secondly, outside of the United States, most dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen gas, rather than helium, as clearly shown in @ORGANIZATION2 @NUM1. The owners became aware that it would be extremely dangerous to have a dirigible moored over downtown New York, especially after the German ""Hindenburg"" ""was destroyed by fire in @LOCATION1."" (@ORGANIZATION2 @NUM1). In accordance with @ORGANIZATION2 @NUM3, ""the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" Violent winds, caused by air currents at the top of the building, would cause a moored dirigible to swivel. Using lead weights to counter this would be extremely dangerous over such a densely populated area. The U.S. Navy dirigible Los @CAPS1 could not even dock in December 1930 due to the strong winds. Lastly, an existing law that prevented airships from flying too low over urban areas made it illegal for a ship to tie up to the mast anyway. (p @NUM4). All these obstacles combined made it nearly impossible for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building."
1501	16334	6	3	"In the story ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1, the ambitious builders of the Empire State Building encountered a significant obstacle when attempting to construct a dock for dirigibles. One of the major problems they faced was the absence of a suitable landing area. As stated in paragraph six, this limited landing area would only permit dirigibles to anchor there for a mere several hours. Additionally, they came to realize that most dirigibles arriving from outside the country utilized hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is far more highly flammable, posing a substantial safety risk. In paragraph thirteen, it was noted that an accident involving a hydrogen - filled dirigible could have had far more catastrophic consequences if it had occurred above a densely populated area like downtown New York. These issues ultimately made the construction of a functional dirigible dock at the Empire State Building extremely challenging."
1502	16335	6	3	"The @CAPS1 encountered numerous obstacles during the construction of the Empire State Building and while attempting to allow dirigibles to @CAPS2 there. One prominent obstacle was related to the expanded use of dirigibles in New York City. As clearly stated on page @NUM1, paragraph 6, ""The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area."" This shortage of an appropriate landing space severely hindered the regular docking of dirigibles. Another significant obstacle was nature itself, which affected the use of the mooring mast. As also mentioned on pg @NUM2, paragraph @NUM3, ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was Nature itself."" Weather conditions were yet another major hurdle. For example, on page @NUM4, paragraph @NUM5, it was reported that ""The @ORGANIZATION2 dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of the forceful winds."" These are @NUM2 conclusive examples of the numerous obstacles faced in allowing dirigibles to @CAPS2 near the Empire State Building, highlighting the complexity of the endeavor."
1503	16336	6	3	"There were numerous obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building had to confront when trying to enable dirigibles to dock there. A couple of these significant obstacles were, first, the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure. This situation arose because, as described, ""the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" This means that the forces would have to be transferred through nearly eleven hundred feet below the surface, which presented a huge engineering challenge. Another major obstacle was the realization that ""the mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose."" The reasons for this were quite evident; these issues should have been apparent even before the building was ever constructed. These are just a few of the many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building had to face during this ambitious project."
1504	16337	6	3	The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced were numerous and revolved around safety and money - related issues. Successfully docking a dirigible at the building would mean incurring additional costs of over @MONEY1. This extra expenditure was required to make necessary arrangements to the building, such as strengthening structures to handle the dirigible's load and ensuring proper docking mechanisms. Moreover, there were a multitude of safety problems. The gas carried by the dirigible was a major concern as it was often highly flammable. There was also the danger to the people below in the city in case of an accident. Additionally, it was against the law for airships to be flying at such low altitudes. These combined safety and financial issues made it extremely difficult for the builders to achieve the goal of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
1505	16338	6	3	"The Empire State Building faced considerable hardships while attempting to dock dirigibles. The determined builders made efforts to construct a docking station for the dirigibles. However, the primary problem they encountered was the challenge of safely docking at thousands of feet in the air. As noted, ""The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area."" This shortage of an appropriate landing space made it difficult to dock dirigibles regularly. The strong winds in New York also added to the difficulty of landing. Another crucial reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was the laws regarding airships flying too low over urban areas. Not only was it illegal, but it also posed a significant safety risk. Most dirigibles from outside the United States were constructed using a highly flammable gas called hydrogen. A tragic incident occurred when a German dirigible was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey. The owners of the Empire State Building quickly realized how much worse the situation could have been if such an accident had taken place in a highly populated area like New York. These multiple factors ultimately made it unfeasible to establish a successful dirigible - docking system at the Empire State Building."
1506	16339	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to dock dirigibles at their building were that foreign dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen over helium, the winds at the top of the building violently changed, and it was illegal to fly too low over urban areas. First of all, foreign blimps using hydrogen are extremely dangerous as there's a high risk that they will burst into flames. This realization only struck the builders when a German blimp, the Hindenburg, caught on fire on May 6, 1937. After this tragic event, they ""realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" If the incident happened over New York City, numerous more lives would have been lost. A larger number of casualties would occur, which would cause an even bigger fiasco. Also, the winds above the building change constantly, which would make the blimp highly unstable. The article explains this effect by stating, ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" The changing winds would severely affect the back of the ship. The front would be secured due to its tethering, but the back would be left free to sway and swing wildly in the wind. Pedestrians below would be at a very high risk of danger, making this idea completely impractical. Finally, the law made it illegal to even approach the building, let alone dock on it. The article tells this by saying, ""... an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas... Would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area..."" The builders simply could not use the dock unless the law changed. The law was made to protect pedestrians and innocent bystanders, and flying the craft to the Empire State Building would violate said law. In conclusion, the three major obstacles stopping the use of the Empire State Building for dirigible docking were the hydrogen gas used in foreign blimps, the unpredictable winds making the craft swivel, and the law prohibiting aircrafts from flying too low over urban areas, which collectively made the plan unfeasible."
1507	16340	6	3	Although the mooring mast due to hoist at the top of the Empire State Building was a well - thought - out plan, it provided some significant obstacles for builders. The biggest problem was safety. Most dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is an extremely highly flammable product. If an accident, such as a fire, occurred at the Empire State mooring mast, it wouldn't be safe to take place around millions of people in a large city like New York City. Another factor affecting the building was nature. The winds above were constantly shifting due to air currents. The only way to tie down the dirigibles would be to use weights, but that would also be extremely unsafe to have heavy weights hanging above a city full of people. The last issue was an existing law that prevented airships from flying too low in urban areas. This law makes it illegal for ships to even attempt to tie to the building, therefore it made it nearly impossible for builders to make the mooring mast functional. In conclusion, these safety, natural, and legal obstacles combined made it very difficult, if not impossible, for the builders to achieve the goal of using the Empire State Building for dirigible docking.
1508	16341	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1, the builders of the Empire State Building were faced with some substantial obstacles. One crucial obstacle was that they had to make sure that the Dirigibles could dock safely at the top of the building. They needed to ensure that the docking process was smooth and without any major risks. They also had to be certain that the passengers could get off and on the dirigibles safely. This involved creating proper access points and ensuring the stability of the craft during boarding and disembarking. Lastly, they had to be sure the building would not collapse when they made the mooring mast. The additional weight and forces exerted by the dirigible and the mast had to be carefully calculated and accounted for in the building's structure. These examples clearly show that the builders were faced with many challenging obstacles when building the Empire State Building with the intention of dirigible docking."
1509	16342	6	3	The building wasn't originally designed to carry the extra weight of having a dirigible attach to the top. This lack of proper design meant that there could be structural issues when a dirigible was docked. And the dirigibles had to have weights drop from the back to keep it in place. Having lead weights dangle over @NUM1 feet in the air wouldn't be very safe at all. There was a risk that the weights could fall, endangering people and property below. The mast was built out of glass, which could have been extremely dangerous if a dirigible couldn't stop and went straight into the tower. A collision could shatter the glass, sending sharp shards flying. Also, the electronic winching stations didn't seem like they would work very well. Their inefficiency could lead to problems during the docking and undocking processes. In conclusion, these design flaws, safety risks, and equipment inefficiencies made the plan of using the Empire State Building for dirigible docking highly unworkable.
1510	16343	6	3	"The idea of the Empire State building being used to dock dirigibles may seem quite ridiculous now, but upon its construction, this was the original purpose of the mast at the very top. Of course, there are several valid reasons as to why this plan didn't come to fruition. First of all, there was ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"", which would make it completely impossible to tie a dirigible to a building legally. Any attempt to do so would result in a violation of the law. Also, the high - powered air currents atop the building would cause a docked dirigible to sway uncontrollably. This constant swaying would not only be a nuisance but also a significant safety hazard. Finally, many non - U.S. dirigibles used hydrogen to fly instead of helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable, and if a dirigible were to explode like the Hindenburg over the city, it would be incredibly dangerous for civilians. These reasons give strong credibility to the idea that the Empire State Building would not make a safe dirigible docking bay, and thus the plan was ultimately abandoned."
1511	16344	6	3	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced were a law that prohibited airships from flying low over urban areas. Another problem they encountered was when the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but couldn't get close enough to tie up due to forceful winds. The powerful wind would blow the dirigible towards the sharp spires. The first obstacle the builders had faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock was an ""existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"". This law made it illegal for a ship to ever fly up to the building. The second reason why the builders faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock was that in 1930, the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but couldn't get close enough to tie up because of the forceful winds. These are the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in their attempt to allow docking."
1512	16345	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. Al Smith, the four - term governor of New York who headed the efforts to construct the Empire State Building, was determined to outstrip the height of the Chrysler Building. The architect building the Chrysler Building had a clever trick; he built a 185 - foot spire and hoisted it to the top. Al Smith's team was determined to outstrip the height by placing a mooring mast at the top of the building. However, the architects couldn't simply place a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. The winds would constantly shift the mast. Using such a setup high above the pedestrians on the street was neither practical nor safe. Additionally, dirigibles couldn't dock at the Empire State Building due to a law against airships flying too low over urban areas, which made it illegal for ships to ever tie up to the building. In conclusion, the builders of the Empire State Building faced significant obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there.
1513	16346	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building encountered several obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock at the mooring mast on top of the building. The main problem was that foreign dirigibles typically use hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is extremely flammable, and if, hypothetically, a dirigible caught fire, it would pose a great threat to the highly populated New York City. In the event of a dirigible explosion, the people of New York would not have enough time to escape the blast. Another major problem was the winds. Strong winds could easily blow the dirigible off its course or, even worse, into a spire on top of a building, puncturing it. This issue was discovered when the U.S. Navy dirigible ""Los Angeles"" was attempting to reach the mooring mast, and the captain couldn't get anywhere near it. These obstacles and dangers clearly suggest that the mooring mast was a bad idea, which the constructors later came to realize."
1514	16347	6	3	The Empire State Building faced challenges in its attempt to build the highest building in New York. The builders were ambitious and wanted the building to be extremely large. They had been working on the project for many years, which added to the complexity. There were likely difficulties in terms of engineering, financing, and dealing with the ever - changing construction regulations. Despite these challenges, they persevered in their goal to create a record - breaking structure. In the end, their efforts led to the construction of an iconic building, but the journey was filled with obstacles due to their lofty ambitions and long - term work on the project.
1515	16348	6	3	"In the article ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there are detailed. One set of engineers in New York was trying to figure out a practical and workable arrangement, while government people in Washington were considering a safe way of mooring airships to this mast. The architects couldn't simply place a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add a significant amount of stress to the building's frames. The stress from the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. As a result, the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. In fact, over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework to address these issues."
1516	16349	6	3	Based on the excerpt, there are three reasons why there were obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. These reasons were, first, it was too close to the city and not high - up enough. The proximity to the city meant there were many structures and air traffic that could interfere with the docking process, and its relatively short height compared to what was ideal for a safe dirigible docking added to the problem. The second reason is because the wind spun the blimp around the mast. The strong and unpredictable winds at that location made it extremely difficult to keep the blimp stable during docking. And the third reason is because German blimps were filled with hydrogen, which is highly flammable. If the blimp was next to a heat source, it would blow up. In contrast, @LOCATION1 blimps were filled with helium, which is much safer. Due to these multiple issues, allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building proved to be an unfeasible plan.
1517	16350	6	3	"During the construction of the Empire State Building's dirigible dock, there were three major obstacles: the wind, the structure, and the safety. The wind was the most obvious flaw in the landing dock because of the rough wind currents at the top of the building. These wind currents were not only strong but also highly variable, making the docking process extremely challenging. Landing perfectly on the dock was one thing, but staying there was impossible because you would have been whipped around. ""[@ORGANIZATION2 dirigible Los Angeles] feared that the wind would blow the dirigible on to the sharp spires of other buildings of the area, which would puncture the shell."" (paragraph @NUM1) The problem of structuring the mast to hold the balloon would also become a structural obstacle because ""[they] couldn't simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof"" (paragraph @NUM2). The flat roof did not provide a stable base for the mast. To get the structure sound enough to land a dirigible, they would have to do sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications to the framework. Lastly, landing a huge metal balloon on top of the largest skyscraper, over millions of city - dwellers, even when they knew the balloons were highly flammable, was one of the reasons the mooring mast didn't work out. Although there were two attempts of landing, neither succeeded, and now the mast is there only for decoration, a reminder of an ambitious but ultimately unworkable plan."
1518	16351	6	3	"The builders and the architects faced many issues in making this project of extending the Empire State Building to 1,250 feet height. Though they planned their steps into making the mooring mast on top, it was unrealistic. It was unrealistic because this was never done before on top of a building. There was no prior experience or established methods to rely on. Another obstacle they faced was the safety of the passengers and in general, because most dirigibles outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, which was highly flammable. A small spark could lead to a catastrophic explosion. Another obstacle they faced was with the weather, because landing a dirigible on top of the building with fast winds due to the violent air currents was also dangerous for the people on the dirigibles and could've possibly hit other buildings by swiveling around in the air from the winds. The last obstacle the builders faced was that their project was illegal, against the federal law because the dirigibles would be flying too close to urban areas such as New York City. So, therefore, it was impossible to accomplish, as shown in paragraph @NUM1. In this paragraph, it states ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed."" This shows proof of the project's incapability to be built, highlighting the many challenges that made the plan unviable."
1519	16352	6	3	"Ultimately, it is evident that the entire concept of Al @ORGANIZATION1 on the Empire State building was strategically flawed. It was Al Smith's dream, but a dream is not always reality. In theory, the Mooring @ORGANIZATION3 would be constructed to dock dirigibles. However, it was eventually revealed that a docking station on the Empire State building would never be possible. The reason Al Smith's dream could never prove to be reality is because Smith and the builders hit many obstacles. One obstacle faced with the construction of the @ORGANIZATION3 was the location. When a landing zone is 1,250 ft above ground level, it is extremely tough to test and complete a perfect landing zone. The process of testing and ensuring a safe landing was much more complicated compared to if it was on ground level. Also, with location comes the safety issue of having such high wind speeds at such an altitude. It is true that the higher the altitude, the higher the air pressure and the ""violent air currents"" (@CAPS2 @NUM1) @CAPS1 will have, making a very unsafe environment. Next, another aspect of the location was the fact it was in densely populated New York City. If there were any mistakes, a great number of casualties would be expected. Lastly, a large obstacle Smith and the builders faced was technology. In the @DATE1's and 1930's, the amount of technology and engineering was certainly unparallel to the technology prevalent in today's society. Due to these combined factors, Al Smith's dream of a dirigible docking station on the Empire State Building could not become a reality."
1520	16353	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there is that Al Smith constructed an 185 - foot spire inside the building to make it taller. By the @DATE1's, the new airships called dirigibles were hailed as transportation for the future. They were like blimps but were filled with hydrogen and helium to make them lighter. In New York City, they had a lack of suitable landing areas for dirigibles. Al Smith added a mooring mast to the top of the building so they could tie the line from in front of the ship. However, the construction of the spire and the addition of the mooring mast did not solve all the problems. The height and location of the building, along with the nature of the dirigibles themselves, presented many challenges. The high - altitude winds and the flammability of hydrogen made the docking process extremely risky. Despite the good intentions of providing a landing area, allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building remained a difficult and ultimately unachievable goal.
1521	16354	6	3	The operators of the Empire State building faced many obstacles when they attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was that there was a law stating that airships couldn't fly too low over cities, which clearly meant they couldn't dock at the Empire State building. Another obstacle was that foreign blimps used hydrogen instead of helium to fly, and hydrogen is extremely flammable, so using hydrogen blimps in New York City would create significant public safety issues. Finally, nature would prove to be the greatest obstacle because of strong wind, which could get quite violent and cause the blimps to possibly get untied from the building or fall. In conclusion, there were many obstacles that the operators of the Empire State building faced when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there.
1522	16355	6	3	The workers faced many obstacles in the arduous process of building the mooring mast. The first reason was because of the High Winds. The strong winds blew the dirigibles back - and - forth. It would be catastrophic if an accident occurred as the large dirigibles could cause great damage in such a situation. Secondly, The Law stood in the way of this idea. A law in New York was passed, that strictly prevented dirigibles from flying over urban areas. The reasoning behind the law was because of a serious german dirigible accident in New Jersey that raised public safety concerns. Lastly, and probably the simplest, There was no clear way to land! The landing gear had not been invented yet, so it was far too risky to even attempt landing. In conclusion, this idea was way ahead of its time, which is both good and bad in most ways as it showed ambition but lacked the necessary practical elements.
1523	16356	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles. Al Smith realized that he was close to losing the title of the world's tallest building. The one major obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. A mooring mast was added to the top of the building which would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling. Dirigibles were docked by means of an electric winch. The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add significant stress to the building's frame. The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be carefully modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in back with lead weights. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area, although two dirigibles did attempt to reach the building before the entire idea was dropped. Fearing that the wind would blow the dirigible onto the building, the whole plan became unfeasible. In conclusion, the many obstacles faced by the builders made the use of the mooring mast for dirigibles an impractical idea.
1524	16357	6	3	"The dream of the aviation pioneers of docking their dirigibles on the Empire State Building, created numerous obstacles for the builders to face. The mooring mast of the building ""was destined to never fulfill its purpose,"" the author implying that the building should not have been built, because of all these obvious obstacles. One obstacle they faced was the violent winds on top of the building, due to strong air currents. It was extremely difficult for the dirigibles to dock. The ""four - blocks"" length blimp, filled with helium and hydrogen, would be dangling high above the busy streets, which was not safe for the millions of people on the streets below. In December 1930, the dirigible Los Angeles could not get close enough to the mooring mast because of forceful winds. Another obstacle the builders faced was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The Columbia blimp tried to deliver bundles of newspapers to the building, ending up with papers dangling on the rope from the blimp, because the dirigible mooring equipment was never installed. Therefore it was ""desirable to postpone to a later date that the final installation of the landing gear"" that gave airplanes the title of ""transportation of the future."" In conclusion, the combination of natural and legal obstacles made the dream of dirigible docking on the Empire State Building an unachievable one at that time."
1525	16358	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building came upon some problems when putting in the dock for dirigibles. First, the sheer height of the building makes catching the dirigibles extremely dangerous because of the tower's structure. If the dirigible was to crash, it would be falling onto a big city's crowded streets, endangering countless lives. Finally, most dirigibles were filled with hydrogen and that is highly flammable. A single spark could lead to a massive explosion. That is why the mooring mast was dangerous and ultimately made the plan of using it for dirigibles unviable. In conclusion, these problems made it clear that the dock for dirigibles in the Empire State Building was not a practical addition.
1526	16359	6	3	The Mooring Mast has two obstacles, namely, the winds on top of the building are constantly shifting due to violent air currents. These erratic winds make it extremely challenging for dirigibles to approach and dock. The other reason dirigibles could not moor at the location is the law against airship flying too low over urban area. This law restricts their movement and access. They try to get close but they can't because of forceful winds. In nineteen thirty, the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring but could not get close. So they established a law for the security of an urban area to regulate airship activities and ensure public safety.
1527	16360	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, there were many obstacles the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle is that ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This highly flammable hydrogen could be a big threat to the nearby pedestrians, as a single spark could lead to a catastrophic explosion. Furthermore, an additional obstacle is ""nature itself"". The winds are constantly changing which is dangerous for the dirigibles, making it difficult to control their movement and stability. One last example of an obstacle is ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This would be dangerous if the dirigible lost control and harmed a pedestrian. These are, indeed, some examples in the article of how there were many obstacles the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, ultimately limiting the feasibility of such a docking facility."
1528	16361	6	3	"Builders in The Mooring Mast project by the construction company face many obstacles when working to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. In order to ensure safety and eliminate problems involving the stress load and pressure of the dirigible on the building, the building would need ""to be modified and strengthened to accommodate"" the blimps, and these modifications would cost up to sixty thousand dollars, which was a significant financial burden. Many of the blimps were filled with hydrogen, an extremely flammable substance that could put the building and the City of New York in great danger if a dirigible was to blow up, endangering countless lives and causing extensive damage. Because winds ""on the top of the building are constantly shifting due to violent air currents,"" there was difficulty controlling dirigibles and keeping blimps still to keep passengers safe, as the unpredictable winds made docking operations extremely hazardous. There was also a law against the height of airships in urban areas. Using the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building would result in breaking the law since the Mast was too low. These difficult obstacles proved too difficult to overcome, as the mast is not seriously used by dirigibles, and the idea of regular dirigible docking at the Empire State Building was ultimately abandoned."
1529	16362	6	3	It was very difficult for the builders of the Empire State Building to allow dirigibles to dock there. They had to face many obstacles along the way. One obstacle was that they kept trying to make the building higher. Al Smith, a competitive four - term governor, was very competitive with the architect who was constructing the Chrysler Building which was also in New York City. Smith wanted the Empire State Building to be larger, and by extending it, it became more dangerous and difficult to allow docks up there, as the increased height made it harder to manage the docking process and added more stress to the structure. Another obstacle was the weather at the top of the building. The winds at that height were very rigorous and with a highly populated area below, they did not want an accident to occur, as a dirigible accident could cause great harm to the people on the ground. Allowing docks up on the Empire State Building was very dangerous, and these challenges made it nearly impossible to implement a successful dirigible docking system.
1530	16363	6	3	"New York is said to be, ""the city that never sleeps."" The people of New York are always awake, rushing about in the streets, going about their daily lives, working, and socializing. When four - term governor, Al Smith, wanted to put up a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building, these people of New York had many concerns. Along with the people who were constructing the building, they were worried about the potential impacts. These concerns consisted of laws, safety, and construction. If a mooring mast was built, a law they'd have to worry about would be flying airships too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up the building or even come close to the area, restricting the functionality of the proposed mast. Another major worry was safety. These dirigibles contained highly flammable hydrogen. If a dirigible had caught fire above New York City, the damage could be tragic, destroying buildings and endangering lives. The construction of the mast was out of the question because they never had planned on making it prior to starting the project, and adding it later would require significant re - engineering and resources. Overall, the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building was never really destined to have been created. Too many factors and obstacles were in the way after the idea of creating the mooring mast began, and thus, the project was not pursued further."
1531	16364	6	3	"The builders faced many significant obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. They specifically had to find a practical way to keep the dirigibles from spinning around the top of the tall tower. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This real - world situation meant the dirigibles would swivel around the mast unless firmly tied down. The next problem or obstacle was making the building's structure strong enough to withstand the tension caused by the dirigibles. ""Over sixty thousand dollars worth of detailed modifications had to be made to the building's framework. The next challenge was to create a safe environment for the pedestrians below. That was not possible because the city infrastructure was already built below. The dirigibles ""would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, which was neither practical nor safe. Clearly, the builders faced numerous obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the building, and these issues made the plan quite unfeasible."
1532	16365	6	3	The builders, faced with the complex task of constructing a structure for a particular purpose, encountered a series of difficulties. They were met with challenges related to design, materials, and the surrounding environment. These problems required careful consideration and innovative solutions. In the end, despite the hardships, they persevered to achieve their construction goal.
1533	16366	6	3	Al Smith and his dedicated workers went through quite a bit while working on this building. As a specific example, while building it, they had to precisely transmit the stress of the dirigibles' load all the way to the building's foundation, which was around eleven hundred feet below. After that, they would have to carefully modify and strengthen the frame of the building to properly accommodate the new situation. The greatest obstacle throughout the whole process, though, was nature itself. Due to violent air currents, the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting in an unpredictable manner. Safety was a major obstacle Smith had to face while building this building. Smith initially thought a dirigible would be okay to use on the building, but little did he know how dangerous using one could be. Due to the fact that most dirigibles from outside the @LOCATION1 used hydrogen rather than helium, using hydrogen meant they were highly flammable, posing a serious threat to the entire project. In conclusion, these challenges made the construction a very difficult and risky endeavor.
1534	16367	6	3	"In the novel, the builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous difficulties in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Because in the novel it said, ""A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add significant stress to the building's frame."" This quote clearly indicated that the dirigible would add stress to the building and increase the risk of collapsing. The building's structure was not originally designed to handle such additional forces, and this oversight led to a precarious situation. In the end, it was evident that allowing dirigibles to dock was a flawed concept in the context of the building's design."
1535	16368	6	3	They faced many problems when trying to dock dirigibles there. It should never have been made in the first place. Too many things were predictable. They had no proper landing gear, which was a major drawback. The wind was too great a factor, constantly blowing in unpredictable directions. And the ships couldn't get close enough to the mast to dock. The people creating this docking facility overlooked the possibility of it not working and only focused on building it. They had no landing gears at all, so it was extremely hard to steady the dirigibles and dock them. The wind was so unpredictable that it swung the balloon - like dirigibles around. The biggest thing was when they slowed it down and had no wind assistance, it still couldn't get close enough to dock. Those are the major problems they faced, and these issues clearly show that the plan to dock dirigibles was ill - conceived.
1536	16369	6	3	"There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building had to face in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The dirigible's substantial weight was held by a single cable tether, and the force from this weight ""had to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation,"" which was located far below the rooftop. If the cable tether were to ever break unexpectedly, passengers in the dirigible and civilians of New York would be in grave danger. This cable tether would be too risky to use on a regular basis. The builders could not possibly overcome nature and its ""violent air currents"" that occurred at the top of the building. These strong air currents would cause docking to potentially be too time - consuming and extremely dangerous. The builders and architects tried to reverse this obstacle by weighing down ""the back with lead weights."" However, this was ""neither practical nor safe,"" because of the potential danger of the weights falling and hitting New York pedestrians. In the end, the builders and architects of this grand project had to grapple with many gargantuan obstacles, which ultimately made it unfeasible to dock dirigibles at the Empire State Building."
1537	16370	6	3	Some of the obstacles the builders went through was that they had to make many significant changes. For instance, they could not just simply drop a mast on top of the building's flat roof. The blimp, when attached, would place stress on the building as it was held by a single cable. The blimp's heavy load and the pressure from the strong wind would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's deep - seated foundation. The building's frame (@CAPS1) would have to be strengthened to accommodate this new and demanding situation. This strengthening process would cost over sixty thousand dollars for the new framework. In conclusion, these obstacles made the task of adding a mooring mast a very challenging one for the builders.
1538	16371	6	3	Creating a mooring mast to sit atop the Empire State Building that would function and allow dirigibles to dock there was an incredibly challenging task for those who built the Empire State Building. Because the building was not originally designed to support the extra weight and the large size of a mooring mast, architects had to painstakingly work to redesign the frame of the whole building. The architects carefully modified plans to strengthen the steel frame of the building enough so that it could handle the added stress of a mooring mast. While builders were able to fix this problem through their hard work, many obstacles remained that could not be avoided. One of these was the great danger of attempting to control a dirigible. Dirigibles were often inflated with highly flammable hydrogen, and having these hydrogen - filled dirigibles near the Empire State Building would threaten the safety of the numerous citizens of the highly populated New York City. Also, dirigibles were traditionally weighed down with lead while docked to keep the blimp from floating around in the wind. This could not be done on the Empire State Building because it would mean lead bricks would be constantly dangling over the busy pedestrians below. Besides all these practical obstacles, it was against the law for aircrafts to fly over urban areas, and that was the final obstacle that kept the mooring mast from being used. In the end, despite the efforts, the mooring mast could not be utilized due to these insurmountable issues.
1539	16372	6	3	"There were many obstacles in the process of building the mooring mast. The designers had to think their way around them carefully. It was easily known that you couldn't just go up to the top of the building and start construction haphazardly. There were accommodations to be made. The excerpt describes, ""The stress of the dirigible's heavy load and the strong wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation..."" (@CAPS1). Just adding the mast on would upset the building's delicate structure and foundation. Safety was a major concern. People realized it was a bad idea to have something as highly flammable as the dirigible in such a populated area. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium..."" (@CAPS1). After recent fires involving hydrogen - filled dirigibles, it was clearly noticed how dangerous this idea was. Control was also an issue in the city; rather than an open field. ""... the back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast"" (@CAPS1). That wasn't going to ""fly"" with most people, as it would be almost impossible to keep it stable (@CAPS4) for people loading. In conclusion, designers faced a lot of problems in constructing the mooring mast, and in this case, the mooring mast just wasn't meant to be built successfully."
1540	16373	6	3	"The Empire State Building was destined to reach new limits that had never been met or even thought of in the world of architecture. As described in ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION1, the determined efforts in building a mast not only set the Empire State Building as the tallest building, at @NUM1 ft., but also aimed to make it serve a useful purpose. This was a radical dream supported with intuitive design and high - reaching goals. Unfortunately, the reality in successfully completing this far - reaching destination was slim as problems gradually arose. The largest obstacle was ""... one of safety: most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is flammable."" This, along with the fact that violent air currents at such great heights required that lead weights be used to weigh the dirigible down to prevent extreme movement, served as serious caution for the safety of the highly populated New York City surrounding the Empire State Building. As the practicality in the hopeful mooring mast diminished, it became... ""desirable to post to a later date the final installation of the landing gear."" Eventually, the use of the mooring mast ""quietly disappeared"", thus concluding the radical dreams that were once associated with it."
1541	16374	6	3	Al Smith had a clear and ambitious vision; to create a site for modern travel. Smith faced numerous obstacles and persisted with unwavering hard efforts in an attempt to bring his vision to life. The stress of a thousand - foot dirigible would have been far too much pressure for the original framework of the Empire State Building. Over @MONEY1 worth of meticulous changes had to be made to strengthen the building's framework. In addition, the builders had designed a mast that would be rocket - shaped, made with high - quality aluminum, which could accommodate the mooring arm, and the control machinery would be neatly placed in the shaft; housing elevators and stairs for passengers on the dirigible. Another obstacle they had to face was the lack of floors that would serve as a proper boarding area for the passengers. They had begun to build additional floors with a well - designed glassed - in observation area and a spacious boarding area. Although the mooring mast for the dirigibles was ultimately a fiasco, Al Smith and many dedicated architects tried to make all the modifications they could to fulfill Smith's vision for what he thought was the Empire State Building's destiny, but in the end, the challenges proved insurmountable.
1542	16375	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many significant obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there according to the excerpt The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted. First, they had to make the mooring mast safe for passengers to board on and off. The Architects had a team of experienced engineers and other experts working on it. Another obstacle the Architects had to work with was putting the mooring mast up on the building. So, then they had to add over sixty thousand dollars' worth of enhancements to the framework of the building so that it would be sturdy enough for the mooring mast. Once the mooring mast was set up and they ""celebrated framing the entire building,"" just another problem occurred. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" The winds were constantly shifting and caused the dirigible to swivel around the mooring mast in an unpredictable manner. Finally, they fixed all of their problems for this building to be in use, then the biggest obstacle occurred. Dirigibles became illegal and airplanes became the new preferred mode of transportation. The builders of the Empire State building had just too many obstacles and unfortunately failed in their attempt to make the dirigible docking a success."
1543	16376	6	3	As the builder's dream for the Empire State building grew larger, so did the modifications they needed to make. To begin, they needed to conduct in - depth research and engineer a safe and practical way for the dirigible to dock. This was soon achieved with the valuable help of navy and government research. The next struggle was the structure of the building. Adding a mast with the added weight of the dirigibles and an engine room at the top of the skyscraper would significantly affect the frame. In order for the building to be structurally sound, the frame was carefully modified to withstand the added stress. Even with extensive research and well - thought - out modifications, the docking system was never put in place. The strong and shifting winds above the Empire State Building would not allow for a blimp to actually dock safely, and so the idea was soon reluctantly let go. Safety and wind were the two challenges that the builders could not overcome, and thus the dream of a functional dirigible docking at the Empire State Building faded away.
1544	16377	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in the course of bringing Al Smith's plans to life. One of them was that ""air ships flying too low over urban areas"" is illegal. If breaking the law wasn't a large enough obstacle, then the issue of New York citizen's safety also came into play. Most dirigibles were dangerous due to their high flammability. So one wrong move could have killed many ""if it had [exploded] above a densely populated area."" Another huge obstacle that came into play was the lightness of the dirigibles, which would allow its rear to ""swivel around and around the mooring mast."" The only way to stop that would, again, put the citizens in danger. In the end, these multiple and insurmountable obstacles made it impossible for the builders to realize Al Smith's plans for the Empire State Building and dirigible docking."
1545	16378	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced were that they had to make it extremely strong. Also, they had to be sure that the dirigibles wouldn't destroy the building when it landed. They also had to be very careful that the dirigibles would not crash into the building when it was dropping off the papers. Another obstacle for the workers was that the dirigibles would not be able to land easily due to various factors like wind and the building's height. Finally, they would have to make sure that everything was in place and working properly, from the mooring mechanisms to the safety features. Despite their best efforts, these numerous obstacles made it a very difficult task to achieve the goal of smooth dirigible operations at the Empire State Building.
1546	16379	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles in the attempt to allow blimps to dock on the building. The engineers realized from the start that even if they could get a blimp docked, it would put additional stress on the building's structure. To address this, they had to meticulously reinforce the entire building, ensuring that it could withstand the extra load. In addition to this, the docking of a blimp was dangerous in itself. It could easily be destroyed, just like the tragic fate of the Hindenburg. Due to these significant challenges, the plan to allow blimps to dock on the building ultimately faced insurmountable hurdles.
1547	16380	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles especially with the construction of the mooring mast due to the considerable height of the building. First, due to the alleged, projected height of the mast, there were serious concerns on how to evenly distribute the dirigible's weight. The unique structure of the dirigible and the fact that it was lighter than air were crucial aspects to understand. Taking this into account, the builders had to carefully figure out how to have the whole building support the dirigible's weight and not just the top mast. Had the dirigible been supported by only the mast itself, the dirigible's weight would probably have pulled the mast right out of the building. Another obstacle the builders faced was the delicate nature of the mooring mast. The mast was not made in a practical business - like fashion, but more of an extravagant manner, with much of it made out of glass because of numerous windows. This made the mast's installation a lot more difficult because they had to closely monitor the mast's installation from all areas. In the end, the builders' efforts to make the Empire State Building acceptable for dirigible docking were fraught with these complex challenges.
1548	16381	6	3	"When faced with the prospect of building the tallest building in the world, Al Smith refused to give up. In order to achieve his goal, he decided to build a Dirigible docking mast atop his new creation. But with this genius idea came obstacle after obstacle, preventing the idea from ever taking flight. One obstacle faced by Al Smith, and by far the greatest, was safety. Most non - American Dirigibles used hydrogen within their Dirigibles, which is highly flammable. The owners of the Empire State Building realized how catastrophic it would have been if a fiery explosion happened ""above a densely populated area such as downtown New York"". Another great obstacle was nature itself. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". This made it nearly impossible for the Dirigible to be tethered without the back of the ship swirling around the mooring mast. As a result, these obstacles effectively halted the plan for Dirigible docking on the building."
1549	16382	6	3	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were safety issues, nature itself, and the law. Safety was a big issue when it came to dirigibles docking over populated areas such as New York City. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used Hydrogen rather than helium, and Hydrogen is highly flammable."" After a serious accident in New Jersey, the owners of the Empire State Building realized this accident would have been much worse if it occurred in New York City. Nature causes lots of obstacles in life, like the strong wind which made it very difficult to dock a large dirigible. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around."" They would be dangling high above people, which would pose a significant safety risk. There is a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building."" Two dirigibles attempted to reach the building before the law was dropped. Safety, nature, and the law kept Al @CAPS1's dream from coming true. These obstacles effectively prevented the builders from successfully allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building."
1550	16383	6	3	"The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. When they tried to build it, there was not enough space, so they attempted to force it, but that action @CAPS1 messed everything up. ""A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, without stress to the building's frame"" was an unrealistic scenario. At times, when they tried to add things, it only made the building heavier and more likely to fall. They tried to add more elements just to make it look better, but what they didn't know is that it was only going to make the structure more unstable and prone to collapse. In the end, their hasty and ill - considered attempts to install the mooring mast led to a situation where the plan faced major setbacks."
1551	16384	6	3	The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, which made it extremely difficult to safely moor an airship. Additionally, there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas, which further complicated the use of the mooring mast for airship docking. In the end, these factors combined to make the mooring mast an impractical solution for airship operations.
1552	16385	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many significant obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted shares some of the specific obstacles that were dealt with when trying to make it possible for blimps to land atop the Empire State Building. L¸sted discusses the obstacles of nature, safety, laws, and construction in ""The Mooring Mast"". Nature presented a huge setback in terms of docking dirigibles. As L¸sted writes, ""even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast"", making it very unstable. The safety of docking blimps on the Empire State Building also became a major issue. ""The owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse ""an accident could be if it happened above downtown New York, instead of in a field. The laws in effect at the time made it illegal for airships to fly too low over urban areas. This law made docking a dirigible impossible in New York City. The construction alone of accommodating a mooring mast required ""over @NUM1 dollars worth of extensive modifications"" and a great deal of time and careful planning. As L¸sted says, ""The mooring mast of The Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose"". The obstacles presented in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building were too great and too many. The laws, safety concerns, construction challenges, and the forces of nature at the time were too big a setback for this endeavor, ultimately preventing the successful implementation of dirigible docking at the Empire State Building."
1553	16386	6	3	There are a few significant obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One major obstacle would be the building of the mooring mast to be added to the top of the building. Although it was initially a good and innovative idea, it was very complicated in terms of engineering and construction. Another reason consists of law @CAPS1. There was an existing strict law against airships flying too low over urban areas. New York is definitely not the ideal city for this idea just because there is a large number of people walking around the @CAPS2 and there are many tall buildings around, which increases the risk. This idea of docking dirigibles on the Empire State Building would gradually come to be over with the invention of airplanes. As airplanes became more popular and practical, the idea @CAPS4 slowly disappeared, as it was no longer a feasible or necessary option.
1554	16387	6	3	Al Smith's idea of making the Empire State Building bigger was a very difficult and challenging task. Also, trying to make the top of the building a docking area for new airships was extremely difficult. One obstacle the builders faced attempting to create a dock for dirigibles was preventing stress to the building's frame. If the builders wanted to fix that issue, it would involve the building's foundation which was eleven hundred feet below. Strengthening the framework of the building would cost too much money. The stress of the building would come from the dirigible's heavy load and strong wind pressure. Another obstacle that the builders were faced with was the wind. The violent air current would cause the building to continuously shift, making it unstable for docking. They didn't want to use lead weights because it was too dangerous, as they were dangling high over pedestrians and other potential targets. A law that builders had to think about while building this was the law that went against airships flying too low. They had many complex obstacles that the builders had to keep in mind while building the dock, and these obstacles ultimately made it very difficult to achieve the goal of creating a functional dirigible dock on the Empire State Building.
1555	16388	6	3	"The main obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building had to face were mainly safety and nature itself. Safety was of utmost importance, and because they were aiming at having dirigibles land on top of the building, they needed to make sure it was completely safe. In the reading it states that ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" Since it is flammable, the builders realized how much danger it could cause especially in a high - populated area like New York City. Now besides safety, one of the biggest obstacles was nature. With having the mooring mast at a steep height on top of the Empire State Building came with many difficulties that revolved around the weather and atmosphere. The winds on the top of the building were always shifting unpredictably, which would make it extremely hard to land dirigibles. Because of the unsustainable air currents, nothing could be effectively done about the dirigibles. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" Due to the roughness of the wind and the unidealistic design of the dirigible, safety and nature were the main and insurmountable obstacles in the creation of a functional dirigible - docking area on the Empire State Building, ultimately preventing its successful implementation."
1556	16389	6	3	Builders faced numerous problems when attempting to dock @CAPS1 dirigibles on the Empire State Building. The first major hurdle they encountered was the powerful wind at the top of the building. When the Navy dirigible Los Angeles attempted to dock at the building, the strong wind made it impossible for the dirigible to get close enough without losing control, such as the risk of hitting another nearby building. This uncontrollable situation made docking the dirigible an impossible task, and thus the Los Angeles had to abandon the attempt. Another significant reason that builders faced difficulties with @CAPS1 dirigibles docking on the Empire State Building was the existing law. There was a law in place that stated airships were not @CAPS2 to fly low over urban areas. This law effectively prevented any and all dirigibles from approaching the building, which meant they could not dock. In conclusion, these problems made it extremely challenging to achieve the goal of dirigible docking on the Empire State Building.
1557	16390	6	3	"In The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION1, numerous contractors were extremely determined to construct a mast on the Empire State Building. Their aim was to sanction the use of dirigibles, or blimps, as the future mode of air travel. However, there were a large number of obstacles standing in the way of making this a reality. The idea of allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building was indeed a fantastic one, but it ultimately proved to be just an unfeasible theory. The first problem was related to the weight of the blimp and the combined force of the malicious winds. These factors had the potential to eventually shatter the beautiful framework of the building. As stated, ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" Architects quickly took action and impulsively spent over sixty thousand dollars on making changes to the building to address this flaw. Nevertheless, this was not the only problem. The second major concern was the hydrogen that would fill these blimps. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" In a densely populated city like New York City, the risk of hydrogen - related fires was a top concern. The most significant obstacle was mother nature. ""The winds on top of buildings were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" With a dirigible flying above thousands of civilians, an uncontrolled aircraft because of high winds was extremely unsafe. The last impractical reason why this idea was not realistic was the law that forbade airships to fly too low in urban areas. All of these obstacles combined made building a mast on the Empire State Building nothing more than a dream. Al Smith, the architect of the Empire State Building, came up with fascinating ideas. Although they were great in theory, they did not work in practice. Between the environment, winds, hydrogen use, and safety laws, his dream was ultimately just a hoax. These insurmountable obstacles made it impossible to proceed with the construction. In the end, Al Smith had amazing imagination but unfortunately, bad luck."
1558	16391	6	3	"In the article ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the mooring mast had to confront a series of obstacles that hindered the successful docking of the dirigibles. First and foremost, the architects were tasked with designing the mast. They were well - aware that the frame of the Empire State Building would need to be strengthened to bear the load and wind pressure exerted by the dirigible. Therefore, they ""designed the mooring mast and made changes to the existing plans for the building's skeleton"" and carefully planned for the reconstruction of the building and the mast. The workers were filled with excitement about their plans and eagerly anticipated the launch of a revolutionary moment. However, once they delved deeper into the construction plan, they realized the numerous problems it entailed and faced many roadblocks that prevented the plan from moving forward. ""Most dirigibles... used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable,"" which clearly indicated that the mooring mast was unsafe and could potentially lead to disastrous accidents. Additionally, ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"", demonstrating the physical insecurity of the ship on the dirigible. Lastly, the law imposed restrictions on airships flying too low, and the dirigibles would be in violation of that law. Even though the builders were eager to provide a launching pad for the dirigibles and had an ideal design in mind, there were too many flaws that made the mooring mast an impossible project to bring to reality. Clearly, the builders faced many problems that could not have been solved in their attempt to allow the dirigibles to dock. In conclusion, these insurmountable issues dashed their hopes of a successful dirigible - docking facility on the Empire State Building."
1559	16392	6	3	"The idea of a mooring mast atop the Empire State Building seemed like a magnificent concept at the time of construction, but it had a multitude of obstacles to overcome. The builders initially had to make ""over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications"" to the building's steel frame. This was crucial as it would reinforce the building against the pressure that a docked dirigible would create. Adding a mooring mast was not as straightforward as simply placing one on top of the building. So, the builders constructed a large stainless - steel enclosure to house passengers. This enclosure was also equipped with an elevator and stairs to bring passengers to the eighty - fifth floor. Lastly, the builders had to complete the roof before framing the mast in steel. The concept of a mooring mast was truly ingenious, but the practicality was soon found to be extremely low. Not to mention the fact that the builders were working at a height of a thousand feet, which presented many challenges. In conclusion, despite the innovative idea, these various difficulties made the realization of the mooring mast a very difficult task."
1560	16393	6	3	The Empire State Building had the ambition to allow dirigibles to dock on its top. To achieve this, they would need to build a mast on top so that the dirigibles could hook onto it and refuel. However, they ran into a multitude of problems right from the start and continued to face them throughout the process. The first problem, among many, was that they could not simply place a mast on the top because it would be too unstable and cause excessive stress to the building's structure. To prevent this, they ended up modifying and strengthening the structure as a whole, which cost over sixty thousand dollars. Once they managed to figure out how to balance all of the wind pressure, they had to come up with a way to bring the dirigibles in. The answer was relatively simple: electrical winches. The next problem was safety. Dirigibles outside of the @LOCATION1 used highly flammable hydrogen, and if that were to explode, it would be extremely dangerous for the densely populated city below. Another safety issue was nature's violently shifting winds. On the ground, they would waive the back down with lead weights to keep it from swaying, but doing that in the air over a large number of people could be extremely unsafe. The final blow to this plan was the law that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas. In conclusion, these numerous problems made it impossible for the Empire State Building to implement the plan of allowing dirigibles to dock.
1561	16394	6	3	"The obstacle that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were the strong winds on top of the Empire State Building. This is because in paragraph @NUM1 it states that ""the air around the building was constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This problem would make the dirigibles swivel around uncontrollably in the air. Another obstacle that the dirigibles had is that they often used hydrogen and helium, which are highly flammable substances. These issues combined made it extremely difficult and dangerous to dock dirigibles at the Empire State Building."
1562	16395	6	3	There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced such as the high - velocity winds, and the challenge of how they could dock the dirigibles when it is against the law to fly an aircraft too low near urban areas. One significant obstacle the builders faced was the safety of the dirigibles anchoring above busy streets filled with people and under the influence of high winds. Most dirigibles out of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. So, any foreign dirigible that was anchored at the Empire State Building would cause a serious safety issue because the high winds at the top of the building could cause an accident to occur, causing the dirigible to blow up and potentially endanger pedestrians. Another obstacle the builders faced is the law that made it illegal for dirigibles to ever dock at the building because it was illegal for aircrafts to fly too low near urban areas and it would have been a long and arduous process to ever get the government to approve such an exception. In conclusion, these multiple obstacles made the idea of dirigible docking at the Empire State Building extremely challenging.
1563	16396	6	3	The builders faced so many obstacles to having dirigibles dock on the Empire State Building. One of the greatest obstacles was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to dangerous air currents. These erratic air movements would cause the back of the dirigible to swivel around and around the mooring mast. With the dirigibles dangling high above pedestrians on the streets, this situation was neither practical nor safe. There was also an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. All these factors combined meant there were so many insurmountable obstacles to mooring dirigibles on the Empire State Building, ultimately making the idea unfeasible.
1564	16397	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles with trying to build a docking station for dirigibles. They first needed to make @MONEY1 worth of modifications to strengthen the building to ""accommodate this new situation."" This involved reinforcing certain structural elements to handle the additional weight and forces associated with docking dirigibles. However, this was an obstacle they were able to overcome through careful engineering and construction. The next problem was that most dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable, and after the tragic fire of the Hindenburg, people became very aware of how potentially dangerous this docking idea was. Another problem was the weather. High winds could cause significant problems when the dirigibles are trying to dock, making it difficult to control their movement and position. To top off this list of problems is the fact that there is a ""law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" In the end, there were just too many obstacles for the builders to overcome, and the mooring mast was never successful in its intended purpose."
1565	16398	6	3	The obstacles the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building were severe. The greatest and most important obstacle they faced was safety. If a plan is not completely safe, it shouldn't happen. The Empire State Building would not have been stable enough with the winds being so powerful. The strong gusts could put excessive stress on the building and the docking mechanism. Also, most dirigibles or blimps used hydrogen not helium. Hydrogen is extremely combustible, and if the blimp caught on fire, it would be a disaster, especially in a place as crowded as New York. This was another major problem with landing a dirigible on the Empire State Building. Another obstacle was the wind. A dirigible could not land unless it was weighted down with lead weights. But having these heavy lead weights hanging above the city was also not very safe for people walking freely in New York City. These problems are the reasons why the dirigibles could not land on the Empire State Building, as the risks were simply too high to justify the operation.
1566	16399	6	3	In an attempt to make the Empire State Building higher than the Chrysler Building, the builders faced a few obstacles while trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. One significant obstacle stemmed from safety concerns. Dirigibles coming from outside the United States commonly used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is far more flammable, and the builders realized that if an accident like the one where the German dirigible was destroyed by a fire in New Jersey were to occur, it would be even more disastrous in a densely populated area such as downtown New York. One of the greatest challenges in attempting to use the mooring mast was nature itself. If the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of it would sway continuously due to the strong and erratic winds on top of the building. The practical hurdle the builders encountered was legal. There was an existing law that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas. Tying up the dirigible to the building would thus be illegal. As the years went by, the idea of using the mooring mast gradually faded away, leaving no more obstacles to deal with.
1567	16400	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in their efforts to allow dirigibles to dock there. The author clearly stated, ""The greatest reason was one of safety."" Dirigibles typically used hydrogen more frequently than helium, and hydrogen is extremely flammable. In the event that a dirigible were to catch fire or crash, it would pose a grave danger over a densely populated area. Another significant obstacle was nature. The author wrote, ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" These strong and unpredictable winds would be far too challenging for a dirigible to handle. A final factor that prevented dirigibles from docking was the law. The story mentioned, ""... was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This law effectively made it illegal to dock dirigibles at the Empire State Building. In conclusion, the dirigibles faced a multitude of obstacles that ultimately prevented them from docking at the Empire State Building."
1568	16401	6	3	Dirigibles had a top speed of eighty miles per hour, and they could cruise at seventy miles per hour for thousands of miles without needing to refuel. Some dirigibles were as long as one thousand feet, which is the same length as four blocks in New York City. The main obstacle to their more widespread use in New York was the lack of a suitable landing area. The greatest challenge to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. These strong and unpredictable winds made it extremely difficult, if not impossible, for dirigibles to safely dock using the mooring mast. As a result, the potential for expanded use of dirigibles in New York remained limited.
1569	16402	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted, workers building the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles, or blimps, to dock there. Initially, Al Smith, who led the efforts to construct the Empire State Building, was determined to win ""... the title of world's tallest building..."" in a competition against the architect building the Chrysler Building. Then, Al Smith came up with an idea that would make his building significantly taller than the Chrysler Building. He decided to add a mooring mast to the building to serve as a docking point for dirigibles. ""The Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" In fact, ""over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made..."". ""The architects and engineers of the Empire State Building consulted with the experts..."" to ensure that everything would be safe and in compliance with regulations. Despite all the trouble the builders went through, ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose..."". After expending so much work and effort, the mooring mast was never put to use because ""Dirigibles moored... at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe."" In the end, the ambitious plan for the mooring mast had to be abandoned."
1570	16403	6	3	In building the Empire State Building, the builders had to grapple with numerous obstacles to enable dirigibles to dock there. The first major obstacle was determining what the dirigibles would attach to. The builders initially thought that adding a mooring mast would make docking straightforward, but they initially overlooked the building's foundation. They soon realized that the foundation was not nearly strong enough to support the weight and forces exerted by dirigibles. As a result, over an additional sixty thousand dollars was spent to reinforce it. After that, the builders had to figure out how passengers would board the dirigibles, as well as where to provide space for baggage and ticketing. To address these issues, a glassed - in observation area and an open observation platform were constructed. Another significant obstacle was the existing airship law regarding how low they could fly. The dirigibles clearly violated this law, which effectively put an end to the idea of using the mast for docking. After several failed attempts at docking, the idea gradually faded away, and the builders finally came to the realization that the plan would never work. In conclusion, despite their best efforts, the challenges proved insurmountable, and the dream of dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building was abandoned.
1571	16404	6	3	The idea of making the top of the Empire State Building into a dirigible docking station had been a good idea, and would have helped with the problem that there was no area large enough for the dirigible to land in the bustling city. However, there were flaws in the idea that were not discovered till the construction of the building was completed. One flaw was the violent air currents that would keep the winds around the building constantly moving. These erratic winds would push and pull the back of the dirigible around and around till eventually the back of the dirigible would hit the building, causing potential damage to both the dirigible and the structure. The other flaw was that most of the dirigibles were filled with a highly flammable gas known as hydrogen. If the dirigible had exploded and burst into flames like the Hindenburg in Lakehurst, New Jersey on May 6, 1937, then the flaming shell would fall down on the people around the building, endangering countless lives. Even if the flaws had been fixed, there was already a law that went against the airships flying too low over urban areas. If the airships managed to land on the Empire State Building, it would be considered illegal, thus putting an end to the once - promising idea.
1572	16405	6	3	"While building the Empire State Building, the builders faced many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there. The original problem was figuring out how to get the large and cumbersome dirigible onto the building. After consulting with the Navy, which had expertise in handling large air and sea vessels, as well as meeting with the president of the newly formed ""airship transport company,"" they thought they were past the rough part of it. But there were many obstacles to come. Next, as they began constructing the mast, they realised that with the great height of the building, dirigibles landing would ""add stress to the building's frame."" The frame of the building would have to be modified to help fix this problem, and it cost over a significant amount of money (@MONEY1) to make these modifications. The prior two obstacles had been resolved, but the next bunch of obstacles caused the attempt of dirigibles to dock to stop in its tracks. Many safety problems posed as obstacles for the building team. It could be very dangerous, as some gases used in dirigibles are extremely flammable. Another obstacle is the ability to safely dock, at such high altitudes, with ""constantly shifting"" air currents. All of these problems were amplified because it was even more unsafe for these problems to exist in such a populated area. The build team was able to overcome some obstacles, but some caused too many potential problems to be fixed, ultimately halting the plan for dirigible docking."
1573	16406	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First of all, a lot of stress would be put on the building's frame with a thousand - foot dirigible held to it. The sheer size and weight of the dirigible, combined with the forces exerted by wind and movement, meant that the builders would have to make many modifications to the building's framework. ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" Moreover, safety was a paramount reason as to why dirigibles weren't allowed to dock there because of the highly flammable gas, Hydrogen, that is used in most dirigibles. ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" Additionally, nature was the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast. Violent air currents caused shifting winds, making the dirigible swivel around the mooring mast. This erratic movement was not safe for the pedestrians on the streets below, who could be hit by falling debris or the dirigible itself. In conclusion, these obstacles made it impossible for the mooring mast of the Empire State Building to fulfill its purpose of serving as a dirigible docking station."
1574	16407	6	3	The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was nature itself. The winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. These strong and unpredictable winds made it extremely difficult, if not impossible, for a dirigible to approach and dock safely. Another obstacle would have to be that the builders didn't check the laws of the city. An aircraft is not allowed to fly that low over urban areas such as New York City, so this law prevented and made it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. The last obstacle that the builders of the Empire State Building faced was related to public safety, and this was the greatest reason. This project put the public in danger because if a dirigible went down in flames over a highly populated city like New York City, it would be catastrophic! For example, when the German dirigible the Hindenburg caught fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, if a similar accident had occurred over New York, then the accident would be much worse and many people would die. Due to these insurmountable obstacles, the plan to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building had to be abandoned.
1575	16408	6	3	"While building the mooring mast, the builders of the Empire State Building struggled through many difficulties and issues. First, they had to make sure the dirigible wouldn't tear down the framework of the building. Because the dirigible was so large and heavy, the forces exerted by the dirigible, added with the wind, would ""be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation"" which was at the bottom. This had to be addressed, or the building would have been at risk of being destroyed. Even before this, workers had to learn how dirigibles worked and how they could be docked on the building. They ""consulted with experts, taking detailed tours of the equipment"" just in order to learn how a dirigible flies and how it would be docked. Probably the most important thing the workers had to keep in mind was the safety of the public. This was very difficult to do, considering the flammable nature of the gases used in dirigibles and the unpredictable air currents at the building's height. Unfortunately, it wasn't possible to build this mast so it would be safe for the public. This eventually led to the mast never being used as a docking station, as the risks far outweighed the potential benefits."
1576	16409	6	3	The Greatest Obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was nature itself. The strong and unpredictable wings on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigibles were carefully tethered to the mooring mast, the large back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast uncontrollably. Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights to keep them stable, but using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above the unsuspecting pedestrians on the busy street, was neither practical nor safe. In the end, these challenges made the idea of dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building unfeasible.
1577	16410	6	3	"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders had to face many daunting obstacles while constructing the Empire State building to be able to allow dirigibles to dock there. The builders had to face many complex obstacles such as strict laws regarding airship operations, @CAPS1 Changes and the inherent limitations of the building @CAPS2, that was not thoroughly thought about while the exciting idea was accumulating. After creating the plan to add a mast on the top of the Empire State building as a docking for Dirigibles, the new and innovative airships, they finally decided to look at the defaults of the already developed plan. While the mast was being designed, the architects realized that you ""could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building's flat roof."" ""A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add significant stress to the building's frame"". When the builders were constructing their plan, they didn't consider the fact that the heavy load of the dirigibles would add stress to the entire building. ""The greatest obstacle to a successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" The builders realized that the strong winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents and since the law was against airships flying too low over urban areas, the dirigibles idea wouldn't be as easy to fulfill with all of the numerous obstacles to overcome. The obstacles the builders had to face when attempting to dock dirigibles on the Empire State building were safety laws, unpredictable weather and the building @CAPS2, which ultimately made the project unworkable."
1578	16411	6	3	"The excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast,"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, describes the various obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. For example, after the tragic incident where the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire, the fear of such a catastrophic accident occurring in a densely populated area such as New York posed a major problem. This was because most international dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen instead of the safer helium. Another significant obstacle was the nature of the mooring mast and the violent air currents that cause rapid and erratic shifts in wind. Having a dirigible moored to the top of the Empire State Building, ""dangling high above the unsuspecting pedestrians on the street was neither practical nor safe"" (paragraph @NUM1). Also, there were existing strict laws that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, therefore making ""it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"" (paragraph @NUM2). The architects of the project were so overly excited by the novelty of the idea that they were blind to these potential difficulties. These numerous obstacles and unsolved problems contributed to the ultimate unsuccess of the mast, and the idea gradually disappeared and was eventually forgotten."
1579	16412	6	3	The builders faced a lot of complex issues to allow dirigibles to land at a place on the Empire State Building. The builders had to be extremely cautious and careful when building the platform to allow dirigibles to dock. The dirigibles (Blimp) were very large transportation machines that were made out of strong Steel and durable Cotton Fabric that was filled with a combination of hydrogen and helium. Hydrogen is a highly flammable substance, which meant the builders had to be extremely careful with power and electricity supplies to prevent any potential fire hazards. To allow a blimp to dock above @NUM1 feet in the air on the Empire State Building, they needed to work meticulously on the framing of the building so that in case there was any bad weather condition, such as strong winds or heavy storms, the building would not collapse and would remain stable. Because of all these problems and the strict precautions the builders had to make, making the mast was a failure and the focus shifted to future transportations like planes.
1580	16413	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many significant obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle they faced was that they had to reconstruct the building to add the mast. ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be carefully modified and significantly strengthened to accommodate this new and challenging situation."" Designing and installing the mast was an obstacle they had to face. Also, they had to face all of the strict safety requirements. ""The mast was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed."" After they carefully analyzed what could go wrong if they docked dirigibles, the original purpose of the mast was not able to be fulfilled. Another obstacle they had to face was testing their plan to dock dirigibles. ""U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up."" The dirigible failed in their attempt and the idea of docking dirigibles gradually disappeared in the late 1930's. The builders of the Empire State Building faced many insurmountable obstacles, which led to the abandonment of the dirigibles - docking project."
1581	16414	6	3	"The architects of the Empire State Building faced numerous safety and practical obstacles when considering allowing dirigibles to dock on top of it. For example, dirigibles outside of the United States were typically filled with hydrogen, rather than helium, gas. Hydrogen gas is highly flammable, which poses a significant risk. As a result, the German dirigible the ""Hindenburg"" was destroyed by a fire in 1937. The architects of the Empire State Building foresaw that if such an incident had taken place above a densely populated area like downtown New York, it could have been a much more tragic event. Furthermore, anchoring a large - sized dirigible, say around 800 feet, to the top of a building with a single tether would add excessive stress to the building's frame. To solve this problem, the architects would have to spend approximately $50,000 in modifications to the building's steel frame. Additionally, there are violent and unpredictable winds above the Empire State Building. If a dirigible were tethered to the mast, it would swivel around the top of the building with the wind currents. When moored in open fields, dirigibles can be anchored with weights. However, dangling weighted anchors above the heads of pedestrians on the busy streets below could be potentially extremely dangerous. In 1930, the U.S. Navy dirigible ""Los Angeles"" tried to moor at the Empire State Building, but couldn't get close enough to the spire to tie itself up because of sharp winds. The pilot also had to carefully maneuver around other spires as well, for fear of puncturing the dirigible. Clearly, there were practical and safety reasons why the dirigible moor was unable to be completed at the top of the Empire State Building."
1582	16415	6	3	Al Smith and his group of experienced architects encountered many problems when they attempted to build a mooring mast atop the Empire State Building in order to dock dirigibles. Before they began building, the architects carefully realized that they could not simply land a dirigible on the building's flat roof. The roof lacked the necessary strength and stability. They had to make over sixty thousand dollars' worth of significant modifications to the framework before they could even think of docking dirigibles there. After they finished building the conical top of the Empire State Building, the team working on the project, through in - depth analysis, realized that dirigibles could never be docked at the Empire State Building for several reasons. First, landing dirigibles was extremely dangerous to the people of the city. Dirigibles contained hydrogen, which is highly flammable, and if there was an accident similar to the Hindenburg disaster in New York City, the damage would be utterly devastating. Nature also presented a major hurdle. Air currents were too powerful, and if the ship did land, it would swivel around the spire of the building. It was possible to prevent this by putting lead weights into the back of the dirigible, but this was also unsafe for the people that lived and walked underneath. The last obstacle the architects faced was an existing strict law that prevented airships from flying too low over urban areas. Although the architects had a great and innovative idea, they never fully realized why it would not work until after building. In conclusion, despite their efforts, the combination of safety, natural, and legal factors made the dirigible - docking plan unfeasible.
1583	16416	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many significant obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. For one, most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable, and it could easily explode under certain conditions. For instance, on May 6, 1937, the German dirigible Hindenburg was completely destroyed by a massive fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey. There is no way to predict that such a disaster could never happen again. The greatest obstacle in attempting to have dirigibles dock there was nature itself. The winds on the top of the building were constantly and rapidly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if a dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast in an unpredictable manner. Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights. However, using them at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above the busy pedestrians on the streets below, wasn't practical and was extremely unsafe. Another reason is because there was a well - established law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law was due to the fear that the wind could blow the dirigible into other buildings in the area, which would puncture the dirigible's shell and cause a great deal of damage. In conclusion, these multiple obstacles made it nearly impossible for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
1584	16417	6	3	"In the passage The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon, the builders of the Empire State Building were faced with numerous obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One clear example is that ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" This indicates that a solid and well - planned amount of support is essential to hold a dirigible safely. Another significant issue is that ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States use hydrogen not Helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" So, if that were to catch fire in the middle of the bustling New York City, the consequences would be extremely dire. The changing wind speeds at the top of the building would cause the dirigible to sway erratically in the air. This could lead to serious issues with stability during docking and unloading operations. So, in this passage, the builders in The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon had to overcome these challenging obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. In conclusion, the combination of structural, safety, and environmental factors made the task of enabling dirigible docking at the Empire State Building a very difficult one."
1585	16418	6	3	When something is getting invented or built, many significant obstacles are faced. The number one obstacle was safety, which is of utmost importance. If even one person were to die per trip, nobody would be willing to go on the balloon - like dirigibles. Safety is the foundation of any business; no safety means no business. The wind at the top of the Empire State Building was another major problem. The strong and unpredictable winds made it difficult for the balloon to stay still while unloading passengers or cargo, which is very unsafe. The actual building also presented a problem. The skeleton of the building would have to undergo significant changes, and that is an expensive fix. These are some of the major obstacles the architects faced. They tried hard to work around them, but unfortunately, they failed. Maybe one day, with the advancement of technology and better understanding of these issues, they will find a way to fix it and make dirigible docking at the Empire State Building a reality.
1586	16419	6	3	"In The Mooring @CAPS1 by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building, an iconic skyscraper in New York City, faced significant obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the main problems was nature. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air - currents,"" which made it extremely dangerous for dirigibles to be turning around the building above pedestrians going about their daily business. Another obstacle that the builders faced was that the dirigibles used hydrogen, rather than helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable, and the owners of the Empire State Building did not want a dirigible to catch fire above a ""densely populated area such as downtown New York,"" where the consequences could be catastrophic. The last obstacle faced in the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made ""it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" In conclusion, these multiple hurdles effectively prevented dirigibles from docking at the Empire State Building."
1587	16420	6	3	"There were many problems the builders of the Empire State Building, a well - known landmark, faced when it came to dirigibles. They faced problems with ""... Violent air currents"" that flow above the building. These strong and unpredictable air currents would constantly be pushing the ships as they tried to dock precisely at the designated spot, and would sway the back end of the dirigibles while they were docked, making the docking process extremely unstable. Another problem was that there was an ""... existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This law, put in place for public safety, would make it basically illegal to dock an airship on the Empire State Building. These obstacles described in ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia L¸sted show why the spire at the top of the Empire State Building was never used to dock dirigibles, as the combination of natural and legal issues made it an unfeasible endeavor."
1588	16421	6	3	There were many obstacles that stood in the way of allowing dirigibles to dock there at the Empire State Building. The layout of how the mast would be used was not carefully thought out. One reason is because most dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium, which was highly flammable. Given that the dirigible would be relatively in close proximity with the pedestrians walking on the streets below and other buildings in the area, it would be extremely unwise to use the mast for docking. In addition, there was an existing law stating that the dirigible could not fly low in urban areas, which it would have to do if it attached to the mast. Also, the force of the wind could spin the back of the dirigible, causing it to go around and around the mast in a dangerous and uncontrollable manner. The proposed solution of putting heavy blocks in the back could cause the blocks to fall on top of the pedestrians, posing a serious threat. Overall, there were many reasons why it was unreasonable to allow dirigibles to dock there, and these factors made the idea unworkable.
1589	16422	6	3	The obstacles which the builders of the Empire State Building faced to allow dirigibles to dock there were numerous for this project. The first problem was that, other dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen. Hydrogen is a much more flammable substance than helium, which is what dirigibles in the United States used. The owners of the Empire State Building didn't want anything to occur similar to the German dirigible the Hindenburg, which had a tragic fire incident. Such an incident would be even worse in downtown New York instead of Lakehurst, New Jersey, considering the high population density. Another practical reason why dirigibles faced problems docking at the Empire State Building was that an existing law prevented dirigibles from flying too low over urban areas. For example, a @ORGANIZATION1 dirigible named the Los Angeles, despite its attempts, could not get close enough to tie up due to forceful winds that buffeted it. These problems go to show that owners of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there, and these issues made the docking plan unviable.
1590	16423	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building built two floors just for the passengers to drop off their luggage. These floors were designed to provide a convenient and organized space for passengers. They had a view in those floors, which was intended to enhance the passenger experience. However, if the idea of using dirigibles for transportation at the building didn't work, they wasted a significant amount of money on those extra rooms. They started working on the build and attempted to make dirigibles dock on the top, but they wasted a lot of time and money in the process. The challenges they faced, such as wind conditions and legal restrictions, made the project unfeasible. In the end, it was just a waste altogether, and the intended use of these floors and the docking facility did not come to fruition.
1591	16424	6	3	"The Empire State Building was meticulously designed with the ambitious goal of becoming the world's tallest building, and the architects had a few clever tricks up their sleeve. The building was originally envisioned to also function as a mooring mast for dirigibles, a truly innovative concept at the time. Unfortunately, numerous problems stood in the way of turning this theory into reality. One significant obstacle the constructors of the Empire State Building faced was the use of dangerous gases in the balloons. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" The use of hydrogen posed a grave and dangerous threat to the safety of civilians in New York City. Another problem that was encountered with the building was the wind. The back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast... (the dirigibles) dangling high above pedestrians on the street, which was neither practical nor safe. A third problem the builders had was the legality of the issue of mooring ships to the buildings. There was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. ""With this law in place, it would have been impossible for ships to moor. Although the builders had good intentions, they failed to fully realize the harsh reality of the situation, and thus the plan for dirigibles to use the building as a mooring mast was ultimately abandoned."
1592	16425	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple formidable obstacles in their ambitious attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. For example, as mentioned in paragraph @NUM1, ""a thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add significant stress to the building's frame."" The difficulty in having stress from the dirigible's heavy load and the strong wind pressure is that it would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. This meant that the entire structure of the building would be under immense strain. Wind was another major obstacle that the builders had to overcome. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. And even if the dirigible were to be tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast in an unpredictable and dangerous manner. Dirigibles moored in open fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using the lead weights at the Empire State Building would not be safe, as they would dangle high above pedestrians on the busy streets. Given these numerous and insurmountable challenges, it became clear that the plan to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was not feasible."
1593	16426	6	3	Building the Mooring Mast was not an easy task; creating this futuristic design was accompanied by a multitude of problems. Some of the problems that these builders faced were that dirigibles can be up to one thousand feet long, so they are extremely heavy and sway in the wind dangerously. It was also against the law for airships to fly at a low level over urban areas, and there was also a great danger of the dirigible crashing or catching fire over the densely populated area of New York. Even though these problems almost seem impossible to overcome, they were able to make some adjustments to make the project seem more realistic. The steel frame of the Empire State Building was carefully modified and strengthened so it could support the dirigibles and wind pressure. However, nature had no mercy, and the strong winds would sway the dirigibles vigorously, which was neither safe nor practical. They were able to bypass the law and attempt to dock once, but it didn't end up working out after all. There had already been well - known cases of dirigibles crashing, such as the tragic incident of the Hindenburg. An accident over a densely populated area would be truly horrific and not practical. Because of these problems and more, the thought of using a Mooring Mast to dock dirigibles was quietly and permanently retired.
1594	16427	6	3	When the idea of a mooring dock for dirigibles first emerged, it seemed like a brilliant and revolutionary idea. But as time passed and construction progressed, the surmounting obstacles that arose made the idea of a mooring dock remain just an idea. When the mooring mast was finally finished, the obvious safety hazards stopped it from fulfilling its intended purpose. The greatest safety hazard was the nature of the mast itself. The winds at that great height were strong, violent, and constantly shifting. Even if the dirigible was tethered down, the back of the ship would be swirled around the mooring mast in a chaotic and dangerous way. Another significant hazard was that most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is extremely flammable. After the German dirigible Hindenburg was tragically destroyed by fire in 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized that they could not take that risk. A final obstacle that arose was a law that was against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made it completely illegal for a ship to even come near the building. In the end, these insurmountable obstacles ensured that the mooring dock for dirigibles at the Empire State Building would never become a reality.
1595	16428	6	3	The obstacles the engineers faced were those of any typical builder. You have to think about how high is too high, taking into account the wind conditions, the sturdiness of the frame, and the cost and payroll for the engineers. Although Al Smith did not run into the typical problems, he did have to rethink the mooring mast to determine if it was a good idea. Putting a massive, thousand - foot dirigible dangling from a building 1,250 feet in the air was a risky proposition. Al Smith aimed to create a landmark for the U.S., but perhaps he shouldn't have put a non - usable mooring mast at the top. In hindsight, it became clear that the challenges associated with the mooring mast were too great, and it would have been wiser to focus on other aspects of the building's design to achieve its status as a significant landmark.
1596	16429	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced a myriad of obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. This means that even the slightest spark inside the dirigible would quickly send it up in flames, endangering not only the passengers and crew but also the people and property below. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to the violent air - currents. This proves that having the dirigible docked up there would be extremely dangerous as the unstable winds could cause the dirigible to sway uncontrollably. To counter this, weights would need to be used to anchor the back of the dirigible. The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This symbolizes that it is against the law to have an airship that close to a highly populated area like New York City. Due to these insurmountable obstacles, the idea of docking dirigibles at the Empire State Building was ultimately ignored.
1597	16430	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many natural opposition in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock in the building. Natural forces were a total threat to the idea of the dirigibles landing on the Empire State Building. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. This erratic wind behavior wouldn't be safe for the people getting in and off the dirigible because the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast, making boarding and disembarking a perilous task. Other opposition to the idea was that most dirigibles that came from outside the U.S. didn't use helium, but hydrogen which is highly flammable. A single spark could cause a massive explosion, risking the lives of the people who lived around the Empire State Building. Also, the law was against this idea. There was a law that prohibited airships to fly too low over the urban areas. This law made the docking of the ships in the Empire State Building illegal. In conclusion, the builders of the Empire State Building confronted both natural and social opposition to the landing of the ships in the Empire State Building, and these factors made the plan unfeasible.
1598	16431	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was that the building had to be modified and strengthened. These modifications were necessary to ensure the structural integrity of the building when a dirigible was docking. The modifications cost them over a significant amount, specifically @MONEY1 worth of modifications. They had to make these modifications so the dirigible could dock safely and securely. All in all, these costly and labor - intensive modifications were the main obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock.
1599	16432	6	3	The builders had many obstacles to allow the dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was they had to make sure the building was high enough. A sufficient height was required to provide enough clearance for the dirigible to approach and dock without hitting any surrounding structures. They also had to make sure the building was durable enough. The structure needed to withstand the weight and forces exerted by the dirigible during docking and while it was moored. Those are some of the obstacles they had to overcome to allow the dirigibles to dock there. In the end, these height and durability requirements presented significant challenges to the builders.
1600	16433	6	3	When allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, they were faced with many obstacles. One of the many obstacles the builders were faced with was that the Empire State Building was not well - structured to hold a dirigible of @NUM1 ft. The building's current design and construction could not support the weight and forces exerted by such a large dirigible. As a result, the building's structure would need to be modified, which would cost at least sixty thousand dollars more. Another obstacle the builders had faced was that the dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen was very flammable, and this meant they didn't want something bad, like a large - scale explosion, to take place above the building and in a populated area like downtown New York. The last main obstacle they had to face was that the mooring mast was always affected by the nature around it. The changing wind and weather conditions would cause the mast to move, and the dirigibles would wear on it, causing danger to people in the town of New York. Those were the few significant obstacles the builders had in allowing dirigibles to dock near the Empire State Building, and these challenges made the plan difficult to execute.
1601	16434	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building had a lot of problems in building the mooring mast. How would they be able to allow dirigibles to dock there? High winds and laws stood in the builders' way. The frame of the building had to be reinforced so it would not fall to the ground. The landing gear installation date had to be postponed due to building schedule issues. When a dirigible did try to land, it couldn't. The air streams were too strong for it. In the end, the idea was unrealistic. High winds and laws prevented the mooring mast from ever being used for its intended purpose.
1602	16435	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The greatest obstacle was safety for pedestrians and the building itself. Most of the dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is very flammable. They didn't want the dirigible to explode and fall over pedestrians and catch the whole building on fire. Such a disastrous scenario would pose a huge threat to the densely - populated area around the building. Safety is the main obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building faced when trying to let dirigibles dock there, which ultimately made the idea unfeasible.
1603	16436	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. @PERSON1 says in the excerpt ""The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area."" This clearly shows that in order for the dirigibles to dock on the top of the Empire State Building, there must be enough landing space. If a mooring mast was added to the top of the building, it would only allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours, for refueling or service, and to let passengers off and on. One of the other practical reasons why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The architects could also not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the building's flat roof. A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, could add significant stress to the building's frame. So, considering all these factors, the builders of the Empire State Building did not allow the dirigibles to dock on top of their building, also because of everything that could potentially happen to the building."
1604	16437	6	3	"According to the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on its mooring mast. A large dirigible moored at the top of the building would add tremendous stress to the building, and ""over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications"" had to be made to accommodate the stress. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, strong winds would cause the back of the ship to swivel around the mast. According to the article, dirigibles could be weighted down to prevent this, but it is too unsafe for pedestrians on the ground below. There was also the issue with docking dirigibles that use hydrogen, a highly flammable gas. On May 6, 1937, a hydrogen dirigible was destroyed by fire and according to the excerpt, the owners of the Empire State Building realized that if the accident had occurred in downtown New York, it would have made the densely populated area too unsafe. The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for there were too many obstacles for such an accomplishment to be made, making it an unviable option."
1605	16438	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock there. Building a mast is more complicated than you would think. They had to take a lot of things into consideration, like the dirigible's load and the wind pressure. ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework"". Just when the builders thought they were done, Al Smith adds a 250 - foot Mooring Mast to the top of the Empire State Building. The builders had to go through a great deal of obstacles and challenges, such as ensuring the structural integrity and dealing with additional design changes, to complete this project, but they did manage to finish it despite all the difficulties."
1606	16439	6	3	Obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was nature itself. The winds on top of the tall building were constantly shifting due to the violent air currents swirling around it. As a result, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast, making it extremely difficult to secure the dirigible safely. This unpredictable wind behavior ultimately posed a major challenge to the docking plans.
1607	16440	6	3	The workers that were building the extravagant Empire State Building they went through several obstacle courses. One of the obstacle courses was having the blimp sit on top of the building. Since the blimp was only held by one cable cord, it was applying significant stress to the building because the blimp was pretty heavy. Another obstacle was nature. Since the Empire State Building was so high up, the wind was excruciatingly strong, buffeting the blimp and making docking operations perilous. The last obstacle they had to overcome was the gas they used inside the blimps. If they used hydrogen, which is a highly flammable substance, like the German blimps, it could have been a disaster. In the end, these challenges made the task of allowing blimps to dock at the building extremely difficult.
1608	16441	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was an existing law. In paragraph @NUM1, it states the reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building is because of an existing law against airship flying too low under urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to even tie or even approach the mooring mast on the building. This legal restriction severely hampered the builders' plans to enable dirigible docking at the Empire State Building.
1609	16442	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One problem was ""the fact that the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) These shifting winds would make it extremely hard for the dirigibles to be tethered securely to the mast. Another problem they faced was the ""existing laws against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (@CAPS1 @NUM2), which added a legal hurdle to the docking plans. Also, the equipment used to dock the airships hadn't even been installed, further complicating the situation. All these factors combined made it very challenging to achieve the goal of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building."
1610	16443	6	3	"There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in an attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there in the @NUM1. The first obstacle was ""the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" If the builders had decided to do that, then the dirigible moored at the top of the building would add significant stress to the building's frame, which could also jeopardize the lives of all the tourists who visited and everyone who worked there. There was also the fact that ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" This meant the frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened. Something like that didn't come cheap; in fact, ""Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" In all, the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was a failure. The most obvious reason being safety since most dirigibles outside the United States used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. The end result is, today the rooms that were set aside for baggage are now the world's highest soda fountain and tea garden, and the highest observation deck has never been open to the public, a testament to the unsuccessful docking plans."
1611	16444	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous challenges in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. One significant obstacle was that dirigibles couldn't simply land on top of the building. A thousand - foot dirigible, when placed on the building, would add substantial stress to the frame of the building. They would have to carefully ""transmit"" the load and the wind pressure to the foundation which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. To address this, the builders had to make over @MONEY1 worth of costly modifications. Another reason was nature. As clearly stated in paragraph @NUM1, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting"". Due to these unpredictable winds, the dirigible could not be properly tethered down because the lead weights would be dangling precariously above pedestrians. A final obstacle was an already existing law. The law strictly prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas. This legal restriction made it completely illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building. These insurmountable obstacles ensured that the mooring mast was destined to never fulfill its intended purpose."
1612	16445	6	3	"In attempting to dock dirigibles at the Empire State Building, many complex problems were faced. One problem was detailed in paragraph nine where it clearly states, ""A thousand - foot dirigible at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add significant stress to the building's frame."" If they did build the dirigible dock, they would have to thoroughly reinforce the whole building so it would not collapse under the additional weight and pressure. Another problem was that most dirigibles used hydrogen, not helium. Since hydrogen is highly flammable, they could not take the risk of a dirigible blowing up over a heavily populated area like New York City. A more challenging problem was the weather, specifically the wind, at @NUM1 feet. The air currents were extremely violent at that altitude, causing the dirigible to swivel around the mooring mast uncontrollably. Dirigibles usually land in an open field where they can be safely anchored by lead. According to the excerpt, having lead weights dangling high above pedestrians on the street was neither practical nor safe. Lastly, the most major problem was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. In paragraph @NUM2, it is evident that the law made it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. Even though the dirigible dock was a great idea in theory, too many problems were in conflict with the mooring mast for it to go into full effect. On the brighter side, it made the Empire State Building the tallest in the world, a significant achievement in its own right."
1613	16446	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced a multitude of obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. One major problem was that they had to strengthen the rest of the building in order to safely put the mast at the top. This process would be extremely costly, as the author specifically says ""over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" Another problem in the attempt of allowing dirigibles to dock there was the strong winds at the top of the building. The air currents were very violent at that high altitude. As described, ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" This constant swiveling would pose a great danger to people on the streets of the city. Finally, the laws of the city presented a significant hurdle to the plan for the mooring mast. The law clearly stated that it was illegal for an airship to fly too low over urban areas. If the dirigible was able to dock on the mooring mast, it would be breaking this law. The builders of the Empire State Building faced many complex problems, and unfortunately, their plan never actually followed through, leaving the mooring mast without fulfilling its intended function."
1614	16447	6	3	"The Empire State Building faced various significant obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Most importantly was the grave danger involved in this ambitious plan. Blimps from outside the @LOCATION3 commonly used hydrogen, a highly flammable gas, instead of helium. After a German dirigible was tragically destroyed in a fire, the owners of the Empire State Building clearly saw the true dangers of a similar accident occurring in downtown New York, a densely populated area. Successful use of the mooring mast was another major obstacle. The winds at such a high altitude were extremely strong and made it extremely difficult to dock the dirigibles. Once docked, the dirigibles would have to dangle above pedestrians, which, as described, was ""neither practical nor safe"". The existing law against airships flying too low in urban areas created further problems. After the Los Angeles dirigible failed to reach the mooring mast because of the high winds, the owners started to fully recognize the unsolved problems. By the late 1930's, the idea of using the mooring mast for dirigible docking had ""quietly disappeared"", as it became clear that the obstacles were insurmountable."
1615	16448	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, The Mooring Mast, by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, building a mooring mast on the Empire State Building was hindered by many formidable obstacles that the builders had to face. Firstly, the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would severely hurt the building's frame. Builders addressed this problem by making ""over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications... to the building's framework"" (page @NUM1 paragraph @NUM2). After the mast's construction, two more significant obstacles arose. Firstly, most dirigibles used hydrogen, which is very flammable. After the German dirigible Hindenburg was catastrophically destroyed by fire, the builders clearly realized the great danger in letting that same type of accident happen in densely populated New York City. The mast's greatest obstacle was ""nature itself"". Since the winds on top of the building were always shifting due to air currents, the back of the dirigible would swivel around the mast erratically. Builders thought of using lead weights to fix this problem, but having dangling weights high above pedestrians on the street ""was neither practical nor safe"". The last and most obvious obstacle was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. Though the builders and owners were able to overcome the first obstacle given from the construction of the mooring mast on the Empire State Building, future obstacles proved to be too difficult to overcome, preventing the mooring mast from fulfilling its intended purpose."
1616	16449	6	3	The people who built the Empire State Building had numerous problems during its construction. One significant obstacle to the expanded use of airships in New York was the lack of a suitable landing area. The Empire State Building was planned to have a mooring mast at its top for docking these new airships. These airships would accommodate passengers on both already existing transatlantic routes and new routes that were yet to be established.
1617	16450	6	3	Some of the challenges the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there are as follows. The dirigibles were docked by means of an electric winch, which would haul in a line from the front of the ship and then tie it into the mast. Also, the dirigible's body could swing in the breeze, yet passengers could safely get on and off the dirigible by walking down a gangplank to an open observation platform. Finally, the architects and engineers of the Empire State Building carefully consulted with experts, taking detailed tours of the equipment and mooring operations at the U.S. Naval air Station in Lakehurst, New Jersey, to address these issues.
1618	16451	6	3	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were cost and safety. The steel frame of the building would have to be extensively modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation, and it would cost over a substantial amount. Another obstacle was that most of the countries outside the U.S. use hydrogen, which is highly flammable. Another obstacle was that ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents,"" which made it unsafe. These were some of the major obstacles they had to overcome, and in the end, these factors significantly affected the feasibility of the docking plan."
1619	16452	6	3	In order to build the Empire State Building, some of the workers endured various problems while constructing it. The engineers and architects first consulted with the experts. The obstacles the builders had to face were, firstly, the height. It was a thousand feet, and this height was putting a great deal of stress on the building's frame. Wind pressure also added significant stress to the one - thousand - foot building. Another big obstacle was nature itself. The winds were constantly shifting due to the violent air currents. Even when the mooring mast was tethered or tied up, the back part of the ship would sway from the wind. In the end, the author says or implies that it was never meant to be built because of all the complex problems that came with it, making the construction and the dirigible - docking plan extremely challenging.
1620	16453	6	3	"The future of allowing dirigibles to dock on the top of the Empire State Building became unrealistic when issues of safety came forward and when test runs did not go as expected. Some dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium, which could be highly flammable. ""The owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse an accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area."" By placing a dock in the heart of New York City, it was risking the lives of too many passengers and citizens. When the dock was in place at the top of the Empire State Building, two dirigibles tried landing, but both times it was a failure. There were multiple problems during landing, one being the wind. ""The dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds."" These various dangers ultimately stopped this plan from becoming a reality."
1621	16454	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State building faced a few main obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock atop the building. These three main obstacles were the designing of the mast and the necessary building modifications, safety concerns, and existing laws regarding aircrafts. The designing of the mast was a significant obstacle because when a dirigible was moored to the mast, it would add substantial stress to the building's frame. The load and pressure from the moored dirigible had to be effectively transmitted to the base of the building, and they faced ""over sixty thousand dollar's worth of modifications"" to achieve this. One of the other crucial problems was, most importantly, safety. As the article states, most countries used hydrogen in their balloons to stay afloat, unlike the United States which used helium. This was extremely dangerous as hydrogen is highly flammable, and the building owners did not want a repeat of the tragic Hindenburg accident when a German dirigible was destroyed by fire. Also, a dirigible had to be properly weighted down; otherwise, it would spin around the mast, and the commonly used lead weights were a hazard for pedestrians below. The last main obstacle for the Empire State building's builders was the existing law banning airships from flying low above urban areas. It would be illegal for a dirigible to approach the area, let alone tether to the building. These are the three main obstacles which the builders faced in building the Empire State building and its mast. Design, safety, and legal issues all proved to be too much for the builders, ultimately preventing the successful implementation of the dirigible docking plan."
1622	16455	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building had to deal with multiple problems involving safety. Due to Al Smith's desire to build a building larger than the Chrysler Building, he decided to put a mooring mast for dirigibles on top of his. Before the construction of the mooring mast could commence, the building's frame had to be carefully modified. Simply placing the mast on top would stress the frame to such an extent that it could bring the building down. Another significant issue was the landing of the dirigibles themselves. On flat land, dirigibles could be weighed down, but on top of a building, there were many people below who could be injured if something went wrong during the landing process. There was even a strict law against dirigibles flying too low over urban areas, which the builders had to find a way around. The biggest obstacle seemed to be ensuring the safety of the people. In the end, these safety - related problems posed a major challenge to the builders' plans for the dirigible mooring mast.
1623	16456	6	3	In the process of building the Empire State Building, the architects encountered many obstacles. One main obstacle was making the foundation strong enough. Specifically, in order for the dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, they had to strengthen the entire foundation. If a dirigible docked before the foundation was properly strengthened, the whole building would twist and sway, endangering its structural integrity. Another problem was the wind. The wind coming off of other nearby buildings would spin the dirigibles at high rates of speed, making it extremely difficult and dangerous to dock them. Even though they faced these numerous obstacles, through hard work and innovative engineering solutions, they successfully completed the Empire State Building, a remarkable feat of architecture despite the challenges.
1624	16457	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when attempting to add a dirigible docking station at the top of the building. As it says in paragraph @NUM1, ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" Wind could cause a serious safety hazard by violently spinning the back of the docked dirigible around. Also, dirigibles are highly flammable. If an explosion similar to the Hindenburg disaster took place at the top of the Empire State Building, it would have been a catastrophic event, endangering countless lives and causing extensive damage to the building. Attempting to moor a dirigible at the top of the building was not only dangerous; it was illegal. As stated in paragraph @NUM2, ""There was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" The fact that mooring a dirigible was illegal and extremely dangerous was not the only obstacle that builders faced. It was also a daunting task. Builders would have to learn new and complex technologies for operating the system at the U.S. Naval Air Station. After thorough research, builders realized that they would have to strengthen the frame significantly. As mentioned in paragraph @NUM3, ""Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" The numerous obstacles the builders faced, including safety, legal, and technical issues, proved to be enough reason to never use the mooring for dirigibles at the Empire State Building."
1625	16458	6	3	In their attempts to build a platform for dirigibles to dock at, the builders of the Empire State Building failed to note a few difficulties. One would be the way passengers got on and off of dirigibles. When the dirigible was anchoring to refuel and allowing passengers to board and disembark, the rear of the blimp would constantly swivel. This swiveling motion could endanger the passengers as they tried to move between the dirigible and the building, and it could also possibly cause the dirigible to get damaged or even destroyed. Another difficulty was the way the mast was built. It had a design similar to that of a rocket, which meant it was not possible for dirigibles to completely land. If it had a platform - like design, dirigibles could land instead of just hovering. This would have allowed for more stability during the docking process, making it safer and more practical for passengers and the dirigible itself. Overall, these unforeseen difficulties contributed to the ineffectiveness of the dirigible docking platform at the Empire State Building.
1626	16459	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in their ambitious attempt to allow dirigibles to dock on the mooring mast. To achieve this, the builders had to painstakingly consult with aviation and engineering experts. They also took in - depth tours of the specialized equipment used in building mooring masts, understanding how land dirigibles were serviced. They aimed to create a workable arrangement that would ensure safe docking. Moreover, they had to modify the building to provide proper support for the mast. In preparation for the construction of the mast, the architects first took detailed tours of the advanced equipment at the @ORGANIZATION1. The builders also had a serious meeting with the president of an airship transport company that had a well - known service offering across the vast expanse of the Pacific Ocean. Creating a workable arrangement was no easy feat. It was extremely difficult and tedious to figure out “on some safe way of mooring ships to this mast.” The foundation of the building was a crucial factor as well because, as experts pointed out, “the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof.” Over @MONEY1 in extensive modifications to the frame and foundation of the building had to be carried out. All of these challenges were significant obstacles in the way of architects building a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building, but it showed their determination to make the daring plan a reality.
1627	16460	6	3	The builders of the Empire State building faced many complex obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One major obstacle the architects faced was the building's frame. They needed to carefully design the landing area in a very precise way. If a dirigible landed there, it shouldn't add too much extra stress to the building's frame, which was the backbone of the entire structure. Another problem was the stress of the load, and wind pressure. In paragraph @NUM1, the author says “The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below.” This clearly shows why the dirigible's load and the wind's pressure are such a significant problem. These forces could potentially compromise the stability of the building. Finally, after the builders thoroughly figured out that they needed to make various adjustments, they also realized they had to strengthen the building's steel frame. “Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of costly modifications had to be made,” which is a substantial amount of money. Those are the numerous obstacles that the architects of the Empire State Building faced while trying to allow dirigibles to dock there, highlighting the complexity of the task.
1628	16461	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building had to overcome many formidable obstacles so the dirigibles could safely dock at the top to refuel or repair. People were initially extremely thrilled for this innovative idea, yet they were well - aware of how arduous this task would be. First of all, the building plan had to be completely redone due to the Chrysler building's builders' sneaky tactic of trying to make their building taller than the Empire State Building. Al Smith, a determined figure, was not going to let that happen. So, he decided to make the @CAPS1.S.B. even taller, reaching an impressive height of 1,250 ft. Secondly, the builders had to come up with a well - thought - out way to build the dock on a stable platform because it was highly unstable on the flat roof. This served as a major obstacle because at such a great height, construction work is extremely difficult to carry out safely. Al Smith was more than determined, and his enthusiasm enlightened the workers. As stated in paragraph @NUM1, “over sixty thousand dollars” worth of significant modifications had to be made to the building's framework (L¸sted, @NUM1). Also, the dock or landing dock could not be used depending on the weather conditions. The dirigibles, being so close to the city, building, and civilians, were extremely dangerous when swaying around. The author says, “some were as long as one thousand feet, the same length as four blocks in New York City” (6). There were strong and violent wind currents that could make the dirigibles sway erratically around the mooring mast. Last of all, an existing strict law against airships flying that low over urban areas was in place. This is a major contributor to the failed attempt. Being prohibited and breaking the law would get many involved in the project in serious trouble. All in all, the attempt made by the architects of the Empire State Building proved their dedication and good intentions, but their ideas were too impractical and irrational for the dock to become successful in society.
1629	16462	6	3	In the excerpt from, “The @CAPS1 Mast”, by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, it was clearly mentioned that architects faced numerous challenges when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. One significant obstacle they faced was the fact that they used hydrogen instead of helium as the lifting gas. In the excerpt, it specifically stated that hydrogen is highly flammable. @CAPS2, if something went wrong, it could turn into a huge disaster in a highly populated area like New York, with thousands of people at risk. The main problem they faced was the nature itself. It said “The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents.” The dirigible had the potential to swivel around the mast in an unpredictable manner. With all the pedestrians bustling below, this was extremely dangerous as a swinging dirigible could cause serious harm. These challenges are what led to the fate of the mooring mast not being used as originally planned, despite the initial hopes and efforts.
1630	16463	6	3	It was truly unfortunate that such a great and innovative idea was never able to succeed. The builders of the Empire State building were faced with many complex difficulties when trying to allow dirigibles to dock on the building. First, they had to design the Mask, which, as one can imagine, was a long and extremely complicated process. They had to consider every aspect of the docking mechanism, from the connection with the dirigible to the impact on the building. Everything seemed as if it was going to work out. The builders were full of hope and started the construction with enthusiasm. After two months of hard - working construction, the mooring mast was not able to fulfill its intended purpose for several reasons. Hydrogen, which was used in the dirigibles, is highly flammable and far too dangerous to use in such a highly populated area like New York City. Things such as the strong wind and the unpredictable nature itself would have made this wonderful idea impossible to execute safely. There were also strict laws that would have never allowed for this to happen anyway. If the builders and planners had done more in - depth research, they would have found this project to have been impossible before going through all the intense and costly construction. This shows that proper research and foresight are essential in large - scale and innovative projects.
1631	16464	6	3	"The first obstacle that the can builders faced was the fact that the long - held idea of the Empire State Building being the tallest construct in New York City had been shattered. This unexpected change led them to subsequently face more obstacles as their plan expanded. When the design to make the construct of the plan was finally complete, they began to face more potential problems. The first being it was not logical or probable to ""drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof"" (line @NUM1). For, in doing this, the amount of stress it would induce on to the frame would be monstrous. Hence, it was concluded the stress would have to be transmitted through the building's foundation, which to the builders' dismay was 11 hundred ft. below. This resulted in @MONEY1 worth of costly modifications to the foundation. Another obstacle that was faced was the wind pressure. ""Los Angeles approached the mooring mass but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds"" (line @NUM2). In the end, these obstacles made the project extremely challenging."
1632	16465	6	3	"While constructing the Empire State Building, the builders were faced with many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. To begin, there were the dangers of allowing dirigibles that were made outside of the United States. Many non - American dirigibles were made up of hydrogen, which is much more flammable compared to the United States' helium balloons. To avoid a repeat of the explosion of a dirigible, L¸sted states, ""the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse the accident could have been if it had taken place above.. Downtown New York."" Additionally, the winds at the top of the building were too wild to attach a dirigible safely to the top. The author clarifies, ""Even if the dirigibles were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around... the back could be weighted down with lead weights, but using these was neither practical nor safe."" This shows that in order to have the ship still enough to be able to moor it was dangerous. Lastly, a law was passed making it impossible to fly close enough to the building to be able to moor. Marcia Amidon L¸sted says, ""An existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This makes the possibility of landing a dirigible on the Empire State Building illegal, effectively dashing the hopes of this docking plan."
1633	16466	6	3	One of the obvious reasons is the height at which all this taking place. The strong, always - changing winds were a significant problem because it would make the back of the blimp sway from side to side violently. Another problem was trying to stop the swaying of the ship. They consulted putting lead weights, but hanging weights above pedestrians on busy streets is not safe at all. Another reason was that it was against the law to fly aircrafts too low to the ground. These are just some of the reasons why this idea of having dirigibles dock at that location wasn't going to work. In conclusion, these factors combined made the plan unfeasible.
1634	16467	6	3	Even beginning to build the dock of the Empire State Building was a mistake. What first appeared to be a worthwhile and realistic idea ended up being potentially horrific if it failed. One obstacle the builders faced in an attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there was the law that did not allow airships flying low over urban areas. It would be even illegal to continuously have ships closely over pedestrians on the busy sidewalks below. Another obstacle they faced was the unsafeness of it all. The winds at that height are constantly different and could cause the dirigibles to move around erratically. Having airships dock at the Empire State Building was potentially dangerous as well as illegal, making the project an unwise venture.
1635	16468	6	3	The builders of the Empire State building faced a lot of obstacles. One problem they had was when, and if, they landed, getting an area for the people to get on and off. They had to make the platform bigger also to accommodate the passengers safely. When the dirigibles landed, it was usually because they needed more fuel. Typically, it would only be a couple of hours they were stopped. However, these issues added to the complexity of the project and made it difficult to implement the docking plan successfully.
1636	16469	6	3	"During the construction of the Empire State Building, the builders encountered numerous obstacles when trying to enable dirigibles to dock there. One significant obstacle was that the builders couldn't simply install a mooring mast on the top of the Empire State Building. A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would impose excessive stress on the building's frame. This stress could potentially compromise the structural integrity of the entire building over time. Another problem the workers faced was that they would have to completely change the entire design of the building to accommodate the mooring dock. This would involve complex engineering and construction work, adding significant time and cost to the project. The largest reason why the dock didn't work out was safety. The author writes that ""most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium."" This means that the dirigibles were highly flammable, and if one exploded over the densely populated New York, it would have extremely serious repercussions, endangering countless lives and causing massive property damage. All of these reasons are why the mooring dock never came to life on top of the Empire State building."
1637	16470	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of those obstacles was that many dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen instead of helium. This was a major problem because, as stated, ""hydrogen is highly flammable"" (para. @NUM1). Docking dirigibles that used hydrogen instead of helium had been proven extremely dangerous by the German Hindenburg when it was destroyed in a catastrophic fire. If anything similar occurred over New York, a bustling and densely populated city, the results would be truly horrible, causing widespread destruction and loss of life. A second obstacle faced in allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was another safety concern. The point was brought up that ""winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (para. @NUM2). These unpredictable wind shifts would make it extremely unsafe for the passengers on board the dirigible, increasing the risk of accidents during docking and disembarking. A third obstacle faced is the fact that there was a law against airships flying too low over areas such as New York. That law made it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. Those are three obstacles the builders faced when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building."
1638	16471	6	3	"When designing the Empire State Building, architect Al Smith had the idea of futuristic Dirigible travel in mind. However, he faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at this giant building, as described in The Mooring Mast. Mooring a dirigible to the top of it ""... would add stress to the building's frame."" In order to allow dirigibles to dock, Smith had to modify the building's frame by transmitting pressure all the way down to the foundation. This required careful engineering and construction work to ensure the building could withstand the additional stress. Smith also faced the issue of foreign balloons; most of which used the highly flammable hydrogen instead of helium. A fire caused by a dirigible docked to the Empire State Building would rapidly spread to the city, endangering the lives of countless people and causing extensive property damage. Smith found that nature caused problems as well. Due to the changing winds atop the building, ""... the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast,"" endangering pedestrians below. Because of all these obstacles, the idea of a dirigible mooring was given up, but the mast remains today as a reminder of the ambitious yet unfeasible plan."
1639	16472	6	3	The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced were quite challenging. Firstly, the building was at a height of @NUM1 feet, which presented difficulties in terms of wind conditions and accessibility. Secondly, it was unclear how the passengers would be able to get on and off the dirigible safely at such a great height. Thirdly, dirigibles take a long time to slow down, which would require a large area for approach and docking, something the building's location might not easily provide. The building is said to be 102 floors high with an observation deck on the 101st floor and a boarding/observation deck on the 102nd floor for the blimp passengers. Some more major obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building had faced were so intense they are hard to explain. One was how to dock the blimps effectively, considering the building's structure and the characteristics of the dirigibles. Another was how many blimps could dock there at one time, taking into account space limitations and safety regulations. These obstacles ultimately made it very difficult to implement the plan of dirigible docking at the Empire State Building.
1640	16473	6	3	"In the excerpt, ""The @CAPS1 Mast,"" by @PERSON1, the architects of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the problems the builders encountered was that the dirigible didn't have a suitable landing area. The architects concluded that they couldn't just drop a @CAPS1 mast on top of their building, because it would add stress to its frame. So, they had to strengthen and modify the building's structure in a complex and time - consuming process to make it work. Another obstacle was the fact that most dirigibles ran on hydrogen, which is highly flammable. The builders realized how dangerous that could be, especially above a densely populated area such as downtown New York. A hydrogen - fueled dirigible explosion could cause a large - scale disaster. They also realized that nature itself was their biggest obstacle. Winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, and these unpredictable wind patterns made docking extremely difficult and unsafe. Lastly, there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas, which would make their idea illegal and unsuccessful. Due to all these insurmountable obstacles, the plan to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building had to be abandoned."
1641	16474	6	3	@CAPS1, also known as blimps, were once thought of as the future of transportation. These airships were like balloons, yet they were made of steel, incorporated rubbers, and were equipped with propellers to maintain control. These steel balloons could reach speeds of up to eighty miles per hour. The main reason the Empire State Building couldn't dock these airships was that most @CAPS1 from outside the United States used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable, and its use could lead to dangerous accidents, which made docking them at the building unfeasible.
1642	16475	6	3	When the construction of the Mooring Mast on the Empire State Building was completed, the builders started to encounter problems that should have been obvious right from the start. One of the issues was a U.S. law that prohibits aircraft from flying close to or around cities and buildings. This meant that they wouldn't be able to tether the blimps to the mast. Additionally, the highly violent and constantly changing weather and wind conditions posed a significant problem. The strong winds would blow the blimps around, and they couldn't be weighed down with lead blocks as on land because having them hang over the city was not safe. With the erratic winds, the blimps (most of which were filled with hydrogen) could be punctured and set ablaze, endangering the people on the ground. Despite these obvious problems, one might think they wouldn't have attempted it. However, these obstacles were never overcome, and the mooring mast still sits unused to this day.
1643	16476	6	3	"The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION2 focuses on the Empire State Building and the high expectations people had for it. In @DATE1, it was officially announced that the Empire State Building would reach a height of 1,250 feet. The purpose of this selection is to show that the builders of the Empire State Building were trying to turn another idea into reality. While attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, the builders faced several obstacles. For instance, the building was not stable enough to support the dirigibles, so additional framework would be needed. There were also potential dangers associated with making this idea a reality. As stated, ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would add too much stress to the building's frame."" Due to this added stress, ""the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened."" Then, when a dirigible was destroyed, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse it could have been if such an incident had occurred in a place like downtown @CAPS1. It's fortunate that they didn't proceed with the idea."
1644	16477	6	3	"In The Mooring Mast, by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. The Mast was doomed to fail even before construction began. The most significant reason the mast never functioned properly was safety. The hydrogen used in most dirigibles is highly flammable. If an accident were to happen, it would occur over downtown New York. As noted, ""The owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) Nature itself presented one of the greatest challenges to the successful use of the Mast. Violent air currents and strong winds made it extremely difficult to fly a dirigible near the building. As described, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" (@CAPS1 @NUM2) The Mooring Mast was fated to fail from the start. The primary reasons for its failure were the air currents and safety concerns, which ultimately prevented the dirigibles from ever landing there."
1645	16478	6	3	"While attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, the builders encountered multiple obstacles. One major hurdle was the lack of a suitable landing area. Al Smith proposed that if a mooring mast was added to the top of the building, dirigibles could anchor there to refuel and embark and disembark passengers. Another obstacle was that dirigibles from outside the United States typically used hydrogen instead of helium, which is extremely flammable. The owners of the Empire State Building were concerned that it wouldn't be safe if a dirigible caught fire with a densely populated area directly below. The most significant obstacle was the interaction between the use of the mooring mast and nature. As stated, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The owners of the Empire State Building believed that if something went wrong, the dirigible would be left dangling above pedestrians on the street, which was a very unsafe situation. In conclusion, these obstacles made it impossible for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building."
1646	16479	6	3	"Many obstacles occurred while the builders of the Empire State Building attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there. The stress exerted by the blimps docking on the building would be excessive. As noted, ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation"". Another significant problem was that dirigibles were highly flammable, and in such a densely - populated area of New York, it ""was neither practical nor safe"". Additionally, laws against airships flying too low over urban areas worked against the idea. Despite these challenges, two dirigibles did attempt to reach the building before the entire idea was ultimately dropped."
1647	16480	6	3	"The construction workers faced many obstacles in building the Empire State Building. One of those major obstacles was height. Since they aimed to make the building the tallest in the world, they had to ensure that there was sufficient advanced technology available to achieve this feat. Also, they decided to add an extra seventeen floors to the building, making it 102 floors instead of its original planned number of floors. Another crucial obstacle was its safety issues. The construction workers failed to thoroughly check into the problems associated with building the mooring mast. In paragraph @NUM2, the author states, ""The as yet unsolved problems of mooring airships to a fixed mass at such a height made it advisable to postpone to a later date the final installation of the landing gear."" The author is trying to convey that when designing the production of the mooring mast, they overlooked certain issues that led them to set back the final date. Due to these obstacles, the construction team managed to succeed in building the tallest building, the Empire State Building, which stands as a remarkable achievement in architecture."
1648	16481	6	3	"The Empire State Building faced obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles, ""enormous steel - framed balloons"" commonly called blimps, to dock there. One of the main issues was the substantial pressure on the building caused by the dirigibles. As said in the excerpt The @CAPS1 @CAPS2, by @ORGANIZATION2, ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" (paragraph @NUM1). To address this, over @MONEY1 worth of modifications were made to strengthen and accommodate for this new situation of dirigibles docking at the building. However, despite these efforts, there were still other challenges that made the idea of regular dirigible docking difficult to realize."
1649	16482	6	3	One obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building faced in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock was that the stress from the mass of the dirigible and wind pressure would all be transmitted to the building's foundation. The frame of the building would have to be significantly strengthened to accommodate this new situation. There were also serious safety reasons. Since most dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable, if something were to happen and the dirigible was to catch fire, the fire could potentially destroy New York City because it's so densely populated. The biggest obstacle was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. If the dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast, making it extremely difficult and dangerous to dock. Due to these insurmountable obstacles, the plan to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was ultimately abandoned.
1650	16483	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. While designing the mast, the architects encountered problems including wind pressure, safety, and practicality. The frame was not strong enough to withstand the stress and wind pressure from the load of the dirigible. The foundation of the building, which was approximately @NUM1 feet below, would have had to be extensively strengthened and modified if it was going to be able to handle the movement of the dirigible attached by a single cable tether. Safety was the greatest obstacle that the builders faced. Most dirigibles used hydrogen to make them lighter than air. However, this hydrogen was highly flammable, causing many potential dangers. Since New York City is such a thickly - settled area, the risk of a fire was too great to take. Finally, instead of dirigibles landing in open fields, they would have to dock eleven hundred feet above the ground. In the words of Marcia Amidon L¸sted, ""using these (dirigibles) at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe."" As a result, the plan to allow regular dirigible docking at the Empire State Building was not pursued further."
1651	16484	6	3	There were three main obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there: the densely populated area, the violent air currents, and the existing law against airships. First, most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. Since the dock would be above downtown New York, a densely - populated area, there is a significantly higher risk of the dock blowing up due to the large number of people and structures below. Secondly, nature was a great obstacle. There were strong winds on top of the building and the wind currents were constantly changing violently. There was a gigantic fear of the dirigible swiveling around and hitting another nearby building, which could cause a large - scale disaster. Finally, the dock could never allow a ship to be tied up legally due to the existing law of airships flying too low over urban areas. The dirigible would not be safe, and the entire idea of allowing dirigibles to dock would have to be dropped. For these reasons or obstacles, many builders of the Empire State Building faced difficulties while attempting to allow blimps to dock there.
1652	16485	6	3	"The architects had their hands full when building the addition to the Empire State Building. There were multiple obstacles that needed to be overcome when they started building. They had to make sure the dirigibles were safe enough, taking into account factors such as the integrity of the structure and the stability of the docking mechanism. They also had to take in consideration the winds that are constantly changing, which could affect the approach and docking of the dirigibles. These problems were part of why the plans were put to a halt. Certain weather conditions were a big part of the safety procedures that took place. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" The winds would make the ship sway back and forth, which would be extremely dangerous for both the dirigible and the building. Another problem was that many foreign ships ran on hydrogen which is flammable, and having such a ship docked above a busy city like New York would be a high - risk situation. ""Many dirigibles outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" Due to these issues, the plans for the addition faced significant challenges."
1653	16486	6	3	The builders had to go through many obstacles to succeed in allowing the dirigible to dock on the Empire State Building. The first thing that was a problem was getting it to the top of the Empire State Building. They said the strong wind made it really hard to get the dirigible up there without it popping, as the wind could cause excessive stress on the dirigible's structure. There was also the safety of it being up there. There was already an incident where another dirigible caught on fire, highlighting the potential danger. The gases inside are really flammable and that would make a really big problem if there was an accident, endangering people on the ground and in the building. The last thing that they had to consider was if airships were too low. If the dirigible was too close to the building or the ground, it could pop due to various factors like hitting an object or sudden pressure changes. For all those reasons, they had to carefully consider them to succeed in allowing the dirigible on the Empire State Building.
1654	16487	6	3	"Having the Empire State Building dock and hold dirigibles brought up some hefty problems for the builders. Most of the problems resided among the idea of a mast. Al Smith knew that the mast would put too much pressure on the building frame, potentially compromising the structural integrity of the Empire State Building. Another issue was the balloon itself. Besides the U.S., most dirigibles were made of hydrogen rather than helium. The hydrogen made it much more dangerous to have in the crowded downtown New York area, because hydrogen was much more flammable. A small spark could lead to a large - scale explosion. A third obstacle was the winds. As said, ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" These unpredictable winds made it difficult to control the dirigible during docking and while it was moored. It was also illegal to fly/hold or dock an aircraft so close to the ground. The docking and holding of the dirigibles at the Empire State Building brought many issues and dilemmas, making it hard to carry out such a risky idea for such a tall building."
1655	16488	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building were challenged with significant obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One example was that the architects had to address the potential problem of the ""existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This law clearly would prohibit and make it ""illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"". Dirigibles were designed to be ""moored in open landing fields"" and ""could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the busy street, was neither practical nor safe."" Another example of an obstacle that the builders of the Empire State Building faced was the potential risk to passengers and resident safety. The reason the landing of dirigibles were a potential threat to the entire population of New York City was that ""most dirigibles from outside the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" The owners of the Empire State Building saw these potential risks ""when the German dirigible ""Hindenburg"" was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey."" Also, another obstacle of placing a mooring mast among one of the world's tallest buildings was ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Due to the unpredictable winds, the dirigible could sway and ""swivel around and around the mooring mast"", which could damage the dirigible and the building. The architects of the Empire State Building were threatened by the possible obstacles of constructing a mooring mast atop the building, and these challenges made the plan of allowing dirigibles to dock very difficult to execute."
1656	16489	6	3	"Throughout the short story The Mooring Mast, the dedicated builders faced numerous and complex obstacles to bring their ambitious vision to fruition. For example, the skilled workers had to meticulously design a mast that would effectively take ""the stress of the dirigible's load"" (@NUM1). The cable at the top was found to not be able to maintain the intense stress the dirigible would produce. So, the experienced engineers had to painstakingly develop a new solution to distribute the weight of the dirigible evenly. This arduous process cost them a significant amount of time and money due to the massive height of the Empire State Building. The creative architects also had to conduct extra in - depth research to develop the mast. The hard - working workers took detailed tours of the U.S. Naval Air Station and had in - depth meetings with the president of the airship transport company just so they could be absolutely sure the dirigibles would land in a safe and secure way. These numerous obstacles had to be faced in order to pursue their initially unrealistic dream, but unfortunately, despite their efforts, many challenges remained insurmountable."
1657	16490	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building had many formidable challenges. One of these significant challenges was the complex task of trying to get the frame of the building to support the dirigible. As stated, ""The stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted to the frame."" This required careful engineering and structural planning. Another problem faced by the builders was that there was a strict law against aircraft going that low. This was clearly stated @CAPS2 @NUM1, ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low in urban areas."" The biggest and most unforgiving obstacle was nature itself. The violent and unpredictable winds that high up would have caused the dirigibles to be unable to moor safely. As described, ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mast."" These were the substantial challenges the builders faced, which ultimately made the goal of dirigible docking at the Empire State Building extremely difficult to achieve."
1658	16491	6	3	The Empire State Building was intended to be the tallest building ever constructed. At the very top, there was to be an accessible docking station for dirigibles, known as mooring masts. The novel idea of having a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building led to extensive modifications of the whole building. It cost over sixty thousand dollars in detailed modifications to properly accommodate the mooring mast. This project was truly the first of its kind and encountered many significant obstacles, similar to the modifications. Some of those challenging obstacles included the violent and erratic air currents and the constant and unpredictable change in wind direction on top of the building. With these wind changes, the dirigible could easily swing around and hit the building or other nearby buildings and then fall on the densely populated New York City below. The proposed solution to this was to tie lead bricks to the tail of the dirigible, just like what is done in open fields when they land. Although the bricks could keep the tail from moving around, having them hang over a thousand feet above pedestrians was far from safe. In the end, the idea of docking dirigibles on the Empire State Building was abandoned due to the many serious problems that could potentially arise, and it became clear that the concept was not feasible.
1659	16492	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many difficult obstacles in the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. Those obstacles include: the lack of a suitable and well - defined landing area in @LOCATION1. A mooring mast was necessary to be installed at the top of the building so that dirigibles or blimps could anchor there for several hours for refueling, necessary services, and to let passengers on and off. The steel frame of the Empire State Building had to be carefully modified and significantly strengthened because a thousand - foot blimp mooring at the top of the building, held by a cable tether, would cause a great deal of stress to the building frame. The blimp's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all through the building's foundation, which was located somewhere about eleven hundred feet below. This required precise engineering and structural adjustments. The last obstacle in allowing blimps to dock at the Empire State Building was a strict law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it completely illegal for a dirigible to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area, effectively putting a halt to the docking plans.
1660	16493	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous and significant obstacles in allowing Dirigibles to dock. The most obvious one was the extremely high height at which they would dock. Al Smith states, ""The Empire State would reach the height of @NUM1 feet."" Moreover, many Dirigibles from outside the U.S. were extremely flammable. If one caught fire while moored to the top of the Empire State Building, the results would have been utterly catastrophic because it would occur over a densely populated area. Another major obstacle was the wind. If the ship was tethered to the mast, the back of it would constantly swivel around. Using lead weights to secure the back would neither be safe nor practical as it would pose risks to the people below and be difficult to manage. The last significant obstacle was a law that made flying a dirigible too low over an urban area illegal. No ship would be allowed to fly over downtown New York, which effectively prohibited dirigibles from docking at the Empire State Building. These multiple obstacles combined made the idea of dirigible docking at the building unworkable."
1661	16494	6	3	Al Smith, an ambitious visionary, faced numerous and complex obstacles in the intricate process of designing and building a mooring mast on top of the colossal Empire State building. Most of these daunting obstacles should have been carefully realized and analyzed even before the mast was initially built. One of the blatantly obvious obstacles was the ever - present and constant change in wind. The back of the blimp, being untethered, would end up swinging wildly around in the vast sky, posing a serious safety risk. Another significant obstacle was the design of the mast. This aspect was of utmost importance because if the mast was designed incorrectly, it would exert excessive stress on the building's structure and could potentially cause a great deal of irreparable damage. There was also a strict law regarding airships flying too low in urban areas, and New York, being a bustling urban area, was no exception. One of the most perilous reasons was that some blimps were filled with hydrogen, a highly flammable gas. Al Smith and his team of architects should have thoroughly realized and actively discussed these critical issues before constructing what ultimately became an unusable structure. If these discussions had taken place, a substantial amount of time and money would have been saved, and the project could have been more successful.
1662	16495	6	3	In this excerpt “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the determined builders of the Empire State building faced a multitude of challenging obstacles in their ambitious attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first significant obstacle was the intense competition to make the building taller than the Chrysler Building. They ingeniously overcame this by making the decision to add a top, or a “hat,” to the building. However, they then had to grapple with a new and complex situation. New modifications had to be carried out so that the dirigible would not impose excessive stress on the building's frame. The steel frame of the building simply could not withstand the heavy load and strong wind pressure that would transmit nearly 1,250 feet below. The biggest obstacles that ultimately led to the unfortunate fate of the mast were multi - faceted. Since most dirigibles outside of the United States used hydrogen, which was extremely flammable, they could not afford to have any accidents taking place above downtown New York. Nature itself emerged as the greatest obstacle. The constant shifting winds were a major problem. The dirigibles could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but having these weights dangling high above pedestrians on the busy streets was neither safe nor practical. There was also a strict law against airships flying too low over urban areas. These are the numerous and difficult obstacles that the builders faced in their valiant attempt to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State building, and unfortunately, these challenges proved insurmountable.
1663	16496	6	3	Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the insightful author of “The Mooring Mast,” not only vividly highlights the numerous safety hazards that the Empire State Building builders encountered while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there but also delves into a factual aspect dealing with laws and violations that firmly solidified the failure of such a transportation concept. Normally, dirigibles would moor in open and spacious landing fields and then be carefully weighted down to ensure that they remained motionless on the ground. However, since the builders of the Empire State Building were tempted to dock dirigibles 1,250 feet in the air, both nature and airspace laws came into play. The Empire State Building, rising an astonishing 102 floors high, was a remarkable feat in and of itself. The grand vision of dirigibles docking at such a great height by the builders was severely hampered by both the powerful forces of actual nature and legal disputes. The fact that dirigibles would have to dock at the top of the Empire State Building was not favored by nature. The winds in the airspace 1,250 feet in the air were not only incredibly strong but also constantly shifting due to violent and unpredictable air currents. These air currents were so forceful that even “the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles... could not get close enough to tie up.” It was simply too much of a safety hazard and a risky gamble to moor a dirigible when the winds were not cooperating. The most factual and practical problem the builders faced with the idea of docking dirigibles atop the Empire State building was a violation of an airspace law. The existing law clearly banned “air ships from flying too low over urban areas,” meaning that legally, it was a potential safety hazard to direct and dock a dirigible that high in the air. Without any certainty for success, the operation of docking dirigibles on the Empire State Building was halted in the late 1930s. Although the builders of the great Empire State Building could construct a 1,250 - foot skyscraper, the attempt to dock dirigibles upon the building failed mainly because of the numerous safety hazards and legal constraints they faced.
1664	16497	6	3	In the excerpt, “The Mooring Mast,” by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, Al Smith, a determined entrepreneur, had a grand ambition to make the tallest building in the vibrant city of New York. He managed to build a very tall structure, precisely 1,046 feet tall. However, the Empire State Building was later constructed even taller, reaching a height of 1,250 feet. It was essentially a fierce competition to see who would have the honor of having the tallest building in New York. A mooring mast was installed on top of each building to add more height. Unfortunately, the builders did not fully account for the balloons, or dirigibles, that passed through the air. Dirigibles are extremely flammable. If they were to accidentally come in contact with a mooring mast, it could lead to a catastrophic event, just like the tragic incident when “the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937.” The mast could have potentially caused huge chaos in New York if it had damaged a passing dirigible in the air. This oversight by the builders ultimately led to the impracticality of using the mooring mast for its intended purpose.
1665	16498	6	3	The greatest reason for the limited use of the mooring mast was centered around safety. Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is an extremely flammable gas. This posed a significant risk, especially in an urban environment like New York. The greatest obstacle to the effective use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly in a state of flux, shifting due to violent and powerful air currents. These unpredictable winds made it extremely difficult, if not impossible, to safely moor a dirigible. The combination of the flammable hydrogen in dirigibles and the unruly winds on top of the building created a situation where the use of the mooring mast was fraught with danger. In the end, these factors made it clear that the mooring mast was not a practical solution for docking dirigibles, and its use was severely restricted.
1666	16499	6	3	"When building the dock for dirigibles, Al Smith, with his limited foresight, was only able to think of a few obstacles that would come up. As it turns out, there were far more obstacles than he initially expected. One that was expected was that the building could be pulled over by the dirigibles, as clearly stated in paragraph @NUM1, third sentence. An obstacle that remained unknown until after the mast was built was that the violent shift in wind would cause the dirigibles to wrap itself around the mast. And to dangle weights off the back of it to prevent the wrapping was considered extremely unsafe, as described in paragraph fourteen, from the second sentence to the fourth. Another untold issue was the ""existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (paragraph @NUM2, first sentence), along with the fact that ""most dirigibles outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (paragraph @NUM3, second sentence). In the end, it became evident that the whole idea of a docking mast was not well - thought - out, and it ultimately faced insurmountable challenges."
1667	16500	6	3	"During the time of the @DATE1's, numerous obstacles came into play for the architects building a dirigible dock for them to land on top of the Empire State building. The builders had to grapple with difficult situations related to the weather conditions of this dock. The Empire State building was so high that ""The winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". These harsh weather conditions that were occurring high above this 1,250 - foot building made it extremely difficult for dirigibles to dock themselves, thus making the outcome highly unsafe. Builders also had to face the hard reality of ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"". With this law taking effect, it made it completely illegal for a dirigible to even attempt a landing on these docks. The main concern among the obstacles these builders constructing this landing dock faced would be the strong winds that would occur. The winds were so powerful and strong that the blimp would face ""the sharp spires of other buildings in the area, which would puncture the dirigible's shell"". This obstacle of weather was a huge struggle for these architects, leading to the unsuccessful docking of these dirigibles. In the end, the obstacles that were faced in constructing this dock led to the outcome of dirigibles being ""given away to airplanes"", marking the end of the dirigible - docking dream at the Empire State building."
1668	16501	6	3	Based on the excerpt, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were significant. One major obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. Al Smith, however, saw a great opportunity for his Empire State Building to have a mooring mast added to the top of the building. This mooring mast would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, or to let passengers off and on. Dirigibles were docked by means of an electric winch, which carefully hauled in a line from the front of the ship and then securely tied it to a mast. In conclusion, these are the key obstacles which the builders of the Empire State Building faced in their attempt to allow dirigibles to be docked, and they presented a complex challenge to the realization of this ambitious plan.
1669	16502	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, there were many challenging obstacles that the builders of the @ORGANIZATION1 encountered as they were attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Al Smith, the four - term governor of New York, was extremely determined to outstrip the Chrysler building by making the Empire State Building much taller. He had lofty goals where the building ""would be equipped for an age of transportation that was then only the dream of aviation pioneers"". The first obstacle involved their expanded use in New York City, which was the glaring lack of a suitable landing area. Al Smith, however, saw it as a golden opportunity to have a mooring mast added to the top of the building. This mast would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers off and on. Al Smith's strong ambitions to enhance the building's height encouraged him to bravely overcome this obstacle. Another problem with this, however, was actually constructing the mast, which led to a new and difficult obstacle. Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications were painstakingly done to the Empire State Building because they couldn't have a thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building. If the dirigible was held by a single cable tether, it would add excessive stress to the building's frame. Even though this was a major obstacle, the modifications to the building had successfully adjusted this problem, and the builders were finally able to create the mast. As the progress of the Empire State continued, more difficulties kept arising, which made Al Smith's goals much farther away. Not knowing the fate of the mooring mast on the Empire State Building, the builders realized afterwards that the mast's purpose became obsolete. The issue here was mainly safety, as ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"". They noticed after the mast's construction that it could have been a terrible tragedy to have a dirigible go in flames above the densely populated city. Another important obstacle that interfered in attempting to dock dirigibles above the Empire State was nature itself. It was stated that ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". The builders knew that weighing down the back of a dirigible would be very unsafe because of the pedestrians below. Even with all these obstacles, the builders of the Empire State Building continued to try to allow dirigibles to dock there, but over time the idea had gradually faded away and they basically gave up on the project. Al Smith's goals were left unfulfilled because of the challenging obstacles, but in the end, he did manage to establish the Empire State Building as the tallest in @ORGANIZATION5, leaving a lasting mark in the architectural world."
1670	16503	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced several significant problems in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. To begin, the architects were unable to simply drop the mooring mast on top of the building's flat roof. This was due to the well - known fact that a dirigible held by a cable would add considerable stress to the building's frame. Though this was a major obstacle, the architects spent over @MONEY1 on careful modifications to the frame to remedy the problem. Another major problem with the idea of the mooring mast was general safety. First off, most foreign dirigibles use hydrogen, as compared to helium, to stay aloft. This problem lay within the fact that hydrogen was highly flammable, and after the Hindenburg catastrophe in 1937, architects became extremely concerned that the same tragic accident could occur over downtown @LOCATION1. In addition, the mast idea proved unsafe due to violent wind currents. To keep from blowing around, dirigibles needed lead weights, which couldn't be allowed to dangle over busy city streets as it would pose a great danger. In conclusion, a final obstacle was a law that prevented airships from flying too low over an urban city. This made it illegal for all airships to tie up in this area. Those were the insurmountable obstacles facing the architects, and they ultimately led to the abandonment of the dirigible - docking plan at the Empire State Building.
1671	16504	6	3	From the excerpt “The Mooring Mast,” the builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first significant concern was safety. Most dirigibles at that time used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. A prime example of the danger associated with hydrogen - filled dirigibles was the German Hindenburg, which tragically went up in flames in Lakehurst, New Jersey. The greatest obstacle to the use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. This would cause the back of the dirigible to swivel around and around the mooring mast. With the dirigible dangling high above pedestrians on the street, such a situation was neither practical nor safe. In conclusion, these safety and natural - related issues made it extremely challenging for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
1672	16505	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there included critical issues in safety, nature - related problems, and a complex dilemma with a law. Safety was a major and immediate concern as many dirigibles used hydrogen, a highly flammable gas. An infamous example of the risk was the German Hindenburg, which had a catastrophic fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey. As the article “The Mooring Mast,” by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, states, “the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse the accident could have been if it taken place above a densely populated areas such as downtown New York City.” In addition, nature was a big and persistent obstacle the owners faced. The winds on top of the building constantly shifted, and according to L¸sted, this would have caused the back of the dirigibles to “swivel around the mooring mast,” which was clearly not “practical nor safe.” Moreover, there were legal issues the builders had to deal with. There was a law at the time restricting airships from flying too low over populated areas. As the article notes, “This law would make it illegal for ships ever to tie up to the building or even approach the area.” In summary, the builders of the Empire State Building were up against formidable challenges related to safety, nature, and the law when trying to enable dirigible docking.
1673	16506	6	3	In the excerpt “The Mooring Mast” by @ORGANIZATION1, the builders faced many problems with the attempt to allow blimps to dock there. One significant problem was that the already constructed frame of the Empire State Building was not strong enough to support a new mooring mast for blimps. This meant that major structural modifications would be required. A second problem is shown in the quote “The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents...” (L¸sted para. @NUM1). The weather conditions at the height of the Empire State Building were extremely harsh. The winds would throw and move blimps in violent ways when they were trying to dock. The push of the winds even caused the threat of a blimp being blown into a spire on a surrounding building, as described in the quote “which would puncture the dirigibles shell” (L¸sted para @NUM2). That is what could happen if a blimp tried to tether to the building. Additionally, the builders also faced the laws about flying that low over an urban area. All in all, the builders of the Empire State Building did face a multitude of problems while trying to allow blimps access to the building, making the task extremely difficult.
1674	16507	6	3	The builders of the Empire State building had to face many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle they faced was the complex task of placing the mooring mast on the building. As L¸sted states, “The architects could not simply place a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building's flat roof” (L¸sted @NUM1). This meant that they would have to build another specialized structure to be able to place the mooring mast securely. The second obstacle they faced was preparing the building to dock dirigibles. L¸sted claims, “A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top... held by a single tether would add stress to the building's frame” (L¸sted @NUM1). The dirigibles were quite heavy, and their weight would weigh the building down. So, they would have to find a way to prevent damaging the building. The architect would have “The steel frame modified and strengthened” in order for any dirigible to dock there safely. In conclusion, these were the significant obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock.
1675	16508	6	3	The men who were constructing the building did not put enough thought into the practicality of the new form of allowing dirigibles to land. One major and obvious issue with the dirigibles landing there to fuel up is the fact that they could explode. There had been blimp accidents before, and those incidents were not in a heavily populated area like New York. “When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York.” (@CAPS1 @NUM1). The winds at the top of the building would also create a dangerous situation. They would blow the back end of the blimp around, and it isn't safe to have lead weights hanging over pedestrians. Also, the blimp would be too low. “The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents.” (∂ @NUM2) “- the back of the ship would swivel around and around -” (∂ @NUM2) “Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe.” (∂ @NUM2). In conclusion, the architects should've thought their plan through better to avoid these obvious safety and practicality issues.
1676	16509	6	3	There were many obstacles the builders faced when attempting to dock dirigibles on the Empire State Building. First off, there was a great safety concern. Many dirigibles from foreign countries used helium instead of hydrogen; however, contrary to common belief, it is hydrogen that is highly flammable, and if there was a leak or a spark, the dirigible might explode. Second, the wind made it very challenging to dock the dirigibles. The winds were always changing because of the violent air currents around the tall building, making it difficult to control the large and cumbersome dirigibles. Finally, there was already a law in place against airships flying too low over urban areas. So even if they fixed the other problems, it would still be illegal to dock the dirigibles. Those are some of the significant problems the builders faced when attempting to dock dirigibles on the Empire State Building, which ultimately made the endeavor unfeasible.
1677	16510	6	3	"In this excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The architects had significant trouble with putting the mooring mast on top of the building. As stated, ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" This was because the mooring mast would have stressed the building. The stress from the dirigible's load and the strong wind pressure would have to be transmitted to the building's foundation. To handle this stress, they would have to strengthen and modify the whole building, which was estimated to cost over sixty thousand dollars. Due to this high - cost and complex modification, they instead built a shiny glass and chrome - nickel stainless steel tower. These were the practical obstacles in making a mooring mast for the Empire State Building, which forced the builders to find an alternative solution."
1678	16511	6	3	The obstacles the builders went through to allow dirigibles to dock there was that they initially wanted to put a mooring mast on the top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. However, the problem was that the stress of the dirigible's load, along with the heavy wind pressure, had to be transmitted to the building's foundation, which was about @NUM1 ft below. Since this stress transfer was necessary, the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be extensively modified and strengthened to accommodate the situation. This modification would involve significant engineering work and resources, making the process of installing the mooring mast a challenging and costly endeavor. In the end, these obstacles made it difficult for the builders to achieve their goal of allowing dirigibles to dock easily at the Empire State Building.
1679	16512	6	3	Some of the obstacles facing the builders was that if they were to add on the mooring mast, they would have to strengthen the building integrity. This is necessary because once the mast was installed, the wind and pressure from the moored dirigible would have been transmitted all the way down to its foundation. Moreover, more floors would have to be added to house elevators and stairs to a ticket and luggage area, which would require additional construction and space planning. They also had to find a way to attach the mooring mast to the foundation, which is nearly @NUM1 feet below. This attachment had to be secure enough to withstand the forces exerted by the dirigible and the wind. These multiple obstacles made the task of adding a mooring mast to the Empire State Building a complex and difficult one, ultimately affecting the feasibility of allowing dirigibles to dock there.
1680	16513	6	3	"In the excerpt, The Mooring Mast, written by Marcia Amidon Lusted, the builders faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigible to dock at the Empire State Building. One obstacle the builders faced was that they had to modify the building's framework in order to install the mooring mast. As the text explains, ""a thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was eleven hundred feet below. This was another significant obstacle the builders faced. Also, the mooring mast never fulfilled its purpose because of safety concerns. Hydrogen, which was commonly used in dirigibles, is highly flammable, and any accident could lead to a catastrophic explosion. The biggest obstacle was nature. The winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents around the tall building. All these factors combined made the idea of docking dirigibles at the Empire State Building neither practical nor safe, and thus it was not a viable option."
1681	16514	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous problems while trying to allow dirigibles to dock on the mast. One significant obstacle involved the idea of dropping ""A mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof"" (paragraph @NUM1). If they had carried out this plan, the mast would have added a substantial amount of stress to the building's foundation. As a result, the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be thoroughly modified and strengthened. However, this modification process was extremely costly. Another obstacle was the use of hydrogen rather than helium in foreign dirigibles. Hydrogen is a highly flammable gas, and if a dirigible had accidentally caught on fire, it could have caused a great deal of damage to the densely - populated area around the building. However, the greatest obstacle involved the harsh wind currents on top of the Empire State Building. Even if the dirigible was ""Tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around"" (paragraph @NUM2). The use of lead weights to anchor the dirigible down while ""dangling high above pedestrians on the street was neither practical nor safe"" (paragraph @NUM2). In conclusion, while building the mast on the Empire State Building, the architects and builders faced many insurmountable obstacles that ultimately prevented the successful implementation of the dirigible - docking plan."
1682	16515	6	3	"In the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on it. When building the Empire State Building, the architects had to carefully take the considerable height of the building and the mooring mast into account. They simply could not casually drop a large glass and chrome mooring mast on top of the building's flat roof. Also, the wind currents over one thousand feet high are rapidly changing, which poses a great challenge to the stability of the dirigibles. An extremely large dirigible berthed at the top of the building would ""add stress to the building's frame"" (@NUM1). The architects would have to comprehensively modify and strengthen its steel frame for the safety of the building. These necessary changes would cost over sixty thousand dollars, which was a huge financial burden. But alas, the mooring mast of the Empire State Building never fulfilled its intended destiny due to these complex and costly obstacles, leaving the plan of dirigible docking unachieved."
1683	16516	6	3	The obstacles the builders faced with the mooring mast were the strong winds and the gases used in non - American dirigibles. The wind was a major problem because at that great height, the back of the dirigibles would continuously swivel around the mooring mast, making it extremely difficult to keep the dirigibles stable. The gases used were also a significant problem. Out - of - country zeppelins used hydrogen, which is a highly flammable gas. If the zeppelin were to go up in flames over the densely populated New York, it would cause not only property damage but also endanger countless lives. In conclusion, these wind - related and gas - related obstacles made it almost impossible for the mooring mast to serve its purpose of facilitating dirigible docking.
1684	16517	6	3	Dirigibles were being hailed as the transportation of the future. They were quite remarkable in terms of their performance. They had a top speed of @NUM2 miles per hour and could cruise at @NUM3 miles per @NUM4. Some of these dirigibles were extremely large, being as long as @NUM5 feet. Their size and speed made them seem like a promising mode of transportation at that time, but various factors would later limit their widespread use.
1685	16518	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lusted, the author describes the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigible (blimps) to dock there. The original purpose of the mast was to serve as a convenient landing spot for dirigibles, also known as blimps. In paragraph 6, the author states ""The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. Al Smith saw an opportunity for his Empire State Building: A mooring mast added to the top of the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and let passengers off and on."" This shows one of the challenges faced by his company. In paragraph @NUM1, it says ""the mooring mast and made changes to the existing plans for the building's skeleton, construction proceeded as planned."" However, despite these efforts, the building's structure didn't really offer much assistance to the dirigibles, and the plan to use the mast for dirigible docking faced many difficulties that were hard to overcome."
1686	16519	6	3	The Mooring Mast, designed by @ORGANIZATION1, the same builders of the Empire State Building, encountered numerous obstacles in their attempts to enable dirigibles, the future mode of transportation in the @DATE1's, also commonly known as blimps, to dock at the building. The most significant challenge was determining how to make the mast function effectively. The primary obstacle to using the mooring mast was nature. The winds on top of the building were in a constant state of shift due to strong and violent air currents. As a result, even when the dirigible was tied to the mast, the back of the dirigible would spin around the mast. According to the excerpt, dirigibles moored in open landing fields can be weighted down using lead weights. However, since these weights would dangle high above the people below, it would pose a great danger in case they fell. Moreover, builders had no control over nature, making this the most difficult hurdle. Another obstacle was the stress that the building's body frame would endure if the dirigible was held by a single cable tether. The wind pressure and stress would have been excessive for the building's foundation. This issue was resolved by modifying the steel frame of the building to make it stronger and prevent the building from collapsing. Despite facing many obstacles in the attempts to allow dirigibles to dock at the building, it ultimately proved to be in vain because there is a law that prohibits airships from flying too low over urban areas.
1687	16520	6	3	The Empire State Building had to grapple with the problem of how to install a mast for the helium balloon, which was lighter than a regular inflated balloon. The tip of the building was disproportionately long, and some of these problems presented challenges that architects were unable to solve. In the end, despite their best efforts, the issue of the mast for the helium balloon remained a complex problem that couldn't be fully resolved.
1688	16521	6	3	The @CAPS1 encountered various issues during the building process. They faced intense arguments among the team members, which led to a great deal of confusion. The construction also took a long and arduous time. All these difficulties combined made the building process a challenging endeavor. Despite these hardships, they persevered through the entire process, but it was clear that the project had been fraught with problems.
1689	16522	6	3	There were numerous obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced when trying to allow dirigibles to dock at the building. One significant obstacle was the stress on the building caused by the dirigible. The stress from the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transferred all the way down to the building's foundation, which was @NUM1 feet below the surface. Therefore, the steel frame of the Empire State Building would need to be modified and strengthened to withstand this stress. Another obstacle was that most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. This posed a serious safety risk if a dirigible were to dock at the building. The third obstacle was the constantly shifting winds on top of the building due to violent air currents. Even when the dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would move around uncontrollably, making docking extremely difficult. Lastly, there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a dirigible to tie up to the building or even approach the area. In conclusion, these multiple obstacles made it nearly impossible for the builders to achieve their goal of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
1690	16523	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced a multitude of problems and obstacles while trying to allow blimps to dock there. One of the major obstacles was that foreign blimps used hydrogen instead of helium to stay airborne. If a hydrogen - filled blimp were to explode over New York, the resulting damage and death toll would be catastrophic. A second obstacle was that the high elevation of the building, which was @CAPS1 high, created strong wind currents. These wind currents made it extremely difficult for the Navy's blimp, the Los Angeles, to approach the docking station at the mooring mast. Their final obstacle was the fear that the blimp might collide with another building's spire. Such a collision could puncture a hole in the blimp, causing it to crash. In summary, the builders faced significant challenges, including the high - risk of a foreign blimp exploding due to its hydrogen filling, the difficulty of docking caused by the strong wind currents at high elevation, and the danger of the blimp hitting another building's spire. These obstacles made it very difficult to achieve the goal of allowing blimps to dock at the Empire State Building.
1691	16524	6	3	"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"", the builders of the Empire State Building were faced with numerous obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The designers had such grand plans for the building that the reality was far from achievable. One significant challenge they encountered was ensuring the safety of everyone involved. In the excerpt, it is mentioned that ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (paragraph @NUM1). This meant that the risk of the dirigible catching on fire was extremely high. If it did catch fire, not only would it cause severe damage to the blimp itself, but it would also pose a great threat to the buildings and people of New York. Another major obstacle was mother nature herself. No one could accurately predict the weather, and ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (paragraph @NUM2). Blimps would not be able to fly close enough to the docking area without the wind pushing it off - course. The unpredictable winds could make the aircraft fly into nearby buildings, which could damage the delicate design of the dirigible. All in all, the challenges the designers had to overcome to build such a great building with the intention of dirigible docking were only a practical dream that reality soon crushed, highlighting the importance of considering all factors in large - scale engineering projects."
1692	16525	6	3	"In the excerpt, the builders had numerous obstacles on how they could dock dirigibles on top of the Empire State Building. The first significant problem they had was because of the high winds. As stated, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (@NUM1). This was a major issue because the strong and unpredictable winds could cause the dirigibles to crash into the building, potentially releasing its highly flammable gases. The second obstacle they faced was making the building structure strong enough to tie down the dirigibles. ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation"" (@NUM2). This was a problem because if they did not strengthen the steel adequately, the repeated docking and movement of the dirigibles would gradually weaken the building's overall structure. Those are the main two obstacles that the builders faced when building the Empire State Building with the intention that it could dock dirigibles, showing that even grand plans need a solid structural and environmental feasibility assessment."
1693	16526	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The @CAPS1 Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders faced many complex obstacles. They were trying to get Dirigibles to land on the Empire State Building, a feat that seemed ambitious but was fraught with difficulties. If they were going to have Dirigibles land atop the building, they would have to add additional floors to the building to create a proper landing and docking area. Another significant issue is that ""The steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the new situation."" This meant that they would have to spend a large amount of extra money on construction and reinforcement. Then, something they discovered later is that they couldn't even carry out this plan in the first place due to legal matters. If they did that, they would be getting themselves in trouble with the legal system. Once they realized these insurmountable problems, I think that they came to the conclusion that the project was a failure and informed the world, ""The as yet unsolved problems of mooring air ships to a fixed mast at such a height made it desirable to postpone to a later date the final installation of the landing gear."" This shows that in large - scale projects, legal and structural aspects need to be thoroughly considered from the start."
1694	16527	6	3	"Engineering a docking station was supposed to be a remarkable accomplishment for the city of New York. Unfortunately, builders faced many formidable obstacles in trying to make this incredible plan succeed. Many engineers did not think of the potential hazards, and as stated, ""for reasons that should have been apparent before it was even constructed"" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). The greatest issue was safety. Dirigibles used a highly flammable gas, hydrogen, and if an incident like the Hindenburg were to occur again, it would pose an immense danger to the densely populated city. The potential for a large - scale fire and explosion was a nightmare scenario. Another obstacle were the winds at the top of the Empire State Building. The winds were constantly shifting, and the backs of dirigibles would swing around erratically, making it almost impossible to approach the docking area safely. There was also a law against low - flying aircraft over urban areas, so it was illegal for a ship to ever even approach the area. The idea for a docking station was great in theory, however, many obstacles were not brought up in the early stages of planning, so the Empire State Building never came to be a dock, emphasizing the need for comprehensive risk assessment in engineering projects."
1695	16528	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced were quite challenging. The wind was a major concern as the climate conditions at the building's location were always unpredictable, posing a continuous risk. The constantly changing wind patterns could affect the construction process, making it difficult to operate heavy machinery and transport building materials safely. Additionally, the height of the building was also a significant challenge for the builders. Working at such great heights required specialized equipment and safety measures. The higher they built, the more difficult it was to ensure the stability of the structure and the safety of the workers. In conclusion, these factors combined made the construction of the Empire State Building a test of the builders' skills and determination, highlighting the complexity of high - rise construction projects.
1696	16529	6	3	Based on excerpt The Mooring Mast, by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock were numerous, and the main challenge was to get it to work. For many practical reasons, the builders would never succeed in getting dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. One significant reason this idea could never come to fruition was because the dirigibles themselves were highly flammable. The hydrogen gas that most places used to fuel their dirigibles made them extremely prone to catching fire. In a highly populated area such as New York, the risk of a large - scale fire caused by a dirigible would be a major problem. Another issue was money. The builders would need to allocate a substantial amount of additional funds to strengthen the building to bear the weight of the dirigibles. With a one - thousand - foot dirigible moored to the top of a building by a single cable tether, there would be an enormous amount of stress on the building's structure. Finally, the last reason was safety. Violent winds at the top of the building would make dirigibles unstable when docked. There is also an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. In @CAPS2, based on excerpt The Mooring Mast; by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1, the obstacles builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock were the flammability of dirigibles, money issues for building reinforcement, and safety concerns due to winds and laws. These multiple obstacles made it impossible for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.
1697	16530	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many challenges with dirigibles. The first challenge was related to the building's structure. With the large size of the aircrafts, they would put a great deal of stress on the building. So, a new and sturdier frame was created to accommodate the @NUM1 ft dirigibles. This modification required a significant investment, and sixty thousand dollars was needed for the necessary changes. Another problem was safety. A large number of dirigibles outside the United States used hydrogen, which is highly flammable. If an accident similar to the one in New Jersey, where the blimp caught fire, were to happen in the heavily populated New York, it would result in a large number of injuries and deaths. A third reason was nature. Since the building stood so tall, the wind speeds and pressure were very unpredictable, especially with the violent air currents. In open fields, weights were used to stabilize dirigibles, but having lead weights ""dangling high above pedestrians... was neither practical nor safe."" @CAPS1, there were laws against flying at certain altitudes in urban areas. The Empire State Building, being at the height it was, still fell under the scope of this law, making it illegal to have a dirigible or other craft tie up to it. These various obstacles that the builders faced when building the Empire State Building ultimately made it unfeasible to use it for dirigible docking."
1698	16531	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building had to suffer through many hardships in building the Mooring mast and trying to dock Dirigibles on it. Some of the obstacles that the builders had to overcome were related to the weather. As stated, ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself,"" (paragraph @NUM1). The winds at the top of the Empire State Building shifted frequently due to the violent air currents. Even if the Dirigible was tied to the mast, the strong wind would push it all the way around the mast, making docking extremely difficult. Another obstacle that the builders had to deal with was the safety concern regarding the lead weights. They feared that the lead weights that held the Dirigible down would be dangling over the edge of the building. This situation would leave it unsafe for pedestrians on the street below and also for the pilot and passengers on the blimp. Due to these weather - related and safety - related obstacles, the plan to dock dirigibles at the Empire State Building faced significant setbacks."
1699	16532	6	3	"In the excerpt of the @CAPS1 ""The Mooring Mast"", by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Dirigibles, also known as blimps, were, at the time of the construction of the Empire State Building, the most advanced form of @CAPS2. The Empire State building was erected with the intention of tethering dirigibles and allowing them to unload and reload passengers and refuel. While building, the constructors realized, ""The stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings Foundation... eleven hundred feet below,"" (para. @NUM1). This meant that detailed plans needed to be made to support both the building and the blimps. The natural environment also posed a conflict to the project. Lead weights would be used to land dirigibles, but having them ""dangling high above Pedestrians on the street, was neither practical or safe."" (para @NUM2). Due to the violent winds at that elevation, these weights would cause the blimp and its weights to waver. The aircrafts were also at risk of landing on ""sharp spires of other buildings."" (para @NUM3). In addition, a law forbade @CAPS2 from ""flying low in urban areas (para @NUM3). For these reasons, including structural stress, safety risks from weights and natural elements, and legal restrictions, the Empire State Building was never used for the docking of dirigibles."
1700	16533	6	3	During the construction of the Empire State Building, the world was convinced that they knew the future of air travel: dirigibles. In an attempt to keep up with the modern world, Al Smith, the lead architect of the Empire State Building, decided to top the building with a dirigible docking station. Unfortunately, during the building process, the architects faced many insurmountable obstacles that stopped them from completing the mooring mast. One of these problems was the large sum of sixty thousand dollars they would have to spend on modifications to the building. This financial burden was a significant deterrent. Another issue was the high flamibility of hydrogen, the gas used in inflating the ship. A single spark could lead to a catastrophic explosion. But the biggest obstacle was nature. The winds that the dirigible would be facing were very strong, and pedestrians on the sidewalk were put at risk by the possibility that the ship would tear off the tether it was tied to and crash onto the street below. A final reason for the end of the mooring mast plan was a law that clearly stated that airships couldn't fly too low over urban areas. Although the mooring mast seemed like a great and forward - thinking idea at the time, the combination of financial, safety, natural, and legal obstacles stopped it from having any chance of success.
1701	16534	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building went through many arduous obstacles. I truly feel bad for them because of how extremely dangerous the construction work was, and how long hours they had to work day after day. At the same time, I would have been extremely happy to be a part of constructing such an iconic and remarkable building. The builders could have easily died while doing their jobs. Building it so high up in the open air, it must have been swelteringly hot under the sun. I don't think it had to be that high; they could have achieved the same grandeur but at a lower height. Those are some of the significant obstacles I think the builders went through, and their efforts have left an indelible mark on the world.
1702	16535	6	3	"There were a few significant challenges that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The mast couldn't simply be dropped on the top of the building haphazardly. ""A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add excessive stress to the building's frame."" All this extra stress would then be transmitted to the very foundation of the building, potentially compromising its long - term stability. Another major obstacle was that the builders had to modify the whole building extensively. The architects had painstakingly designed the mooring mast and made detailed changes to the existing plans for the building's skeleton. The builders already had the building mostly done, but in order to dock the dirigibles, they needed to make substantial alterations. These architects worked incredibly hard to build something that could never be used because of the violent and unpredictable air currents. ""Even if the dirigibles were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" The architects put all their hard work into remodeling the building for nothing, and it was a great disappointment."
1703	16536	6	3	"In the excerpt from The Mooring Mast by @PERSON1, there were many considerable obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Their biggest and most pressing concern was safety. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (L¸sted, paragraph @NUM1). The excerpt specifically mentions the German dirigible, the Hindenburg, which was tragically destroyed in a massive fire. ""... the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse the accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York"" (L¸sted, paragraph @NUM1). Another significant obstacle was nature itself. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (L¸sted, paragraph @NUM3). The unpredictable winds made it absolutely impossible to safely dock people onto and off the dirigibles. Finally, there were strict laws put in place restricting airships flying too low over populated areas. ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"" (L¸sted, paragraph @NUM4). Due to these multiple obstacles, the plan to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building faced insurmountable challenges."
1704	16537	6	3	"Although adding a mooring mast to the top of the Empire State Building is a very ingenious and clever idea, there are multiple complex problems and concerns that accompany this new feature. For example, even if the cable were fastened extremely strong enough to the one thousand - foot dirigible, it would add a great deal of stress to the building's frame, causing the building to grow weaker much more rapidly than without it. In addition, to counteract the dirigible's large effect on the building, it would be necessary to have the dirigible's weight and the wind pressure ""to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation,"" which was nearly an impossible feat considering this distance was over @NUM1 feet. @CAPS1, @CAPS2 was a large and crucial factor in building this futuristic structure; over Sixty thousand dollars had to be carefully collected to better support the building's structure. In the end, these challenges made the addition of the mooring mast a very difficult and perhaps unfeasible endeavor."
1705	16538	6	3	While attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, the builders ran into a few serious obstacles. One significant obstacle was a previously existing strict law about airships flying too low over urban areas like downtown New York. This law posed a major legal hurdle to the docking plan. Another problem the builders ran into was the high and gusty winds causing the back end of the dirigible to swing wildly in the wind, making it extremely unsafe for passengers to unload. Unlike dirigibles moored in open fields, lead weights could not be used to weigh the back of the dirigible down because they would pose a great danger to pedestrians on the busy street below. Another crucial safety issue was that most balloons outside the United States filled dirigibles with hydrogen, which is much more flammable than helium. Dirigibles filled with hydrogen could cause a catastrophic disaster if it ever caught on fire. Although the idea of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building seemed great at first glance, the builders at the Empire State Building eventually realized it was neither practical nor safe, and had to abandon the plan.
1706	16539	6	3	There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. A huge obstacle was that some dirigibles were as long as @NUM1 feet, which is precisely the same length as four blocks in New York. This significant size made docking a complex task. Another obstacle was the expanded use in New York, specifically the lack of a suitable landing area they would have. With this situation, Al Smith saw an opportunity for his building. He planned to add a mooring mast to the top of the building that would allow passengers to board and disembark, which would then become a spot for refueling or service. But with this new idea, there would have to be lots of planning to ensure its feasibility and safety. In the end, despite the potential, these numerous obstacles made the implementation of this plan quite challenging.
1707	16540	6	3	Architects constructing the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles for the mooring mast. During the 1920s, dirigibles were being hailed as the transportation of the future, and at that time, the idea of making a mast wasn't so far - fetched at first. As construction neared completion, many concerns arose. Many dirigibles outside the United States use the highly flammable gas known as hydrogen. This posed a serious safety risk as any spark could lead to a catastrophic explosion. Another problem was the docking of the blimps. The winds on the Empire State Building constantly shifted, which forced the rear of the dirigibles to rotate around the mooring mast, making docking extremely difficult and dangerous. Lastly, a law was formed to restrict airships from entering an urban area at low altitudes, which further limited the practicality of the mooring mast. When all the problems came together, the idea of mooring dirigibles quietly disappeared as it became clear that it was not a viable option.
1708	16541	6	3	"In The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock there. One big obstacle they had to overcome is when the dirigibles dock, the weight and movement would leave stress on the foundation of the building. As stated, ""Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework"" to withstand this stress. Another obstacle the builders would have to overcome was the winds at the top of the building constantly shifting directions. They thought about putting weights on the dirigibles to stabilize them, but then that would not be safe having them hang a thousand feet up over people on the streets below. There was also a law stating that airships could not fly too low over urban areas. All these factors combined made the process of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building extremely challenging. Therefore, the builders of the Empire State Building had many obstacles to overcome, and these ultimately made the idea less and less feasible."
1709	16542	6	3	A mooring mast could just be put on top of the Empire State Building. However, if a thousand - foot dirigible docked at the top of the building, held by a cable tether, then it would add significant stress to the building's frame. The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure have to be transmitted to the bottom of the building, which was eleven hundred feet below. To handle this stress, the frame would have to be strengthened and modified, and this would cost over sixty thousand dollars. Nature itself was the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast. The winds were shifting because of violent air currents on the top of the building. The back of a dirigible would swivel around and around the mooring mast, making it difficult to keep the dirigible in a stable position. Lead weights were sometimes used to weight down dirigibles, but they wouldn't be safe at the Empire State Building because there are pedestrians below. These weights were typically used for open landing fields where there is no risk of harming people. In conclusion, the combination of structural stress and natural wind conditions made the use of a mooring mast at the Empire State Building unfeasible.
1710	16543	6	3	When the Empire State building was built, they came across some problems with letting the dirigibles dock there. Some reasons are when the dirigibles were made, they weren't designed to go high. So when the Empire State building went up, the dirigible had a slight problem as it was not accustomed to operating at such heights. Most dirigibles that are made outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium. But, hydrogen is highly flammable, which means that any small accident during docking or refueling could lead to a large - scale fire or explosion. This high - risk factor due to the use of hydrogen and the dirigibles' unsuitability for high - altitude docking made it very difficult to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. In the end, these issues made the plan of having dirigibles dock there an unworkable idea.
1711	16544	6	3	When the builders of the Empire State Building attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there, they faced multiple formidable obstacles. The most crucial one was the issue of safety. Given that the dirigible was filled with hydrogen, which is highly combustible, it would cause absolute chaos if it caught on fire. Imagine the destruction that would ensue over the bustling city of New York. Hydrogen would be far too dangerous to use in the dirigible as it could catch fire at any moment. Another significant obstacle was the speed of the wind at the top of the Empire State Building. There were violent and unpredictable air - currents. These would shift the position of the dirigible precariously if it was docked at the mooring mast. Since the back of the dirigible could not be weighted down because of safety issues, it would swivel around the mooring mast uncontrollably. The last major issue was an existing law about airships. They were not allowed to fly at this height as it was too close to an urban area. This made it completely illegal to try and dock at the Empire State Building. In fact, they couldn't even approach the area except for the Los Angeles and the Columbia, who were given a chance to try before the idea was ultimately ruined. Neither of them could successfully dock, and thus, the idea was abandoned for good.
1712	16545	6	3	"Based on the excerpt from @PERSON1's book ""The Empire State Building"", there seem to be two main and quite challenging problems with the docking of dirigibles in New York City. First, there is the problem of nature itself. The area around the Empire State Building, and all of @LOCATION3, experiences strong and erratic winds. These winds make it extremely difficult to have a safe docking procedure. The Naval @CAPS1 the Los Angeles attempted to dock, but the operator, being extremely cautious, pulled away for fear of puncturing the zeppelin on the spire of another building. Such a puncture could have led to a disastrous situation. The second problem, though slightly easier to rectify, was the law that prohibited any aircraft from getting too close to the buildings of New York City. This basically made even attempting to dock an illegal act. There are numerous reasons why the idea of zeppelins didn't gain traction worldwide, and this excerpt about New York was a prime example of the obstacles that couldn't be safely overcome. In the end, these issues put an end to the hopes of successful dirigible docking in the city."
1713	16546	6	3	"In their attempts to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, the builders faced a multitude of obstacles. Firstly, the frame of the Empire State building was initially too weak to bear the extra stress of the dirigible's load. The weight of a docked dirigible would have put an immense strain on the structure. So, the builders set out to strengthen the building frame, which was a costly sixty - thousand - dollar feat. Secondly, the builders struggled with high, shifting winds. These winds were so strong and unpredictable that they made docking a dirigible nearly an impossible task. As described, ""the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast"", making it very difficult to keep the dirigible in a stable position. Another significant obstacle the builders faced were safety issues. The insides of many dirigibles were filled with hydrogen, a highly flammable gas that allowed the dirigible to float. After a tragic dirigible fire in New Jersey, the builders became acutely aware of the dangers of dirigibles and what a catastrophic event it would be if a dirigible caught on fire above the densely populated New York City. Finally, the builders also had to deal with the laws regarding air traffic. The laws clearly prevented airships from flying ""too low over urban areas"". In the end, these combined obstacles effectively prevented the builders from ever letting dirigibles dock on the Empire State Building."
1714	16547	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, it is abundantly clear that the builders of the mooring mast atop of the Empire State Building faced multiple, insurmountable problems. To begin, the excerpt states that dirigibles from other countries were often filled with hydrogen, which is extremely flammable. The danger of hydrogen was vividly demonstrated when the German dirigible ""Hindenburg"" burst into flames in a terrifying incident. The Hindenburg disaster was a wake - up call. This incident could have been far, far worse if it had happened in a densely populated area like New York City, where the loss of life and property would have been immeasurable. Aside from the fire hazard the mooring mast would create, there was also a strict ban on low - flying aircraft in densely populated areas. According to the excerpt, the greatest obstacle was ""Nature itself."" This was a reference to the powerful winds and violent gusts found at the peak of the Empire State Building. With those strong and unpredictable winds, it would be incredibly difficult, almost outstandingly so, to control a dirigible safely. After carefully considering all of these complications and obstacles, it was finally decided that the mooring mast would not be built, as the risks far outweighed any potential benefits."
1715	16548	6	3	"From the knowledge I gained reading the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"", I learned that there were many significant obstacles in making a place for dirigibles to dock. The most important reason is safety. Since most dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium, the dirigibles were highly flammable. Hydrogen is a volatile substance, and if the dirigibles were to ever catch on fire over the crowded city of New York, many innocent lives could be in great danger. The resulting chaos and destruction would be hard to contain. Another major obstacle was the climate. The top of the Empire State Building, where they were going to build the Mooring Mast, had such a harsh and unforgiving climate. The strong winds and unpredictable weather conditions made it nearly impossible to dock a dirigible on it. These are some of the many insurmountable obstacles the architects had to face when designing the mooring mast. In the end, these challenges led to the abandonment of the plan to create a docking place for dirigibles."
1716	16549	6	3	Some of the obstacles that builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were quite complex. For instance, they had to figure out how to dock a dirigible to a building, which involved creating a secure and stable connection. Additionally, fueling and service for the dirigibles needed to be arranged in a practical and safe manner. Moreover, they had to determine how to get passengers on and off as safely as possible, perhaps by designing appropriate boarding mechanisms. They also should have thought about the potential impact that a thousand - foot dirigible swaying from the top of the building might do to its structure. The architects and engineers of the Empire State Building consulted with experts, specifically letting people from the U.S. naval air station take a detailed tour of the equipment and the mooring mast, which is the anchor for the dirigible. The passengers of the dirigible could get on and off by walking down a gang plank to an open observation platform. In all, over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the building's foundation. Unfortunately, despite these efforts, some dirigibles couldn't even dock, making the whole endeavor a challenging one.
1717	16550	6	3	"In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders faced numerous and significant obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock over the Empire State Building. If the builders would want to dock the dirigibles, they were immediately met with the issue that there was no right area to land them. As the text states, ""... in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area"". Another major obstacle was the need to understand the weather conditions because nature itself can take control. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, which made landing and docking extremely difficult. The dirigibles, if landed on the Empire State Building, would be weighed down as they had weights at the back, further complicating the docking process. Another reason that it was an obstacle was because dirigibles used a gas of hydrogen rather than helium, and the gas hydrogen is a highly flammable gas. This could do a lot of harm if there are passengers present in the dirigibles and could be very dangerous for the Empire State Building, ultimately making the idea of docking dirigibles there a risky and unfeasible one."
1718	16551	6	3	The dream for the Empire State Building was to allow dirigibles to dock on the top of it. It initially sounded like a great and innovative idea, but the builders faced many formidable obstacles trying to reach the goal of having them dock there. The first problem they faced was that the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be properly transmitted to the building's foundation so it wouldn't stress the building's frame. To address this, over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had been made. A glass and chrome - nickel steel tower was constructed with an illuminated interior. As a result, the building was now 102 floors. Even though all this hard work was put in, the building was never used for docking purposes because of safety concerns. One of the safety obstacles was that dirigibles were highly flammable. After one caught on fire in New Jersey, the owners of the Empire State Building didn't want the same disaster to happen in the highly populated New York City. Also, another big obstacle was caused by the terrible winds. Even though there was a landing site, the dirigible could never be securely tied down so the passengers could get off safely. Additionally, there was a law that stated the aircrafts can't fly too low to urban areas. Through all the money and obstacles the builders had to go through to make this dream possible, unfortunately, it was never achieved, leaving the docking idea as an unfulfilled vision.
1719	16552	6	3	"While in the process of building the Empire State Building, the workers overcame countless obstacles. Al Smith, the governor of New York, had a grand vision and wanted to build ""the world's tallest building"" (1). At the same time the Empire State Building was being designed, the @ORGANIZATION2 building, also in New York, was finishing construction. The @ORGANIZATION2 building workers decided they wanted to challenge the designers of the Empire State Building by secretly building a 185 - foot spire, which made their building 46 feet taller. This began a fierce competition between the designers to see who would win the title of the tallest building. Later on, after the Empire State Building was built and won the title of the tallest building, the workers were trying to make it work as a mast for dirigibles to land on. However, the designers forgot to factor in the safety of landing a dirigible in the middle of a city and the fact that wind is a huge factor in landing the aircraft safely. Due to these oversight and challenges, the idea of the building acting as a landing for dirigibles is dropped. The Empire State Building, despite not fulfilling the dirigible - docking dream, still stands as an iconic and remarkable architectural achievement."
1720	16553	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced a variety of obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the prominent obstacles faced was ensuring that the people below would not get hurt. There was a real risk that if something on the dirigible or during the docking process happened to fall, someone on the ground could get seriously injured. Another significant obstacle was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This legal restriction made it difficult to execute the plan of having dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building. These obstacles, both related to safety and legal compliance, presented major challenges for the builders. In the end, these issues made the goal of allowing dirigibles to dock there a very difficult, if not impossible, one to achieve.
1721	16554	6	3	"Builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous challenges when attempting to make it possible for dirigibles to dock there. Some of these obstacles were not directly related to the building itself; nature played a significant role. At a height of 1,250 feet, the forceful winds made it extremely difficult for the pilots of the dirigibles to steer the ships close enough to tie them up. This was evident when the @ORGANIZATION2 dirigible ""Los Angeles"" encountered issues. Fearing that the wind would blow the ship onto sharp edges or other buildings in the area, which could cause the shell to get punctured and lead to a disaster, the captain failed to attempt to reach the building in December 1930. Another obstacle was an existing law that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, as it would put civilians on the street at risk. Additionally, a dirigible that was not large enough would put stress on the building's frame. In the end, these multiple obstacles made it unfeasible for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building."
1722	16555	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many significant obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. For one, having dirigibles dangling high above the pedestrians on the busy streets below was not only impractical but also extremely unsafe. There was also ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas,"" which added a legal hurdle to the plan. In addition to these obvious set - backs, ""a thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add excessive stress to the building's frame."" However, it can be safely said that mother nature herself presented the biggest obstacle for the builders. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents,"" making it extremely difficult to keep the dirigibles securely and safely hoisted to the building. The obstacles for the builders also became much more dangerous as they began to understand the science of the dirigibles. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" When the German dirigible ""Hindenburg"" caught fire on May 6, 1937, in Lakehurst, New Jersey, the owners and builders of the Empire State Building realized that the accident could have been much worse if it had happened on top of one of the most populated cities in the world. As a result, the idea of dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building was ultimately abandoned."
1723	16556	6	3	It shows that in the future, the @CAPS1 Building was never able to fulfill its intended purpose of being used as planned. Instead, it is the @CAPS2 Building in New York that has taken on a more prominent role. The @CAPS1 Building, despite its initial aspirations, faced various issues that prevented it from achieving its goal. In contrast, the @CAPS2 Building has managed to thrive and become a significant landmark in the city. Overall, the difference in their fates highlights the importance of proper planning and adaptability in architectural projects.
1724	16557	6	3	The people who were attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building went through many arduous obstacles. They would first have to carefully modify and significantly strengthen the building's frame to accommodate this new and challenging situation. The architects designed a shiny glass and chrome - nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from inside, with a stepped - back design that precisely imitated the overall shape of the building itself. After putting in all of that hard work, they then unfortunately found out that the mast of the Empire State Building would never work as intended. The greatest reason was safety. Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. The biggest obstacle was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The law made it strictly illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. By the late 1930s, the idea of using the mooring mast for dirigibles and their passengers had quietly faded away. Dirigibles, instead of becoming the transportation of the future, had given way to airplanes, which were a more practical and safer alternative.
1725	16558	6	3	"Many problems arose with the docking of dirigibles at the Empire State Building that the engineers did not account for. While the architects were in the process of designing the mast, they realized that the building was not originally built to withstand the stress of dirigibles and the strong winds. ""... modifications had to be made"" (paragraph @NUM1). Although this obstacle was able to be overcome with some effort, many others were insurmountable. Since most dirigibles outside of the @PERSON1 used hydrogen, a very flammable gas, a dirigible could go down in flames similar to the German Hindenburg. ""Owners... realized how much worse that accident could have been... above... New York"" (paragraph @NUM2). Another major obstacle was a problem with a ""law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (paragraph @NUM3). No dirigible would be allowed even close to the building; however, two still attempted but neither could tether safely to the building. The thought of dirigibles being the transportation of the future gradually shifted to airplanes. As a result, the Empire State Building's top floors are now a popular public tourist spot, marking the end of the era of potential dirigible docking at the building."
1726	16559	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there stemmed from the docking method. The dirigibles were docked by means of an electric winch, which carefully hauled in a line from the front of the ship and then securely tied it to a mast. However, the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof as it required proper structural integration and safety measures. In conclusion, these challenges made the dirigible - docking plan quite difficult to execute.
1727	16560	6	3	There were many significant obstacles in the way of adding a mooring dock to the top of the Empire State Building. First and foremost, numerous new modifications would have to be added to the frame of the building. This was because the previous frame was simply not designed to hold the extra weight of a large @NUM1 dirigible hanging from 1 cable. These necessary additions would cost over sixty thousand dollars, plus demand extra time and a great deal of effort. Another huge problem was safety. The winds around New York were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. This unpredictable wind pattern would lead to the blimp wrapping around the tower and possibly breaking off or causing even worse damage. Not to mention that all around was a densely populated city, and any accident could cause far more destruction than normal. Foreign dirigibles also used large amounts of hydrogen, which, as proven at the Hindenburg disaster, could explode into a massive flaming hunk of steel. This risk would be magnified with the volatile weather, and any accident would result in high human and property costs. Finally, it was illegal for blimps to fly low near a city, making the whole project completely illegal. As you can see, there are indeed many insurmountable problems with having a blimp docking center on the Empire State Building.
1728	16561	6	3	Obstacles are faced every day, but the builders of the Empire State Building had even harder challenges in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the building. The reasons as to why dirigibles could not dock there were quite obvious. Most dirigibles use hydrogen, a very flammable element, to float. If a dirigible caught fire above a densely populated area, like downtown New York, a very serious and life - threatening problem would develop. Another obstacle being faced was nature. The winds were constantly shifting because of violent air currents, causing the back of the ship to swivel around the mooring mast in an unpredictable manner. Lead weights could be used to weigh down the back of the ship, but dangling these heavy weights above pedestrians is extremely dangerous. Also, there is a strict law preventing airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it completely illegal for a dirigible to ever tie up to the building. The idea for making a mooring mast on the Empire State Building was a clever one, but evidently, due to these numerous challenges, it was an impossible feat.
1729	16562	6	3	"In the article ""The Mooring Mast,"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, it is apparent that the builders of the Empire State Building faced many significant challenges during the attempt of trying to dock dirigibles. The dirigibles themselves could be a major hazard. Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. In the likes of what had happened to the German airship Hindenburg, officials didn't want a similar catastrophic disaster to occur in downtown New York. Also, the dirigibles' light mass would make them an easy target for high, forceful winds. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. This reality caused fear that a zeppelin could potentially be blown into a spire of some sort on another building, causing it to suffer a hole in its fragile lining. The law also caused obstacles for docking dirigibles on the Empire State Building. There was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, which thwarted many of the would - be attempts of mooring these dirigibles. Mooring dirigibles was a dream talked about in ""The Mooring Mast,"" however, due to these various challenges, that dream soon never had the chance to come true."
1730	16563	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced were that first, the mast designed to go on top of the Empire State Building was initially thought up just to make it the world's tallest building, not because it was a necessary addition, so a lot of problems arose. This mast was designed to be a dirigible docking station. At the time, blimps were very unsafe and lacked a suitable landing area, so this was thought to be a great opportunity to give them a place to anchor for a few hours for refueling, service, and to let passengers on and off. A mooring mast couldn't be simply dropped on top, as it would add excessive stress to the building's frame. So, the steel frame had to be carefully modified, and it took over sixty thousand dollars to do so. After construction took place, it was then realized that if an incident, such as the Hindenburg disaster, occurred again, it would be much worse over a densely populated area such as downtown New York. But the largest obstacle was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Although the dirigible was tethered to the mast, the back of the ship would swivel around in a dangerous way. The usage of lead weights could solve this problem, but because they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, it was neither practical nor safe. There was also an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. In conclusion, these multiple obstacles made the dirigible - docking plan for the Empire State Building unfeasible.
1731	16564	6	3	Although constructing a mooring mast on the top of the Empire State Building seemed like a promising and innovative idea, a number of significant obstacles prevented this theory from becoming a practical reality. The builders and architects had to change the frame of the building completely to accommodate the substantial weight of the mast, and this modification costed over sixty thousand dollars. Another serious problem was that most dirigibles outside the @LOCATION1 use hydrogen over helium, which was highly flammable. If a dirigible suffered the same tragic fate as the Hindenburg, it would cause a much greater and more catastrophic accident at ground level. The greatest challenge that the mast faced was constantly shifting winds from violent air currents. This caused the back of the ship to swivel around the mast, even when it was tied to it, which created a major problem. Most importantly, there was already an existing law that strictly prevented dirigibles from flying too low over urban areas. So, it would be illegal for the dirigible to approach the building, let alone tie up to it. Although the mooring mast at the top of the Empire State Building seemed like a good idea, this feat couldn't be accomplished due to these insurmountable obstacles.
1732	16565	6	3	The @CAPS1 of the Empire State Building had to cross many difficult obstacles in order to have a dirigible dock on the Empire State Building. They needed to build a mooring mast for the dirigible to dock on the Building. This presented another problem however because if a dirigible docked on the building, its considerable weight would be too much for the building. They overcame this obstacle by reinforcing the building's supports with additional steel beams and bracing. The largest obstacle and the one that ultimately defeated this idea of docking a dirigible on the Empire State Building was simply the elements. The violent air currents and high winds made it nearly impossible for a dirigible to safely tether itself to the top of the Empire Building. For example, when the @ORGANIZATION2 dirigible Los @CAPS2 tried to get in range of the mooring mast but was unable to, due to the fiercely forceful winds that buffeted it from all directions. In the end, the @CAPS1 of the Empire State Building could not overcome the obstacles, and the dream of dirigible docking at the building remained unfulfilled.
1733	16566	6	3	"Architects based in New York tried very hard to build a successful mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building, to dock dirigibles for several hours for refueling or service purposes and to allow passengers on and off the blimp. While building, architects faced some challenging obstacles that destroyed the chances of the mooring mast to open and become usable. A dirigible moored at the top of the Empire State Building only held by one cable tether would cause significant tension on the building's frame. The weight and wind pressure would need to be effectively transferred to the building's foundation. About over @MONEY1 of extensive modifications would need to be made to the building's framework, including strengthening the beams and columns. Another obstacle was the roof. ""When the building had been framed to the 85th floor, the roof had to be completed before the framing for the mooring mast could take place,"" wrote @PERSON1 in her article 'The Mooring Mast.' The greatest obstacle however was nature itself. Violent air currents caused the winds to change non - stop, causing the blimp to swivel around the mooring mast in a dangerous manner. The only solution would be to weigh down the back of the craft with lead weights, but the risk was too much as it could cause instability. Last but not least, there was a law in New York against airships flying too low over urban areas. The law made it illegal for a blimp to even approach the Empire State Building. As a result of not being able to use the mooring mast for dirigibles to station, the rooms set aside were turned into the world's highest soda fountain and a tea garden for tourists and sightseers. By the late 1930s, dirigibles had become a form of transportation of the past, and airplanes had made their way to the front of the crowd, marking the end of the era of potential dirigible docking at the Empire State Building."
1734	16567	6	3	Building just a building alone is a tremendous job for builders, then adding on a docking mast for dirigibles makes it significantly more difficult. The architects and builders had to consult with experts as to how this construction should take place and whether it was safe or not. They carefully studied the engineering aspects and potential risks. The architects and builders had to tour equipment and mooring operations at the U.S. Naval Air Station in Lakehurst, @CAPS1 and also had to meet with the president of an airship transport company to gain more insights. After perfusive planning and many detailed meetings later, they would begin building this mooring mast. As for the building, the construction workers could not just drop a mooring mast onto the flat roof of the Empire State Building. They had to find another way as they did not want to put excessive stress on the building's frame. They came to the conclusion that the frame of the building must be modified, which required over sixty thousand dollars in costs for materials and labor. Workers got to add the mast and then construction was halted due to the danger posed to pedestrians from falling debris and the unstable structure during the process. All that work for nothing, and the project of the mooring mast had to be put on hold.
1735	16568	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building were @CAPS1 with immediate and complex problems when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The major hardship that they @CAPS1 was placing a mooring mast on top of an already completed building. ""A thousand - foot dirigible... would add significant stress to the building's frame."" (∂ @NUM1) Not to mention that a large dirigible would also have placed substantial stress on the building. Completing such a project would be extremely difficult because the building was not originally designed for docking dirigibles. This means the roof and the top floors would need to be comprehensively converted to accommodate passengers and travel operations, including adding waiting areas and access ramps. Nature was also an obstacle that builders @CAPS1. High winds could cause the dirigible to violently sway, making it difficult to control and dock safely. Weights used to tether the dirigibles could also be a safety hazard in a densely populated area such as @LOCATION1, as they could fall and cause injury. Fire was another serious safety concern for the builders. The gases used to keep the dirigibles airborne were highly flammable and would again cause serious concern for safety in a city of millions. Ultimately, all of these factors combined caused the creation of a mooring mast on the Empire State Building to fail, and the idea of dirigible docking at the building was abandoned."
1736	16569	6	3	There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle the builders faced was the strong winds on top of the building. The winds were constantly shifting due to violent air - borne currents. Even though the dirigibles were tied down to the mast, the ship would swivel around the mooring mast. This erratic movement would make it unsafe for pedestrians walking below. Another issue with landing the dirigibles on the Empire State Building was safety. Most dirigibles outside the United States used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable. When a German dirigible, the Hindenburg, was destroyed by a fire in Lakehurst, the owners of the Empire State Building realized that such an accident would be much worse in downtown New York, where there was a high population density. Considering these significant problems, it became clear that allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was not a feasible option.
1737	16570	6	3	"While building the Empire State Building, the builders faced many obstacles. One of the first obstacles faced was intense competition. Al Smith, the governor of New York, was extremely determined to have the tallest building in the world, aiming to beat the Chrysler building which was also under construction at the same time. This created a major obstacle because it put a great deal of pressure on Al Smith and the builders to construct such a miraculous, tall building within a reasonable time frame. A second obstacle faced by the builders was having to create a successful mooring mast on top of the building that wouldn't harm the structure of the building itself. ""A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add excessive stress to the building's frame."" Over @MONEY1 worth of changes had to be made to the framework to ensure its stability. The last obstacle was all the work put into the mooring mast for it to even be able to work. It was extremely dangerous for dirigibles to land there. The dirigibles were highly flammable. The winds were harsh and unsafe, and there was a strict law prohibitting the aircraft from flying so low. Due to these numerous challenges, the construction of the mooring mast for dirigible docking was a very difficult and ultimately unviable task."
1738	16571	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced a lot of obstacles while trying to build it. Some of these obstacles were that a thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable would add significant stress to the base of the frame. This stress could potentially compromise the structural integrity of the building. Also, the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. This would make the back of the ship swivel around in an unpredictable manner. There was always the serious thought about how dangerous using hydrogen and helium was, as they were extremely flammable. A small spark could lead to a massive explosion. Those are some of the obstacles the builders faced while trying to make the Empire State Building taller. Given these challenges, the builders had to carefully consider and find solutions to ensure the safety and success of the construction.
1739	16572	6	3	The Empire State Building had to face dangerous conditions every day, like @CAPS1 - force winds that could push workers off - balance and make it difficult to handle construction materials. Heavy lifting was another perilous task, as large and cumbersome building components had to be hoisted to great heights. Working at high heights was extremely dangerous, with the risk of falls being a constant threat. Workers had to be extremely cautious and follow strict safety protocols. These dangerous conditions made the construction of the Empire State Building a very challenging and high - risk project.
1740	16573	6	3	"After reading The Mooring Mast, by Marcia Amidon Lusted, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building are faced with in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there are evident. The number one reason is because it is not safe. First, most dirigibles used hydrogen, which is highly flammable. In a highly populated area like the vicinity of the Empire State Building, the chance of a fire starting is extremely dangerous as it could cause widespread damage and endanger many lives. Also, ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself"" (∂@NUM1). With the building being so high, ""winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (∂@NUM1). These shifting winds made it very difficult to control the dirigible during docking. The conclusion has been made that dirigibles land in landing fields because they can be weighted down in the back with lead weights. This method would not be safe if used on the Empire State Building as the high - altitude winds could still cause instability. Clearly, the builders of the Empire State Building are faced with too many obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock there, making it an unwise and unsafe decision."
1741	16574	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced a few problems in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The primary problem was the issue of safety. Most dirigibles typically used highly flammable gases such as hydrogen. This could be a detrimental problem if the dirigible ever caught fire above New York's public, endangering countless lives and causing widespread panic. Another problem was working with nature. There were violent air currents constantly shifting atop the building, causing the back of ships to swivel around the mooring mast. The dirigibles couldn't simply be weighed down in the back, because that would be a safety hazard, potentially causing the vessel to become unstable and crash. The last problem builders faced was the law. At the time, there was an existing law against airships flying too low over cities. To tie up a ship to the Empire State Building would be considered illegal, subjecting the operators to legal consequences. Due to these insurmountable problems, the plan to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was ultimately abandoned.
1742	16575	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many difficulties and obstacles during the process of creating the great building. The creators had planned for it to be the tallest building in existence, but they were thwarted by the engineer of the Chrysler Building. They put a new top onto the building, making it forty - six feet taller than the Empire State. To match these men, Al Smith decided to add a crown of his own to the building. He built a mooring at the 102nd floor that would accommodate dirigible travel. Once it was put in place, he needed to make it compatible with the dirigibles. Six thousand dollars were spent to remodel the frame of the building to ensure it could withstand the forces exerted by the docking dirigibles. They also needed to find safe ways to dock the blimps. They were unable to find ways to extend an electric winch, which was crucial for a smooth docking process. Balloons were powered by flammable gases too, a safety hazard in a big city like New York, where a single spark could lead to a catastrophic explosion. Plus, weights could not be hanging over city streets in order to weigh down the ship, as it would pose a danger to pedestrians and vehicles below. These problems made the dirigible popularity drop quite a lot, so the mooring was never used to its full potential, remaining more of a novelty than a functional docking facility.
1743	16576	6	3	"In the passage, The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION2, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there are outlined. These obstacles were safety, nature, and law. Safety was an obstacle because the passengers on the dirigibles would be put in danger. This is evident in the line, ""...dirigibles from outside of the @LOCATION1 used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" The dirigibles could have blown up, as many have in the past, causing a massive explosion that would endanger not only the passengers but also people on the ground and in nearby buildings. Nature was an obstacle because the dirigibles could have a hard time attaching to the mast if the weather is undesirable. This is supported in the quotation, ""...winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The wind could cause the dirigibles to move around uncontrollably, which wouldn't be very safe for anyone, potentially leading to the dirigible crashing into the building or falling to the ground. There was a law against airships in urban areas that was an obstacle. This law is explained in the quotation, ""this law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" This law made it unnecessary to have the mooring mast, as it could not be legally used. The obstacles outlined in the passage The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION2, allowed the architects to avoid wasting funds on something that wouldn't be profitable, saving resources that could be better used elsewhere."
1744	16577	6	3	In the process of building the Empire State Building, there were many obstacles for the builders. Al Smith, who was the one who designed the building, wanted to make the building taller. He did this by attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on a mooring mast at the top of the building, reaching 1,250 feet high. There were obstacles in the way of attaining this goal. Safety was the greatest reason why it was never used as a docking station. Hydrogen was used in the dirigibles, which was highly flammable. An accident had already occurred having to do with a dirigible, called Hindenburg, in New Jersey. As popular as New York is, they couldn't take the risk of putting harmful, dangerous gases in a densely populated area, as a single fire or explosion could cause mass casualties and significant damage to the city. Another problem that occurred to stop this building from being used as a mooring mast was the powerful wind currents that constantly shifted. The dirigible would be dangling high over pedestrians swiveling around because of the wind, this made it very unsafe and not even practical, as it would be difficult to control the dirigible and ensure a safe docking. One last reason the Empire State Building would not be able to have a mooring mast in which dirigibles could land was because there was a law which stated airships were not allowed too low over urban areas. These were some of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced, ultimately preventing the mooring mast from becoming a functional docking facility.
1745	16578	6	3	In this excerpt the builders of the Empire State building were faced with many problems trying to build a dock for dirigibles. The first problem they were faced with was how could they put this much stress on the building's structure, as mentioned in paragraph @NUM1. The additional weight and forces exerted by the docking dirigibles could potentially damage the building's integrity over time. Another problem the workers faced was the safety of the city people below. What if the dirigible caught on fire like the Hindenburg and all the pedestrians below would be in danger. Also, the buildings around it would be in harm's way too, as the fire could spread quickly and cause a large - scale disaster. As stated in paragraph @NUM2 the dock was never really meant for use. I think they just wanted a reason to make the building taller than the Chrysler building. However, due to these significant problems, the idea of using the dock for dirigibles was not feasible, and it remained an unfulfilled concept.
1746	16579	6	3	Everyone would enjoy the convenience of hopping into a dirigible and traveling from one place to another. However, the builders encountered numerous challenges in their attempt to make this possible. One significant challenge was the stress that the single cable tether from the dirigible would impose on the building. The force exerted by the tethered dirigible could potentially compromise the structural integrity of the building over time. Additionally, wind pressure was a perilous factor. Given the substantial weight of the dirigible, strong winds could easily cause it to break free and pose a serious threat to people below. Strengthening the building to support the dirigible would come at a high cost, exceeding sixty thousand dollars. Moreover, the risk of fire was a major concern. Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. The Hindenburg disaster in 1937 serves as a tragic reminder of the potential dangers. Overall, due to these hazardous factors, the cons of allowing the dirigible to dock always outweigh the pros. Perhaps in the future, advancements in technology will enable a safe way to achieve this.
1747	16580	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced significant obstacles when it came to the airship mooring at the building. One of the primary issues was the unpredictable wind conditions. The winds on top of the building were constantly changing because of violent air currents. These erratic winds made it extremely difficult for airships to approach and dock safely. Another major obstacle was the existing law. There was a specific law that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas. This law was in place to ensure the safety of the people living in these areas. If an airship were to attempt to approach the Empire State Building, it would be breaking this law. In conclusion, these challenges effectively prevented the airship from mooring at the Empire State Building."
1748	16581	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building encountered multiple hurdles as they tried to enable dirigibles to dock. The first and most crucial problem was safety. Dirigibles constructed outside the U.S. relied on hydrogen, an extremely flammable gas. The Hindenburg disaster on May 6, 1937, in Lakehurst, New Jersey, was a tragic example of the danger. If a dirigible were to be destroyed over a densely populated area like New York City, it could cause extensive harm to a large number of people. The second obstacle was nature. At the high altitude of the building, violent air currents caused the winds to constantly shift. This made it extremely dangerous for dirigibles to land. Even when tethered to the mooring mast, the dirigible would sway back and forth, making it difficult to dock passengers and conduct inspections. Additionally, weighting down dirigibles with lead weights, a common practice, was not practical or safe at such a high altitude. The final obstacle was the law. There was a specific law that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas and made it illegal for them to tie up or approach the building. Overall, these obstacles effectively put an end to the potential of the mooring mast.
1749	16582	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous challenges when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. As presented in paragraph nine, the building was not originally designed to support a one - thousand - foot dirigible with a single rope. A dirigible of that size moored at the top of the building would add a significant amount of stress to the building's frame. To address this, @CAPS1 had to reinforce the building to withstand this new stress. The second problem, introduced in paragraph thirteen, was the use of hydrogen in dirigibles. Hydrogen is a highly flammable element, and having dirigibles filled with it over a populated area like New York was a major safety risk. In paragraph fourteen, it was revealed that the wind speed at the top of the building far exceeded that in other docking locations. This made it difficult to dock dirigibles as the normal method of tying down the back end with a rope and lead was not feasible due to the high - altitude conditions. In summary, the builders tried to overcome architectural, safety, and natural flaws to enable dirigible docking, but their efforts ultimately proved unsuccessful.
1750	16583	6	3	"Al Smith had a remarkable vision for the Empire State Building. His enthusiasm for having dirigibles dock at the top, however, made him overlook the obvious obstacles. Dirigibles were not a safe means of transportation. Hydrogen, which was commonly used in them, is highly flammable and would pose a great risk near large crowds in an urban area like New York. From a practical perspective, the mooring mast was unworkable due to the high elevation. The building's height led to violent winds, making it challenging for dirigibles to land and for passengers to disembark safely. Additionally, there was a law that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas. Irvan Clavan accurately summarized the situation when he said, ""The as yet unsolved problems of mooring airships to a fixed mast at such a height made it desirable to postpone to a later date the final installation of the landing gear."" As technology advanced, dirigibles soon became obsolete, further diminishing the possibility of using the mooring mast. In the end, the combination of safety concerns, practical difficulties, and legal restrictions thwarted the plan for dirigible docking at the Empire State Building."
1751	16584	6	3	"The main problem of dirigibles landing by the Empire State Building was safety. For one reason, dirigibles were huge; ""Some were as long as one thousand feet, the same length as four blocks in New York City."" The Empire State building is @NUM1 ft tall. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" If a dirigible was going to land on a very windy day, it had the potential of crashing into other buildings which would cut through the dirigibles' materials. Also, when it came to tethering to the mooring mast, they would... ""weigh down in the back with lead weights..."" This idea was dangerous. To hold the dirigible to the building, there would be lead weights ""dangling high above pedestrians on the street, which was neither practical nor safe."" Due to all these problems, it was clear that the dirigible would never be safe to land on the mooring mast, and these were the problems that the builders faced. In the end, the risks associated with landing dirigibles at the Empire State Building were simply too great to overcome."
1752	16585	6	3	"There were many reasons that the mooring mast couldn't be used. The first reason is wind speeds. In fact, ""in 1930, the @ORGANIZATION1 dirigible, Los Angeles, approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie because of forceful winds."" As a result, the dirigibles could not even get close enough to dock. Another reason was safety. In 1937, the German dirigible, Hindenburg, went down because of a fire. That situation could've been a lot worse if the dirigible went down on heavily populated areas, in which thousands of people might die. The last reason is that there is a law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas. Therefore, it would be illegal for a dirigible to get close enough to dock. Given these insurmountable issues, it became evident that the mooring mast was not a viable option for dirigible docking."
1753	16586	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State building faced several obstacles throughout the building procedure. First, many of the dirigibles were filled with hydrogen gas rather than helium, and ""hydrogen is highly flammable."" As a result, following the German dirigible Hindenburg disaster, Empire State Building owners ""realize how much worse the accident could have been,"" and this resulted in the decision not to utilize the mast as a docking area. Also, when Al Smith decided to build the additional mooring mast onto the top of the building, due to the weight of the docking blimps, the architects had to invest ""over @MONEY1"" to modify the building's framework and enable it to support the weight of a dangling blimp. Moreover, due to violent winds, the docking dirigibles could not properly land and ""were constantly shifting."" Lead weights couldn't be used because of the dangers and impracticalities the idea could set on the @LOCATION1 below. Finally, it seems that the overall safety and practicality of the mooring mast weren't easily attainable. Al Smith states himself that the engineers are ""trying to dope out a practical, workable arrangement."" Hence, the builders of the Empire State experienced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the building, and these challenges ultimately made the endeavor unfeasible."
1754	16587	6	3	"The ability to dock dirigibles atop the Empire State Building, while initially lucrative, had major obstacles. The problems facing the development of the mooring mast would be cost, flammability of dirigibles, and weather over @NUM1 feet in the air. The structural and cost problems facing Al Smith were that ""The stress of the dirigibles' load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" In order to overcome this obstacle, ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified, and... over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications would have to be made."" This is problematic because Al Smith now must spend more time and money than originally planned. Furthermore, another problem is that ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This is a huge obstacle because a fire or explosion ""above a densely populated area such as downtown New York"" would be catastrophic and could put thousands of people in harm's way. Finally, the weather at the top of the Empire State building is unsuitable for docking dirigibles: ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting... the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" This is dangerous to the structure of the building, surrounding buildings, and people close by. Due to these problems, Al Smith and the engineers could not complete the Mooring Mast, and the idea of dirigible docking at the Empire State Building was abandoned."
1755	16588	6	3	"In ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock on it. These obstacles took into account safety, nature itself, and the law. The first obstacle was one of safety. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" Owners of the Empire State Building realized that if a dirigible was destroyed by fire, it would cause a huge accident. Also, this accident would be devastating because it'd take place over the densely populated area of downtown New York. In addition, ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" These would cause the back of the ship to swivel around the mooring mast. Dirigibles that are moored in open fields use weights to be weighed down. Yet, these can't be used on top of the Empire State Building because they'd be dangling above walking pedestrians, which is dangerous. Lastly, a major obstacle faced when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the building was the ""existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" As a result, this would make it illegal for a ship to tie to the building or even approach the area. Overall, the obstacles faced when trying to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building were insurmountable, leading to the disappearance of this idea altogether."
1756	16589	6	3	Builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous challenges while trying to construct a dock for the dirigibles. They had to ensure that the platform was safe for passengers to walk on when disembarking from the blimps. Moreover, the dock needed to be positioned at a significant height so that the building's owner could maintain the record of having the world's highest building. A simple addition like a small hat wouldn't have achieved much, so building a proper dock was a more viable idea. In the end, despite their efforts, many factors made the successful implementation of the dirigible dock quite difficult.
1757	16590	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building encountered a variety of both man - made and natural problems while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One major issue was the building's strength. The building's steel was not strong enough to “transmit pressure from the dirigible's load to the building's foundation.” Additionally, “the winds at the top of the building were always in motion and filled with violent air currents,” which could push the Zeppelin into the edges of the building. It was also prohibited for airships to fly too low over urban areas, making it illegal for a ship to even dock at the building. Price was another significant factor. Along with the building's cost, an additional sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework just to make it strong enough to accommodate an airship. Given all these problems the builders faced, it's no wonder that dirigibles docking at the mooring mast was not a feasible option.
1758	16591	6	3	Based on the excerpt, the morning mast presented several obstacles that the builders faced when attempting to allow dirigibles to land on the Empire State Building. Constructing a 1454 - ft tall building was already a challenging task, and adding a mast would be even more difficult. Allowing a dirigible to land on the Empire State Building would be extremely dangerous. The German dirigible, the Hindenburg, was destroyed, causing millions of dollars of damage. “The owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown.” Therefore, the mast was erected but was never used as a dirigible landing site.
1759	16592	6	3	In the excerpt “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon Lusted, there are many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced. The task of building something on the Empire State Building that would allow dirigibles to dock there was a daring and perilous job. There were multiple obstacles the builders encountered. One significant obstacle was the winds. “The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents.” This made the building process extremely difficult as construction materials and equipment would get blown around. Another obstacle was that “The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation.” This meant that the builders first had to reinforce the building's structure to support the docking place before they could start building it. These two obstacles made building the docking place much more arduous. It took a longer time as they first had to strengthen the building's frame, and they also had to constantly monitor the wind to avoid any harm to the workers. In conclusion, these challenges significantly hampered the progress of creating the dirigible docking facility.
1760	16593	6	3	The obstacles that the workers had with docking the dirigibles were that even though the dirigibles would be tied up at the front, the back end would still swivel in the wind. They couldn't attach small weights to the back because if these weights ever fell, they would endanger pedestrians. Moreover, there was a law passed stating that ships couldn't dock on buildings or even come close to urban areas. These are some of the significant obstacles the workers faced, which ultimately made the docking of dirigibles at the building an unfeasible option.
1761	16594	6	3	Technology had not caught up to the dirigibles. They could not dock because neither the building nor the dirigible had the right equipment, and this was one of the obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced. For instance, when they had to deliver the newspaper, the lack of proper docking facilities made the process extremely difficult. In the end, this technological shortfall significantly hampered the intended use of the building for dirigible - related activities.
1762	16595	6	3	"One of the major obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was to strengthen the frame of the building. As stated, ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below (paragraph @NUM1)."" If the building was not strengthened, all that stress and force would surely collapse the building. Another crucial obstacle faced in the perfection of docking dirigibles was modifying its safety. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable (paragraph @NUM2)."" If a dirigible were to be destroyed by fire in downtown New York, it would undoubtedly cause a really serious hazardous accident. Downtown New York is densely populated, so a destroyed dirigible in this area puts in danger both the passengers of the dirigible and the pedestrians on the streets. Other than the two obstacles explained above, nature is yet another obstacle to the Empire State Building. Strong winds can severely affect the building or even the dirigible. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air - currents (paragraph @NUM3)."" Violent winds could force the back of the dirigible to swivel around the mooring mast. A swiveling ship above pedestrians is far from safe. Moreover, the law enforces that airships could not fly too low over urban areas. Flying too low over urban areas, once again, puts both pedestrians and passengers in a state of danger. The dirigible could be blown by the wind and hit a sharp spire of other buildings in the area. In conclusion, these multiple obstacles made it extremely challenging to dock a dirigible successfully at the Empire State Building."
1763	16596	6	3	The architects of the mooring mast were blind to the numerous problems that could have arisen. Balloons are not very strong, and if they didn't already know, it's quite windy on the top of the Empire State Building. The strong wind could drive the dirigible right into its spikey doom. They had no real effective way of keeping the dirigible contained because usually lead blocks were used to hold it down. However, from 102 stories in the air, relying on lead blocks was not the safest plan. Also, most non - American dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium. In a crowded New York City, a fireball resulting from a hydrogen - filled dirigible would be utterly devastating due to hydrogen being highly flammable. Clearly, the builders really should have planned this out better to avoid such potential disasters.
1764	16597	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building (@ORGANIZATION2) had many significant obstacles to face when building the mooring mast for dirigibles to dock. Top winds, the flammability of foreign ships, and airspace laws all severely hindered the production of the blimp dock. Very high up in New York, the winds are extremely dangerous. If a blimp tried to dock there, the back would be violently whipped around and could end up seriously harming someone. Being at such a great height, this situation is highly perilous. Many foreign dirigibles were filled with hydrogen, which is extremely flammable, as witnessed with the tragic Hindenburg incident. When that disaster occurred, the owners of the @ORGANIZATION2 thought it was far too risky having those hydrogen - filled dirigibles flying over highly populated areas. There were strict laws made prohibiting low - flying aircrafts over densely populated urban areas. So, there could be no docking at the Empire State Building or they'd be breaking the law every time they did. That was a risk the owners did not want to take. In summary, the idea of the mooring mast was a very under - thought idea. The builders forgot that the wind, the flammability of ships, and airspace laws would all ultimately end up stopping the mast's success. Now, the @ORGANIZATION2 just has a long, useless pole on top of it, a reminder of a flawed plan.
1765	16598	6	3	"The weight was a major obstacle they faced. As described, ""A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add significant stress to the building's frame. The stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" The weight of the dirigible would be too heavy for the frame because the frame wasn't originally made for that much weight. Some dirigibles were highly flammable. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" They felt that it was far too dangerous because the Empire State Building is located in a densely populated area. The air pressure was another obstacle that was faced. ""Fearing the winds would blow the dirigible onto the sharp spires of other buildings in the area, which would puncture the dirigible's shell...."" The last obstacle was the law. ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area..."" This law wouldn't allow dirigibles to land at the Empire State Building due to its location. In conclusion, these combined obstacles made it almost impossible for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building."
1766	16599	6	3	"Based on the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous and complex obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building's flat roof."" This was a significant struggle as a thousand - foot dirigible, when moored, would add an excessive amount of stress to the building's frame. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and as the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" Considering the foundation was eleven hundred feet below, this was yet another major obstacle the builders had to overcome. The Empire State building then had to be thoroughly strengthened and carefully modified in order to build a stronger foundation for the mooring of a dirigible upon it. These were some of the many challenges the builders endured in designing the mast, highlighting the complexity of the project."
1767	16600	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"", the builders faced several notable obstacles. Some of these obstacles were directly related to the strength of the building's frame. The architects could not simply place a mooring mast on top of the building's flat roof because it would place an overwhelming amount of stress on the frame. As a result, over sixty thousand dollars' worth of detailed modifications had to be made to the building's framework. Another obstacle was that despite these efforts, the mooring mast was ultimately never destined to fulfill its intended purpose, which was a disappointment after all the work and expense."
1768	16601	6	3	"The architects building the Empire State Building encountered a substantial problem when trying to install the mooring mast on the very top. The second sentence in paragraph @CAPS1 states, ""A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add a significant amount of stress to the building's frame."" Although the architects faced multiple challenges, this was the most prominent one. This meant that they would have to make substantial changes to the building's structure in order to make the mooring mast work. As it says at the bottom of paragraph @CAPS1, over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be carried out to address this issue."
1769	16602	6	3	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State building faced a considerable number of obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock upon its mast. The wind was a major and persistent problem for the blimps. Not only would they swing about in a dangerous manner when tethered to the mast, but on the few occasions that a dirigible actually approached the Empire State building, the strong and unpredictable winds made it impossible for them to maneuver close enough. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Another significant factor that stood in the way of the Empire State Building's dock being used was the high - level of danger it presented to the buildings and people below. The gas, hydrogen, that dirigibles used to float is highly flammable. ""When the German dirigible was destroyed by fire,... the owners... realized how much worse the accident would have been... above a densely populated area."" The third and final obstacle they faced was the strict law against airships flying too low over urban areas. ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building."" With all that potential danger and discouragement, it's entirely understandable that the Empire State building was never used for docking dirigibles."
1770	16603	6	3	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there included the issue of a thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building. Since it was held by a single cable tether, this would add a great deal of stress to the building's frame. Another obstacle was that the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. Even though the steel frame of the Empire State Building was initially strong, it had to be comprehensively modified and significantly strengthened to accommodate this new situation. Overall, this entire process of modification and strengthening cost over sixty thousand dollars' worth of work, demonstrating the high cost of overcoming these challenges.
1771	16604	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building faced quite a few challenges in creating dirigible docking stations. One of the main issues was that there was a strict law in place. This law specifically banned the use of low - flying aircraft in urban areas, such as the bustling New York City. Another significant reason was the safety aspect. It was simply not safe to dock these massive blimps at such a great height. At almost 800 hundred feet up, the winds would be extremely violent. With the tail - end of the dirigible not being fastened down properly, it was very likely that it could get spun around and end up tangled with the mast. Also, safety was a major concern because many foreign blimps were filled with hydrogen, which was highly flammable. If an accident similar to the tragic Hindenburg fire occurred over an urban place like New York City, it could have had extremely tragic consequences. Lastly, in order to build the mast, the builders had to reinforce the frame of the building carefully so that it could bear the stress that such a station would put on the structure. Due to these numerous obstacles, the idea of using the docking stations was ultimately not feasible.
1772	16605	6	3	"In the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State building, builders were faced with several different challenging obstacles. One obstacle the builders faced was the complex task of how they were going to modify the building to be able to support a ""thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether"". This was because it would add an excessive amount of stress to the building's frame, potentially compromising its structural integrity. Another obstacle, along with the necessary modifications to the building's frame, was the financial aspect. Building this new structure would cost a significant ""over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications"", which was a large investment. One of the most important obstacles, however, was safety. Although most blimps in the United States use helium, outside countries mainly use hydrogen. Hydrogen, being highly flammable, was absolutely out of the question to be in a city as highly and densely populated as New York. The other safety hazards included the winds, which were ""constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". Since the back of the blimp could not be weighed down, it was at risk. Also, there was ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"", which would make their attempts not only dangerous but also illegal. In the end, due to these insurmountable obstacles, the mooring mast was never completed."
1773	16606	6	3	"Based on the excerpt ""The Mooring mast"" by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced a few significant obstacles. One of those obstacles was making sure that blimps and other airborne transportations did not interfere with the building. This involved ensuring that the flight paths of these vehicles did not pose a risk to the building's structure or the people inside. Also, another obstacle the builders had to deal with was making sure the docking areas were safe. Because if a blimp got too close to an urban city like New York and all those flammable fuels leaked out, it would be a huge disaster. The dense population and numerous buildings in New York would make the consequences of such an incident extremely severe. These are the obstacles the builders faced, and they made the construction of the docking facilities a very challenging task."
1774	16607	6	3	"In The ""Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION1 many problems with the mast of the Empire State building are explained. One of the many problems was that the large dirigible tied to the building mast would add a substantial amount of stress to the building. This stress could potentially cause the building to collapse, which was a major safety concern. But this problem was fixed by strengthening the building's foundation. Engineers carefully designed and implemented reinforcement measures to ensure the building could withstand the additional load. A second problem with docking a dirigible at the Empire State building was the highly flammable gases the dirigible used to become lighter than air. If the dirigible were to catch fire, its metal frame could fall to the ground, endangering the citizens below. The last danger would be that while the dirigible was docked, strong air currents coming off of the building could cause the dirigible's tail to spin around on the mast. One way to fix this would be to place lead weights on the back of the ship. But if one of these weights fell off of the dirigible, it could potentially harm pedestrians below. Because of these persistent problems, the mast could never be used effectively."
1775	16608	6	3	When designing the dock for dirigibles on the top of the Empire State Building, there were several obstacles that the architects and the engineers were faced with. One problem was that they couldn't simply drop the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building because it was too heavy for the frame of the building. The frame was not initially designed to support such a large and heavy structure. So, because of that problem, the architects and engineers had to come up with a way to modify the frame of the building carefully so that the building could put up with the added stress of the mooring mast. Another problem that they were faced with was that it was simply too dangerous. It was deemed dangerous because most dirigibles were filled with Hydrogen, which was extremely flammable. They couldn't risk having an accident similar to what happened to the Hindenburg happen 102 floors above city streets that were crowded with people. So, those were a few obstacles that the architects were faced with when building the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building, and these challenges made the project very difficult to execute.
1776	16609	6	3	The @CAPS1 states that the greatest obstacle in this endeavor would be nature itself. The strong wind would blow the blimps onto the sharp spires of other nearby buildings, causing potential damage and endangering the blimps and their passengers.
1777	16610	6	3	The builders faced many problems that should have been foreseen. Perhaps the greatest reason was because @CAPS1 dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium as their gas choice. Hydrogen is highly flammable, and if it were to explode, it would have spelled doom for New York, as the resulting fire and destruction could have spread quickly in the densely populated urban area. The weather also created a great risk. If a dirigible were to dock there, the violent air currents would shift constantly, making it extremely difficult to control the dirigible's movement. The use of lead weights to stabilize the dirigible would put pedestrians at risk, as the weights could potentially fall from the great height. That idea was neither safe nor practical. Probably one of the most obvious risks was the law. There was a law that stated that airships cannot fly too low over urban areas. Because of these reasons, it made making the Empire State Building a landing area unsafe, and thus, the plan was ultimately unfeasible.
1778	16611	6	3	After finishing the @ORGANIZATION1, architects were eager to start mooring dirigibles right away. However, due to three potential problems that the architects had never realized before, they never could moor any dirigibles. One problem was that most @CAPS1 dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium. This was a significant problem because hydrogen is extremely flammable. After the Hindenburg went up in flames in @ORGANIZATION2, architects feared that a similar catastrophe could happen in @CAPS3, and many more would die as the Empire State Building is located in a highly populated area. Another problem was high winds. Because it was so windy at the top of the building, it was almost impossible to hold the dirigibles steady. Also, the dirigible would have swiveled while tied to the building because there was nothing holding down the front and back, making the docking process extremely dangerous. The third issue was that there was a law against flying dirigibles at the height that was necessary to moor on the Empire State Building. That's why no dirigibles ever successfully moored on the Empire State Building, as these problems made the operation too risky and illegal.
1779	16612	6	3	"There were many obstacles the builder of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First off, as stated in paragraph @NUM1, ""A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building... would add stress to the building's frame."" This shows a significant obstacle because in order to enable this to happen, over @MONEY1 of funds would be needed. The funds would be used for the strengthening and modification of the steel frame, thus requiring the re - working of the fundamental building blocks of the operation, which would be time - consuming and complex. Second, the greatest concern was safety. This is brought to light because most dirigibles are very flammable as they consist of helium, which is an extremely flammable gas. Also, if the dirigible were to mount to the top of the Empire State Building, the back of it would be swaying around and around. This has a real possibility of dis - mounting and crashing into a densely populated area of people, causing great harm and destruction. These are some of the reasons that made the obstacles of attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the top of the Empire State Building insurmountable."
1780	16613	6	3	"While constructing the Empire State Building, the builders were faced with many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One such obstacle that the builders had to overcome was the law that prevented airships (i.e., planes or dirigibles) from flying too low over urban areas. In paragraph @NUM1, we learn that ""[this law] would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" This legal restriction posed a major challenge to the plan. Another obstacle the building crew of the Empire State Building was faced with when constructing the mooring mast was nature itself. Because of the violent wind currents near the top of the building, the way the wind blew constantly changed, causing a great difficulty for any dirigible to connect to the mast properly. In paragraph @NUM2, we are told about how if it were possible to connect the mast to a dirigible, the back would swing. ""Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighed down in the back with lead weights, but using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe."" Because there were too many obstacles with not enough safe options, the mooring mast project was shut down. This proves that during its construction, its builders were faced with too many insurmountable obstacles, and the plan to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building could not be realized."
1781	16614	6	3	"To design a mast for the dirigibles to land was no easy matter. Architects couldn't simply place a mooring mast on top of the @ORGANIZATION1's flat roof. The stress from a thousand - foot dirigible would transmit significant weight and strong wind pressure all the way to the foundation. To be able to create this mast, the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened. First, the architects ""designed a shiny glass and chrome - nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from inside, with a stepped - back design that imitated the overall shape of the building itself."" This rocket - shaped mast would have four wings at its corners made of aluminum and would rise to a conical roof that would house the mooring arm. For the winches and control machinery for the dirigible mooring, they would be placed in the back of the machinery area. Finally, when this was all completed, the existing plans for the building were to be put in place, ensuring the overall integrity and functionality of the structure."
1782	16615	6	3	"There were many obstacles which the builders of the mooring mast had to face. They initially thought it was going to be an easy task to accomplish, as shown in paragraph eight where Al Smith was asked about the mooring mast and he responded ""[It's] on the level, all right. No kidding. We're working on the thing now."" This shows how truly sure Smith was about the goal's simplicity. Although determination was a great factor in the building of this world - wide known monument, problems kept standing in the way of success. For example, in paragraph @NUM1 the author describes how the Empire State Building would not be able to fulfill its purpose, even though workers should've known better. She states ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" Difficulties kept pouring down, one of them being nature. The strong winds and unpredictable weather conditions made the construction and operation of the mooring mast extremely challenging. Finally, the workers gave up after the project was postponed due to mainly safety reasons. By the late 1930's, the idea of the mooring mast had almost disappeared. All that really matters is that they tried, and all it took was just one dream, which shows the spirit of innovation and ambition in the face of difficulties."
1783	16616	6	3	"In the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"", by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced a few problems in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the first problems they faced was safety. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (L¸sted, @NUM1). The builders would have to keep this in mind as a single spark could lead to a catastrophic explosion, endangering the lives of passengers and people in the building below. The next obstacle they faced was nature and its winds. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to the violent air currents,"" (@NUM2). The winds would be a major problem that the builders would have to face because it is so unpredictable. Strong gusts could push the dirigible off - course or cause it to collide with the building. Lastly, the builders had to worry about the law pertaining to airships flying too low over urban areas ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area,"" (@NUM3). The builders of the Empire State Building had to face the difficulties of safety, nature, and the law in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, and these challenges ultimately made the project very difficult to achieve."
1784	16617	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles such as safety, nature, and law in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. The issue of safety became apparent because most dirigibles made outside of the @LOCATION1 were made with highly flammable hydrogen rather than helium. To risk the destruction of one atop such a bustling city would be devastating, not only in terms of loss of life but also in terms of damage to the iconic building and the surrounding area. Nature too became a problem in the futile attempt of the builders. With such ""Violent air currents"" (∂ @NUM1), the dirigible would swivel around even if it were tied up to the mooring mast, making it difficult to board passengers safely and increasing the risk of damage to the dirigible and the mast. Finally, law was an obstacle to the builders. Existing legislation banned airships from ""flying too low over urban areas"" (∂ @NUM2), meaning the dirigibles would have no way of landing atop the urban building. Obstacles such as safety, nature, and law hindered the attempt of allowing dirigibles to land on the Empire State Building, making it an unfeasible project under the given circumstances."
1785	16618	6	3	In the @CAPS1, the docking of dirigibles had many issues. One, boarding passengers would be very difficult as the dirigible will @CAPS2 violently from a gust of wind. This sudden movement could cause passengers to lose their balance and fall, posing a serious safety risk. Second, the gases used to make the dirigible afloat are highly flammable, and explode quite easily. A small spark from an electrical device or a static discharge could trigger a massive explosion, endangering the lives of everyone on board and in the vicinity. These issues made the docking of dirigibles a very challenging and risky endeavor.
1786	16619	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous and significant obstacles when considering having dirigibles dock there. First off, it was a colossal safety issue. As stated, ""most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen... hydrogen is highly flammable"" (paragraph @NUM1). If an accident of a scale similar to the Hindenburg disaster occurred over New York City, thousands of innocent people could lose their lives because of this highly flammable substance. The dense population below would be extremely vulnerable. Secondly, a very large problem was successfully using the mooring mast. ""The winds at the top of the building are constantly shifting due to air currents"" (paragraph @NUM2). If the wind got out of control and the dirigible wasn't tied down properly, the harsh winds could have the dirigible dangerously dangling over the people of New York. Amongst many other reasons and with the use of common sense, it is clear that the construction of this mooring mast should never have been realistically considered. In conclusion, the risks and challenges were far too great to make the idea of dirigible docking at the Empire State Building a feasible one."
1787	16620	6	3	"In The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, you learn about the ambitious plans for the Empire State Building. Not only that, but you also discover why the Mooring Mast cannot be used for its original purpose. The Mooring Mast was initially planned to serve as a docking station for dirigibles, or blimps. One reason why the Mooring Mast could not dock these dirigibles is that places outside of the U.S. used hydrogen instead of helium. The excerpt states ""Most dirigibles outside of the U.S. used hydrogen rather than helium, which is highly flammable."" (∂ @NUM1). Naturally, they did not want a huge fire to break out in a highly populated area like New York. Another reason why it would not work was the presence of violent air currents. The excerpt states ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would be whirled around the mooring mast."" (∂ @NUM2). With that problem, they would also have to worry about the mast being damaged or taken out. The last reason is because of a law. The excerpt states ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (∂ @NUM3). The building mast was too close to humans to allow them to dock there. In conclusion, while the mast was a brilliant and innovative idea, it could not be realized due to these insurmountable obstacles, and now it remains only a dream."
1788	16621	6	3	The builders and architects of the Empire State Building encountered a multitude of problems when attempting to dock dirigibles at the top. The first problem was that there were extremely strong winds near the uppermost part of the building. These powerful winds made it extremely difficult for a captain to have full control of their ship. When the dirigible was anchored to the mast by a single tether, the strong winds would twist the dirigible around the spire, making it nearly impossible to transfer passengers safely. Another important issue that the builders could not overcome was the fact that the streets below the Empire State Building were densely populated. This meant that a disaster similar to the tragic Hindenburg incident in New Jersey could cause many more casualties in the bustling city of New York. Lastly, one of the most obvious obstacles that the builders could not get past was the existing law against airships flying over urban areas. This law made it illegal to fly a dirigible at a height that would be necessary for docking on the mast of the Empire State Building. With these significant obstacles in their way, the builders of the Empire State Building could most likely never have accomplished their dream of docking dirigibles on the mast. In conclusion, the combination of wind challenges, population density, and legal restrictions made the idea of dirigible docking at the Empire State Building an unachievable goal.
1789	16622	6	3	"An obstacle the builders of the Empire State building faced was weight. As the story indicates, ""A thousand - foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add a substantial amount of stress to the building's frame. The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly @NUM1 feet below."" This added stress could potentially compromise the structural integrity of the building. Another obstacle was nature. The story says ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was Nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" These unpredictable wind patterns made it extremely difficult to safely dock a dirigible. In conclusion, the issues of weight - induced stress and the unpredictable forces of nature made it highly improbable for the builders to achieve their goal of using the mooring mast for dirigible docking."
1790	16623	6	3	"The architects had to go through many arduous obstacles, such as having to completely rebuild the whole frame of the Empire State building. In paragraph nine it says ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building's flat roof."" Consequently, they had to carefully modify and strengthen the entire structure to accommodate the new situation. Another obstacle they had to face was that hydrogen was highly flammable. When a German dirigible was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, the owners of the Empire State Building realized that an accident of that magnitude could be far worse in the crowded streets of New York. The potential for a large - scale disaster was a major concern. Another obstacle was nature itself. In paragraph @NUM1 it says ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The back of the ship would swivel around, and while it could be held down with lead weights, as paragraph @NUM1 says ""using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling, is neither practical nor safe."" In conclusion, the combination of structural modifications, the flammability of hydrogen, and the challenges posed by nature made it impossible for the architects to achieve their goal of using the mooring mast for dirigible docking."
1791	16624	6	3	The builders of the Empire State Building, in their ambitious plan to allow dirigibles to dock on the mast, were faced with many formidable obstacles. Initially, they did not fully realize that making the docking feasible would be extremely complex. The most intricate obstacle was figuring out how to securely tie the blimp down. Not only did they have to prevent it from spinning around wildly, but they also had to ensure that the force exerted by the blimp wouldn't rip the building out of its foundation. The constructors were also deeply concerned about safety and whether such a docking arrangement was permitted. Another major hurdle was that dirigibles were flying too low to the ground for docking. Moreover, they were mostly filled with hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable, posing a significant risk. After all the arduous efforts to achieve success, Al Smith and his peers had to prioritize and look out for the best interests of the people of New York. In the end, considering these insurmountable obstacles, the plan to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was not a practical one.
1792	16625	6	3	"Dirigibles are large steel - frame balloons that are enclosed by cotton and filled with a combination of hydrogen and helium. In the early 1930's, a novel idea emerged that dirigibles would dock at the top of the iconic Empire State Building in New York. After carefully reading The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L¸sted, we have gained insights into the numerous obstacles the builders were confronted with. The author clearly notes, ""the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". As a result, the dirigibles would be in a state of constant movement and shifting, making docking extremely difficult. The author also states, ""the other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This law was put in place for valid safety reasons. Due to these two main obstacles - nature and law, the builders were unable to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. In conclusion, these challenges made the docking of dirigibles at the building an unfeasible idea."
1793	16626	6	3	The builders of the Empire State building had a multitude of obstacles in their path if they intended to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first and most critical problem was ensuring the safety of the passengers on the dirigibles as well as the pedestrians on the street below. Dirigibles are filled with hydrogen, which is highly flammable. A tragic example of this danger occurred in 1937 in New Jersey when the dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by a fire. This catastrophe would have been far more disastrous if it had taken place over the densely populated areas of New York city. Nature also presented a huge threat to the construction and use of the docking mast. Due to the strong air currents on the top of the building, the blimp (dirigible) would be in a constant state of shifting. The only possible way to control the swaying of the blimp would be to use weights to hold it down, but this would again put the public at risk. Along with these natural hazards, it would have been illegal for the blimps to dock at the Empire State building because of an existing law. In light of all these issues, the idea to allow dirigibles to dock at a mooring mast atop the Empire State Building is completely impractical and unworkable.
1794	16627	6	3	"There were many significant obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, including nature, law, and the sharp spire. Nature was probably the most significant problem as the wind is uncontrollable. The wind at the top of the Empire State Building was so strong that, as described, ""... the back of the ship would swivel around and around..."". This would make the process of landing and taking off the dirigibles extremely difficult and dangerous. Law was also a major issue. There was a law in place that strictly prevented ""... airships flying too low over urban areas."" Additionally, the spire at the top of the building was sharp enough to pose a serious threat to the dirigibles. If a dirigible were to accidentally hit it, it would pop the dirigible, and the resulting explosion and debris could kill many people below. Given these insurmountable obstacles, it is clear that the plan to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was not viable."
1795	16628	6	3	The planners of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. For example, it would have been almost impossible to dock due to the violent winds blowing at that height. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting because of violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast. It would not have been safe to land a dirigible there as the winds at that height were unstable, causing the ship to toss and turn in the air. Another obstacle they faced was the law regarding airships flying too low to the ground. An existing law prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for a ship to tie up to the building or even approach the area. That means even if docking were physically possible, it would break the law. The workers building the Empire State Building had to deal with these challenges, but the obstacles were simply too great to overcome. Thus, no dirigibles have successfully docked there, and considering these long - standing issues, none ever will.
1796	16629	6	3	"The one obstacle the builders had when trying to build this building was the lack of a convenient way for the dirigibles to land for all. The dirigibles had a relatively fast speed of eight miles per hour, and they were as large as four blocks of New York City, as mentioned in paragraph @NUM1. This was a problem for the builders because both the dirigibles and the building itself were very big. The size was an issue because the enormous dirigibles would not land in the right space. Having a lack of time was always a concern because the building would not be completed on schedule. The builders always had to hold back because ""engineers consulted with experts... architects met with presidents"" as stated in paragraph @NUM2. Holding back on the construction of the building to meet with those people took away valuable time. When there is something very high and wide in the way, there will inevitably be a problem, and these challenges ultimately affected the building's progress."
1797	16630	6	3	Some of the problems with the constructing of docking dirigibles were that natural causes, such as high winds as mentioned in ∂ 6, posed significant challenges. The dirigibles were highly flammable due to the use of hydrogen gases that enabled the dirigibles to fly. Also, another important factor was that this project was being carried out in a highly populated area. This meant that if anything ever went wrong, harm could be done to civilians, which added a great deal of risk to the entire endeavor. Overall, these issues made the construction of docking dirigibles a very difficult task.
1798	16631	6	3	"The builders of the Empire State building faced some obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. A problem they had was the violent winds blowing the blimp around at a high altitude, with people onboard. As stated, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting."" Another setback was that it was illegal to fly an aircraft that low. Specifically, it was ""illegal for a ship to tie up to a building."" Also, it was dangerous for dirigibles that ran on hydrogen to dock because hydrogen is highly flammable. Due to these numerous issues, the Mooring Mask of the Empire State Building ultimately became nothing more than an attraction for sightseers."
1799	16632	6	3	The obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building faced was that there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. Although two dirigibles did attempt to reach the building before the entire idea was dropped, the legal restriction was a major hurdle that could not be overcome, and it effectively put an end to the plan of dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building.
1800	16633	6	3	"You want me to tell you what they had to go through in an attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there?! Well, to tell you the truth, they had to go through a lot. For instance, ""one obstacle was the lack of a suitable landing area."" Also, another ""obstacle I would have to say is nature""! Let me tell you why I picked these two obstacles. They wanted to dock the dirigibles at the Empire State Building. I say ""wanted"" because their plan did not work; there were too many things wrong. For example, as they said, ""one obstacle was the lack of a suitable landing,"" and they couldn't find a good landing area for the dirigibles without something bad happening. Another ""obstacle they had was nature."" I say nature because if the wind blew, it could blow away some people. So, those are the main obstacles that they had to go through @CAPS1 to allow the dirigibles to dock there, and these challenges ultimately led to the failure of the docking plan."
