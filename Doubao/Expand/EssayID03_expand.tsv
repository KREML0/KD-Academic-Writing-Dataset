1	5978	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. The features of the setting that particularly trouble the cyclist are the lack of clear information on where to go and the scarcity of water. This poses a significant problem because for his long - distance trip, he desperately needs water to stay hydrated and accurate directions to reach his destination. In the end, these issues can make his journey much more arduous and uncertain.
2	5979	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in a negative way. He found himself in the vast desert, a place that is characteristically dry and extremely hot. As Kurmaskie states, “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” The month of June in the high deserts only exacerbates the heat. Also, the soaring temperature made everything around him unbearably hot, as described by “brackish water falling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.” Since he was in the open expanse of the desert, there was no shelter from the blistering sun. The text further notes, “The sun was beginning to beat down.” The cyclist was all alone on the desolate road, with no one in sight. So, until he eventually passed out, there was no one to come to his aid. As Kurmaskie writes, “and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June.” “About forty miles into the pedal, I arrived at the first ‘town’ but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.” The settings in which the cyclist was riding were far from ideal and thus negatively affected him, ultimately causing him to be severely dehydrated and utterly exhausted.
3	5980	3	3	Everyone travels to unfamiliar places. Sometimes, when we get lost in these new locations, we might ask locals for directions, which may not always be a good idea. The setting had a notable impact on the cyclist. He had a perfectly good map that could have guided him accurately. However, he approached a group of older men who looked as if they hadn't been out of their vicinity in ages. These old men, apparently out of touch with the current layout of the area, gave the cyclist the wrong directions. My advice would be to not blindly listen to anyone, regardless of their age, if you have a reliable map with you. Also, it's crucial to try and have a general sense of where you are going at all times. In this way, you can avoid the mistakes the cyclist made.
4	5981	3	3	I believe the features of the cyclist's personality affected him negatively. He was impatient and overly trustworthy. He took the old men's advice to take a shortcut that would supposedly save him an hour of his time. If he had stayed true to the map, he wouldn't have almost suffered from heatstroke. But his impatience got the better of him, and he decided to take the shortcut. After this harrowing experience, he learned that he has to stick to the map and not trust people who haven't witnessed the changes in the area over the last few years. This realization will likely make him more cautious in future travels.
5	5982	3	3	The setting effects the cyclist because if the setting were different, the story would not have made sense. The setting of the story is a desolate and dry landscape with scattered ghost towns. When he reaches the first “town,” he sees “One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn't hold the lamesh mule.” The lack of water in this setting creates a major problem. If there were no such water - related issue, there would be no conflict in the story. In the story, the speaker says, “I was traveling through the high deserts of California,” which are known to be very hot and dry. This hot and dry environment causes the crucial problem of a high need for water. If the setting were a lush forest in [DATE1], he wouldn't have as pressing a need for water, which would have made the story much less exciting and engaging. The setting, therefore, is integral to the story's conflict and overall appeal.
6	5983	3	3	There were many features of the setting that affected the cyclist. For instance, it was extremely hot and dry, with the scorching sun relentlessly beating down. Also, it was nearly deserted; almost all of the places he crossed were completely deserted, with not a soul in sight. Among the lost features of the setting were a ram - shackle shed that looked on the verge of collapse, several rusty pumps that had long since stopped working, and a corral that couldn't even hold in the lamest of animals. These features give you an idea of how the cyclist feels, as the desolate and harsh environment surely made his journey a difficult one.
7	5984	3	3	The cyclist was riding through a small town when he stopped for directions. These old men, sitting idly on a bench outside a dilapidated store, told him to take a short cut and he did, only to get lost. He found himself in a ghost town in the desert, with empty buildings and a sense of eerie quiet. In conclusion, the desert is hot, and this heat added to his distress of being lost.
8	5985	3	3	The affects of the cyclist's situation, if it does not change, could hurt a lot of people's feelings because there are those who simply don't care about the cyclist. I'm one of those people who does not care about it because it does not affect me or anyone I know. It is a big deal to some people; some of them get so worked up that they might even blow stuff up. They are talking on TV and on the radio, making all these claims that seem made up. I don't believe it until I see it. That whole situation is not relevant to black people because it has not done anything to us. We really don't care about the affects of the cyclist, and it seems this issue will continue to divide people's opinions.
9	5986	3	3	The essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” describes a man’s bicycle ride through California. Now, California is very hot during the summer, which is when the cyclist is riding. The blistering heat of the summer sun in California creates a sweltering environment. This setting greatly affects the man’s journey. It made it very difficult for him to finish his ride. He drank most of his water in the beginning of his ride due to the intense heat, so he gets very dehydrated. The text states, “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.” As you can see, the setting makes this man’s bike ride extremely hard, almost an insurmountable challenge.
10	5987	3	3	In the story, “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” written by Joe Kurmaskie, represents how certain conditions can affect a cyclist. The cyclist was biking through the desert to reach Yosemite National Park, but on his journey he encountered many tough conditions to make it difficult to get there. First of all, the desert was very hot, with the sun blazing brightly in the cloud - less sky, which makes travel very difficult. For example, the text states, “the sun was beginning to beat down.” This intense heat makes any task difficult because the sun drains a person’s energy, leaving them weak and fatigued. Secondly, the trip was very long so the cyclist had a hard time conserving water. For instance, the man drank so much water, he almost ran out; “The water bottle contained only a few sips,” leading to dehydration which can cause death. Joe Kurmaskie’s story, “Rough Road Ahead. Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” clearly represents how certain conditions of an environment can severely affect a cyclist's journey.
11	5988	3	3	The setting of the author's “shortcut” affected his performance and strength tremendously. Whether it was the steep hills, scorching heat, or barren landscape, all three factors took their toll on Joe Kurmaskie. Not only that, but his lack of water depleted his energy as well. “Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.” The hills were a tough obstacle to pass since Joe was being drained of energy with each pedal stroke. He overcame this exhaustion when a building came into view. “I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn't a mirage, and tried not to get too excited with what I believed was my last burst of energy. I maneuvered down the hill.” The author overcame all the problems he faced even though it was extremely difficult. He seems to have written this piece to exaggerate how important it is to keep going when you want to give up. Winston Churchill once said, “Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage it takes to continue that counts.” I believe that @PERSON2 agrees that perseverance is key in the face of adversity.
12	5989	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist very much so! The cyclist is riding through the blistering hot desert. In such a harsh environment, he needs an ample supply of cold water to keep him hydrated. The longer he rides under the blazing hot sun, the more profusely he sweats, and the higher the likelihood of him getting dehydrated. If he was riding in the pouring rain or thick snow, it could possibly slow him down as well. This is because he would be cold, and his muscles might get stiff, preventing him from moving as fast as he normally would. The cold could also make his hands numb, affecting his grip on the handlebars. All these factors clearly show why the setting affects the cyclist very much so, as it can significantly impact his physical condition and performance.
13	5990	3	3	There were many features that affected the cyclist such as the intense heat and lack of water. The cyclist was constantly drinking a lot of water throughout the story and ends up only having a little water left. “I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.” That shows he wasn't adequately prepared with enough water for his trip to Yosemite. Without water, he/she would face the real danger of dying from the heat. “Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heat stroke” This states that he @CAPS1 recognized the danger of not having enough water in his system. Features such as water and heat affected him/her throughout the story. Not having enough water could make him/her lose more sweat, and the sweltering heat is making him lose even more sweat, which can lead to extreme heatstroke. Heatstroke can cause dizziness, confusion, and even loss of consciousness, highlighting the critical importance of water in such a situation.
14	5991	3	3	The features in the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. Initially, when the cyclist came across the road with the big snake lying in the middle of it, it made him stay on high - alert and feel very uneasy. The sight of the large, menacing snake made his heart race, and he had to carefully navigate around it while trying not to startle it. Furthermore, the vast desert with nothing but sand and an empty horizon around gave the cyclist a feeling of abandonment and the sense that there would be no help available when he was in trouble. The desolate landscape seemed to stretch on forever, and the cyclist felt isolated and vulnerable. Finally, the cyclist is greatly relieved when he sees the bait store and realizes that people are there. The presence of the store and other people offered a glimmer of hope and safety. The features in the setting greatly affected the cyclist on his ride, influencing his emotions and state of mind throughout the journey.
15	5992	3	3	The features of the setting in “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” by Joe Kurmaskie, greatly affect the cyclist and put him through many hardships that he probably could have avoided. The old cottagers told him about a path they thought was right, but it turned out to be a difficult one and did not lead him to the right place. The features of the setting are described as “flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.” These hills were not only physically demanding to climb but also mentally exhausting as they kept coming one after another. The unexpected change in the terrain made the cyclist's journey much more arduous than he had anticipated. Overall, the features of the setting had a significant negative impact on the cyclist's trip, highlighting the importance of proper planning and reliable information when embarking on a journey.
16	5993	3	3	"In the essay ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"", the author Joe Kurmaskie uses the features of the setting to significantly affect the cyclist. The cyclist is affected by these features because for several miles, he sees the same desolate desert setting. There is no change in the scenery, and he has no water as none of the fountains offer cold water. Moreover, the road is filled with a lot of hills. The cyclist could be deeply affected by seeing the desert with no scenery changes for a while. When one looks at the same unchanging scene for hours, it's easy to start getting tired and bored with everything. This causes him to feel very drowsy and bored. Also, having no water out in the desert can make a person dehydrate and faint. All these factors combined make the cyclist's journey extremely challenging and arduous, clearly demonstrating how the setting has a profound impact on his experience."
17	5994	3	3	"Many different characteristics in a setting can determine the outcome of an event taking place there. In the story, ""Rough Road Ahead Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"", the cyclist's journey was affected by a few weather - related things. The intense heat was an extreme factor that slowed him down and, in most cases, prevented him from reaching his maximum level of ability. The sweltering sun bore down on him, sapping his energy with each passing moment. Also, the time of day in which this takes place greatly affects the cyclist. For example, cycling during the peak heat of the day is much more strenuous than in the cooler hours. Lastly, the type of road and the amount of ground that he has to cover also affect his performance. A rough, hilly road requires more effort than a flat, smooth one. Overall, setting can be a determining factor in a journey, just as it was in the cyclist's life, influencing every step of his adventure."
18	5995	3	3	The setting of the story affects the cyclist in many ways. Since he is riding in the vast California desert, he constantly feels very hot, and the heat makes him always in a state of constant thirst. The sun beats down relentlessly, baking the ground and leaving him parched. In addition to this, the area he is riding in appears to be quite desolate. As he pedals along, he finds nothing but old abandoned buildings that stand as silent witnesses to a bygone era. He doesn't encounter anyone. There are no people, no cars, and no sign of modern civilization. This isolation causes him to feel a little unnerved, as if something were to happen to him, nobody would know about it. This feeling of vulnerability is especially prevalent when he becomes dehydrated. In those ways, the cyclist is very much affected by the setting, which creates a challenging and lonely environment for his journey.
19	5996	3	3	In the story “Rough Road Ahead” by @PERSON1, the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One way the setting affects the cyclist is that, in the hot and arid desert, the cyclist drank more water than before. The dry air and high temperatures cause rapid dehydration. For example, the text states “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June. You will drink more water in a desert than in a forest because the desert environment is much more demanding on the body. The lack of moisture in the air and the intense heat force the body to lose water at a faster rate. If you go cycling, be aware of the settings around you because they will affect you. The desert setting can pose significant challenges to a cyclist, and being prepared is crucial for a safe and successful journey.
20	5997	3	3	"Some features of the setting affect the cyclist. First, the cyclist followed the old codgers' advice on how to get to Yosemite National Park. Their advice seemed well - intentioned but was no use and didn't help her in the end. She found herself on a path that led to nowhere useful. Next, “a tarlike substance oozed out” of what she thought was going to be water. This was a huge disappointment as she was in desperate need of hydration. Then, the terrain changed to “short, rolling hills”. These hills were not easy to navigate and didn't make her bike ride any better. They required extra effort and energy. Lastly, ""tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake"" appeared, which slowed her down. The unexpected obstacles and the fear of the snake made her cautious and reduced her speed. All of these roadblocks in the setting affected the cyclist, making her journey more difficult and less straightforward than she had anticipated."
21	5998	3	3	The features of the setting that significantly affect the cyclist are the severe lack of water sources, the presence of out - of - date information, and the continuous rolling hills. If he had access to up - to - date information, he would probably have been able to get water from a town that isn't empty or almost empty like a “ghost town” as the cyclist described. This would have made his journey much more bearable.
22	5999	3	3	When the cyclist is racing, there are a couple of things that can pose challenges. If the wind is blowing strongly, it becomes a major problem as it creates resistance. Additionally, he has to strictly follow traffic laws and ride on the right side of the road. This combination of factors makes his racing experience quite difficult, but he adheres to these rules to ensure his safety.
23	6000	3	3	“Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” was set in a rough environment filled with hazardous things and the death - defying heat. The cyclist had to endure the intense pain of dehydration while maintaining his determination. He had been given bad directions that almost cost him his life. He was travelling through a vast desert where he claimed the temperature was @NUM1. Also, since he passed through ghost towns, the cyclist had to ration his limited water supply. He used nature skills he’d once learned and began to suck on pebbles, which took his mind off thirst and used saliva to help refresh his throat. Throughout his arduous adventure, everything seemed to conspire against him, preventing him from getting water any faster. Fortunately, he survived and learned his lesson, vowing never to take shortcuts again.
24	6001	3	3	An example of the setting affecting the cyclist is when he faced a lack of water in a ghost town in just eliterat. After much searching, he finally found a water source, but a tar - like substance came out, and it tasted like battery. When he left that place, he had to traverse a rough road. Due to the poor condition of the road, he couldn't travel at a fast speed, which further delayed his journey. This shows how the harsh setting continuously hampered his progress.
25	6002	3	3	The cyclist had an extremely hard time getting to Yosemite National Park. This was mainly because the sun was blazing, and it was in the middle of June. The intense heat was so overwhelming that the cyclist became dehydrated much faster than he would have on a cooler day. When he pumped the handle of the old rusted water pump, he said the water felt “somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees”. Moreover, the cyclist also had to deal with a large number of “short rolling hills”, which were much more difficult to bike on compared to flat roads. On top of all these difficulties, the roads were in very bad condition, so he had to constantly watch out for rocks in the road. Despite all these challenges, he persevered and finally reached his destination.
26	6003	3	3	The cyclist in the story is initially quite confident when accepting the old men’s help. As he first sets out on his journey, he doesn't seem to suspect that anything is amiss. The directions given by the men appear to be well - organized; he's assured that his water supply is all in store, and the first landmark, now a desolate ghost town, is precisely where it's supposed to be. When he reaches the next so - called “town,” he finds that there's nothing available to replenish his dwindling water supply, and he starts to feel a sense of unease. However, since he was told that the next town isn't far, he decides to press on. Then, the scenery undergoes a drastic transformation. The previously flat roads start to turn into hilly terrains, and the sun beats down even hotter. It truly begins to look like a desert as tumbleweeds roll past! Despite being extremely dehydrated, the cyclist continues his arduous journey. The next thing he encounters is an old, dilapidated juice building that almost seems to mock his lack of water. Nevertheless, he perseveres and at last spots a shop where he can finally get water. The changing scenery gradually sends the cyclist from a state of confidence to worry, then to hopelessness, and lastly, to a feeling of relief.
27	6004	3	3	Well, I would put it like this: the weather has everything to do with our state of mind. Unfavorable weather conditions can make a person feel tired and upset. The constant discomfort from the weather can easily make one prone to anger. As the negative feelings accumulate, it can lead to a sense of unease and eventually build up into stress. In this way, weather can have a significant impact on our emotional and mental well - being.
28	6005	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in two ways: physical and mental. Physically, the most obvious factor is the terrain. If the roads are long and winding, it can wear the cyclist out as they have to constantly adjust their balance and pedal rhythm. Also, if the incline of a hill is too steep, it becomes a real challenge. When it’s just the cyclist against gravity, each pedal stroke can be exhausting, quickly sapping their energy. The temperature is another crucial factor in a cyclist's physical ability. Nobody wants to feel like they're in a sauna while bike - riding; the excessive heat can cause fatigue and reduce their endurance. Mentally, the cyclist can be deeply affected. If the terrain looks deserted, similar to a desert, the cyclist instinctively thinks of “dehydration” and “death.” Seeing dead animals or bones along the way can also trigger thoughts of their own mortality. And if they notice vultures circling overhead, it can fill them with fear and the thought of impending death. What's even worse is when all these negative elements are present in the same place at the same time. This is how the setting can have a profound impact on cyclists.
29	6006	3	3	The settings of the story were truly grueling. As the cyclist was riding along the desolate path, the sun began to beat down relentlessly on him. The intense heat caused the cyclist to start sweating profusely. In an attempt to cool down and quench his thirst, he ended up drinking just about all of his water. Now, the cyclist was facing a triple threat of major heat, excessive sweating, and dehydration. The California desert is an extremely harsh place to be, especially during the month of June when the sun is at its most intense. Fortunately, after struggling through the difficult conditions, the cyclist did come across a camp. There, he was able to find fresh food and water to replenish his depleted resources. After taking a short break to recover, he eventually continued his way to Yosemite National Park.
30	6007	3	3	As the cyclist is travelling to Yosemite National Park, he comes across many features in the area that significantly affect him. First, he approaches some old guys sitting on their porch for directions. These old men, who never leave their porch, have no knowledge of the recent changes in maps. At first, this interaction seems to have a positive effect on the cyclist because he believes he's found a good shortcut to Yosemite. He's excited about the prospect of reaching his destination more quickly. However, as he follows the directions, the situation takes a turn for the worse. It turns out that the so - called shortcut never actually existed, and he's led astray. Another significant feature that affects him is the desert - like setting. The intense heat in this area makes it much harder for him to ride his bike. The high temperature drains his energy rapidly, and he has to drink a large amount of his water to stay hydrated. This later results in him becoming severely dehydrated. On a positive note, after enduring a lot of hardship, he eventually finds a bait shop. There, he's able to rehydrate himself and also get some new, reliable directions to continue his journey to Yosemite National Park.
31	6008	3	3	The features of this setting affect the cyclist in many ways. The setting is a desert, and by common knowledge, you know that it is going to be extremely hot and bone - dry. Because it is hot, the cyclist needs a significantly larger amount of water as he is rapidly getting dehydrated. And when his water supply runs low, due to the dryness, his mouth becomes parched. Also, because he is in the desert, he sometimes encounters wild and dangerous animals. In the story, he sees a ridiculously large diamondback snake, which I believe are venomous. Due to the extreme heat of the desert, he realizes that he has a high chance of dropping from heatstroke. The writer said that the desert had short rolling hills and a rough road ahead, which would quickly wear the cyclist out. Because of this terrain, the cyclist's progress is greatly affected, making it a real struggle for him to continue.
32	6010	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many different ways. One clear example is the intense, hot sun that was relentlessly beating down on him, causing him to become extremely thirsty. The searing heat made his throat dry and his body crave water constantly. Another feature is the rough, bumpy road that wore the cyclist out and made him extremely tired. Every jolt on the uneven surface sapped his energy. My last example is the old, dilapidated juice factory with a vivid picture of a refreshing cup of juice on it. This sight made the cyclist feel like giving up because he thought he would surely die of dehydration. These are my reasons as to why the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many different ways, clearly showing how the environment can have a profound impact on the character's experience.
33	6011	3	3	In the essay, the author writes of the rough roads that the cyclist has had to overcome to reach the goal. These rough roads are full of potholes and uneven surfaces, making the cyclist's journey extremely difficult. Each pedal stroke on these rough terrains requires extra effort, testing the cyclist's endurance and determination. Despite the challenges, the cyclist perseveres, knowing that reaching the goal is worth all the hardship. This shows how the rough roads play a crucial role in the cyclist's pursuit of the goal.
34	6012	3	3	Understanding, realistic, and mood - all are reasons how setting affects the story. If a book has a well - crafted setting, then the book might be quite good. When you have a setting, it is much easier to understand what the author is trying to convey. A detailed setting provides context and background, making the story more relatable. And if you have a good setting, it makes the story more realistic. So when you read it, you won't be thrown off by inconsistencies. The mood of the story sets the overall tone. Usually, books have their ups and downs, and the setting helps to create and enhance this mood. That's why authors carefully choose and develop the setting to create the right mood for the story.
35	6013	3	3	The setting of the story affected the cyclist by making him severely dehydrated, which could potentially lead to a life - threatening heatstroke. “I could drop from a heatstroke,” this statement clearly shows that it was swelteringly hot out, and the cyclist was in a very bad physical state. The lack of water in the arid setting was taking a toll on his body. His skin was dry, his head was pounding, and his energy was rapidly depleting. If he didn't find water soon, the heatstroke could become a reality, putting an end to his journey. This demonstrates how the harsh setting had a direct and dangerous impact on the cyclist.
36	6014	3	3	"The terrain during the cyclist's journey greatly affects him. For example, the first terrain that he experienced was not very hilly, but rather flat and soothing, with a gentle breeze rustling the nearby grass. The author stated, “I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.” This clearly shows that he was energized and happy, enjoying the smooth ride. However, the reader can predict that the journey will not remain this joyful, because the cyclist is basically in the desert during the summer, in which it is extremely hot, the sun beating down relentlessly. Then, the cyclist experiences hilly terrain that sucked the life from his body, especially because he had no water left, his throat parched and dry. The cyclist said, “sometimes life can feel so cruel"", emphasizing that the cyclist's mood had changed from enthusiastic to tired and forlorn. This change of mood from the terrain can be connected to real life, as obstacles are included, in which the person must persevere and be strong to overcome, in which the cyclist finally did, emerging stronger from the experience."
37	6015	3	3	The features in the story have a great effect on the cyclist. One feature of the setting that affects the cyclist is the heat. At first, the story says that the tall pine trees cooled the cyclist, providing a refreshing shade as he pedaled. But eventually, the forest gradually turned into a vast desert, and the intense heat poured down on him like a furnace, making it extremely hard to cycle, his body quickly sweating out moisture. Another feature that affected the cyclist was the lack of water. As he moved away from his starting point, the cyclist was drinking lots of water to stay hydrated. But when he needed to refill, the water was brown and hot, with an unappealing smell, so the cyclist didn't take any. The lack of water plus the heat formed one giant obstacle that potentially could have killed him, but through great determination and willpower, the cyclist got through this troubling time, learning the importance of endurance.
38	6016	3	3	The narrator in this story goes through a tough journey consisting of hope, challenge, physical pain, despair, and relief. All of these are further developed by the settings where they take place. For example, after taking advice from old men at a campsite, he is on his way through the deserts of California, the sand shifting under his wheels. If he had been almost anywhere else, his journey could have been much better. He could have gotten more reliable advice from locals, or had been in a place where the towns were not miles and miles apart, making it easier to find supplies. Also, at one point he reaches a snake on the road. This could symbolize a decision, which was to go forward and how it will affect the outcome of his trip, or perhaps the decisions he had already made. To take advice from strangers and better yet he should use it. The irony continues as he becomes dehydrated and the flat land suddenly turns hilly, making each pedal stroke a struggle. If that weren't to happen he could have been more successful and healthy on his trip. The settings in this man's story are necessary for it to have a plot line and have the humor it possesses. If he were in the city, for example, he would not get lost and stranded, and therefore would have no story, highlighting the importance of the unique setting.
39	6017	3	3	The setting in the story changes many times. It starts in an area with clear rivers and tall pine trees, the sound of flowing water soothing. Then the cyclist arrives at a small town, with friendly faces and a simple charm. After that, he is pounded by the hot sun as he moves along a hilly road, the inclines testing his strength. With not much water left in his bottles, the cyclist uses all the energy he had to get to a town where he could get something to drink, his legs burning with exhaustion. The setting was what made the cyclist's journey a hard one, presenting various challenges that tested his limits and resilience.
40	6018	3	3	The features of the settings affect the protagonist in the story “Do Not Exceed posted speed Limit”. It is the early morning and everyone is still asleep. He wakes up in the morning looking for something to do. When he pulls up to the first place, he notices that the people there seem old and crazy, and the place looks run - down. The houses are falling apart, with broken windows and peeling paint, and he thinks that the place needs urgent fixing. Then he leaves and sees these wide bunch of hills stretching out as far as the eye can see. In conclusion, I would never do all the riding he did, as the journey seems filled with so many unappealing aspects and challenges.
41	6019	3	3	The setting greatly affects the cyclist as he finds himself alone in the vast desert with no water and no clear sense of direction. The old men sitting lazily on the porch gave him inaccurate directions, and now he is completely lost in the scorching desert. Despite the overwhelming odds, the cyclist manages to find the inner willpower to keep pedaling forward. Along his arduous journey, he encounters another old man who offers to guide him, but he proudly insists that he has a map to find his way. Eventually, with determination, he overcomes the challenges and continues towards his destination.
42	6020	3	3	The setting in the story had a profoundly discouraging impact on the biker. As he follows the advice of the elderly men and sets off on his journey, he realizes that there is, “no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” The desolate landscape intensifies his sense of isolation. He uses vivid tone words to describe the difficult situation when he says, “The water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips.” This scarcity of water adds to his distress. He exhaustedly describes how hard his journey is getting, emphasizing the intense heat in the desert of California as he pedals up, “one long, crippling hill.” The uneven terrain did not make his ride easy at all. The combination of the harsh weather, rolling hills, and the shortage of water takes a heavy toll on him. If he were on flat terrain on a cool day, he would have been just fine. In such a setting, these factors severely hampered his progress.
43	6021	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist a great deal. The blazing hot sun beats down relentlessly on him, causing him to sweat profusely and making him extremely thirsty. The rough, bumpy roads and the numerous hills force him to work much harder to keep moving forward. The desolate and abandoned places he passes through make him gradually lose hope. If I were faced with these same obstacles, I would have been affected in the very same way. As I firmly believe that any human being would react similarly when confronted with such challenging conditions. In conclusion, the setting's features have a significant and inevitable impact on the cyclist.
44	6022	3	3	The features of the setting, or nature, have a notable impact on the cyclist as they are wearing her out. The cyclist is on her way to the city of Yosemite, but some guys suggested a shortcut to her. Through this shortcut, she has to face steep hills, intense heat, and a lack of water. @CAPS1 describes this difficult situation by saying, “I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn't a mirage, and tried not to get too excited.” @CAPS1 is excited at the sight of a building, hoping to get some much - needed water from there. Also, the act of wiping the sweat from her eyes clearly indicates that it is extremely hot outside and she is sweating profusely, losing precious water in the process. Therefore, the features of the setting, with their harsh elements, significantly affect the cyclist's journey.
45	6023	3	3	The three most important features of the setting that affect the cyclist are the ground he is traveling on, the towns he passes through, and the availability of water. The ground the cyclist is riding over is crucial because the rougher the terrain and the more hills there are, the more energy he must expend, and the less distance he can cover. @PERSON1 is riding smoothly until he has to tackle the rolling hills which consume his energy, exhaust his water supply, and cause his hope to dwindle. As he approaches towns, his hope briefly increases, but it soon fades when he realizes that the town will be unable to offer him any relief. When he pumps out water that tastes like “battery acid,” his hope once again diminishes. However, as he spots the bait and tackle shop in the distance, he gains a new sense of determination knowing that he can make it there and recover. These three features are what have the most significant impact on the cyclist's journey, shaping his experience and challenges along the way.
46	6024	3	3	In the story of “Rough road ahead : do not exceed posted limit”, the arid and desolate setting in the middle of the desert during the sweltering summer severely affected the cyclist. As he pedaled on, he found himself low on water, a crucial resource in such a harsh environment. The old men, perhaps out of ignorance or some other motive, gave him the wrong directions. It seemed that mainly, those old guys thought he'd die out there. Miraculously, the cyclist survives. However, due to the intense heat and the season he was riding in, he'll probably bring another water bottle next time to better prepare for such a challenging journey.
47	6025	3	3	Some of the features of the setting, like the poor - quality road, had a significant impact on the cyclist. The road was in a terrible state, with bumps all over it. These bumps made the cycling much harder as the bike jolted with every movement, and it also took up a lot of the cyclist's physical strength. Also, the temperature in the neighborhood reached around two hundred degrees. After that, the cyclist came across a road with a whole bunch of hills. Climbing these hills in such high - temperature conditions further exhausted the cyclist, making the journey extremely arduous.
48	6026	3	3	In the story, many different settings affected the author in numerous ways. At the very start of his journey, he stumbled upon a ghost town. The desolate and empty streets of the ghost town were a unique setting. He reacted to the features of this setting with a mix of humor and hope. “I chuckled, checked my water supply, and moved on.” This shows that despite the eerie atmosphere, he still had hope that he would end up safe and in the right place. The next setting was an abandoned shed with a water pump and a fork in the road. As he stood there, looking around, he grew worried when he realized that no near town was still in sight. “This sight was troubling.” When the features of the next setting caught his eye, he was in a state of desperation and devastation. “At some point, tumbleweed crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake.” He was on rough terrain in the middle of the desert with little water. When he reached the abandoned @CAPS1’s factory, all his hope was lost, and he started planning his death. “I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.” But then, when he finally reached the fish camp, he was incredibly relieved. “I had an overwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber, kiss them and buy some bait.” He was overjoyed and overwhelmed because he had survived the harsh journey through various challenging settings.
49	6027	3	3	Ghost towns are not exactly the most inviting place for a cyclist running low on water supply. In “Rough road ahead: do not exceed speed limit”, the cyclist is affected in many ways by his surrounding settings. Starting off on a warm day with the sun shining brightly seemed like a good thing at first. His mood was still fresh, and happy expressions played on his face as he began his journey. But as he moved on, he started to feel the heat. He speaks of how “The sun was beginning to beat down”, expressing his regret for listening to the old men who led him on their “shortcut”. Along the road, he comes to his first disappointment, a ghost town with “one ramshackle shop, several rusty pumps and a corral that couldn't hold the lamest male”. With great effort, he tries to pump the water from the corral but gets a “battery - acid” flavor. As a result, he is forced to continue onward with very little left to drink. This affects his mood, making him pity himself and feel angry at the men who put him into this predicament. By the end, he is relieved though when he comes to GARY & @CAPS2 FISH CAMP, a place with a working sink full of cold water. He says he “had an overwhelming urge to seek out @ORGANIZATION1, kiss them and buy some bait”. His thankfulness is clearly expressed to these men he doesn't even know because they were the light at the end of his long, dark and very exhausting tunnel.
50	6028	3	3	The features of the setting have a profound impact on the cyclist. It was extremely hard for the author to arrive at the first town. For example, in “Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”, the road that the author was riding on was rough. The uneven surface made each pedal stroke a struggle. Another example is “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” The entire stretch of the road was filled with hills and was in a rough condition. Moreover, “The water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips.” This means that the author didn't have that much water left. With the rough road and scarce water, the journey became really hard, testing the cyclist's endurance and willpower.
51	6029	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist a great deal. One factor that impacts the cyclist is definitely the heat. The scorching heat is relentless, causing him to constantly lose fluids through sweating. As a result, he's probably suffering from a severe lack of water. He looks really hot, being all alone, cut off in the middle of nowhere that seems to stretch for miles. Another feature of the setting that likely affects the cyclist is the uncertainty of whether there'll be a car around the next turn. If he can't see around the bend, he has no idea what's coming. The cyclist could also be anxiously thinking about when the next town will finally show up, which would offer him much - needed relief and resources.
52	6030	3	3	The setting puts a great deal of stress on the cyclist. The biggest issue he faces is the weather. He is a cyclist “traveling through the high deserts of @LOCATION1 in June.” The June heat in these high deserts is intense. He had been riding his bike all day under the blazing sun, and he was soon going to run out of water. Just when he thought he could drink more water, he drank “water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.” The water was so hot it hardly provided any relief. The weather being so hot and humid, with the thick, stifling air, did not help the cyclist throughout his journey. Another factor of the setting that affected the cyclist was the terrain. “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills,” which was a main problem the cyclist faced. These changes in terrain played into the fact that the weather did not cooperate. The hills made the cyclist work harder, pedaling with more force, therefore using more energy. Luckily the terrain had a positive affect on the cyclist as well. The stones he found on the ground, with their interesting shapes and textures, helped keep his mind off the thirst. There were many factors of the setting that negatively and positively affected the cyclist throughout his adventure. In the end, these elements combined to create a unique and challenging experience for the cyclist.
53	6031	3	3	The narration of “Rough Road ahead” follows a solo cyclist who encounters several challenges throughout the story. The changes in his environment directly affect the completion of his journey and his health. As the narrator makes his way to Yosemite National Park from the north, his first encounter with his environment acknowledges his desperate and urgent need for water. The text states “I had been guzzling my water pretty regularly... the high deserts of California in June.” To his disappointment, the truck stop’s water supply from the pumps was not adequate for his consumption. The water was either scarce or of poor quality, only forcing him to look elsewhere to quench his thirst. Next, he experienced rolling hills. By exerting more energy to climb these hills, he made his way forward, yet still in need of water. His speed lost its quickness as thoughts of his crippling dehydration distracted him. He then came across his challenges as he made his way to a bait shop, with the searing heat beating down on him unmercifully. The change in his environment challenged his health and created an obstruction that nearly deterred him from his goal. In the end, his ability to persevere in the face of these environmental challenges was truly remarkable.
54	6032	3	3	The setting affected the cyclist a lot. One way was the heat. The sun beats down mercilessly, and it got so hot that he was becoming severely dehydrated. He kept drinking his water at regular intervals, trying to stay hydrated, until he didn't have any left. His throat was parched, and his body was struggling to cope with the heat. Another reason is because the road turned into hills. The sudden change from flat terrain to hilly ground made him use more energy. He had to pedal harder with each uphill stretch, his muscles straining. Finally, it didn't help that he hadn't seen any sign of living creatures except for a snake. The desolate landscape added to his sense of isolation and unease. All these aspects clearly show how the setting affected the cyclist in multiple and challenging ways.
55	6033	3	3	The features of the setting in “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” affect the main character, the cyclist, significantly. The cyclist is biking “through the high desert of California in June.” So naturally, it can be inferred that it is extremely hot and dry, making water a precious delicacy. As the cyclist is passing through a ghost town, the eerie silence and desolation add to his unease. And when he approaches a pump that releases “a tarlike substance followed by brackish water,” he realizes he is running out of his precious water. The surrounding landscape of lonely hills, tumbleweeds that roll aimlessly, and snakes slithering in the heat does not inspire confidence. In fact, the cyclist feels that “I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous - looking but sweltering day in June.” He finds an old Grape Juice Factory that's no longer in service. The abandoned building with its dilapidated structures causes more anxiousness and despair. I have had an experience similar to this where I was out walking in a state park in the @DATE1. The cold was biting, and a desolate landscape of snow - covered trees made me feel as if I'd never be warm again, similar to the cyclist whose environment made him feel he'd die of dehydration. So, as can be seen, the setting of this short story has a profound and detrimental effect on the cyclist, making his journey a battle against the harsh elements.
56	6034	3	3	The settings that affected the cyclist were in fact ones you don’t want to be near when you are out of water and exhausted from pedaling. The time and place affected him greatly because there wasn’t a cool breeze in the air during the scorching June in California. He was right in the middle of vast, flat deserts and had no sense of where the path was and where civilization was so he could get some water. The quote “old timers who haven’t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office” helped you realize taking advice on direction from old people who don’t go anywhere is a bad idea. “Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills”. This quote shows you some terrain features that affected the cyclist. Furthermore, the cyclist thankfully found civilization with running water, which was a great relief after his arduous journey.
57	6035	3	3	In the story “Do not exceed posted speed limit”, the author Joe Kurmaskie tells you that there are many things you have to go through before you reach your destination. An example is when he stops and asks for directions to Yosemite state park because he didn't want to get lost. He then had to pass through other towns. Another example is when he came to a large rock in the road and had to get water from an old, rusted pump because he had hardly any water left in his water bottle. These experiences show that reaching the destination is not always a straightforward journey.
58	6036	3	3	I think the features of the setting that affected the cyclist were the terrain. “Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills” this shows that he was worn - out and troubled by the change of the terrain. He also feels alone. “I toiled on; at some point, tumbleweed crossed my path”. He also thought he was in a ghost town. “Summer time” rattled around in the dry honeycombs of my deteriorating brain. He felt that he was slowly dying. He also thought he was losing his mind. The sun had a great impact on him because he wiped his face to make sure he was not seeing a mirage. But through it all, he had hopes. The author also wants us to have hope and keep on going even though things don't look good. Keep moving forward, never look back, and always be positive and take advantage of your surroundings. This is the important message the author tries to give.
59	6037	3	3	Heat, dryness, and flatness - all are features of the setting that affected the cyclist. As the cyclist was driving through the vast desert, he noticed how extremely hot it was, and how quickly he would become dehydrated. It was also very dry, and he started to get increasingly nervous about how thirsty he was. The flat ground shows that there is nothing around that can help the cyclist, which made him scared. The story also mentions that he is in a ghost town, adding to his sense of isolation and danger. In such a setting, the cyclist's journey becomes a real test of survival.
60	6038	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in the way that the author started talking and how he sounded at the beginning of the story. When they both look at the picture, he looks like he is in a daze and then makes some choices. As the story continues to be read, it doesn't sound like he is enjoying his ride. Because of the noise on the bumpy roads, the sparks, and the lack of any counter - thirst measures, he is in a tough situation. He is wasting time and energy. Getting advice from old - timers might not be a good idea because they may not know the area well, especially when you are traveling around. You could end up in a difficult situation like this. In California, it's hard to know how far things are and how to deal with the harsh conditions. One could end up being dehydrated if not careful. So, being cautious and resourceful is crucial in such a setting.
61	6039	3	3	In the story “Do not exceed posted speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, there were numerous factors that affected the cyclist. One significant aspect was the water situation. He had no truly good water to drink due to his location. As he described, “When I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid.” The presence of what seemed like “battery acid” in the water meant he couldn't drink it, as it could have made him extremely ill. Additionally, the unstable roads he had to bike on made the journey difficult. A sign read “Rough roads ahead.” Riding on such unstable ground is indeed very challenging. Clearly, these two elements, the unpalatable water and the rough roads, showed that the features of the setting definitely had an impact on the cyclist.
62	6040	3	3	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead Do Not exceed posted speed”, many of the features of the setting affect the cyclist. At the start of the journey, the cyclist passes by a river, which he won't encounter later on. As he progresses, the heat intensifies, and the lack of water becomes a real problem. He then comes across a water fountain. When he tries the water, it's hot and has a strange flavor, likely because the fountain has long since been shut down. The heat, the disappearing river, and the undrinkable water from the fountain all demonstrate how the cyclist is affected by many features of the setting.
63	6041	3	3	The feature of the setting affects the cyclist because the roads are extremely rough. If he goes too fast, he could spin out of control and end up out of commission. Moreover, the water was a major trouble. As he said, “When I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid.” This indicates that the poor - quality water and the rough roads combined to create a difficult situation for the cyclist, clearly showing the impact of the setting on his journey.
64	6042	3	3	The cyclist is mostly affected by his lack of water. In the beginning of his ride, the cyclist is full of confidence and is eager to reach the joys of @LOCATION1. He yearns for “the cool pines and rushing rivers…” (@NUM1), imagining the refreshing environment that awaits him. However, later on when the cyclist reaches the rough terrain, he starts to feel the exhaustion setting in as he gradually depletes his water supply. After a long and arduous climb over a hill, a bit of relief comes upon him. But then, his hopes are dashed when he sees a shut - down juice factory, almost as if it was placed there just to tease him. Finally, when he reaches his destination, it fills him with a deep sense of relief and pride, knowing that he has managed to survive the strenuous journey despite the lack of water being a major obstacle.
65	6043	3	3	The setting affected the cyclist in a great way. The snakes slithering across the paths blocked his way, forcing him to stop or change his route frequently. His short water supply was another major issue, making it extremely hard for him to continue. The scorching heat made him feel as if he could drop from a heatstroke at any moment. Moreover, the information from the old man, perhaps warnings about the difficult terrain or scarce resources ahead, added to his mental burden. All these elements of his environment combined to make his ride very hard to continue. In conclusion, it's evident that his settings had a substantial and far - reaching effect on him.
66	6044	3	3	The setting affected the cyclist because of the road conditions. The road was all messed up, with potholes and uneven surfaces that made it extremely challenging for the cyclist to maintain balance and speed. This difficult road situation significantly hampered the cyclist's progress and overall experience.
67	6045	3	3	The cyclist was well prepared for his adventure; he had checked his bike thoroughly and packed essential items. However, it was hot enough for a change in scenery. When the old men told him to take a difficult path, his entire setting changed for the worst. After this, he was nearly overpowered by the devastating hills, which seemed to stretch on endlessly. Dehydration was slowly creeping up on him as well. He had not nearly packed enough water or supplies for a change such as that, and he would regret it later. The hills were steep and endless, and the sun was hot and merciless, making the situation even worse on him. This is how the change of setting affected the cyclist, leaving him in a tough and challenging situation.
68	6046	3	3	Setting can affect anyone and everyone, in this case, it happened to be a cyclist. Since it was June, it happened to be pretty hot outside, causing the cyclist to lose more body fluid due to his constant movement producing sweat. This makes water an absolute must - have for him to stay hydrated. Also, as he passes through, he comes across a sign that read: ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT. Since the road was full of bumps and uneven patches, riding a bike across it isn't much easier. Another way the setting affected the cyclist was the snake that blocked the road, which he thought of to be a diamondback, causing him to stop abruptly and feel a surge of fear. All these factors clearly show how the setting had a significant impact on the cyclist's journey.
69	6047	3	3	The features of setting really affect the cyclist because of the condition. For example, the weather; when it is hot, the heat will slow the person down as they have to exert more energy and deal with the discomfort. Their body gets tired more quickly, and they may even start to feel dizzy. And if it's perfect, like a mild and breezy day, that will let the person go at a regular speed, enjoying the ride without any hindrance. And the roads, if the road is bumpy with lots of potholes and rough patches, that will slow them down as they have to be cautious and navigate carefully. And if it's smooth, like freshly paved asphalt, that will speed them up as they can pedal with ease. See, it really does depend on the condition of the setting, which can either facilitate or impede the cyclist's progress.
70	6048	3	3	The setting affects the author a lot. First, he is in a California desert in the middle of June. It is extremely hot out, with the sun beating down relentlessly. This makes the cyclist very tired, as his body is constantly working hard to regulate its temperature. There are some cool pines, but they don't help much as the heat is still overwhelming. There is also nowhere to get water for a very long distance. The narration states, “I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). With no water, the cyclist was severely dehydrated. This hurt his biking skills like balance and leg strength, making it difficult for him to pedal smoothly. Finally, there was no one around for most of the story. The cyclist did not know how far he had to go until he reached @CAPS1 or water. There was also no one to help him if he were to have a heat stroke, leaving him in a vulnerable and precarious situation.
71	6049	3	3	In the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the distinct features of the setting significantly affected the cyclist. For example, the cyclist pedaled for miles on a bike, constantly grappling with the harsh weather conditions in the deserts. The arid environment meant there was only a little bit of water available, and the long - distance cycling left the cyclist extremely tired. The cyclist faced numerous hard times while attempting to travel on a bicycle from one point to another, making the journey a real challenge.
72	6050	3	3	The setting of this story greatly affects the cyclist’s attitude and adversities. The path of the cyclist is through the California deserts, which are characteristically dry and blisteringly hot. This first presents the major conflict of the story, the very real danger of the cyclist getting heatstroke. In the reading, the author says, “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly.” If the setting was in a cooler climate, the author would most likely not have drunk as often, and would not have faced the risk of dehydration. The trip would not have been as perilous for the cyclist if the climate was different. Another element of the setting that affected the cyclist was the terrain. In the reading it says, “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” The rough road not only would take a toll on the author's body, with every pedal stroke becoming a struggle, but also his mind. While riding, the author thinks, “I was doing a water - depleting 12 mph.” This shows how his attitude is getting less and less optimistic as well as keeping his mind constantly on his thirst. Thinking of his thirst would only get him more thirsty. The small change in terrain had a large impact on the author's journey. Perhaps the most influential element of the setting is the isolation. Only until the end of the story does the cyclist run into another human. Up until that point, he was all alone, having to deal with his thirst and fatigue on his own. If the setting had been in a more urbanized area, the cyclist could have easily gotten help from other people, which would have made his ordeal very easy. Also, the fact that nobody was going to help him played a large role in the mental state of the author. In conclusion, the conflict of this story was set up by the setting. If the setting were not hot, rough, and isolated, the cyclist would have had an easy journey, and the story would not have been as exciting or interesting. A different setting in my opinion would have truly ruined the story.
73	6051	3	3	The features in the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. When the cyclist was going through the desert, it was extremely dry, old, and dirty. “... I came to a fork of sorts. One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn't hold in the largest mule greeted me. This side was troubling.” When she wanted to use the rusty water pump, a far - like substance oozed out and the water seemed to be @NUM1 degrees. “Not two miles into this next section of ride, I notice the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” This made it more difficult for the cyclist to ride the bike smoothly. The constant up - and - down motion on the hills would make the cyclist more tired. As the cyclist moved on, he was getting more and more tired and his water supply was going down rapidly. It was a real struggle to keep his balance while he kept riding, adding to the overall difficulty of the journey.
74	6052	3	3	How the setting of the place affects the cyclist is, for one, it is too dry. A cyclist riding for hours should not be in a place that’s so dry. Like in the story it says “I was travelling through the high parts of California in June,” meaning it was really hot and parched. The scorching heat and lack of moisture made the cyclist prone to heat - related illnesses. Second would be the presence of dangerous animals. A cyclist should not be riding in a place with diamond - back snakes. It says in the text “I toiled on. At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path; it really did look like a diamond back.” which, if it really was one, would be extremely dangerous. A cyclist should not be riding in that type of dangerous places, no matter what kind of dangerous animals are there. That is how the settings of the surroundings affect the cyclist and why it’s a bad place for them to ride.
75	6053	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist as the ground would frequently change terrain, making it very difficult to ride at the same speed throughout the journey. With sudden inclines, declines, and uneven patches, the cyclist had to constantly adjust their effort. Also, the lack of water in the area made it hard for the cyclist to focus. The parched throat and constant worry about water supply distracted the cyclist from the ride. I think the features of the setting affect the cyclist because people often think the challenges presented by the setting are worse than they actually are. However, in this case, the changing terrain and water shortage were indeed significant obstacles for the cyclist.
76	6054	3	3	The setting affects the cyclist in many ways. The sweltering setting affects the cyclist because the weather is extremely hot and humid, a condition that makes him sweat profusely. This sweating is using up energy as his body is desperately trying to stay cool. Also, the setting affects the cyclist because there is no available water. So, on top of sweating and being out of energy, he has no water to refuel his body, which makes it extremely hard for him to keep pedaling forward. In such a situation, the cyclist's ability to continue his journey is severely hampered, and the setting's influence becomes a significant obstacle to his progress.
77	6055	3	3	In this story the cyclist is going through a vast desert of California. This arid environment is a key reason why he is very limited on water supply. It is really hot under the clear desert sky, which would cause him to drink a lot more water to stay hydrated. He had smartly started his journey in the morning so that the sun wasn't as hot as it would be in the middle of the day. Then, as time passed, it started to get a lot sunnier. So with the increasing sunlight comes more intense heat. The rider says “The sun was beginning to beat down.” This simple statement would help the readers vividly realize what time of day it was and how hot it was. This was still in the morning so he didn't fully realize it, but as it got into the afternoon, the heat took its toll, and he realized it and started to get dehydrated, putting his journey at risk.
78	6056	3	3	The wonderful features and settings had a dramatic affect on the author. However, the affect was bad rather than good. First, there was the almost unbearable heat that hung in the air like a thick blanket. The author had a limited amount of water and used a lot of it because of the smoldering temperatures that made every breath a struggle. Another feature that had a great impediment on the author’s well - being would be the lack of water in the pumps he stumbled across at the snack area. Lastly would be the tar - like substance that came out of the pump when the author tried to get water. There was also brackish water in there that tasted suspiciously like battery acid, making it undrinkable. All these factors combined made the author's experience in this setting a truly unpleasant one.
79	6057	3	3	"The cyclist is traveling through a rough part of California during the hot month of June. The unforgiving sun beats down on him. The author describes part of his journey; ""I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June."" The intense heat of the sun and the scarcity of water around is causing the cyclist to worry about his health. A little further into his journey, he realizes how bad his situation could get if he doesn't find water soon. The author writes, ""the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke."" As the cyclist has run out of water and there is no sign of life around, he begins to feel that he may never make it through the desert to Yosemite National Park. The author describes this bleak thought as ""I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean."" The harsh setting of the cyclist's journey greatly affected how he perceived his journey, turning it from an adventure into a fight for survival."
80	6058	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because of where he is. The biker is in a campground in California. By saying that one could easily sense it is a dusty place, with the ground crunching under the bike's wheels. Also, when the story says that the “town” had been abandoned. This also tells us that the place the cyclist is in is a deserted place without many people or places to stop and rest. The story also talks about a snake in the road. A snake in the road tells one that the town is deserted. I could tell that this “town” is deserted because around here, people do not go to towns that don't have buildings. If a snake was in the road, then the town must be empty because around here streets are busy and there are no snakes in the road. The desolate setting clearly poses challenges and a sense of isolation for the cyclist.
81	6059	3	3	The setting greatly affects the cyclist because he is the one laboriously riding over the “short rolling hills,” which require continuous pedaling and energy, and around a “ridiculously large snake,” a startling obstacle that can disrupt his concentration. Moreover, since it's extremely hot under the blazing sun, he could suffer from heatstroke at any minute. The sweltering heat saps his energy and dehydrates him rapidly. So yes, the author, who is the cyclist in this context, is clearly affected by the setting as it poses both physical and mental challenges during the ride.
82	6060	3	3	The affects of the features around the bikers are quite significant. The hot bikes, heated up by the scorching sun, make the bikers feel uncomfortable and they desperately need water to stay hydrated. Also, the roads are so hilly that they can't just ride straight. They have to navigate over the steep hills, which demands a great deal of physical effort. This affects them because cycles are very hard to land from a jump on such uneven terrain. The constant up - and - down movement on the hilly roads not only tires them out but also makes the ride more dangerous. In conclusion, these features of the surroundings have a notable impact on the bikers' experience.
83	6061	3	3	"The features of the setting in Yosemite give the cyclist something to look forward to, as the beautiful scenery of the cool pines and rushing hills sounds incredibly enticing. However, the harsh conditions of the journey he is in to reach there cause him despair. As soon as the cyclist passes a ghost town and notices the sweltering heat of the sun during the early endeavors of the trip, he checks himself up as he says, ""I barely noticed it [the sun], the cool pines and rushing hills of Yosemite had my name written all over them."" Although the cyclist began to feel the toll that the long trip and the intense sun were going to take on him, he tried to erase the morning's fatigue with the hope and beauty of arriving at Yosemite. The more the cyclist noticed the relentless sun, the more he drank until his water supply seemed low. Like an old rusty water pump, he had hope of being replenished, but the taste of bitter battery acid in the water caused the cyclist to stop drinking. The rolling hills, the blazing sun, and the tumbleweeds did nothing to quench the cyclist's thirst or at least divert his attention. If the cyclist was to see a sign that said Yosemite @NUM1 miles away, his spirits would have risen. Instead, he saw a sign that said, “Rough Road Ahead” which did nothing to help him. If the terrain was more level, easier to travel on, and in plenty supply of water, the tone of this passage would be more hopeful instead of such despair. Clearly, the features of the setting caused the cyclist grief instead of hope."
84	6062	3	3	The bike rider in the short story “Do not exceed posted speed limit” by @PERSON1, is greatly affected by the condition of the land around him. He is riding through the extremely dry desert, where the scorching sun beats down relentlessly. As he pedals on, he is running low on water. The arid environment sucks the moisture out of his body quickly. However, since it is such a dry place, with no visible lakes, rivers, or water sources in sight, he can't find any water. Also, since it is out in the middle of nowhere, far from any human settlements, there is no one he can ask for some. If this story was set somewhere else, like a lush forest or a coastal area, he wouldn't have either of these problems. In conclusion, the desert setting has a detrimental impact on the bike rider's journey.
85	6063	3	3	"In ""Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit,"" the features of the setting affect the cyclist significantly. Many visual features create a very deserted area that feels hot in your head, as if the heat is overwhelming your senses. For example, in paragraph five, they use a lot of well - chosen adjectives to describe how abandoned the place was. Words like ramshackle, which gives an image of falling - apart buildings, and rusty, showing the neglect and decay, paint a vivid picture of desolation. Also, the frequent mention of the lack of water made us think of how hot this California desert must have been. The intense heat not only dehydrated the cyclist but also played tricks on his mind. It made the cyclist believe he was seeing a miracle when he saw the Welch’s fruit juice factory, a rare sight in the vast desert. The choice of visual words in this story, such as those depicting the desolate landscape and the heat, are specifically used to describe what affected the cyclist. These words effectively convey how the setting influenced his physical and mental state during the journey."
86	6064	3	3	In the passage, the cyclist had about @NUM1 different settings. One of these settings was the rough terrains he had to pass through. On these rough terrains, he faced a shortage of water, struggling to find enough to quench his thirst. Another setting the cyclist had to go through was the hill - like terrains. As he pedaled up those steep hills, he found himself laughing at himself for taking the old men's advice in the first place. Both of these features took a great toll on the cyclist's body strength and his spirit. But with confidence, determination, and the anticipation of the relief of success, he was able to overcome the obstacles and continue on his journey.
87	6065	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example, the weather in California in June was extremely hot. The sun beat down relentlessly, and the water the cyclist found in the pipes was hot, as well. The text says, “Somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.” This affected him severely because he had no cool water to drink from, which made him more prone to dehydration. Another example is when he had to overcome tumbleweeds and snakes. The text states, “tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake.” These were unexpected obstacles that he had to overcome, adding to the difficulty of his journey. Another example is he was deserted. The text says, “no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” This isolation made the cyclist feel vulnerable and alone, but he persevered through all these challenges.
88	6066	3	3	The setting in the features of the cyclist is that if it is too hot or too cold, it could significantly affect how the cyclist is riding. If it's too hot, the cyclist would get exhausted a lot faster. The sweltering heat would make the cyclist sweat profusely, draining his energy quickly. And if it's too cold, then the cyclist would, in @MONTH1, be more likely to get sick. The cold air could seep into his body, weakening his immune system. Also, if it's too windy then he would go a lot slower if he is going in the wind's direction. The strong wind would act as a resistance, making it harder for the cyclist to pedal forward. Thus, the weather conditions play a crucial role in the cyclist's performance.
89	6067	3	3	The features that affected the cyclist were plenty of things. One thing would be lack of water. In the text, he said the pump gave water that tasted like battery acid. This unpalatable water was hardly suitable for drinking, leaving the cyclist parched. Another one would be all the surroundings changed from what the old men said and he got lost. When he realized he was lost, the unfamiliar environment made him feel anxious. When he was lost, he had to have determination to find someone so that he could survive. With his strong - willed determination, he searched for help and hoped to get back on track.
90	6068	3	3	The setting and its features affect the cyclist greatly. He is in the desert and all the towns are abandoned. The desolate desert stretched out as far as the eye could see, with empty, dilapidated buildings standing as silent witnesses. Also, he now hits a sign that says “Rough Road Ahead…(kurmaskie, pg @NUM1).” This makes his trip even worse because now he has to make it over not only big hills but torn - up, old, beaten roads. These rough roads made his cycling extremely bumpy and difficult. And he has the sun beating down mercilessly and is almost out of water. Despite these harsh conditions, the cyclist keeps going, showing his resilience in the face of adversity.
91	6069	3	3	The features of the setting significantly affect the cyclist. When he has to go down the winding hills, these hills present obstacles that he must overcome. He has to slow down carefully so that he can maneuver through the twists and turns of the hills and avoid losing control of the bike. The intense heat he is facing takes a toll on him, causing tiredness and dehydration. If he is exposed to the sun and heat for a long time, he can get a sunburn or even suffer a heat stroke. A heat stroke can be extremely dangerous and fatal to anyone, especially those with heart problems. Dehydration also poses a serious threat and can be fatal. Moreover, if the cyclist does not see any buildings, he will have no clear reference points to tell where he is, and he might easily get lost. Getting lost will further exacerbate the situation, leading to more dehydration, increased tiredness, and a higher risk of heat stroke. In conclusion, the various elements of the setting have a profound and negative impact on the cyclist's journey.
92	6070	3	3	The setting and features have a notable impact on the cyclist. With each building he spots, he holds out hope of finding water. However, since he is traveling through a desert, water is in extremely limited supply. Many empty buildings are scattered across the desolate wasteland. These buildings initially create a sense of relief in the cyclist, only to be quickly followed by despair when he finds them abandoned. The featureless land also instills a feeling of lost hope in the rider, making his entire ordeal even more arduous. Physically, he has to endure the harsh environment, and mentally, he battles the disappointment and hopelessness. Overall, it was an excruciating experience both physically and mentally for the cyclists, highlighting the powerful influence of the setting on his journey.
93	6071	3	3	In 'Rough @CAPS1 Ahead', the features of the setting and the cyclist's surroundings have a great influence on him. Because he is in “the high deserts of California in June”, the climate is extremely hot, dry, and utterly miserable. The searing heat beats down on him constantly, making each pedal stroke a struggle. Another significant feature of the setting that affects the cyclist is that he is out in the middle of nowhere. There are no other human beings, cars, or buildings for miles around. The vast emptiness makes him feel isolated and vulnerable. Also, the terrain has a major impact on the biker. When the road starts to get bumpy and uneven, it requires more effort from him to keep the bike moving forward. This increased exertion causes him to exhaust his water supply even faster. In conclusion, the cyclist in this story is indeed greatly affected by his surroundings, which present numerous challenges to his journey.
94	6072	3	3	In the short story, the cyclist was affected by the setting in many ways. Throughout the whole story, the author was running out of water. As described, “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.” There was a very limited amount of water in the bottles, and he knew he had to ration it carefully. He had to travel a long distance, as mentioned “Not two miles into the next section.” This long - distance journey was taking a toll on him, and he was getting tired quickly. Also, the terrain was not favorable. “I noticed the terrain changing, flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” These hills made it harder and harder for him to continue his ride. With each hill, he had to use more energy, and his dwindling water supply made the situation even more difficult. In conclusion, the setting, with its water shortage and challenging terrain, severely hampered the cyclist's progress.
95	6073	3	3	The cyclist was so fixated on seeing cool, piney trees and lakes that when he was confronted with dirt, snakes, and no sign of civilization, it worried him deeply. More significantly, what he didn't see scared him the most. He expected to see windy rivers or trails hidden beneath all kinds of trees, but there were none. He also didn't see any people or friendly little forest critters. Instead, all he could see was the same rusty - colored dirt stretching as far as the eye could see and the occasional snake slithering across his path. His mood was severely affected, and he started to lose confidence and hope. He wasn't accustomed to these new and desolate surroundings, and for a while, he even doubted if he could make it out alive. When he came across the run - down building of Welch's factory, it was in a dilapidated state, and it only made him even more distraught. Fortunately, his luck changed when he came to a fishing supply shop. This definitely boosted his spirits. Once he had quenched his thirst and assured himself that he was alive and would likely stay that way, he sat down to rest for a while before mustering the courage to wade out again in search of his destination. In conclusion, the stark contrast between his expectations and the actual setting had a profound emotional impact on the cyclist, but the discovery of civilization gave him the renewed strength to continue.
96	6074	3	3	The features in the setting are extremely unfavorable for the cyclist. He's in California in June, where the sweltering heat is almost unbearable. It's essentially a desolate desert with vast stretches of arid land. When he stops for water, the pump he manages to find is old and rusty. There's hardly any water left in it, just a few meager drops. Moreover, the few drops that he does get have a foul taste, exactly like battery acid. This harsh situation is clearly not good for the cyclist who needs proper hydration to continue his journey.
97	6075	3	3	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the author effectively changes the mood by not only vividly telling us how the cyclist feels but also by meticulously describing his environment. As he's leaving the “resevoir compground,” he's in high spirits because he's just departing from “the serenity of an early - summer evening” and is eagerly headed toward “The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite.” He's surrounded by a beautiful natural setting, and this positive atmosphere affects the cyclist as he anticipates another equally enchanting place. However, when he moves to the “ghost town” and the “sun was beginning to beat down” relentlessly, he becomes less confident and starts to have more doubts about the men's advice. Still, he retains a bit of optimism and finds it amusing that it was once “a thriving little spot.” Next, when the cyclist comes to “one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps and a coral,” he immediately realizes that things are in a dire state, and he desperately needs water. Unfortunately, all they have is a “tarlike substance,” so he has no choice but to move on. When he encounters “the rough road, tumbleweeds and a ridiculously large snake,” it makes the cyclist aware that things have reached their worst. He's faced with a tough decision: either give up or keep pushing through. I doubt it could get any worse, and the cyclist shares the same sentiment. Finally, at the end, the cyclist enters a rather modern bathroom, and as he steps into this civilized space, he feels relaxed, relieved, and much better as if he's escaped from a nightmare.
98	6076	3	3	There are three prominent features of the setting that significantly affect the cyclist on his journey. Firstly, there is a severe lack of water. He's in the middle of nowhere, a vast expanse with no signs of civilization. There's no one around to offer any help. Due to this lack of water, this feature has a profound impact on the cyclist. He needs water to keep his body functioning and to be able to move forward and complete his journey. Water is the most essential thing he should have. Without it, he could end up getting severely dehydrated, and this might even cause him to collapse and die right in the middle of the desolate street. Therefore, water is one crucial feature that affects the cyclist. Furthermore, he's in the middle of nowhere. There are no buildings in sight, not even a single gas station. If he had money, he could stop at a gas station and buy about two or three bottles of water and maybe even a few snacks to boost his energy. That is another feature that will have a negative impact on him. Lastly, nobody is around in town to help him out. Let's say that he gets lost and he needs directions to get to his destination. Well, there's nobody around to assist him in finding his way. In conclusion, those are the three main features that will definitely affect the cyclist.
99	6077	3	3	The settings affect the cyclists for many reasons. One, if the setting is nice, with beautiful landscapes like lush green meadows, clear blue skies, and gentle breezes, the rider can fully concentrate on the magnificent scenery rather than just the pain they are experiencing from cycling. Also, if the setting isn't very nice, perhaps it's a dirty, noisy area with lots of pollution, the rider would probably focus more on the pain in their muscles and joints than they would on the unappealing scenery. Another thing is if the setting is very hilly. The terrain is uneven, and the rider has to pedal hard to drive over the steep slopes. It definitely won't feel the greatest. The cyclist would get even more pain in their legs and back than before. Plus, the physical exertion on the hilly terrain makes the cyclist lose more fluids, and they could get dehydrated faster. Clearly, the setting really does have a significant impact on the cyclist.
100	6078	3	3	The setting in the story affected the cyclist by forcing him to go through numerous obstacles to get to town. The setting was in a vast desert in California in June, where the heat was intense and the sun was scorching. The cyclist was already in a tough situation with a severe lack of water. When he found a pump, it was an old, decrepit one. He said it was black, covered in dirt and grime, and the water that came out tasted like battery acid, which was completely undrinkable. And then he stopped to ask for directions. The men he asked gave him the oldest set of directions, which seemed unreliable and confusing. So, the cyclist decided that he would stick to his trusty map, hoping it would lead him safely to town.
101	6079	3	3	"In the text, the features of the desolate setting greatly affect the lone cyclist. For example, the text states, “There was no one in sight, not a building, or structure of any kind.” The vast emptiness all around made the cyclist feel very lonely, and they gradually started to lose hope of finding water. Secondly, the text stated, ""In an ironic twist the building, abandoned years earlier, by the looks of it - had been a Welch’s Grape Juice factory."" When the cyclist first spotted the building, he thought it would have people in it and got excited. But upon closer inspection, the abandoned state made him lose more hope. Lastly, the text states, “GRAPE AND @CAPS1’S FISH CAMP.” The sight of this building on the horizon gave the cyclist a glimmer of hope and a sense of happiness, as it meant there was a chance of finding a place to get a drink. Clearly, the setting’s features greatly affect the cyclist's feelings."
102	6080	3	3	The features of the hilly setting made the cyclist’s ride longer and harder than he initially expected. When the cyclist first headed out, the road was flat and smooth, allowing him to pedal with relative ease. Halfway through his trip, the “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” Despite being slowed down to 12 mph, the cyclist continued to pedal steadily. The continuous ascent and descent of the hills made the ride slower and more arduous. Towards the end of the hilly stretch, he had to make it “Over one long, crippling hill.” The word “crippling” is used to vividly show the physical toll that the steep hill took on him. Evidently, the hills were a prominent feature of the setting which made the cyclist’s ride longer, harder, and more physically demanding.
103	6081	3	3	There are numerous features in the desolate setting that affect the cyclist. For example, the rough road surface made it difficult for the cyclist to maintain a steady speed and caused his wheels to jolt with every bump. Another example is the tumbleweed that rolled across his path unexpectedly, which startled him and disrupted his concentration. The sudden appearance of a snake on the side of the road also affected the cyclist, sending a shiver of fear down his spine. In conclusion, these are the reasons the setting affects the cyclist.
104	6082	3	3	Sun, amount of miles, and the presence of people all are reasons why the setting affects the cyclist. For example, the sun was beating down on him relentlessly every moment. The cyclist seemed to constantly complain that it was so hot, and the sweltering heat made him feel fatigued. Also, he said that he really didn’t seem to notice it consciously, but deep in his mind, the heat affected the cyclist, sapping his energy. Next, the large amount of miles that the cyclist was biking affected him mentally. As he pedaled on, people along the way would comment on the distance he had to cover, which added to the mental pressure. All these factors in the setting had a significant impact on the cyclist.
105	6083	3	3	The setting is like a vast desert with no water sources or signs of people or civilizations anywhere around him. The endless expanse of sand and the absence of any human presence make him more worried. He realizes that if something were to happen to him, like getting injured or running out of supplies, no one would know for days or weeks, perhaps even longer. This isolation in the desolate setting fills him with a sense of vulnerability and anxiety, highlighting how the setting has a profound psychological effect on the cyclist.
106	6084	3	3	There are several features that the cyclist encountered, and all of them significantly affected the cyclist. For example, “several rusty bumps,” as a quote from the text, clearly explains that he wasn't riding on smooth ground; instead, he was on rough, hard, and extremely bumpy ground. This made his ride extremely uncomfortable. Also, he had a huge lack of water; he was severely water - depleted. Due to this, he couldn't even go the speed limit. He was going at a mere 12 mph while the speed limit could have allowed him to go 55 mph. “Rough roads ahead Do not exceed posted speed limit,” this is another quote expressing the numerous dangers in the ride that he was risking. All these things combined made the cyclist uncomfortable, dehydrated, and very tired, making his journey a real struggle.
107	6085	3	3	The setting in “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” was a very large and crucial factor of the story that was actually the root cause of the protagonist’s problem throughout. First, it started off with the large, steep hills he had to ride up. These hills were so challenging that they made him work extremely hard and tire himself out quickly. Next, the big problem was the intense heat of June. “And the growing realization that I could drop from a heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because …” The heat was truly unbearable. It made him extremely hot, thus rapidly depleting his water supply (which he desperately needed to survive). Moreover, it gave the large, almost inevitable risk of falling from a heatstroke and dying. The heat also made the abandoned Juice Factory all the more ironic and bitter for the protagonist. “A sand - blasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen.” In the sweltering, unbearable heat with no water left and goodness knows how many miles left to cycle, this really made him feel like the sorriest, unluckiest man in the world. The setting overall seemed almost deliberately crafted to make the protagonist not only suffer from the natural elements but also from things that seemed meant purely to taunt him for his plight.
108	6086	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because it is extremely hard to go far on a bike when the place you are riding is dry, completely abandoned, eerily quiet, and both hot and cold in an uncomfortable way, and straightforward with no respite. It clearly tells you that the setting is abandoned when it says “there was none in sight, not a building, car or structure of any kind”. This desolate situation would make it incredibly hard for a cyclist because you need a good water supply, and that's extremely difficult to maintain when there is absolutely nothing around. In such a setting, the cyclist is left vulnerable and struggling to continue the journey.
109	6087	3	3	The cyclist chose to take an old, desolate and abandoned route to @LOCATION1. The route, in some stretches, had absolutely no buildings at all in sight. This lack of any human - made structures made the cyclist gradually lose hope of fulfilling his desperate need for water. Throughout the journey, until the very end, there was no one on the route, leaving him all alone. So, if something were to happen to him, like an accident or sudden illness, there would be no one around to know or offer help. During his adventure, he ran out of water, which made him severely dehydrated, and this certainly didn't help his situation. The overall setting of the story seems truly tragic to the cyclist, making his journey a perilous and forlorn one.
110	6088	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist very much. The text says, “The sun was beginning to beat down” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The intense, hot sun was making the cyclist sweat profusely. As he sweated, he was losing water at a rapid pace. This was making him dehydrate faster, which was taking a toll on his energy and well - being. The text says, “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills” (Kurmaskie @NUM2). The hills the cyclist had to ride up were quite challenging and were wearing him out. He was getting tired faster as he had to exert more energy to climb them. The text says, “I stumbled into a rather modern in bathroom and drank deeply from the sink” (Kurmaskie @NUM3). The modern bathroom had good, cold water. This allowed the cyclist to drink from it. The water replenished the cyclist, allowing him to regain some of his much - needed strength. Then the cyclist could carry on with his journey, although still facing the challenges of the setting.
111	6089	3	3	In the essay “DO NOT Exceed posted speed limit,” it is a clear - cut situation for survival as it seems that this man is desperately fighting to stay alive. As I know, cyclists pedal for long hours at a stretch, and sometimes they cover hundreds of miles. If he was biking in a place where green grass gently meets cool mountains, the tone and mood of the essay would have been completely different. He uses sentences such as “... of two hundred degrees, deteriorating brain, birds would pick me up clean and drop from heatstroke.” All these elements make me eager to read further in the essay to see if he will be okay by the end of his journey. I know what the feeling is like when you are low on fluids because I have chronic dehydration. I couldn't imagine biking and only seeing the desert hiss and passing tumbleweeds. It truly sounds like an awful experience. If he were in a cooler and more colorful place, his experience wouldn't have been so horrific. In conclusion, the harsh setting in the essay greatly impacts the man's survival story, making it a tense and concerning read.
112	6090	3	3	There are many ways that the setting affected the cyclist. One way is in the story when it mentions that it was extremely hot. In such high - temperature conditions, he could easily become dehydrated and possibly have a heat stroke. Also, the roads were windy. This could pose a significant problem because he was already tired. With his fatigue, he might not be able to skillfully navigate around the turns. He might just keep going straight and then end up getting lost even more. These aspects clearly show how the features of the setting, like the heat and the windy roads, have a negative impact on the cyclist in the story. In conclusion, the setting's features play a crucial role in making the cyclist's journey difficult.
113	6091	3	3	"The features in the setting of ""Rough Road ahead"" affect the cyclist. First of all, the weather causes most of his problems. Since the cyclist was biking in a California desert in June, the temperature had to be in the high @NUM1's. This intense heat causes him to become dehydrated, which is evident when he states, ""I had been hitting my water bottles quite regularly."" The heat, therefore, makes the cyclist drink water at an excessive rate and eventually run out of it. Also, the objects the cyclist comes across on his journey affect him. For example, while riding on a rough path, ""a ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me."" This not only halts the biker's progress but most likely scares him badly. The cyclist is greatly affected by the features in the story setting, as the weather and the unexpected objects on the path make his journey extremely challenging. In conclusion, the setting features in the story are major obstacles for the cyclist."
114	6092	3	3	The cyclist was affected by the heat. The fact that it was June, he was in the desert, and he was low on water almost led to his own downfall. In the hot desert setting, the sun beats down relentlessly, sucking the moisture out of his body. The lack of water in such a harsh environment made his situation extremely precarious. This hot desert setting sounds incredibly hostile, with its scorching sand and dry air. I'm really surprised he lived through it and that he was that lucky. In conclusion, the combination of the hot desert, the time of year, and his low water supply made the cyclist's survival a remarkable feat.
115	6093	3	3	The features of the setting had misled the cyclist. When he had first left the town where the old men advised him, the cyclist had high hopes. As he looked around, he enjoyed seeing the scenery and was oblivious to most of the struggle that awaited him. The seemingly pleasant start with the nice scenery made him underestimate the challenges ahead. The setting, which initially appeared inviting, actually set him up for a difficult journey. In conclusion, the misleading nature of the setting's features had a significant impact on the cyclist's expectations and his subsequent experience.
116	6094	3	3	The setting affects the cyclist in a large way. As he pedals along, he has an increasingly hard time going on his journey. His legs start to ache, and his breathing becomes labored. He began to lose hope, get tired, and began to think he was going to die. The settings played the biggest role. It was swelteringly hot, with the sun beating down mercilessly, and there were no people or buildings around him as far as the eye could see. He had very little water left in his canteen and no place to get anymore. He then encountered a large snake, its menacing eyes fixed on him, which made it worse because he was in fear with no one around to help him. If he would have followed his own directions instead of the old men he would not have had this problem. The setting around him really made his trip a hard one with no water, people, towns, or buildings around him, leaving him in a desperate and lonely situation.
117	6095	3	3	"The features of the setting in the essay, ìRough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,î greatly affected the cyclist. In the beginning of this manís journey, he was full of confidence in his abilities. He thought about the adventure that awaited him and said, ìI rode in the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.î  The cyclist was prepared for an exciting day, and the beautiful scenery of the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite around him supported this feeling. He even mused, ""The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them."" However, as the setting began to change and his water ran out, the cyclist's attitude changed. He was ìtraveling through the high deserts of California in Juneî under the scorching sun, without much water, and begun to feel desperate. As more and more abandoned buildings and deserted towns appeared, with a sense of desolation in the air, he went into despair. ìAt some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake - it really did look like a diamondback - blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.î He was in the middle of nowhere with no one around, and because of this setting, he lost hope of surviving. He thought he was going to die of heat stroke, not having any water left, on these short rolling hills and under the extremely hot sun. The cyclist was affected by the features of the setting, going from confidence, to desperation and despair, and then to relief as the changes in setting caused his change in attitude throughout this journey."
118	6096	3	3	"The features of the setting in ìRough Road Ahead, Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit, ìaffect  the cyclist in major ways. First, when the cyclist sees the grape juice factory, the sight of the factory workers handling the refreshing juice makes his throat parched. He is reminded that he is out of water and is doubtful about even living. The text states, ìÖA young worker pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen. I hung  my head ì   (Kurmaskie @NUM1 ). The  text later states, "" At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path..."" (kurmaskie). This desolate scene tells that the cyclist feels depressed and is majorly affected by these sights. The lack of any signs of life and the dry, barren landscape around him could and would later ruin his self - esteem and make him think about dying as he continues his solitary and difficult journey."
119	6097	3	3	The cyclist went on a rough journey and he was explaining how tiring it was and difficult it was for him going from town to town. As he pedaled, he had to deal with the constant lack of water. His throat was dry, and his lips were chapped. He also had to face the threat of poisonous snakes that could suddenly appear from the bushes by the roadside. Moreover, the condition of the road was terrible, full of potholes and uneven surfaces that made his ride bumpy and exhausting. Each pedal stroke was a struggle as he fought against the harsh elements and the difficult circumstances of his journey.
120	6098	3	3	The setting of the essay didnít really help the author at all on his journey. There were not many structures on the way. Either that, or the towns said to be, ìa ghost town.î The empty streets and dilapidated buildings gave an eerie feeling. This couldnít have reassured the author that things were going his way. It also was very hot during his journey. The author says he is ìtraveling through the deserts of California in June.î Deserts are very hot places, and June is during summer, which is the hottest month. The sun was like a blazing ball in the sky, and the air was thick and humid. All this must have taken a toll because he never really saw anything reassuring until the last town he reached with the bait store. The sight of the store and the people there was like a breath of fresh air. So the setting definitely had to have affected his confidence and his energy levels, making his journey a real test of his willpower.
121	6099	3	3	The features that set the affect of the cyclist are very clear in the case of this essay. When the cyclist encountered the signs that said “Rough Road ahead: Do not Exceed posted Speed Limit,” it was obvious that this would have an impact. That sign had to make him slow down his bike. Then he mentioned that there were no buildings or cars anywhere in sight, which added to the desolate feeling of the journey. In conclusion, these features of the setting clearly influenced the cyclist's experience.
122	6100	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. In the essay, it vividly states, “This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time - say, before the last world war - but on that morning it fit the tradition of a ghost town.” This detailed statement might affect the cyclist significantly in the way that they fear if they get into any trouble, there is absolutely no one around to help out. This statement can also mean that they start to worry that they are going the wrong way. In the essay, it further states, “One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral they couldn't have fit the larger mule greeted me.” This statement simply gives the cyclist the strong impression that this particular town is desolate, and that nobody has even been known to live here in years, perhaps even decades. The different features of the journey of the cyclist in the essay make many fear the outcome. If they over - fear the journey and become like “old timers” who had never left their porches, they would never be able to experience such things. In conclusion, the setting's features have a profound and mostly negative impact on the cyclist's state of mind and perception of the journey.
123	6101	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because, forty miles into the desert, I finally arrived at the first “town”. The vast expanse of the desert setting affected the cyclist as the cyclist was riding down the road when a man with a rather strange demeanor came and somehow affected the cyclist. The man seemed very crazy. The cyclist's water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of dreaded sweat circled my shirt, and I feared that I might drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because I listened to some gentleman who seemed to be a bit off - their rocker, thinking I was tough enough. This is my response to how the features of the setting affected the cyclist. In conclusion, the harsh desert setting and the encounter with the strange man had a detrimental effect on the cyclist's journey.
124	6102	3	3	The cyclist trusted a man that didn't know much about the world. He naively thought that the guy would know how to get to the place he was looking for. The cyclist took his advice without hesitation. He assumed that he would be there really soon, so he started to drink his water really fast. Soon enough, he realized that he was out of water and the park he was going to was nowhere near. The cyclist got extremely frustrated and angry. He was now crossing the desert, which was making him terribly tired and dehydrated. He passed this rough road filled with tumbleweeds and snakes, yet he kept on going until he saw the “@CAPS1 Juice” company. He quickly hurried there, went into the bathroom, and drank some water. When he got out, an old man asked if he needed directions, but the cyclist, still annoyed, said no. In conclusion, the cyclist's trust in the wrong person and his hasty actions led to a difficult and frustrating situation during his journey.
125	6103	3	3	During the passage “Do not exceed speed limit,” the cyclist endures many hardships. One of those countless hardships was the unforgiving setting that he was in. While he was lost, extremely thirsty, and completely exhausted, he remained all the while in “The high deserts of California in June”. This clearly shows that the temperature must have been unbearably high. This intense heat would cause the cyclist to tire out and dehydrate much faster than usual. Also, the surface he was riding on had many steep hills, as it is specifically said when he says “over one long, crippling hill”. This shows that the hills took a great deal of energy to get up. And finally, the author says that “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” This shows that if he needed help, there was absolutely no one around to lend him a hand. That is how the setting affected the cyclist in a negative way. In conclusion, the harsh desert setting, the steep hills, and the lack of help all combined to make the cyclist's journey extremely difficult.
126	6104	3	3	It affects the cyclist because in the beginning, the talk is about the old man. It also talks about basically saying their information is out of date. In other words, the cyclist should have just followed his map in the first place. This oversight influenced the cyclist's journey, making it more difficult than it needed to be.
127	6105	3	3	In the stories, “Don’t exceed posted speed limit,” there are some very descriptive settings. In the stories, these settings have a great effect on the cyclist. Through these settings, the effects change, with some being good and some being harsh. The first setting that is described to you is, “the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them.” This setting gives you a vivid picture of where the cyclist is heading. It also establishes a happy sort of mood. However, the pretty picture is about to change. Not much further into the cyclist's ride, he noticed a change of terrain: “the flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” At this point, the cyclist is short on water and is becoming very tired. Seeing this just crushes his spirit. Riding hills is hard, but riding hills without the knowledge of something good waiting for you on the other side of the hills is even worse. Both of these very different settings give off very different feelings. The first one makes you think he is going to have an easy, enjoyable bike ride. But this all changes when he hits those horrible hills. Just the thought of having to ride over miles of hills makes your legs hurt. Overall, the features of the setting imposed an intense bike ride for the cyclist, followed by a reward of a beautiful place.
128	6106	3	3	The author had to bike through extremely hot weather. This made him feel sweat a lot. The narration states, “Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt” (@NUM1). Due to the excessive sweating, this caused him to drink water until he ran out. The narration states, “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips” (@NUM1). Left with no water, he then had to suck on pebbles, which was a risky move as he could have choked on them. The narration states, “With any luck, I'd hit a bump and lodge one in my throat” (@NUM1). This desperate situation shows the harsh impact of the hot weather on the author's biking experience.
129	6107	3	3	In the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” there were many features of the setting that affected the cyclist. The most challenging problem faced by the author was the lack of water. “I pumped that handle for several minutes, but the water wouldn't come out. Nor did I get more than a drip or two, and it had the flavor of battery acid.” When the cyclist set out for the next train, they came to a road that read “Rough road ahead, Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” The terrain got more bumpy and hard to cross. This affected the determination the cyclist had left. They regretted not listening to the old men, thinking they didn't know what they were talking about because they never left their porches. As you can see, the setting definitely affected the cyclist in physical and mental ways.
130	6108	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. One way it affects the cyclist is by being hot, like it says in the text “I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June” (@CAPS1). The sweltering heat makes the cyclist's journey extremely difficult and uncomfortable. Another way it affects the cyclist is by being bumpy, like it says in the text “ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT.” The bumpy terrain not only slows down the cyclist but also adds to the physical strain. That is how the setting affects the cyclist, both physically and mentally, making the ride a challenging one.
131	6109	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist through the mood it instills in the cyclist and the events that unfold as he makes his way from the desert to a town. For instance, his mood undergoes a shift when an old man approaches him asking for a map. His attitude transitions from cautiousness upon venturing onto a new road to sheer terror when he fears for his life, thinking “I was gonna die and the birds would pick me clean.” Then, it shifts to pride when the old man asks for a map, and the author states “I own a very good map”. As he continues his journey towards Yosemite, the setting changes; he first traverses a desert - like area and then stops at a bait shop to rest before likely continuing merrily towards his destination.
132	6110	3	3	Do Not Exceed the Posted Speed Limit’ by Joe Kurmaskie clearly demonstrated that the features of the setting affected the cyclist a great deal. Initially, the cyclist was pedaling through the desert on a bicycle. This had a significant impact because if they had been traveling in a car or on a bus, a lot less energy would have been used up. Moreover, the cyclist started to run out of water. This was a problem as being on a bike in the desert required proper hydration. Another crucial setting factor was the deserted towns. If these towns had not been deserted, the cyclist could have found supplies and support, making the journey much better. All these features combined had a profound and negative effect on the cyclist.
133	6111	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist such that it influenced his determination to continue. For example, after @NUM1 miles of cycling, he looked upon a “ramshackled shed, several rusty bumps and the corral…”. This sight deeply troubled him. In the scorching desert, his water tasted as unpleasant as “battery acid”. The text also describes this journey as “a test for my inner spirit”. It further states that he struggled on with just a few drops of water as he cycled through the tumbleweeds. This passage clearly shows the numerous obstacles he had to overcome. Despite the difficulties, he persevered and managed to make it with a small boost in confidence. Although his situation was extremely unbearable at times, he still kept pushing forward, demonstrating great resilience.
134	6112	3	3	The setting of the story affects the cyclist throughout most of the narrative. The intense heat made him feel hot and extremely thirsty, while the long - distance travel depleted his energy and increased his need for water. In paragraph @NUM1, the writer describes one of the hills as “long and arduous”. This hill was wearing him out, gradually draining what little energy he had left. The setting of the story was a major factor; the road conditions, whether flat or bumpy, along with the temperature, played a crucial role in determining the cyclist's experience. All these elements combined made the cyclist's journey a challenging one.
135	6113	3	3	The setting easily can affect the cyclist in numerous ways. The area where the cyclist found himself seemed to be completely abandoned, which did not bode well for him. When a town or a road is abandoned, there are no noticeable building structures for quite a while, leaving the cyclist without any shelter or resources. Additionally, the condition and shape of the road were very dangerous for the cyclist. Not only was the path narrow and rocky, but the presence of wildlife also posed a threat. In the text, it describes how a poisonous diamond - back snake was directly in front of the cyclist. This example shows that there could be even more dangerous creatures in the area. Finally, the temperature, whether it was swelteringly hot or freezing cold, limited the cyclist's water supply. The risk of complete dehydration was a huge concern for him. Overall, the conditions of the setting the cyclist was in put him at a significant disadvantage.
136	6114	3	3	The different settings that the cyclist had to encounter were mountains or hills with winding roads and the scorching California desert in June. As well as facing these challenging settings, he was running out of water, which made his journey even more arduous.
137	6115	3	3	How the features of the setting affect the cyclist by taking into account that he did not have the right setting. The features are simply not appropriate, and they could be adjusted slightly while still retaining about the same meaning of the essay. So, I firmly think they should change it around to better suit the cyclist's experience.
138	6116	3	3	The features of the setting have a significant affect on the cyclist. He is embarking on this bike ride through the desolate deserts of California in June. This obviously is going to have a profound impact on him because the cycling conditions will be very harsh. At one point he says, “The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed.” Additionally, the setting of having all these ghost towns was deeply troubling to him because no one else was around and he was beginning to run out of water. The sweltering weather outside was starting to take a toll on him, and he said, “I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn't a mirage…” When you're pedaling through the desert on a blisteringly hot day it is going to have detrimental effects on you. If he was in a different setting this feeling of despair would not be present in the story. That is how the setting affects the cyclist.
139	6117	3	3	There are many ways the features of the setting affect the cyclist. One crucial feature is the weather. When a cyclist is on a long - distance trip the weather could affect the setting greatly. For example, if it suddenly started to rain the roads could become extremely slippery and extremely dangerous to ride your bike on. The cyclist and his bike could crash, and in the worst - case scenario, he could die. All just because of the adverse weather. Another important feature is the animals. Animals are significant because wherever you go there are different animals that can behave in various ways. If the cyclist knows the types of animals around the area that he is traveling through, he could keep himself safe and not be harmed. It's far better to know the area and feel secure rather than not knowing what's going to happen next.
140	6118	3	3	As the features changed in the setting it becomes harder for the cyclist. At first, the cyclist started off pretty easily. He had flat, smooth roads to traverse. He set out before the sun could fully bear down on him. “The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over it,” he thought. He kept his mind off the sun and this helped him maintain his momentum. Then, he got to a highway that made the journey a bit more difficult. “I noticed the terrain changing. The flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills,” he noted. So he had to pedal much harder and would tire himself out faster. “At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path. Trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state was a real struggle.” By the presence of tumbleweeds, it was clear that he was in the desert during a hot period of time. So he had little water left and he was becoming severely dehydrated. This was a tough task for him to overcome. By the terrain changing it became much harder for him to continue his cycling journey.
141	6119	3	3	The setting in this short story “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” is a sweltering, sunny desert expanse, where all towns have been completely abandoned. As described, “The sun was beginning to beat down” (@NUM1). When the cyclist “arrived at the first town, it fit the definition of a ghost town” (@NUM1), a desolate and eerie place. At this point, the cyclist is not only tired but also deeply worried about the dwindling supply of water. The desolate setting and the cyclist’s anxious state run side by side, creating a tense and foreboding atmosphere.
142	6120	3	3	In the story, there are numerous challenges the cyclist has to deal with. He has to endure a series of bad situations just to complete the race. The cyclist must constantly watch out for the rough and uneven road he is traversing. Throughout the entire race, he also has to be vigilant about diamond - back snakes lurking in the area. Water is the cyclist's biggest problem during the whole race. He runs out of water very quickly. When he spots a factory and stops, he puts rocks in his mouth to distract himself from the intense thirst and to make his saliva circulate. The cyclist overcomes all these problems, which clearly shows his strong determination.
143	6121	3	3	The features of the setting greatly affected the cyclist. He was riding along on a route that he had little confidence would lead to a proper destination. Since it was the first time he had ever been on that road and he had only outdated knowledge about it, the cyclist felt quite uneasy. The temperature was extremely hot, with very little shade available, and the sun was relentlessly beating down on him. The route was highly discouraging. All the cyclist desired was water, yet the route kept taunting him with false hope. At the first town, he noticed a water pump, but all he could draw from it was sludge and water that tasted like battery acid. Next, he came across a deserted old building that turned out to be an old bottling factory for Welch’s grape juice. The cyclist would seem to be getting close to something to drink, but he was always left empty - handed, highlighting how the setting continuously thwarted his efforts.
144	6122	3	3	During the cyclist's bike ride, the unbearable conditions significantly changed his attitude. When he first starts, the reader can sense his frustration because of the old - timers and their rather vague directions. Then, as he realizes that he might have enough water, his attitude begins to shift. The cyclist goes from being frustrated to appreciating and loving the scenery, as he says, “The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them.” However, as the conditions change to even more unbearable heat, he decides to just give up. But then he gathers the courage and continues, “slowly gaining elevation while losing hope.” When he finally sees Gary and Wilber’s fish camp, he realizes he is safe, and his long - suffering journey is coming to an end.
145	6123	3	3	The cyclist from “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Speed Limit” was affected in many ways by the environment. The most frequently mentioned feature in the environment was the severe lack of water. The cyclist was on the verge of death because there was no water available and he was severely dehydrated. Another prominent feature was the intense heat. It was extremely hot in the area where the narrator was cycling. When it's that hot, the heat rapidly dehydrates you. So, the narrator was being pushed to the limit due to the heat. Moreover, all the towns were deserted, and every town he came to had a haunting effect on him until he got angry at the lodgers he talked to and was extremely frustrated. The initially smooth flat road gradually gave way to rolling hills, which made it much harder for him to ride. Lastly, the snake on the road affected him as he had to carefully avoid it. All of these environmental factors combined had a profound impact on him, testing his endurance and resolve.
146	6124	3	3	"Do not exceed posted speed limit"" by Joe Kurmaskie is truly a story of man against nature. Here is a man who is completely alone, with only his bike, the barren landscape, and the relentless sun for company. First, he notices the sun directly overhead, a common sight in a California June, yet it still bears down on him mercilessly. Then come the rolling hills and the incline in elevation. Going uphill means his body has to work harder, burning calories and quickly depleting his much - needed water supply. Then there is the man's great torture. A speed limit of @NUM1, while he is struggling to go at a tough 12. And worse, there is a billboard showing “a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth”. This truly hits his emotions, clearly showing him what is out of his reach. In this story, every element of his surroundings contributes to his hopelessness, making his journey an almost insurmountable challenge."
147	6125	3	3	The features of the setting significantly affect the cyclist. Firstly, the conditions of the road are truly awful, with potholes and uneven surfaces that make every pedal stroke a struggle. Secondly, the cyclist encounters a huge snake blocking his path, a terrifying sight that makes his heart skip a beat. Along with that, the occasional tumbleweed rolls across his way, adding to the desolate and unpredictable nature of the journey. The biggest impact on the cyclist is the lack of water combined with the unbearable heat, and he is extremely tired. All these factors combined wear him down both physically and mentally. These are the effects the features of the setting have on the cyclist, making his ride a difficult and arduous experience.
148	6126	3	3	If I had a choice to ride a bike in California or Vermont, it would be a no - brainer to bike in Vermont. The temperature in Vermont would be much cooler than in California. In the story, the cyclist complains about the “wide rings of dried sweat” on his clothes and the looming possibility of heatstroke. It is well - known that when temperatures rise, the body tends to lose more water through sweating. Had the cyclist gone to a cooler place like Vermont at a different time of year, he wouldn't have struggled with dehydration on his bike ride. Biking in a cooler climate would have made the journey more enjoyable and less of a physical challenge.
149	6127	3	3	The features of the setting in the story affected the cyclist a lot. In the morning when he began his trip, he was full of eagerness and determination to reach his destination. Although it took him forty miles to reach the first “town”, he didn't seem to mind at all. “The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them,” is what crossed his mind once the sun began to beat down. This means that he wasn't troubled by the distance or the initial heat at that time. But as his trip progressed, it got hotter, and his water supply dwindled. Once he passed a couple of “troubling sights” that were abandoned with no one around, a sense of unease crept over him and he began to worry. The cyclist got so desperate that he started to suck on pebbles to circulate the last bit of spit he had in his mouth. In his desperation, he finally saw a sign for hope that gave him the strength to carry on. When he arrived at GARY AND @CAPS1’S FISH CAMP, his emotions and state of mind changed from being lugubrious to becoming thankful, relieved to have found a safe haven.
150	6128	3	3	During his cycling trip, the author had to endure extreme heat, face snakes, deal with little or no shade, and survive a dire lack of water, all problems directly related to the setting of Yosemite National Park. The author, cyclist Joe Kurmaskie, writes about becoming dehydrated, describing, “the sun was beginning to beat down and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June”. One of his greatest struggles was crossing the path of a “ridiculously large snake” while trying to keep his balance in his dehydrated state. Kurmaskie runs out of water due to the extreme heat. Upon reaching a water pump, he finds the water to be unfit for drinking and “in the neighborhood of zoo degrees”. Another setting - related issue for Kurmaskie is that the area seems deserted, and he has to continue for miles until he is able to find a spot with clean water where he can rest and rehydrate. These challenges make his cycling trip in this setting a harrowing experience.
151	6129	3	3	The features of the setting were very affective in the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” It affected the cyclist because in one part of the setting, the terrain changed to rolling hills. Pedaling a bike on such hilly ground is going to be extremely challenging as it requires a great deal of physical effort. Another way the setting affected the cyclist is that at one point, tumbleweeds were in his way. If a tumbleweed gets caught on the bike, it could disrupt the cyclist's balance and cause him to fall, which might result in harm to him. Lastly, the road started getting rough up ahead, filled with potholes and other irregularities. Riding over these obstacles can be difficult and may even damage the bike. Therefore, the setting had a significant impact on the cyclist throughout his journey.
152	6130	3	3	The features of the setting keep affecting the cyclist because first, the situation seems hopeful, but then he realizes it's hopeless. Initially, he was laughing when people told him the right directions, full of optimism. However, later on, as described in the story, “It was sad, hopeless laughter, mind you, but at least I still had energy to feel bad for myself,” the cyclist reflected on the first town with a sense of despair. The reason this affects the cyclist is that at first, he was making good progress on his journey. Then, he started to get thirsty, and a series of bad things happened. This shift in the setting's influence from hope to despair clearly shows how it impacts the cyclist's state of mind and his overall experience.
153	6131	3	3	In the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” written by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affected the author in many ways. One prominent feature was the hills. The speed limit on these hilly terrains affected the author because he felt that he was moving too slowly. The hilly landscape made it difficult for him to maintain a faster pace. In the story, when it says “I was doing a water - depleting 5 miles an hour,” it serves as clear evidence of how the combination of hills and the speed limit was hindering his progress. This shows that the setting's features, like the hills and the speed limit, had a notable impact on the author's cycling experience.
154	6132	3	3	This is how the setting affects the cyclist. One significant factor is the hot, dry California desert heat. The intense heat was making him extremely hot and constantly thirsty, which led to a rapid depletion of his water supply. The hot desert heat had made the water in the well seem like an unattainable substance, perhaps due to its poor quality or inaccessibility. The water bottle he carried only contained a few tantalizing sips, which were far from enough to quench his burning thirst. The sweltering heat was so intense that it felt as if even the birds would pick him dry. All of these examples illustrate how the harsh desert setting made it difficult for the cyclist to follow the old - timers' advice. It made him realize that wisdom comes with time and that youth can sometimes make silly mistakes. The heat had turned this journey into a test of his inner soul's survival. That is how the setting significantly affects the cyclist.
155	6133	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist mainly because he was in a desert. In this desolate desert environment, there were no stores where he could replenish his supplies, no rivers or lakes to quench his thirst. The heat was scorching, making it extremely uncomfortable for him to ride. The roads were long and stretched out as far as the eye could see, adding to the physical and mental exhaustion. To make matters worse, there were even snakes on the road, which posed a real threat to his safety. All these factors made it much harder for him because he didn't have much water to drink. With limited water and a harsh desert setting, the cyclist faced numerous challenges that made his journey an arduous one.
156	6134	3	3	"Many features in the desolate setting profoundly affect the cyclist. Several main features include the car - laden ""towns"" that are no longer really towns in the traditional sense, and the water pump. Both of these examples gave him a glimmer of hope, but unfortunately, none gave him the much - needed relief. The town he first saw had the potential to give him water, but it was all run down and its resources weakened. “I arrived at the first ‘town’. This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time... refer the @NUM1 word war.” He is saying that the town could’ve provided him with more water and energy, but it appeared that its days of being useful were over. Additionally, he biked across a water pump that was desperately needed. He tried to pump water with great effort but got no success. “I pumped the handle for several minutes but the water wouldnít cool down.” A working water pump wouldíve been a huge boon for him, giving him more strength to continue his bike journey. However, once again, it was very misleading, leaving him in a state of continued hardship."
157	6135	3	3	This is how the features of the setting significantly affect the cyclist. One clear example is “flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” This change has a notable effect because by stating this, it vividly shows how extremely tired he is going to be or the great amount of work he has to put in trying to make it over the hills. Another example would be “high deserts of California in June.” This description is clearly saying it's swelteringly hot outside and very tiring. I think it means that because in California, it's really hot, and in June, which is the peak of “summer time,” the heat makes cycling an extremely tiring task. In conclusion, these features of the setting have a direct and substantial impact on the cyclist's experience.
158	6136	3	3	The features affect the cyclist because of how the road is specifically made. If the road is a smooth downhill ride, the cyclist might ride much faster, taking advantage of the natural slope. On the contrary, the road might be going up a steep hill, so he has to go very slow, expending a great deal of energy. There could also be a possibility that the road might have bumpy rocks or patches of thick grass on it. These obstacles can be something really tough to ride through, as they require extra control and effort. So, the effect on the cyclist is clearly depending on how the roads are made, which can either ease or complicate their journey.
159	6137	3	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist because the worse the features get, the more he desperately wants water. For example, in the essay it said at some point, tumbleweeds crossed his path and a ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the pavement in front of him. When I think of tumbleweeds, I immediately think of dryness because it is like dry grass blowing in the wind. And when I think of snakes, I think of the intense heat because that is the time for snakes to come out when it gets scorching hot. So, the cyclist was constantly thinking about the dryness of his throat and the aridness of his surroundings, making him yearn for water even more. Another feature is when he saw a sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth. This sight was like a cruel tease, probably making the cyclist desperately wish he could have that cold, refreshing drink to quench his thirst. In essence, these setting features intensify his need for water.
160	6138	3	3	In “Rough Road ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” the cyclist was significantly affected by the features of the setting. She was first affected by the old men who told her a so - called “shortcut” to her ride to Yosemite National Park. This supposed shortcut led her into unforeseen difficulties. Then she was affected by ghost towns which, to her great disappointment, had no water to give her. As she continued, she was almost dehydrated when she came to a rickety road which had a few tumbleweeds and a huge snake. This situation was quite difficult to get by, as she had to be extremely cautious. Then at the end, she came upon “Gary and Wilberís fish camp” where she finally decided to make decisions herself. All of these things in the setting affected the cyclist in a negative way except “Gary and Wilberís fish camp” which saved her from dehydration, highlighting the importance of a fortunate encounter in an otherwise challenging journey.
161	6139	3	3	In the short story, “Rough Road Ahead”, the cyclist was faced with many problems. One of these is the feature of the setting. I believe it has a big effect. The setting is in a desert, which is extremely hot, with no water around and usually no one living in it. One thing is that he was running out of water. In the text it says, “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.” Another aspect of the setting of the book that affects the cyclist is that it is in June. June is a very hot month, especially when the cyclist is in a desert traveling many miles. This harsh setting not only challenges the cyclist physically but also mentally, as he has to constantly worry about his water supply and the intense heat.
162	6140	3	3	The settings of a cyclist affect the way the cyclist performs. If the weather is too hot, then the cyclist might slow down because of the sun beating down intensely on them. The scorching heat can cause fatigue and make it difficult for the cyclist to maintain their energy. If it's too cold, the cyclist has to put on more clothes, which might weigh them down and prevent them from achieving the speed they need to obtain. The bike also has to be stable. Riding on rough roads requires the cyclist to be more cautious, and the brakes, speeding ability, and the chains being in good conditions are crucial. The area where the cyclist rides sets the mood. If it's a nice scenery, with beautiful landscapes and fresh air, the cyclist might be in a wonderful mood. In contrast, if the scenery is dark and gloomy, with nasty weather behind it, the cyclist might not be as happy as they could be. These types of things clearly help determine how settings can affect the cyclist.
163	6141	3	3	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead” the setting greatly affects the cyclists. The arid desert climate bears down upon the cyclist. For example, the further route he takes is not only in a desert, but also has no place to get water. The intense heat and lack of water combine to cause deadly dehydration upon the cyclists. The setting now forces the cyclist to become more determined if he wants to live. He must continue pedaling and pray for a town to come up, so he can restock on water and become hydrated once again. This shows how the setting can be a life - threatening factor for the cyclist and how it tests their willpower.
164	6142	3	3	Many different things affected him on his way to Yosemite National Park, but the environment he was in played the biggest role in his journey. The cyclist was in a dry, desert area where tumble weeds were more common than people. The desolate landscape added to the sense of isolation. When the cyclist came across the old men and asked them for directions, they led him to a “ghost town”. There was no water for the dehydrated cyclist who had been baking in the extremely dry, hot weather. The heat was so intense that it seemed to sap his energy with every passing moment. This caused a problem where the cyclist thought that he would die in the desert because of the weather, the directions he was given, and the lack of water. When the cyclist came across the bait shop he knew he was saved. He became rehydrated and declined directions from an old man because these features of the setting are what caused his problems in the first place: unreliable old men, dry weather, and the scarcity of water.
165	6143	3	3	There are a couple things that affect the cyclist in the story. One of the ways he is affected is dehydration. In the story about dehydration it says “The water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June.” The description vividly shows the cyclist's desperate situation. A good affect on the cyclist was that there was no one in sight to slow him down on his bike ride. He could pedal freely without any interruptions. A bad affect on him was not to ask directions from a guy when he was suffering from heat strokes on a gorgeous day in June. Simply because he listened to some gentlemen who hadn't left their porch in a decade, which caused him to get lost. One more thing that got in his way was the poisonous snake. “At some point, tumble weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake - It really did look like a diamond back.” It blocked the major part of the pavement in front of him, forcing him to stop and find a way around it. These various factors combined to make the cyclist's journey a challenging one.
166	6144	3	3	The cyclist, not knowing where he was going, received wrong information and blindly followed it. He was oddly excited upon thinking that he finally knew where he was heading. Along his journey, he was confronted with a plethora of challenges, such as the scorching sun. The weather conditions of the area were extremely harsh, and he even came across a big snake. The sun took a toll on him as he was rapidly dehydrating, and he almost had no water left. The intense heat made the journey incredibly difficult and put him in a strange mood. While following the directions, he was startled by a big snake he encountered. He was scared that he was going to be attacked and had no one to help him make his way through. These features affected him because he was lost and ill - prepared for the journey. Since it was summer, the heat was unbearable, and he was riding a bicycle instead of a car. In the end, his lack of knowledge and the tough conditions made his journey a real struggle.
167	6145	3	3	The features of the setting significantly affect the cyclist's train of thought. On page @NUM1, it clearly states, “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” This description gives a strong sense of the intense heat and foreshadows the possible lack of water he'll face later on. As he passes a snake, he mentions “trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.” So, it's quite evident that the cyclist is most likely starting to feel dizzy and is beginning to lose hope. On page @NUM2, he says, “...I could drop from heatstroke...” This shows that he's starting to think of the worst - case scenarios. This affects him deeply as he's beginning to lose hope and believes he might not make it. On page @NUM3, he says, “I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean...” By this point, the rough conditions are clearly making him worry. In conclusion, the features of the setting had a profound and negative impact on the cyclist throughout the story.
168	6146	3	3	"With little water, the setting was extremely unhelpful to the cyclist. Joe @PERSON1 said, “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind” (@PERSON1). In such a desolate situation, if there were people passing by in cars or nearby stores, it would probably have been a great help to the cyclist for asking directions. @PERSON1 also mentioned, ""working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength"" (@PERSON1). Having no water to replenish the body will make a person weak and unstable, which is a huge problem in the middle of nowhere. @PERSON1 further stated, ""Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills"" (@PERSON1). With little water left and a weak body, going up and down those hills must have been excruciating. Additionally, he said, “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June” (@PERSON1). The dust in the lungs and the intense heat from the sun made it even harder for his body to function. All these factors combined made the cyclist's journey extremely difficult."
169	6147	3	3	The setting in the story had a significant impact on the cyclist. The story takes place in June, a time when the heat is at its peak. The cyclist is getting severely dehydrated due to the sweltering conditions. You can vividly imagine how hot it was when the text says, “wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn't a mirage.” It also gives the impression in the story that it felt like two hundred degrees when the sun was beating down relentlessly. The intense heat not only made the cyclist physically uncomfortable but also added to his mental stress. In conclusion, the hot setting in June was a major obstacle for the cyclist during his journey.
170	6148	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many different ways. For example, it was June, and he was in the @CAPS1 of California. The weather was extremely hot, which rapidly dehydrated him. Moreover, he had no idea where he was going, so he had to rely entirely on the directions given by other people. This reliance on others was not always reliable, and he continued to get dehydrated as he struggled to find his way. The combination of the heat, his lack of knowledge of the area, and the need to keep moving in the harsh conditions took a heavy toll on him. In summary, these features of the setting were the main factors that affected the cyclist during his journey.
171	6149	3	3	The features of the settings in “Do not exceed the posted speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie were rough and challenging. A biker rides through Todi, California, an area known for its rough terrain that makes cycling a real test. The ride was extremely hot and long under the scorching sun. He was so dehydrated that thick rings of dried sweat were visible around his neck. The solo cyclist says, “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” He had nowhere to get water or food. The place was completely deserted. He thought that if he died, no one would find him quickly and the birds would pick him clean. The essay “Rough road ahead: do not exceed posted speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie shows that solo cyclists are very independent as they have to face such harsh conditions on their own.
172	6150	3	3	In the story, “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist faced many obstacles. For example, he needed to get directions to Yosemite National Park. He asked a couple of elder men, but the information they gave was out - of - date. In addition, when there was a fork in the road, the cyclist had to make a decision. He chose a path that the old men said would have a town nearly eighteen miles down the road. Furthermore, the cyclist encountered flat roads that gradually turned into rolling hills. He also had snakes blocking his path and reached a severe dehydration state that could have easily killed him. In conclusion, this determined man overcame all these obstacles to finally reach Yosemite National Park, showing his perseverance and willpower.
173	6151	3	3	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting affects the cyclist in various different ways. First of all, he listened to the old man's advice and ended up on the wrong path. So he travels on a sweltering hot June day in the California deserts. The odds are against him from the start. “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips, wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I needed a drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June…” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). From his haggard appearance, you can clearly tell that he is tired and almost out of water. The harsh setting puts a great deal of physical and mental strain on the cyclist, but he manages to keep going, showing his resilience.
174	6152	3	3	The setting clearly has a huge effect on the cyclist. The flat roads are easy and smooth to ride on, providing a relatively effortless cycling experience. But as the road changes to short, rolling hills, the biking becomes more difficult. This is supported by the sentence that reads, “Over a long, crippling hill...” This shows that the hill is a very challenging obstacle that requires a lot of physical effort. He is also affected by the things that come with the change in terrain. For example, one sentence reads, “...tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake, it really did look like a diamondback, blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.” This stresses how remote the area in which he is biking really is, and shows how it mentally and physically affects his trip, making it both arduous and nerve - wracking.
175	6153	3	3	The effect of the setting is two old timers sitting on their front porch out in the desert. They've been there since Carter was in office. It was starting to become daylight, and he had to walk @NUM1 miles to get to the next town. So he gets on his bike and starts riding towards the next town. The speed limit on the road is 55 miles per hour, but he is going at a mere 12 miles per hour, as slow as a gentle waterflow. He is riding up and down the rolling hills, struggling with each ascent and enjoying the brief respite of the descents. After a long and tiring journey, he finally gets to the next town and is able to continue living his life, having overcome the challenges of the desert setting.
176	6154	3	3	The setting of the essay affects the cyclist because when he asked the old people for directions, he got lost. This shows how the interaction within the setting led to an unexpected and difficult situation for the cyclist, ultimately influencing his journey.
177	6155	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in a lot of ways. In the essay, the author describes how the setting is extremely hot, with the sun beating down relentlessly. The road is bumpy, filled with uneven patches that jolt the cyclist with every pedal stroke. This makes him sweat profusely, drenching his clothes. The heat and the constant physical exertion make him incredibly tired. He is also running out of water due to his intense thirst. The road gets very rocky at one point, making it even more challenging to navigate. The narrator states “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). There is also a photograph that shows how rough the terrain is. It is barren with nothing around it, adding to the cyclist's sense of isolation and struggle. All these aspects of the setting combined had a significant impact on the cyclist's experience.
178	6156	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the cyclist is severely dehydrated and has to ride on the horrible conditions of a road filled with snakes and hills. All of these features act like obstacle courses, which makes it hard to do what he's trying to do, which is receive water. Also, with the cyclist being hot and in desperate need of water, at this point he is delirious and most likely doesn't know what's going on. In the story, the author's main feature of the setting is the road. “Rough road ahead.” This clearly explains the cyclist having to go on a rough road, and doing that while dehydrated is very dangerous. These are some of the features of the setting that affect the cyclist, highlighting the harsh challenges he faces in this environment.
179	6157	3	3	The settings have a huge affect on the cyclist. When he first comes to the “@CAPS1 town,” he isn't really worried. He is kind of laughing and thinks he's funny by saying, “This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time - say, before the last world war.” Then after he says that, it says he chuckled. When he gets to the dark part of the road with the risky pipe of water, he begins to switch into conservation mode and starts to get scared. He says, “I would confront water - a test at my inner spirit.” This shows that he was scared. After he sees the abandoned Grape juice factory, he says something like birds are going to pick him clean and leave behind some expensive biking gear. This definitely shows that he is giving up. Another thing that would back this up is when he talks about writing in his diary about the old men who gave him these directions. When he finally reaches the bait shop, he is relieved and goes to the bathroom and drinks water. He also says that he will buy bait even though he doesn't have a rod. These examples clearly show the many ways the setting affected the cyclist, from his initial nonchalance to his growing fear and eventual relief.
180	6158	3	3	"In the story, ""Do not exceed posted speed limit,"" the features of the setting affect the cyclist. To keep cool on a sweltering hot summer day, it might be necessary for one to find shade. Just to add to the misfortune of the story, there was no one in sight, not a single building, car, or structure of any kind. This desolate factor does not help the cyclist at all. In fact, all it does is make the cyclist more exhausted as there is no relief from the scorching sun. Another element in the story that affects the cyclist is the lack of water. Early on in the story, the author explains, ""The water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips."" With many more miles to go, the cyclist starts to lose hope of making it to his destination alive. The feature of rolling hills also affects the cyclist. The cyclist is already tired enough, and just to add to his misfortune, ""flat roads were replaced by short, rolling hills."" Even though the hills are short, they still could have a significant impact on him because of the repetitive nature of the hills. Many features of the story affected the mood of the story, creating a sense of despair and struggle for the cyclist."
181	6159	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist. It affected him because the distance indicator was showing @NUM1 miles, and then they reached the first town. The cyclist was getting excited as he thought he was almost done and that he was going at a fast pace. When the cyclist finally got to the first town, he observed that it looked completely dead. After that, as he kept moving forward, he gradually realized that he wasn't really getting anywhere. Then, upon reflection, he noticed that he had listened to some old folks who had never even been off their porch. So, right after hitting the first town, he knew that he should never listen to old folks ever again because that first town seemed like nobody had been in it for years. This experience taught him to be more discerning about the advice he takes.
182	6160	3	3	The features of the setting on the way to Yosemite National Park greatly affected the cyclist. On this long - journey to the park, the cyclist had to face the intense heat of the desert in California. The sun beat down relentlessly, making the air feel like an oven. Besides the heat, the cyclist also had to overcome the rough terrain of the short, rolling hills. The uneven ground made each pedal stroke a struggle, which made the cyclist tired and weary. Adding to his weakness, and with the extreme heat sapping his energy, he also ran out of water, causing him to become dehydrated. “Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from a heat stroke...laugh.” This arduous trip through the California desert greatly affected the cyclist by causing great exhaustion and dehydration, but it also likely gave him a newfound respect for the power of nature.
183	6161	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the climate could be hot, making the air thick and stifling. The road could be bumpy, with potholes and uneven surfaces that jolt the cyclist with every turn. And the town could be deserted, with empty streets and silent buildings. For example, “Rough Road Ahead. Do not exceed posted speed limit.” This warning sign would be especially challenging for a cyclist who is already thirsty. If he is running out of water and there is no water source in sight, he probably could barely make it up the hills. And with no town nearby to get water, his thirst would only grow. “First 'town'” This place might have been a thriving little spot at one point, but another warning sign indicated that it fit the description of a ghost town. There was no water to be found, leaving the cyclist in a desperate situation.
184	6162	3	3	Hot, lack of water, lost - all are how the features of the setting affected the cyclist. First, it was hot. In one sentence, he mentioned that the sun was beginning to beat down with full force. The heat was so intense that the water in his bottle felt around two - hundred degrees. Sweat was pouring all over him, drenching his clothes. So, he had to be really hot, and the heat was sapping his energy. Next, the lack of water affected him and his performance. He was dying in need of water. He tried everything, like looking for streams or asking locals, to get water but made it through with almost no water. His throat was parched, and it was getting harder to pedal. Lastly, he was lost. The map that he had was wrong, and the trip wasn't what he expected. But in the end, he was relieved. So, even though he faced all these negative affects, he still managed to come to a positive outcome. Basically, this story is explaining how if you try your hardest, never give up, and try new things you are most likely to succeed in life and other things you @MONTH1 take part of. So, try your best and make the most of your life and plans in your life, just like the cyclist did.
185	6163	3	3	The conditions the cyclist has to face are always either problems or helpers. Say there is a rocky up - hill part. The large rocks and uneven incline will most definitely slow him down. Each pedal requires extra effort as the bike struggles to move forward against gravity and the rough surface. But if there is a nice smooth downhill part, it will speed him up. The cyclist can relax his legs as the bike glides effortlessly down the slope, and it takes a lot of the work of pedaling off his hands. This shows that the cyclist must adapt to different conditions on the road, and these conditions can significantly impact his journey.
186	6164	3	3	The cyclist lost all hope as he found himself in the vast California deserts in the scorching month of June. The situation grew even more dire when he came across a rusty water pump. With great effort, he managed to pump out some water, only to find that it had the taste of battery acid. When he saw the sign “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”, he became extremely cautious. The cyclist was certain that he was going to die out there in the desolate desert. He also felt a deep sense of loneliness as described in the text, “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” Being in the California desert made him firmly believe that his end was near.
187	6165	3	3	In “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, he vividly describes his arduous biking trip through the diverse landscapes of California. In the essay, he mentions the setting with “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” While this doesn't directly characterize the weather, the reader can easily conjure up a clear image of the sweltering heat that typically engulfs a desert in the summer. When the author first stumbles upon the “ghost town”, followed by the dilapidated shack, and finally spots the sign that read “Rough Road Ahead”, all hope of finding Yosemite Park vanished from his mind. The overwhelming hopelessness of the situation made the author seriously consider giving up. He started to think that he was going to die out in the desert, succumbing to dehydration and exhaustion. This experience can be related to anyone who has ever been lost in unfavorable conditions, along with the accompanying feelings of helplessness and fear. It feels as if everything is conspiring against you, with nothing working in your favor, and this is precisely what the author goes through in his detailed description of his trip in “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”.
188	6166	3	3	The setting had a profound impact on the cyclist as the physical exhaustion was gradually taking its toll on him. What made the situation even worse was that he was out in the blistering heat, constantly sweating. This excessive sweating led to dehydration, further weakening his body and spirit. In such a harsh environment, the combination of exhaustion and dehydration made his journey extremely difficult and put his well - being at risk.
189	6167	3	3	To begin with, a crucial feature that affected the cyclist was a severe lack of water. This is clearly shown when the speaker says, “When I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid.” The fact that the only available water source was undrinkable was one of the biggest factors that put him at great risk. Without access to clean water, the cyclist's health and ability to continue his journey were severely compromised.
190	6168	3	3	As the reader listened and followed the directions of the old - timers, he encountered many issues and also learned an important lesson. As he began to ride into the daybreak of morning, he had strong legs and even a wide smile on his face, full of energy and optimism. However, as time went on, he soon found himself running dangerously low on water and experiencing a significant loss of energy. The sweltering summer day made him sweat profusely, and he began to have disturbing thoughts that the birds would peck at his body as if he were going to die on his ride to Yosemite. When he finally reached a town, he quickly refreshed himself. He then realized that he should start to follow his own way of getting to places, rather than blindly relying on others' directions.
191	6169	3	3	The features of the setting in the essay “Do not exceed the posted speed limit” affected the cyclist in a negative way. As he continued to ride further and further, his negative thoughts grew more and more prominent, and he was filled with a great deal of doubt. The cyclist lacked confidence and constantly worried that he wouldn't make it to his destination. For example, when the cyclist realized there was nothing in sight, his tone immediately changed. “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. I began breaking the ride down into distances I could see on the horizon, telling myself that if I could make it that far, I’d be fine.” He clearly seemed unsure of himself and a bit nervous. As the long - drawn - out journey continued, it seemed that the cyclist was losing all hope. “It didn't really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean, leaving only some expensive outdoor gear and a diary.” The more he rode in the desolate middle of nowhere, with only “Rough Road Ahead” signs to be seen, the less likely he thought he was to finish this arduous journey. In conclusion, the harsh setting took a heavy toll on the cyclist's mental state and his belief in his ability to complete the ride.
192	6170	3	3	The features in the setting are very effective in influencing the cyclist. He finds himself in a vast desert area of California, where the sun beats down relentlessly. He has a severely limited water supply, with just a meager amount that can barely quench his thirst. It is extremely hot and dry, and the air is thick with the heat. He has to cover a long distance in this hot and humid weather, which is extremely taxing on his body. The deficiency of water puts him at a high risk of becoming dehydrated, as his body loses fluids rapidly through sweating. Another major obstacle that he encounters during this biking trip to Yosemite National Park is the series of hills that he has to face. At the start of his journey, he was on flat terrain, which was relatively easy to pedal on. But now, these steep hills require him to put in a lot more effort to pedal up, making the ride a lot harder. One other unexpected obstacle that he faced was running into a snake on the way. That setting presented numerous challenges for this cyclist. If it wasn't for the intense heat and the lack of water, he might have been able to make it through the journey a little more easily. In conclusion, the harsh setting with its various obstacles made the cyclist's trip to Yosemite a very difficult one.
193	6171	3	3	The features of the setting strongly affected the cyclist. The long and crippling rolling hills were the cyclist's most challenging problem. These hills seemed to stretch on endlessly, and maneuvering down them would demand a great deal of energy and unwavering determination from the cyclist. Considering that the cyclist was already exhausted and sweating profusely from riding on the rough roads and having the scare of passing a large snake, riding on these rolling hills would be an extremely tough task. The features of the setting were not conducive to the cyclist's well - being. The difficulty of the terrain was causing the cyclist to lose a large amount of fluids, leading to dehydration, and there was a real risk of him dropping from heatstroke. However, the cyclist maintained a positive attitude and refused to give up. His strong determination saved him, and he felt a great sense of relief when he finally came across the “Gary and Wilbells fish camp.” In conclusion, the features of the setting affected the cyclist because they forced him to work extra hard and put forth more effort. But it is evident that with determination, one can overcome even the most difficult of challenges and accomplish anything!
194	6172	3	3	The features of the setting significantly affect the cyclist in the short story “Do not exceed posted speed limit.” The cyclist's mood appears to change in tandem with the changing road and setting. The narration states, “A large highway sign jumped out at me. I read: Rough road ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit … sometimes life can feel so cruel (Kurmaskie).” As the terrain gradually becomes more and more difficult, the cyclist's spirits sink lower and lower. Every time he thinks he is approaching a town and gets excited, his hopes are quickly dashed. One can clearly observe in the picture the tough cycling terrain that takes a toll on the cyclist. The lack of water and the growing sense of hopelessness make him tired as he loses energy. He starts to believe that he will die in this desolate place. In conclusion, the harsh setting in the story plays a crucial role in shaping the cyclist's emotional state and his perception of the journey.
195	6173	3	3	Some features of the setting that affected the cyclist were the signs that displayed speed limits. These signs directly influenced the speed at which the cyclist could ride. When he saw a sign with a lower speed limit, he had to slow down, which disrupted his rhythm and made the ride less efficient. Another significant feature was a large hill on the route. As he pedaled up this steep hill, he could feel the strain on his muscles. He said, “I wipe the sweat from my eyes,” clearly indicating that the hill was making him tired. The incline required him to use more energy, and his body was working hard to overcome the resistance. In conclusion, these features of the setting, the speed - limit signs and the hill, had a notable impact on the cyclist's ride, making it more difficult and tiring.
196	6174	3	3	The setting had a huge impact on the cyclist. One significant impact was the severe lack of water in the arid desert area he was traversing. The parched landscape offered no respite in terms of water sources. Also, the desolate nature of the area, with hardly any people around, didn't help the cyclist out at all. There was no one to offer assistance or even a bit of moral support. The steep hills on the road made it even tougher on the cyclist because they drained what little energy he had left. With each pedal up the incline, his legs burned with exhaustion. Also, the intense sun beating down on him made his body increasingly warm, causing him to feel dizzy and making it harder for him to focus on what he was trying to do. In the end, the harsh setting tested his limits, but his determination kept him going.
197	6175	3	3	In the setting of “Rough road ahead: do not exceed posted speed limit,” the cyclist is greatly affected. In the beginning, the author is enjoying a peaceful and scenic campground outside Lodi, California. As he relaxes, a group of “old - timers” approach and offer directions. From his point of view, “they'd sounded so sure of themselves when pointing off at landmarks and spouting off towns I would come to along this breezy route.” So, the cyclist, trusting their confidence, used that information. Unfortunately, it was not for the better. Instead of a smooth journey, he found himself facing unforeseen challenges due to the inaccurate directions.
198	6176	3	3	How the features of the setting affect the cyclist becomes evident when the old guy asked him, “Do you know where to go?” And the other guy replied, “Yes sir! I own a very good map.” So, how did it change for the man riding the bike? As he pedaled along, he saw all those towns and a prominent sign that said “Rough Road ahead.” The cyclist, being a determined sort, would always stick to the path ahead. What had changed was that he passed by all those buildings and towns, just continuously moving forward. He was in a sort of trance, pedaling on and on. I think he might stick with the future, perhaps hoping that the journey ahead would be more rewarding.
199	6177	3	3	In the story, the cyclist faced many problems. One of the biggest problems was the terrain that he had to maneuver through. The terrain was extremely hilly, with steep inclines that made going up a hill on a bike incredibly tiring. It wore him out much faster than cycling on flat land would have, and it made him use a great deal more energy. Each pedal stroke up the hill was a struggle. The heat was also unbearable, with the sun's rays baking down on him. This made it harder for him to focus, as the intense heat made him feel lethargic. The cyclist did everything he could to stay conscious while maneuvering through the rough terrain and the deserted landscape. It was a huge desert of rolling mountains, and as he pushed forward, he found no civilization anywhere to get a refill of water. For example, if the terrain wasn't as hilly, it would have made it easier for him, using less energy and putting less strain on his legs. The heat of the desert beating down on him probably slowed his progress as well. Heat will make you move slower, and a cyclist moving down a barren road with no shade will make the journey seem longer and almost impossible. In the end, his will and determination got him through the harsh landscape, so he could finally get the water he needed to finish his trip.
200	6178	3	3	In this essay, the features of the setting cause the cyclist to become irritated toward the old men. In this account, the old men give the cyclist directions, and instead of relying on a map, he naively takes their advice. However, their information is out - of - date. They send him through a route filled with rolling hills and bumpy roads. The cyclist has to use all of his energy to reach unknown towns that turn out to be of no real importance and, to make matters worse, there is no water available. The cyclist blames the old men for giving him directions that wasted his precious energy. However, he should really blame himself for taking their advice without consulting a credited map for real and accurate directions. By relying on the old men's words, he put himself in a difficult situation, but hopefully, he'll learn from this experience for future travels.
201	6179	3	3	The setting of where you are riding has a great deal to do with the cyclist. In my own opinion, I firmly believe that the setting is the most crucial part as it can directly influence the cyclist's experience and mood. A pleasant setting can uplift the cyclist's spirits, while an unpleasant one can make the ride a real struggle.
202	6180	3	3	In the short story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting greatly affects the cyclist and his mindset. When the scenery is pretty and cheery, filled with the gentle glow of an early - summer evening, he is happy as well. This is clearly shown when the author writes, “denyoved the serenity of an early - summer - evening.” This quote vividly describes the scenery as a serene or peaceful place. His happiness is evident in the first part of the quote when he said, “denyoyed.” One does not enjoy something unless they are happy or in a cheery mindset. Therefore, the peaceful scenery affected the cyclist by making him happy. The same can be said for dreary scenery too. This is found when the author says, “At some point, tumble weeds crossed my path and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke.” This quote describes the scenery as a place with tumbleweeds. Stereotypically, tumbleweeds are found in dreary and lonely places. This lonely scenery takes its toll on the cyclist. He becomes pessimistic and is thinking of all that could go wrong, not all that could get better. This is a phenomenon we see around us every day. The poor and homeless who live with a low standard of living are often sad. Just like the setting affected the cyclist, their living conditions impact their state of mind. In conclusion, the setting does affect the cyclist and his mindset drastically, highlighting the powerful influence of the environment on one's mental state.
203	6181	3	3	The features of the setting have a significant impact on the cyclist because the setting changed so drastically. The initially flat, wide - open road unexpectedly turned into “short, rolling hills.” Since he was already running out of water, it became much harder for him to muster the will power and determination to go up and down these hills. His determination started to fade as he started to see wide open lands with nothing but “tumbleweeds and ridiculously large snakes.” The sight of these desolate elements made the situation seem even more hopeless. He felt like he was going to dehydrate because the sun was beating down relentlessly and he had no water left. In a desperate attempt to moisten his dry mouth, he used pebbles that he had found to put in his mouth to help circulate the saliva he had. At one point, he even wishes that he would choke on one because he feels so useless. This shows just how much the changing setting had broken his spirit.
204	6182	3	3	In the story, “Do not exceed posted speed limit,” by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist faces many hardships on his way to Yosemite due to the features of the setting. The fact that it was a sweltering hot summer’s day significantly contributed to his hardships. With little water, it was extremely easy for him to get dehydrated. In the text, the author writes, “I could drop from heat stroke, on a gorgeous day in June.” (Kurmaskie, @NUM1). This clearly lets the reader know that the intense heat of June was very dangerous to the cyclist. There was also nobody around except “Old timers who haven’t left the confines of their perches since water was in offing” (Kurmaskie, @NUM2). The narrator stresses his viewpoint on taking directions from these people since their directions are quite poor. It can easily be inferred that he meant they were obviously out of date when giving directions since the ones they gave him were not correct. The cyclist in this story had a rough and arduous time getting to his destination due to the unforgiving setting, which truly tested his endurance and resolve.
205	6183	3	3	The terrain in “Do not exceed posted speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie presented the cyclist with many difficulties. He was already lacking water from the arduous journey, and then the environment turned against him. The narration states, “I noticed the terrain changing; a flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). This means that the cyclist is going to have to put forth a great deal more energy to make it up these hills. Energy he barely has at this point. This will drain almost all the energy the cyclist has, leaving him exhausted. Another example is, “At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). This means that the cyclist is in the middle of nowhere, surrounded by desolation, with barely any water and energy, causing even more problems. In conclusion, the setting in “Do not exceed posted speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie caused many problems for the cyclist, making his journey a real challenge that tested his limits.
206	6184	3	3	In the story “Rough road ahead,” the detailed setting significantly affects the cyclist. The cyclist faces challenges due to the lack of water, the long distance he has to travel, and the hilly terrain. “The water bottles contain only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt,” this statement clearly shows how he was out of water, exhausted, and overheated. The harsh setting affected the cyclist a great deal in the story, making his journey extremely arduous.
207	6185	3	3	The cyclist has it extremely hard in the given conditions. The lack of water, the intense heat, and the rough terrain are all factors that made his ride much harder. First, the lack of water took a heavy toll on the amount of energy he had to keep going. His body was parched, and every pedal stroke became a struggle. Second, the heat also severely affected his trip. It made it incredibly hard for him to keep going; he even thought he would die, imagining the birds would peck at his dead body. Last, the terrain didn't help at all. The trip had many steep hills, and climbing them used up a lot of energy, thus making it even more difficult. In conclusion, those are the things that worked against the cyclist, making his cycling experience a true test of endurance.
208	6186	3	3	In this, I will tell you precisely how the cyclist was being affected. One way is that the intense heat caused him to drink more water than he had planned, and then he quickly ran out of water. His throat was dry, and his energy levels were dropping. The next way is the misleading old guys who gave him bad directions. This made him waste time and energy going in the wrong direction. Another way was the long distance and the bad terrain, which constantly slowed him down. The rough ground and the uphill slopes were a constant challenge. The last reason is the snake that suddenly appeared on the path and slowed him down as he had to stop and avoid it. All these factors combined made the cyclist's journey a very difficult one.
209	6187	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in numerous ways. He was riding his bike across a desolate place with no cars passing by, no people in sight, no available water sources, or no food to be found. It was a truly dangerous journey for him as he had to face the elements and the isolation alone. But despite all the difficulties, he made it through, showing great determination and resilience.
210	6188	3	3	The features of the setting do indeed affect the cyclist. One example is the condition of his jar. If the jar was damaged or leaking, it could lead to the loss of his precious water supply. This would then make him more vulnerable to dehydration during his ride. The state of the jar, as a part of the overall setting, can have a significant impact on the cyclist's journey, either facilitating or hindering his progress.
211	6189	3	3	The features of the setting can significantly affect the cyclist. For instance, imagine a scenario where the surroundings are completely empty, with no cars, buildings, water, or people in sight. This kind of desolate setting might make you want to go faster and unleash your inner speed demon. That’s all I can really tell you. Because personally, I don’t think the setting of where you ride your bike actually matters. Possibly for a professional bicyclist, it can have an impact, but to me, I just don’t think so. In conclusion, while some might believe the setting plays a role, I remain unconvinced of its real significance for the average cyclist.
212	6190	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in numerous ways. There are no cars, buildings, water, or people visible anywhere. The terrain changes from a flat road to rolling hills, presenting a more challenging ride. Even though he had no water, he was determined to keep pedeling. A sign reads “Rough road Ahead, do not exceed posted speed limit”. At this point, he had no water left and was pretty much in the middle of nowhere. If I was in his situation, I would feel utterly hopeless as there was no sign of hope. All he could see were endless rolling hills. Then, when he saw a building over the hills, he thought he was home free. So he pedaled up to the building, only to find that it, along with all the others in the area, was abandoned. The cyclist thought he was going to die. In conclusion, the features of the setting greatly affected the cyclist because the sight of nothingness gave him no hope. If there had been cars and buildings on both sides of him, that probably would have given him some confidence, but that was not the case. He was stuck in the middle of nowhere. Finally, he came to a bend and said, “Then, as easily as rounding a bend my troubles, thirst, and fear were all behind me.” This shows how the setting can both torment and then relieve the cyclist.
213	6191	3	3	There are many features of the setting that affect the cyclist. His dehydration started when the scorching sun beat down on him, intensifying his thirst for water. He was particularly affected when he was out of water and rode by an abandoned Welch’s grape juice factory. “A sand - blasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen. I hung my head.” Then, when he had almost nothing left in terms of energy and hope, he spotted a bait shop. “Somehow I climbed away from the abandoned factory of juices and dreams, slowly gaining elevation while losing hope.” Then, as easily as rounding a bend, his troubles, thirst, and fear were all behind him. It was when he saw “Gary and [Name] Fish camp – If you want bait for the big ones, we’re your best bet”, thus revealing his troubles were over. In conclusion, the various elements of the setting, from the sun to the abandoned factory and the eventual sight of the fish camp, had a profound impact on the cyclist’s experience.
214	6192	3	3	The features of the setting that the author cycled through definitely affect not only his mood but also his physical condition. To start, it is mentioned that he is in “the high deserts of California in June”. From this, it is clearly implied that the weather is extremely hot, causing the author to sweat profusely as he bikes along. Next, there is a significant change in terrain, and he soon approaches “rolling hills” which are much more difficult to bike on, requiring more effort and energy. Finally, the author sees a sign that reads “ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT”. He becomes discouraged because his bike is not even capable of reaching the speed limit, yet he still has to manage getting past the rough road. After passing this road, he approaches a picture of a boy drinking juice that is posted on a juice factory. Seeing this sign most likely exacerbates his thirst and leaves him more exhausted and frustrated than before. Such features of his surroundings played a large part in the author’s change in mood. In conclusion, the setting, with its hot weather, difficult terrain, and teasing signs, had a substantial negative impact on the cyclist’s well - being.
215	6193	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist greatly. First, the beating sun is a major factor. The intense heat dehydrates him and almost takes his life. The sun’s rays are relentless, sapping his energy and making every pedal stroke a struggle. The rocky road is also a significant factor. Navigating the rough surface takes up a great deal of the time and energy he has to perform. Each bump and jolt on the rocky road slows him down and wears him out. Another key ingredient of the setting was the desert. In the vast expanse of the desert, there was no one to help him, and there wasn’t a place to get water. He was completely isolated and at the mercy of the harsh environment. In conclusion, the setting, with its scorching sun, rocky roads, and desolate desert, was a big factor in the story as it tested the cyclist’s limits and survival instincts.
216	6194	3	3	The setting affects the biker in numerous ways. For one, he is riding through the vast high deserts of California during the sweltering month of June. It is naturally hot in the summer, but in the arid desert, the heat is twice as intense. This extreme heat means he will dehydrate at a much quicker pace, and thus will need a significant amount of water. The only water the biker can find is from an old, rusty pump, but he couldn't drink it since it was scalding hot and had a truly nasty taste. “When I tried a drop it had the flavor of battery acid” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). His route was completely deserted, so there was absolutely nobody who could come to his aid. Also, the terrain was extremely bad. The steep hills caused him to exert far more of his energy, which he desperately needed to stay alive. “the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke caused me to laugh,” (@NUM1). He also encountered dangerous animals like the menacing diamond black rattlesnake. The setting also affected him mentally because he was silently berating himself since he took directions from a couple of old men. He knew he should have taken the right way, instead of trying a short - cut that he now realizes is abandoned and perilous. The biker is being affected in many ways, both mentally and physically, making his journey an extremely challenging one.
217	6195	3	3	The setting causes major problems for the cyclist in the essay, “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” The cyclist was faced with a vast, barren desert, traveling in extremely humid and sweltering temperatures with no access to water. He encounters venomous poisonous snakes and areas where there are no buildings or any signs of civilization all together. The effect on him was the main conflict of the essay. He had no water during some stretches of the trip and lost all hope. He told himself that it was no use. In the story it says, “It didn’t really matter. I was going to die…” The extreme measures of the setting caused the cyclist to lose control, even putting stones in his mouth to try and stop thinking about his intense thirst. Overall, the harsh setting caused the cyclist major problems, both physically, as he suffered from dehydration and exhaustion, and mentally, as he battled despair and hopelessness.
218	6196	3	3	The ways that the setting of the place can affect the cyclist are how the road is shaped, such as riding up steep hills and the roughness of the road surface. There was a weather - beaten sign where it said “rough road ahead: do not exceed posted speed limit.” That sign was crucial because if he didn't see it, he might have gone over the speed limit or not known what speed he was supposed to maintain as a cyclist and could have gotten seriously hurt. The road was primarily made for cars, so adhering to the speed limit is quite difficult for a cyclist. This shows how the setting, in the form of the road and its signage, can have a significant impact on the cyclist's safety and journey.
219	6197	3	3	In the story, “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting affects the cyclist. One setting that affected him was the first setting. In this setting, under the blazing sun, he used up his water supply and it was oppressively hot. This affected the cyclist because he was starting to feel extremely dehydrated and began to think he was going to die. The text shows this when it said “I could drop from heat stroke.” Later, when the cyclist came to an abandoned juice factory, he couldn't help but think about how incredibly thirsty he was. This affected him because usually when you think about thirst, you become even thirstier. This also made him deeply disappointed. The final setting affected him because he had finally managed to get water and was no longer thirsty. That is how the different settings affected the cyclist, altering his physical state and emotional well - being throughout the journey.
220	6198	3	3	On that long and arduous bike ride, the cyclist was affected by the setting in multiple ways. He was affected by the lack of water, the scorching heat, and the bad directions. Throughout the story, the cyclist ran out of water due to bad directions from some old men. “Trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.” He ran out of water and became severely dehydrated during his trip. The intense heat played a major part in his dehydration during the bike ride. “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” I have been to California and I know it can be extremely hot. The trip was made even longer due to some bad directions from some old men. “Because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn't been off their porch in decades, caused me to laugh.” The gentlemen gave him wrong directions because in their time that was the correct information. But now the land has changed and the directions were completely wrong. When going on bike rides, the setting of the rides can be a great help or a terrible hindrance. The cyclist experienced firsthand how the setting of a bike ride can affect him a great deal, making his journey a struggle filled with challenges.
221	6199	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist very much. For example, the intense sun was beginning to beat down relentlessly. Another example, I was hitting my water bottles pretty regularly to quench my thirst. The setting was hot and dry, with the heat making the air feel thick. It affected the cyclist very much. It was to the point where it felt like he was on the verge of dying, but somehow he kept going.
222	6200	3	3	The cyclist in this essay was a very brave man. He had many obstacles in his long and arduous journey but he still made it. Nature was most definitely not on his side that day. He had to ride his bike up and down steep hills several times, which wears you out very quickly. Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills that seemed never - ending. After he got through the hills, he came to a sign that read “ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT”. Now he has to go through bumpy roads that jolted him with every turn. At some point, tumbleweeds crossed his path and a ridiculously large snake - it really did look like a diamondback - blocked the majority of the pavement in front of him. Now the poor guy had to deal with snakes bigger than him! Thankfully he got by the snake, alive. Over one long, crippling hill, a building came into view. The man thinks he found someplace to get water, but it's an abandoned building that, by the looks of it, had once been a Welch’s grape Juice Factory and bottling plant. Despite all these hardships, his determination saw him through to the end.
223	6201	3	3	The setting affects the cyclist because it is extremely hot, and the scorching heat makes the air shimmer. Therefore, he gets thirsty as his body tries to cool down. When he says “the sun was beating on me” this clearly shows it was hot, with the sun's rays like a furnace on his back. That's one of the reasons why he was tired and dehydrated, as the heat sapped his energy and fluids. In such a setting, it was a real struggle for the cyclist to keep going.
224	6202	3	3	The feature of the setting affects the cyclist as old - timers gave him wrong information about taking this short - cut he was going to take. He set off with high hopes, only to find the path was much more difficult than expected. Running out of water and energy, his body was weakening with every pedal stroke. He was doubting himself and on the verge of giving up on the race. As he struggled on, the wrong advice from the old - timers seemed to haunt him, but he still had a glimmer of hope deep inside that he could somehow finish.
225	6203	3	3	"In the piece, ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" the features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. The cyclist felt black humor, despair and then relief due to the features of the setting. The cyclist felt black humor, due to the features. This was because it was very ironic where he was. It was a hot, barren desert and he desperately needed something to drink. He passes a closed juice factory that stood there like a cruel joke. This sparked his black humor as he thought about the irony of the situation. The cyclist felt despair due to the features. This was because as far as he could see, ""There was no one in sight, not a building, car, structure of any kind."" This gave him the feeling there was no chance he could survive. The vast emptiness around him made him despair. The cyclist felt relief later on due to the features. He eventually got to a bait shop that seemed like an oasis in the desert. When he was there, alive and able to get some supplies, so he felt relief. As the author says, ""Then as easily as... hobbles, thirst and fear were all behind me."" In this piece, the features determined how the cyclist felt throughout his challenging journey."
226	6204	3	3	In the essay “Do not exceed posted speed limit” by @PERSON1, many features of the desolate setting significantly affect the cyclist. First, when he pedaled into the first “town,” the once - perhaps - bustling place now stood as a silent relic. He mused, “This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time – say, before the last world war.” This deserted ghost town, with its crumbling buildings and overgrown streets, was like a dark joke. Yet, at the start of the day, with a decent water supply in his bottles, it had only a minor impact on his spirits. However, when he reached the ramshackle shed surrounded by several rusty pumps, the effect was far from mild. He uttered, “The sight was troubling,” as the dilapidated structure loomed against the harsh sky. Then, as he got on his hands and knees, desperately working the pump, hope faded. All that trickled out was a drop or two of water that tasted like battery acid, leaving a bitter taste in his mouth and despair in his heart. Lastly, after cycling several miles under the scorching sun, he arrived at an abandoned Welch’s Grape juice factory. With his water supply running dangerously low and having faced disappointment after disappointment, this desolate factory had a very wearing effect on him. The setting in this essay seemed utterly abandoned and hopeless. It was only the cyclist's unwavering determination that got him through this arduous journey.
227	6205	3	3	The story “Do not exceed posted speed limit” is about a cyclist who received bad directions to Yosemite National Park. In the extreme heat, his water supply is steadily depleting. Drops of sweat roll down his face as he pedals on, his throat parched and his lips chapped. He is constantly doubtful that he will complete his journey. The dehydration has made him dizzy, and every turn of the pedals feels like a Herculean task. With each passing mile, his hope fades a little more, but he still clings to the faint possibility of reaching his destination. Despite the overwhelming odds, he keeps going, driven by a glimmer of hope in the face of this difficult situation.
228	6206	3	3	The setting in this story is of utmost importance because without a well - defined setting, the narrative would not make sense. A setting is something that can be crafted by anyone, and it can take on any form or be located anywhere. It serves as the backdrop that helps piece the whole story back together, much like the frame of a painting that holds all the colors in place. In this story, the setting is @LOCATION1, where the protagonist is spending quality time with his family. The warm atmosphere, the shared laughter, and the familiar surroundings all contribute to the story's emotional depth. Setting is a very important part in a movie or video as it sets the mood, creates context, and makes the audience feel like they are a part of the story. Without it, the story would lack the richness and authenticity that draws viewers in.
229	6207	3	3	The way I would set my affected cyclist is by having him ride through a landscape that is both intimidating and unexpected. He pedals through a thick, fog - filled forest where the gnarled trees seem to reach out and grab at his clothes. The ground is uneven, filled with roots and rocks that jolt his bike with every turn of the wheels. It's something you would never think he could set through, a challenge that tests his mettle. But through sheer willpower and determination, he overcomes his initial hesitation. With each pedal stroke, he gets closer to breaking through the dense forest and emerging into the open. His perseverance pays off as he finally rides out of the forest, having conquered the seemingly insurmountable obstacle.
230	6208	3	3	The features of the setting in, “Rough Road Ahead” have a profound impact on the cyclist. The cyclist began his journey at a campground, chatting with some old - timers. He asked them how to get to Yosemite, and they pointed him towards a supposed shortcut, which unfortunately turned out to be out of date. As he cycled on the road to Yosemite, the landscape was a desolate expanse. All he saw were abandoned towns, their empty buildings standing like silent sentinels in the desert. He was extremely thirsty, and there was not a drop of water in sight. In his desperation, he thought he was going to die and uttered, “I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.” It was a sweltering hot summer day. Tumbleweeds rolled across the parched road, and snakes slithered nearby, their presence adding to his discomfort. The heat made him feel hotter and more thirsty than he would be if it were cooler and if there was a big, flowing river by the road. But in California, it was hot and dry, with a desert - like setting. Being in the middle of nowhere, with no relief in sight, made him feel like he was on the brink of death. Clearly, the setting had a significant and life - altering effect on the cyclist.
231	6209	3	3	This cyclist had to contend with the challenging conditions of the land. He didn't have an ample supply of water with him, and as far as he could see, there wasn't a reliable water source nearby. He knew he just had to keep pushing forward. He also mentioned how the road was rough and uneven. This rough terrain conflicted with the time it took him to reach the next place with water. Moreover, he was in a desolate desert area. The air was extremely dry and hot; the sweltering heat made him sweat profusely, which in turn led him to become dehydrated. Despite these hardships, he kept going, driven by the hope of finding water soon.
232	6210	3	3	In the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the features of the setting significantly affect the cyclist. They have a profound impact on the cyclist's confidence and hope. I say this because throughout the story, he encounters things that would concern most people. For instance, the towns that were supposed to be bustling end up being “Ghost towns,” and the road changes from flat stretches to hilly terrains. Yet, he continues on his journey. Then he says, “what I believed was my last burst of energy,” and “I was going to die.” The cyclist doubts his ability to continue but manages to persevere, hoping that over the next horizon, he'll see a building or some sign of civilization. Hope truly saved his life because if he had given in to the thought that he couldn't continue, he might have perished.
233	6211	3	3	The features of the setting have a notable impact on the cyclist. One reason the features of the setting affect him is because it is swelteringly hot outside, which makes him need more water to stay hydrated. An example of this is “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” Another clear example of the intense heat outside is “A tarlike substance oozed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.” This extreme heat forces the cyclist to consume more water, highlighting how the setting directly affects his physical needs.
234	6212	3	3	In the short story “Rough Road Ahead,” a cyclist is pushed through an extremely harsh setting as he tries to reach Yosemite National Park. In the story, the narrator takes a trip to Yosemite National Park after getting directions from two older men. What the narrator doesn't know is that the road ahead is indeed rough and full of challenges. One narrator states “I eased past trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.” The narrator is really taking a severe beating from the arduous travel. The rocky, dry climate is really taking a toll on him. From reading this story, the setting does not do any good for him other than the small general store he finds in the end. Like the title states, the setting of this story was truly a “Rough Road Ahead,” filled with difficulties that tested the cyclist to his limits.
235	6213	3	3	The setting affects the cyclist's features because if the cyclist was riding in a more temperate location around June, the impact might not have been that harsh. However, overall, starting out in a hot place with limited water was not a good situation. The intense heat and lack of water put a great strain on the cyclist's body and endurance. That's how the cyclist is affected by the setting, as the unfavorable environmental conditions make his journey much more difficult and dangerous.
236	6214	3	3	Being a cyclist and in the exhausted condition he was in would be even more unbearable in the specific setting he found himself in. The intense heat of California, with the sun beating down relentlessly, combined with the difficult condition of the rugged path he was on, made the situation extremely tough. Him being so hot and fatigued from the arduous hilly trail would be exacerbated by the lack of a sufficient supply of water. The author was severely dehydrated and on the verge of fainting. If it were not so swelteringly hot, the cyclist would have been in a much better physical and mental condition. In such a situation, the heat was truly the cyclist's worst enemy, making every pedal stroke a struggle.
237	6215	3	3	The cyclist in the article had a harrowing experience as he almost died from dehydration and heat stroke in the unforgiving desert. Despite this life - threatening misadventure, he wrote about it in a light - hearted, humourous way. I truly commend him for having the courage to laugh about an incident where he came so close to death and then turning around and playfully blaming it on old people. He serves as an inspiration for reckless young folk who often take risks without fully considering the consequences. Oh yeah, and the setting being a vast, scorching desert only added to the extremity of his ordeal. His ability to find humor in such a dire situation is truly remarkable.
238	6216	3	3	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”, the time setting very much affects the cyclist during the story. One of the things that affect him during the story is that it was an extremely hot, sun - scorching day. The blistering sun beat down on him without mercy, sapping his energy. Also, he ran out of water and there was nothing but vast stretches of desert and the ever - present threat of poisonous snakes around. Another thing is that when he ran out of water, there were no water sources in sight, just endless desert. So he started to become very thirsty, his throat parched and his body craving moisture. In the essay, it also said he reached a part where he saw a sign that said “Rough Road Ahead, Do not exceed posted speed limited”. The road conditions starting to get rough affected him as the uneven surface made cycling a real challenge. In the end of the essay, he reaches a camp where it is all peace and relaxed, and they have cold, refreshing water there. This affects him because he feels replenished, his body and spirit revived. All these different features of the setting affected the cyclist greatly, shaping his entire journey.
239	6217	3	3	The setting was clearly affecting the character, because as the day got hotter, the sun's rays became more intense and he got thirstier. The heat seemed to suck the moisture out of his body with each passing moment. Also, when he got to the sign about rough roads ahead, the realization of what lay ahead started to sink in. He started to get worried and kinda paranoid, imagining all the difficulties the rough road might bring. The thought of navigating through bumpy and uneven terrain made his heart race. So, that's how the setting, with its combination of heat and the warning of rough roads, affected him, both physically and mentally. The setting truly set the tone for a challenging and anxiety - filled part of his journey.
240	6218	3	3	There was a number of things that affected the cyclists during his travel. First off, at the old town, there was no real potable water he could drink. The water sources available were either contaminated or scarce. So he was out of water and was going to be thirsty, his body already starting to feel the effects of dehydration. Also, it's the middle of June in California, and it's very hot. The high temperatures and the intense sunlight were going to wear him out pretty quickly, making each pedal stroke more difficult. Another thing that affected the cyclist is the steep hills he has to go up and down. For example, he says “Over one long, crippling hill”. He's clearly stating that the hills are very hard for him, sapping his strength and testing his endurance. Those are the features that affected the cyclist in the story, making his journey a real test of his physical and mental capabilities.
241	6219	3	3	The setting of this essay was the California desert in June. The vast expanse of the desert in this month presented a harsh environment. If any of the setting features affected the cyclist (which they all did), this had the biggest impact. In the fifth paragraph, the reader learns that the author was “travelling through the high deserts of California in June.” My prior knowledge tells me that California is generally always a very hot place, especially in the desert in June, the hottest month of the year. The searing heat would have greatly affected the cyclist. He was riding for over fifty miles through the California desert with a limited supply of water. The scorching sun and dry air constantly sapped his body of moisture. This put him at a great risk for dehydration, which he tells the reader he reaches in the last line of paragraph ten. This terrain and the extremely hot conditions would make the cyclist very tired and dehydrated, making his journey to @CAPS1 @ORGANIZATION1 all the more difficult. In such circumstances, every pedal stroke became a struggle, and his goal seemed ever more distant.
242	6220	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. Like he was in a vast desert, with no one around to give him good information. There were no towns close by that were still running. It was a sweltering hot summer day, and there was no water nearby. These factors affected the cyclist because they made him not just sweaty but also left him with a dry mouth and no energy. He was having a lot of doubt that he was not going to make his journey alive. In the story, the cyclist said, “I picked up some pebbles and put them in my mouth. With my lurch, I'd hit a bump and lodge one in my throat. It didn't really matter. I was going to die.” When he said that, he showed a great deal of doubt. Every time he got to a town or building, it was abandoned. He saw an abandoned building which was ironically a Welch's Grape Juice factory and bottling plant. The sight of that factory, usually associated with refreshment, made him even more thirstier. That's how the features affected the cyclist, making his already difficult journey seem almost impossible.
243	6221	3	3	The setting in the story greatly affected the cyclist. The main setting was that he was riding his bike in the desert. The desert is really hot, with the sun beating down relentlessly. So he needed more water than he would have if he were riding in the woods or if there was snow. Also, there were hills on his travel that he had to ride his bike up. Climbing these hills took a significant amount of energy, so again he would have needed more water than if the road was flat. Finally, because of the terrain he was riding on, the animals he ran into, like a snake, could have hurt him. A snake's bite in the middle of the desert could have serious consequences. Because the setting of the story was in the desert, the cyclist was affected more than he had thought he would be. The combination of heat, difficult terrain, and potential animal threats made his journey a real challenge.
244	6222	3	3	In this paragraph, I will be explaining some features of the setting that affected the cyclist. One effect was the uneven, bumpy roads he was trying to cycle on. These roads were full of irregularities. If it was flat, he wouldn't have to really be more aware. But with bumpy roads, he has to look out for rocks scattered on the road and holes in the road that could cause him to lose control of his bike. Another effect are the hills. He had to put out more energy than if the hills were just flat. Pushing his bike up those inclines required extra strength and effort. Those are some reasons that explain the features of the setting that affect the cyclist. These factors combined made his cycling journey a strenuous and difficult one.
245	6223	3	3	Some features of the setting affect the cyclist on his journey to Yosemite. Starting off, an old man who hadn't seen the changes this world made for about a decade gave the cyclist a bad start. The so - called shortcut information he provided led the cyclist astray. If the cyclist wouldn't have gotten the shortcut information, he wouldn't have been without water in abandoned towns. When the cyclist arrives at some rusty pumps, he decided to check it out and see if there is any water. He eagerly pumped the handle, but the water that came out was really not fit for drinking and it tasted like battery acid. The cyclist decided to keep going, even though he was running out of water. His determination was tested as his water supply dwindled. When he came to a snake in the road, he had to get by in his “dehydrated state.” I would imagine this would be dangerous if you couldn't focus well on the road. A moment of inattention could lead to a serious accident. He then came upon @ORGANIZATION1 that was old and abandoned. He obviously couldn't get any water there seeing as how bad of condition the building was. When the cyclist had no water, he became dehydrated and unfortunately there were no stops for water on his journey that day to Yosemite. This lack of water made his journey a perilous one, and reaching his destination seemed like an uphill battle.
246	6224	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. It was like a crazy maze with winding roads and confusing turns. The road he was on was narrow and bumpy, and him not really knowing where he was going didn't help him at all. Moreover, not having enough water to quench his thirst in the hot sun made the situation even worse. This is how the features of the setting, including the complex road layout and lack of water, affect the cyclist.
247	6225	3	3	The cyclist's adventure was very much affected by his setting. It seemed as though the worse his setting became, the worse he personally felt. For example, when he hit the ghost town, with its dilapidated buildings and eerie silence, he just laughed, perhaps out of nervousness. Once he got to the fork in the road, he saw less of the once - existing civilization; the few remaining signs of human habitation were fading away. And he says, “This sight is troubling,”. Once he moves on, he gets more discouraged by the “Rough Road Ahead” sign, which foreshadows the difficult journey to come. It seems as though the more dehydrated he gets, the worse things became for him. The climate in the story also becomes increasingly difficult, with the sun beating down relentlessly. The land at first was flat and easy to ride, but as it got harder to bike on, with uneven terrain and loose gravel, the cyclist grew increasingly wary and delirious, but knew he had to keep going. The area in which the cyclist was in, with its changing landscapes and harsh conditions, had an enormous effect on him emotionally, ultimately shaping his experience of the adventure.
248	6226	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by putting him in a near - death situation. He said “sometimes life can be so cruel.” because he was running out of water, his throat parched and his body weakening. He was also running out of strength, his legs feeling like lead with each pedal stroke, and running out of patience as the endless desert stretched before him. Also, a snake “it really did look like a diamond back,” slithered across his path, and its venom could have killed him. He was in the desert, a desolate place where anything could happen, from sudden sandstorms to extreme heat. The setting of old men who didn't know anything, offering no useful advice, and the scorching heat could have killed the cyclist. The situation would have been different if it were anywhere else, where there might be water sources and more people to help. In this desert setting, the cyclist's life hung in the balance.
249	6227	3	3	The cyclist's problem in Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit by “@PERSON1” is dehydration and the California terrain is the cause. California is full of long deserts that can exceed @NUM1 degrees in summer. The sun beats down mercilessly on the vast expanse of sand, and the cyclist was exerting himself by pedaling through the hot desert air. With the high temperatures and physical exertion, dehydration was inevitable. In the story, the cyclist says “I could drop from a heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June” so the setting, with its sweltering deserts and lack of shade, is obviously a hazard to his well - being. This dangerous setting makes the cyclist's journey a real struggle for survival.
250	6228	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in a very serious way. The features cause him to consider that he might die soon, as well as present a variety of challenges to him. The setting takes place in the deserts of California, in early summer. There are no other people in there, no establishments, towns, etc. A particularly dangerous feature of the setting, in addition to it being in a desert in summer, is the desolation. For example, the author mentions the town that “might have been a thriving little spot at one time - sat, before the last world war”. The cyclist is given almost a sense of hopelessness as well as determination to survive as he runs out of water. His throat is dry, and his energy is waning. For example, he says “I was going to lie… slowly gaining elevation while losing hope”. The author makes the trip to a fishing camp and survives. He learns, because the setting is now lifeless and deserted, to not listen to old people who remember the current setting only as it was many decades earlier. Because the features of the setting nearly kill the cyclist, the cyclist learns a valuable lesson about the power of the environment and the importance of being prepared.
251	6229	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the author was not accustomed to such conditions. As she was riding her bike, there was no suitable place for her to stop and fill up her water bottle, which made her journey quite challenging. This lack of a water - filling spot due to the setting's features had a direct impact on her cycling experience.
252	6230	3	3	The road was completely deserted. There wasn't a single building, car, or house in sight. He was stuck right in the middle of nowhere, without any supplies of water or food. The presence of poisonous snakes and the scorching heat could easily make him collapse, leaving him in a very precarious situation.
253	6231	3	3	The cyclist on her trips sees a lot of features that would discourage her. She is riding in the high deserts of California in June, as (Kurmaskie) mentions. We all know deserts are extremely steaming hot and dry, especially during the month of June. She also encounters numerous hills (Kurmaskie). To make matters worse, she was travelling on these hills in the extreme heat. Though the cyclist goes through many perilous obstacles, she makes it to a camp. As she said, “I could see the horizon, telling myself that I could make it that far, I'd be fine.” (Kurmaskie) This shows the author's dedication and that if you don't give up, you will be fine, as perseverance can help overcome difficult situations.
254	6232	3	3	In the story, “Do not exceed posted speed limit,” the setting is an all - important factor. The author feels the need to vividly describe the path that the cyclist is following and the details of each place he stops. For example, he describes “one ramshackle shed… and a corral that couldn't hold the lamest mule…” and “The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite…” In a story such as this, the setting is of great importance, especially since it is so rapidly changing. The story itself would be of much different quality, likely of a lower quality, if the author never put emphasis on the areas that the cyclist rode past. This story would not be worth reading if the author were not as skilled a writer as he is, as the well - described setting adds a lot of value to the narrative.
255	6233	3	3	The setting of the cyclist was harsh. The weather was so intense that it was extremely difficult to be cycling vigorously all day. The extreme conditions in the setting made the cyclist's task arduous, but it also tested their endurance and determination.
256	6234	3	3	The features of setting can significantly affect cyclists. If you're a male cyclist, you need to be wary of falling off your bike or running out of water. When you maintain a fast pace without any water, you're at risk of getting dehydrated. In the essay, the cyclist ran out of water and thought he was going to die as he became dehydrated. Fortunately, he managed to find a place to get something to drink. Overall, cyclists should always be prepared for such situations to ensure a safe and enjoyable ride.
257	6235	3	3	"In the story ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"", the man's bike ride gets quite rough. Because he followed the old men's advice and took a shortcut, the once pleasant and enjoyable ride turned into a challenging and arduous journey. This shows that sometimes, taking advice without proper consideration can lead to unexpected difficulties."
258	6236	3	3	"The cyclist in the essay experiences different phases that are affected by the setting. At first, the cyclist is well - acquainted with his location and is brimming with excitement for his ride, eager to complete it. Then, he arrives at a ""ghost town"". Doubts start to creep into his mind about the advice the old men gave him. This desolate place has no water, which makes him feel extremely discouraged. When he passes the Grape juice factory, he seriously believes it's the end for him. However, his hope and enjoyment return after he spots the sign for the bait. Clearly, the cyclist's feelings and attitude change in tandem with the changing setting, highlighting the strong influence of the environment on his experience."
259	6237	3	3	"The features of setting affect the cyclist in multiple ways. Initially, when he sees the tall pines and the river, he is calm and relaxed. But upon seeing the abandoned ""@PERSON1’s Grape Juice"" factory, he becomes desperate and fears he will perish in the desert. A man travels to @ORGANIZATION1, where he meets ""old timers"" who offer him a ""shortcut"" to the park. He then sets off on his bike, taking this so - called ""shortcut"". As he travels, he starts to run out of water and begins to think he will die in the desert. The quote ""It dinít really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean."" reflects his despair as he realizes he has no water in the middle of the desert in June. This shows that the harsh desert setting makes him desperate for water. In conclusion, the setting has a profound impact on the cyclist's state of mind and survival concerns."
260	6238	3	3	The features of the setting can have a significant impact on the cyclist, either positively or negatively. It all depends on the specific conditions. For example, the cyclist might fall during the ride. In such a situation, it's important to consider whether he has a traveling first - aid kit. Having a first - aid kit can be crucial in providing immediate care if an accident occurs, ensuring the cyclist's safety to some extent.
261	6239	3	3	Setting is a very crucial element to the story “Rough Road Ahead, Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie. Kurmaskie encountered a harsh scenery featuring extremely high temperatures, a scarce low water supply, and wild animals roaming about. High temperatures, when combined with an inefficient supply of water, can lead to heatstroke, hyperthermia, dehydration, and in severe cases, even death. It is of utmost importance to always be well - prepared with enough food and water to sustain oneself, especially in a situation such as being lost. Dealing with wildlife can also pose a significant obstacle. You never know precisely how any wild animal is going to react to your presence, so you must be as cautious as possible around non - domesticated animals. In conclusion, the scenery and setting of a story can truly make all the difference in how interesting a story can be and how informative it is. For instance, if Kurmaskie had experienced mild weather with an abundance of food and water while riding through a flat small town in @LOCATION1, the story would not have been as captivating.
262	6240	3	3	The features of the setting greatly affect the cyclist in “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie. The setting impacts how fast, hard, and long the cyclist needs to pedal. For example, “…Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” The cyclist was going at a mere 12 mph, while the speed limit on that road was a whopping 55 mph. The cyclist started to lose hope after reading the sign, but his determination kept him going. Furthermore, it's not only the uneven land that adds pressure to the cyclist; the intense heat from the sun also takes a toll. For instance, the cyclist says, “… and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke…” The heat begins to affect the author's health and wear down his perseverance. In conclusion, the setting significantly affects the mental and physical strain the cyclist has to endure.
263	6241	3	3	This story was a great source of motivation for an older man, showing that he can still be healthy and feel like a teenager again. It vividly showed how much effort he put into achieving his goal and how he managed to survive. He pedaled for forty long miles, enduring the hardships of the journey, just to reach the same water source that the cyclist was headed for. It's an interesting story of perseverance and not giving up. In conclusion, it serves as an inspiring tale for anyone facing challenges in life.
264	6242	3	3	It affects cyclists because the condition of the route, whether it's the terrain like hilly or flat areas, or the weather such as strong winds or heavy rain, determines the pace at which they can cycle and even how fast they could travel overall. For example, a steep uphill slope will slow them down, while a tail - wind can increase their speed. In conclusion, the condition of the cycling environment has a direct impact on a cyclist's speed and pace.
265	6243	3	3	The features of the setting greatly affected the cyclist. For example, the cyclist was in California, a place known for its extremely hot climate, especially in the desert region during June. These environmental features made dehydration a much more likely and dangerous possibility. Another example can be found in paragraph ten. It explains how the rough, bumpy road, the tumbling tumbleweeds, and the sudden appearance of a large snake made it incredibly hard for the cyclist to keep his balance, and all this was compounded by the lack of water. Also, the essay describes a building with a poster of a small child happily drinking a refreshing glass of juice. This sight made the cyclist think more about water and he quickly became very thirsty. Although there were some positive effects of the setting on the cyclist. The small pebbles he found allowed him to keep his mouth slightly moist and not constantly dwell on his thirst. Also, the bait shop along the way provided him with an option to get something to drink, thus preventing him from dying of dehydration. In conclusion, the setting, with its mix of challenges and small opportunities, had a profound impact on the cyclist's journey.
266	6244	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One way it affects the cyclist is because of the weather condition. In the sweltering heat of the day, being that it is very hot outside, the cyclist rapidly loses fluids and does not have enough water to replenish what is lost. Another way it affects the cyclist is because of the condition alongside the road. For example, the tumbleweeds that roll across the path unexpectedly and the snakes lurking in the underbrush pose hazards. Being that there is little rainfall, most likely the desert is in the process of a drought, and as a result, the cyclist gets very dehydrated. I believe these are the reasons because it all makes a lot of sense and clearly affects the cyclist's journey.
267	6245	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example, the lack of water was the biggest thing. In the scorching heat of the high desert, without cool water, he had nothing to re - boost his energy. The intense heat made him fatigue quickly, and he would get tired out faster. Even if he does find water, it's hot, like when he says, “brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.” This shows how in “the high desert of June,” the water is all very hot. Even after he pumped the well for several minutes, the water still would not cool down as the hot desert had baked everything above and below ground. So when you go to get something liquid, which heats and cools faster than solids, it will be hot. Also, the rough road made it difficult for the cyclist to travel. We know the road is rough when he says, “large highway signs dumped out at me. It read ROUGH ROAD AHEAD DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT.” This also shows you could not go fast, further hampering the cyclist's progress.
268	6246	3	3	The cyclist is dehydrated. He has a lack of water for a significant distance before he realizes “that the old men would have been right, had he been riding,” before the last world war. As he pedals through the desolate landscape, any “town” he rides into is just a run - down, deserted, and abandoned piece of desert. He says, “It was a sad, hopeless, laugh, mind you, but at least I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself.” It was evident that he was getting more and more dehydrated, but was not quite ready to die. He still had enough energy to keep going, but “hope was fading.” Then all at once, after climbing a large hill, he gains all hope back. He sees “Gary and Wilber’s fish camp.” The rider is safe now. He stumbles into the modern - looking bathroom and drinks greedily from the sink. He is now safe, ready to ride again, and determined to avoid all men who haven’t moved from their front porches in years.
269	6247	3	3	The harsh setting in “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie made the journey for the cyclist more difficult due to the hot weather and the inconsistency of the pavement. The very hot June day was a major cause of the cyclist slowing down. “Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt and the growing realization that I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June.” This proves that the cyclist is very hot due to the summer heat, sapping his energy and making each pedal stroke a struggle. Another factor of the cyclist slowing down is the inconsistency of the pavement on the road. “Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.” The uneven surface and changing terrain prove that the road could be slowing the cyclist also. It seems the cyclist has a lot against him. But if he keeps his head up and perseveres, he can make it to “Yosemite.”
270	6248	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by the hotness of the deserts of California. In the blistering sun, the cyclist was sweating profusely and rapidly drinking his water bottles to stay hydrated. Also, when the cyclist saw the building in the distance, he thought he could rest and maybe get a ride to where he was going. However, upon closer inspection, the building was abandoned years earlier, so the cyclist couldn't stop and had to continue his arduous journey. These are some features of the setting that clearly affect the cyclist's experience and progress.
271	6249	3	3	Several features of the setting that affected the cyclist were the specific time of year, the vast desert land, the notable lack of civilization, the scarce availability of resources – especially water, and the rugged and challenging characteristics of the land. The cyclist was traveling during the peak of summer, which was undoubtedly the hottest time of the year. He was also traversing through the deserts, which create an even more sweltering climate. “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June,” was a quote from the selection that clearly tells us this. If he had been traveling in the cooler months, for example, he would have been more comfortable. Throughout his trip, the author never encounters any signs of desert civilization. He runs into a deserted factory and miles upon miles of land without a single person. The fact that he is traveling through desert terrain also clearly helps us realize that water is extremely scarce. He has great trouble finding a place to get water. This made the trip extra hard and incredibly discouraging. “I was going to die” he says in despair. As he travels farther, the land also becomes increasingly harder to travel on. “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills” – this characteristic of the setting, like the others, negatively affects the cyclist by making his already difficult journey even harder. In the end, these challenging settings tested his limits but also likely made his eventual journey more memorable.
272	6250	3	3	The cyclist's surroundings did indeed have an impact. In paragraph two, the cyclist vividly describes how “I enjoyed the serenity of an early - summer evening.” To have such a wonderful day to begin with was perhaps an assurance that everything would be fine. Confidence was boosted by the beautiful weather, and he also knew a short - cut, which added to his sense of ease. In paragraph three, the cyclist mentions how some old men looked at his map and pointed out “this breezy jaunt.” The cyclist just thought his life got a little easier at that moment. Then in paragraph five, the cyclist comes upon the “traditional definition of a ghost town.” This setting was nothing like what the old men were talking about. “Twenty miles up the road, I came to a fork of sorts.” In paragraph six, this caused significant confusion and worry. “This sight was troubling.” “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” The cyclist was “hitting my water bottles pretty regularly” due to the intense heat. This setting made the cyclist extremely uncomfortable, especially with the sweltering “two hundred degrees” heat. The cyclist then began to feel puzzled and distraught. “I noticed the terrain changing” – in this quote, the cyclist's settings clearly could have caused confusion. But in the end, despite all the challenges posed by the settings, the cyclist succeeded, showing his resilience.
273	6251	3	3	The features of the setting in Do Not Exceed Posted Speed limit by Joe Kurmaskie, significantly affect the cyclist because the cyclist is in a vast and desolate desert with no readily available water and is trying to find a town that is much further than he initially thinks. “I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.” This shows that the cyclist had very little confidence in this desolate area of the journey. The scorching heat of the desert, combined with the long - distance to the town and the lack of water, made the cyclist's situation extremely dire. Every pedal stroke was a struggle as he faced the harsh reality of his surroundings. In the end, the challenging setting truly tested his will to survive and complete the journey.
274	6252	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the road could be severely damaged or there could be a large number of steep hills. One clear example is on pg 12 “with any luck I’d hit a bump and lodge one in my throat.” This vividly explains that the conditions of the road could be extremely dangerous. A damaged road might have potholes or uneven surfaces that could cause the cyclist to lose control of his bike, while the numerous hills would require a great deal of physical effort. That is how the condition of the road can have a significant and detrimental effect on the cyclist's journey. In conclusion, these road conditions made the cyclist's trip far more arduous and risky.
275	6253	3	3	When the cyclist takes off on the road again, he starts with plenty of water, strong legs, and enjoys the sunny and warm day. The initial conditions seem perfect for a great ride. But as the day progresses and gets hotter, and the terrain becomes more like a desolate desert and the air becomes dry and dusty, the cyclist begins to lose his confidence. As he keeps riding, his water supply is steadily depleting, and he begins to firmly believe that he will die. At one point, talking about the terrain he says, “I toiled on at some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path.” It sounds as if he is struggling very hard to keep going without water and with no clear clue about where he is. When he is almost certain that he is going to die from the suffering, he says, “I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.” This clearly shows that by this time his confidence was completely lost because of the insane heat and the unbearable terrain. He begins to lose his sanity along with his strength because the setting around him was so incredibly terrible. However, despite these extreme challenges, his perseverance ultimately led him to keep going, and it's possible that he overcame these odds in the end.
276	6254	3	3	The features of the settings affect the cyclist in many ways. When he starts off, he is bright and happy, just as the serenity of the surroundings is nice and calming. There is a gentle pace that makes him feel like nothing could go wrong. “I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.” After about @NUM1 miles in the cold, his energy was getting low, and he came to his second promising place. He then felt a little disturbed and worried as he realized he needed to find a place with water. “This site was unpromising.” There he finds a water source, and his hopes rise a bit, until he discovers the water isn't good. “A tarlike substance oozed out, followed by murky water that felt as if it came from a place in the neighborhood of two hundred trees.” So he moves on and finally he reaches a life - saving spot! He is so relieved he can't believe his luck. “Then as easily as rounding a bend, my troubles, thirst, and fear were all behind me.” The setting affects the mood in a very big way; the cyclist feels as the setting looks.
277	6255	3	3	The features of the setting greatly affect the cyclist. One way it affects him is because it is extremely hot, and he realizes he has no water left. Also, because there are so many dilapidated buildings and ghost towns, this gives him a glimmer of hope that he will be able to get the water he desperately needs. In such a desolate setting, these remnants of human habitation are his only chance at finding a water source, and this hope, however faint, keeps him going.
278	6256	3	3	Almost all of the cyclist's surroundings are old and barren. The weather is like a sweltering @CAPS1 climate. The road is hard to ride on, with its rough surface and uneven texture. “Flat Road was replaced by short rolling hills.” These hills add an extra challenge to his journey. So his ride was a very rough and tiresome one, as he had to constantly battle the heat and the difficult terrain.
279	6257	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by influencing how much confidence he has in where he's going and how he's going to get there. Having no water in this desolate setting makes him doubt his ability to continue. The lack of water is a constant reminder of the harshness of the environment, and it chips away at his confidence, making each pedal stroke a struggle both physically and mentally.
280	6258	3	3	If the sun had not been so blaringly hot and all the roads so treacherous, the cyclist's journey would have been much easier. Also, the “elevation” often bothers the author because he had to overcome the challenges of dryness and dehydration. The high elevation combined with the hot sun and difficult roads made it a real struggle for him to keep going, but he persevered through these harsh conditions.
281	6259	3	3	When cycling or doing any outdoor sport, the setting matters greatly. If it's cold, you need a proper, insulated jacket to keep your body warm. When it's hot, you need an adequate supply of water to stay hydrated. Depending on how extreme the conditions are, it could be a matter of life or death. For instance, the terrain could be really hilly, and you might get tired quickly. And if you have no water, your body could start to shut down, and you could die. Also, it depends on whether the location is in a city, a suburban area, a small town, a desert, or a highway. All these factors play a huge role in cycling, and one must be well - prepared for them.
282	6260	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in numerous ways. The cyclist was in California in June, a time when the weather is typically hot. If it wasn't so hot under the blazing sun, he wouldn't have needed water as badly. He wouldn't have been sweating as much, losing precious fluids from his body. Also, there weren't any buildings or cars around in that desolate area, so there wasn't anyone to help him in case of an emergency. “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structures of any kind.” Clearly, such features of the setting could severely affect the cyclist's well - being.
283	6261	3	3	In the essay, “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” written by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affect the cyclist. One feature that affects him is that he is cycling “through the high deserts of California in June” (Kurmaskie). This extreme setting means that the intense heat would cause the author to be dehydrated faster. The cyclist, who is also the author, is dehydrated before he can make it to the next town. As evidence, he “gathered up a few pebbles and stuck them in [his] mouth” (Kurmaskie), a desperate attempt to moisten his parched throat.
284	6262	3	3	In the essay Do not exceed posted speed limit by Joe Kurmaskie, the surrounding setting affected the cyclist. The setting was somewhere outside Lodi, California in early summer, a time when the sun can be quite intense. The cyclist took advice from some old men that led him to difficult places to get out of, perhaps areas with rough terrain or long stretches without resources. As the sun beat down, making the air hot and dry, and his water started to deplete, getting to Yosemite was much harder. The cyclist was traveling through high deserts of California in June, a harsh environment. When the terrain started to change from a flat road to rolling hills, the cyclist pushed himself even harder to get to his destination. The sun and hot air dehydrated him faster, sapping his energy. After traveling over “a long, crippling hill,” the cyclist had to stop and even tried sucking on a pebble in an effort to take his mind off thirst. When he found a habited store, he was exhausted and relieved. Clearly, the features of the setting had a big effect on the cyclist. The weather dehydrated him while the terrain exhausted him, making his journey a real struggle.
285	6263	3	3	The settings in the essay affected the cyclist mentally and physically. The fact that he was riding through the desert in June, with the scorching sun overhead, affected how long his water supply lasted. If he had been riding in the cooler @DATE1, then his water supply would've lasted longer and he would've had more energy to pedal. Since the town the old men had told the cyclist about was abandoned, that also affected the cyclist because he had to keep on going even though he was getting weaker with each passing mile. What affected the cyclist most, I think, was when he arrived at the bait store. If that had been abandoned like everything else in that desolate area, the cyclist would've died. Luckily though it wasn't, and he was able to drink water. The factory affected him mentally because the picture of the boy was haunting him in a way due to the fact he was drinking juice, something the cyclist couldn't do at that desperate moment. All in all, I think the conditions that the cyclist was in affected him greatly. Since I've fainted from dehydration before, I know how it feels to be without water. First, you get a throbbing headache; then your mouth dries up and a sense of desperation sets in, and finally you get dizzy. It's a terrifying experience, and the cyclist endured it all due to the unforgiving setting.
286	6264	3	3	The setting in “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” significantly impacts the cyclist's physical and mental state. There are distinct negative and positive effects for each state. The physical effects of the cyclist due to the settings are all apparent throughout the story. For example, when the cyclist reaches @PERSON2 and @PERSON1’s Fish Camp, he is able to hydrate once again. This positive effect makes the cyclist regain his health and safety. The setting mentally influences the cyclist very substantially. This can be clearly seen when the cyclist is in the comfortable camp around in @LOCATION1. He feels a deep sense of happiness in this area. This positive effect well - prepares the cyclist to go on the trip to Yosemite. Also, when the cyclist reaches the “Ramshackle @CAPS2, several rusty pumps, and a corral,” he feels deeply troubled. He is negatively affected mentally by the scarce amount of available water. In addition, the cyclist felt “sad” and “hopeless” when cycling in the dry, arid terrain. The cyclist is in the worst mental state in this place. Finally, the cyclist felt relieved upon seeing the fish camp. He describes the feeling by saying that his troubles are now “behind” him. The setting's positive effect in this instance changes his mental state from negative to positive. Setting was the main factor in deciding upon the cyclist’s physical and mental state. Setting impacts the cyclist’s physical and mental state in positive and negative states almost equally in the story, highlighting its crucial role in the cyclist's journey.
287	6265	3	3	The setting made the cyclist feel extremely lonely. The cyclist lost hope quickly because he never saw any people or water on the long, desolate way. The cyclist said they saw a “ghost town,” a place completely devoid of any signs of life. Before he got to the fish camp, the cyclist saw no one and was gradually becoming dehydrated. This severe dehydration caused him to lose hope rapidly, and at some points, he truly thought he was going to die. For example, he says, “I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.” It is clear that the setting affected the cyclist in a very negative way, leaving a lasting and harrowing impression on his experience.
288	6266	3	3	The features of the setting, specifically being in a forest, greatly affect the cyclist. This was a bumpy trip with a multitude of troubles along the way. The forest terrain was uneven, filled with roots and rocks that made cycling difficult. This was a long trip, with the cyclist having to pedal for hours on end. But he persevered through it all, making it tough with a remarkable story to tell in the end. His journey through the forest not only tested his physical strength but also his mental resolve, and he emerged victorious with a tale of endurance.
289	6267	3	3	The setting of the essay, “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” significantly affects the cyclist's physical and emotional attitude. In the beginning of the essay, the cyclist, “rode into the morning with strong legs and a wide smile on [his] face.” It was not too hot yet in the cool morning air. So, the cyclist was extremely happy and full of strength. He was supremely confident he could conquer anything that came his way. As the day grew on, “the sun was beginning to beat down” mercilessly. He was beginning to drink lots of water but he was still confident and strong. “I came to a ramshackle shed [and] several rusty pumps; the sight was deeply troubling.” The cyclist was travelling in the hot deserts of California, where the heat was almost unbearable. He was becoming increasingly tired and thirsty. He had to save as much water as possible to survive. What started as a confident ride into the desert became a desperate survival ride. Once the cyclist finds water, he is immensely relieved. He feels more confident and can ride to his destination with new - found determination. The weather and setting can affect us emotionally and physically just like in the essay, the cyclist became tired both physically and emotionally as the hot, sunny day went on, clearly demonstrating the power of the environment on human experience.
290	6268	3	3	As the cyclist begins his journey, he is highly confident and extremely excited to have been offered new directions from some “old wise men” which promise a shortcut. This water supply is mediocre, and his attitude is tested against the flat and hilly terrain, until he realizes the directions are way off target. The cyclist was making his way to Yosemite when he came to the first “town,” but it wasn't a town at all but more of a desolate ghost dwelling. As he continued, hoping the shortcut offered by the old “codgers” would actually materialize, he realized he was utterly alone in the scorching hot desert with a depleting water supply and a dwindling spirit. He was deeply disturbed that he had chosen to follow the advice from the older men. Through his pain and despair, he encouraged himself by deciding he would never listen to their type again. The cyclist felt completely cheated, yet through his strong will and determination, by carefully rationing water and mentally choosing to cycle for each hill one at a time, he endured his physical, emotional, and mental trials. He lived to learn the valuable lesson of never consulting old “codgers” on mapping issues, because their information would most likely be outdated, a lesson that will stay with him for future adventures.
291	6269	3	3	The reasons why the setting affected the cyclist are that as the temperature got hotter, the more water he drank. Also, the farther he traveled, the more tired he became. This tiredness caused his body to heat up, which in turn made him drink more of his limited water supply. Eventually, this cycle of heat, tiredness, and water consumption significantly impacted his journey.
292	6270	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist greatly in his determined ride. At first, he seemed at ease, excitedly talking about the cool pines and rushing rivers he was going to encounter once he reached Yosemite. After a long and strenuous ride under the scorching sun, he started to get nervous and began to wonder if he was even going to survive. He was running out of water and thought he saw a diamondback snake, which only added to his anxiety. Once he reached the rolling hills, he saw a posted speed - limit sign saying not to exceed the speed limit of 55 m.p.h., while he was moving at a “water - depleting” 12 m.p.h., constantly wondering how he was going to make it. At the end of the rolling hills, he came to an old Welch’s grape factory, feeling that his life was so cruel. After that moment of despair, he was determined to survive and make it to his destination. He picked out some landmarks on the horizon and rode towards them, slowly making his way across the vast desert. Finally, he made it to “Only and Wilbers fish camp” where he knew he was safe and would survive this arduous journey.
293	6271	3	3	The hot, dry, and barren setting affected the cyclist greatly. A barren place is a hot, dry, and abandoned area with little to no signs of life. The cyclist was trying to ride his bike to Yosemite National Park. He made the mistake of deciding to follow the directions of a couple of old men. As Kurmaskie said, “Simply because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn’t been off their porch in decades.” The hot and dry conditions made the cyclist's hardest obstacle staying hydrated. Without an adequate water supply in such a harsh environment, his journey became extremely challenging.
294	6272	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. One way was because of the hot and dry climate. With the cyclist having a limited amount of water, it affected him severely. The cyclist listened to the old men, so therefore he traveled a good distance, which made matters worse. With a lack of water and such a long distance to go, the cyclist stuck pebbles in his mouth, hoping to forget about his intense thirst. The cyclist even thought of himself dying and the birds picking him clean because he was afraid he would die of dehydration. The conditions of the road made it harder. First, he started with nothing but straight roads, which were already tough in the heat, and then he ended up going up and down hills. In conclusion, the cyclist faced many obstacles that made his trip much harder than what he initially thought.
295	6273	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because in this setting, there aren't many flat areas; instead, there are lots of hills. Also, there was no water available. For example, in the story, he mentions that it was a hilly area. He also says that there are no buildings around, and he is all by himself, which during the quiet @MONTH1 can make him scared. So, the setting affects the cyclist by being a very hot, dry climate with no water, no buildings, and no people to ask for directions. This situation would make him scared, lost, and fearful of what is going to happen to him during this difficult journey.
296	6274	3	3	"During the cyclist's journey, he was faced with many difficulties. Mostly, the drivers were inconsiderate, and he ran out of water. In the essay, it says how he arrived at the first town and was in search of water. It said, ""This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time - say, before the last world war."" This affected the cyclist because he was running out of water. Another feature of the setting that affected the cyclist was the heatstrokes, and there wasn't a single car or building the whole way. These challenges made his journey extremely tough."
297	6275	3	3	The feature of the setting affected the cyclist because of the bad conditions of the road, the intense sun, the deserts, and the low amount of energy supply he had left. The rough road made pedaling difficult, the scorching sun drained his energy, and the deserts offered no respite. With limited energy, he struggled to continue. In the end, these factors combined to make his cycling experience a real struggle.
298	6276	3	3	"As if a long bike ride through the city isn't grueling enough, the author of this story had it much worse. First, the climate was a recipe for a disaster. ""High deserts of California in June."" The high temperature is clearly a debilitating factor, as is direct sunlight and humidity. If the cyclist did not have the proper gear, he could be hurt by all three of these factors. Secondly, ""Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills."" This means his endurance is being tested because it takes tolerance, energy, and will - power to climb each individual hill. Most importantly, with his lack of water in his bottles, all of these characteristics were harmful. Within a desert, water is to be found nowhere. In hot weather, the water bottles will turn warm, and in sunlight, water could even evaporate. To me, it seems like the setting and the weather were the perfect combination for doing much more harm than good, making the cyclist's journey a real ordeal."
299	6277	3	3	The features that affect the cyclist are the lack of water, which makes him slow down. Another is the directions from the old men that probably aren't up to date nowadays. The lack of water saps his energy and reduces his speed, while the inaccurate directions might lead him astray. These factors together pose significant challenges to the cyclist's journey.
300	6278	3	3	"The setting explains an early summer evening with some eccentric men. The mood that he would be in would probably be lively. ""Like a foolish youth, the next morning I followed their advice…"" (Kurmaskie) says that if you were very lively, I would take that as a way of being drunk without being drunk, and doing whatever someone thinks you should do without knowing you are being persuaded to do it. This shows that the lively mood and the influence of the eccentric men could lead the cyclist into unwise decisions during his journey."
301	6279	3	3	The setting causes difficult problems for the cyclist, presenting tough hazards. The weather is extremely hot, and just enduring the hot weather is tough enough. However, cycling through a desert with limited water must be truly miserable. The intense warmth of the desert had a significant impact on the cyclist, causing him to feel fatigued. This fatigue delayed him from reaching his destination quicker. Not only did he have to face tough weather but also hazardous conditions. There were times when “tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake” appeared. This unexpected encounter delayed him, and it took time for him to cycle around these obstacles. As you can see, this was a difficult journey for the cyclist, and these challenges greatly affected his progress.
302	6280	3	3	The features surrounding the cyclist affect him greatly. All that surrounds him are steep hills, rough terrain, shifting sand, and tumbling weeds. These desolate features leave him with the thought that he might die as there is no sign of life around him. Everything is dry and barren, and that's exactly how it makes him feel. The old, rusty water pump stands as a silent witness, showing that it hasn't been used in ages. The black tar pumped out is of no help, only adding to his negative thoughts about life. In such a desolate setting, the cyclist's spirit is truly tested.
303	6281	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways, ranging from temperature, surroundings, and the availability of water. First of all, the cyclist felt extremely tired and exhausted because of the scorching temperature and the challenging terrain. For example, “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” I can vividly imagine the cruel heat relentlessly beating down on him while he was riding down the roads. It would surely make anyone tired and exhausted. Second of all, the desolate surroundings as he rode affected him and made him have less confidence as he journeyed further. For example, “This place might have been a thriving little spot some time, say, before the last world war - last on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.” It shows how the information he had been given caused him to feel unsure of where he was going. I'd feel equally uncapable and would likely do the same in his situation. Lastly, the lack of water made him extremely scared. For example, “conserve my water and go instead for an hour or so at least of my inner spirit.” It made him think the situation wasn't good. So as one can see, the setting affected the cyclist in numerous ways, making his journey a real struggle.
304	6282	3	3	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” the author uses features of the setting to show the effects on the cyclist. In the essay, the rider gets directions from two old men sitting on a perch. In the essay it said, “Never accept bad advice from a collection of old - timers who haven't left the centers of their porch since Carter was in office.” This shows that the old men could be wrong as places can change over time. Also, on this so - called shortcut he almost runs out of water. The essay stated “I would conserve my water and go inward for an hour or so – a test of my inner spirit.” He is running out of water but still has the determination to keep going. Moreover, the terrain affects him. The steep hills prove to be a great challenge with a limited supply of water. The essay states, “Flat roads were replaced by steep, rolling hills.” This shows he is extremely determined. Even though the hills added to the struggle, he managed to make it through. That is how the author used features of the setting to add to the struggle of the cyclist and highlight his perseverance.
305	6283	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because they (perhaps the locals or those giving advice) figured that they were old enough and had seen what was going on in the area and had been through similar situations. They believed that they were well - experienced and knew more about what was happening in that particular setting. So, they thought that the cyclist should listen to them. However, this advice might not always be accurate as the setting can change. Despite this, the cyclist was influenced by these perceived authorities, which in turn affected his journey.
306	6284	3	3	After the cyclist spoke to the “old timers who hadn’t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office,” his initial confidence in their advice began to wane. He entered the desert with a happy demeanor, hopeful for a smooth journey, and determined to reach his destination. As his water reservoir gradually began to disappear, and he neared the sight of the old shed, the dilapidated canal, and a couple of rusty water pumps, he started to feel a strange sense of being touched. He made an attempt to get the water from the pumps, and it was not only hot but “tested like battery acid.” As he continued to ride on, his confidence only faded more. He traveled through the vast desert and encountered a “ridiculously large snake,” and he was running critically low on water. Finally, he saw a building in the far - off distance. Ironically, it was an abandoned juice factory. A sign featuring a figure sipping on some succulent icy liquid stood in a state of ruin, and he began to lose all hope. He didn't think he would make it to his destination or anywhere else for that matter. Although after approaching the old factory, he unexpectedly came across a bait shop where his hope and energy were finally restored, and he could once again face the rest of his journey.
307	6285	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in a few notable ways. For example, the rough and bumpy nature of the “Rough Road” didn't allow him to arrive as fast as he'd hoped. He was driving at a mere @NUM1 on a @NUM2 speed limit, constantly having to slow down to navigate the uneven surface. Second, the fact that he was driving through a desolate desert meant that a large snake slithered its way onto the road. This forced the man to “ease past, trying desperately to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.” Moreover, because he was driving through the sweltering desert, he got extremely hot and started to get dehydrated due to the lack of available water. Lastly, the feature that there weren't any buildings for miles around left him completely lost, and he didn't have anywhere to stop and ask for directions. These few features definitely had a significant impact on the cyclist, making his journey much more arduous.
308	6286	3	3	There were many features of the setting that affected the cyclist during his difficult journey to Yosemite. First, it was the old timers at the reservoir campground. They might have been old, but not very wise in their advice. For example, “I followed their advice and launched out at first light, and along a ‘short cut’ that was supposed to slice away hours from my ride to Yosemite National Park.” This is describing how the cyclist naively took the short cut from the old timers, which almost got him into a life - threatening situation. Additionally, the sun had a powerful warming effect on the cyclist, causing him to rapidly dehydrate. For example, “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the scorching high deserts of California in June.” This gives you a vivid image of just how hot the climate he was in. Finally, a lack of water can cause major problems, such as heatstroke or dehydration, both of which can lead to death. For example, “I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June…” This clearly states that without enough water to keep him cool, he felt as if he were on the verge of death. All these setting features made his journey to Yosemite an extremely challenging one.
309	6287	3	3	In the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the setting often has a profound impact on the character. One example of this is when the character got to a desolate place where there was nothing but desolation. “One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn't hold in the lamest mule greeted me.” This quote explains that the character (cyclist) was thoroughly confused, not knowing where to go next. Another example of this harsh setting is when the water in his bottle felt a scorching @NUM1 degrees. “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” That quote suggests that it was swelteringly hot outside, which would make the water in his bottle unbearably hot. Another example of the setting is when the terrain changed. “The flat, straight road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” This made the biker have to work much harder, and use a significant amount of extra energy. These difficult conditions all made the cyclist have to put in extra effort to find his destination.
310	6288	3	3	The setting in “Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit,” affected the cyclist greatly. For starters, it says he was “traveling through the high deserts,” which is never a safe or easy thing to do. The intense heat was already a challenge. He had been drinking his water regularly, but as the temperature steadily rose, his situation worsened. He was in a state of “trying to keep balance in my dehydrated state,” struggling to stay upright on his bike. From the lack of water, because the rough terrain had jostled his water containers so much, the water had turned into a “far - like substance,” making it almost undrinkable. The harsh and unforgiving setting of the story was truly cruel to the cyclist, making his journey a battle against the elements.
311	6289	3	3	The conditions and features affect every aspect of the cyclist's journey. The conditions were quite challenging; he had to save as much water as possible while also keeping himself hydrated at the same time so that he wouldn't dehydrate himself during the long - ride. The features of the desert - like land were extremely fierce. It was not only dry but also very bumpy, making it difficult for him to maintain a steady pace. Not to mention that there were creatures such as snakes on the prowl out there. You can never predict what they'll do, and the constant threat added to his stress. In such a situation, the cyclist had to be extremely vigilant and resourceful to complete his journey.
312	6290	3	3	The features of the setting in the story affect the cyclist in numerous ways. For example, when he arrived at the first town, the water had an awful taste, like battery acid. This unpleasant experience made the rider more conscious about conserving water. Another significant factor was the harsh conditions such as the high temperature. The heat made the ride even more arduous. The cyclist would listen attentively to the old people in the towns he passed through, hoping to get useful tips that would help him reach the place he was going faster. All these features of the setting combined to create a challenging environment for the cyclist.
313	6291	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist greatly. One prominent feature would be the extreme dryness of the land. He was pedaling for an incredibly long time under the scorching sun. As a result, he became severely dehydrated. There was not a single drop of water in sight, and he had no idea how long it would be until he found some. He didn't think he could make it that far without water. Another feature of the setting was the intense heat. The sun's rays were so strong that he felt like he could not go on any longer. The heat from the sun made him feel as if he was on the verge of having a heat - stroke. Clearly, the features of the setting did greatly impact the cyclist, testing his physical and mental limits.
314	6292	3	3	During the cyclist's trip, he experienced both physical and mental strain. The intense heat, rough terrain, the presence of animals and his isolation all contributed to his strain while completing his challenging task. His isolation while cycling down the “shortcut” was a definite factor in his strain. @PERSON1 stated that, “there was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” All @PERSON1 had to focus on was accomplishing his task. There wasn't anybody nearby to offer help, and there was no shelter for him to take to escape the blistering heat. The heat itself played a very predominant factor in Kurmaskie's physical strain. The heat caused him to become dangerously thirsty and required him to find an abundance of water fast. Kurmaskie stated, “the growing realization that I could drop from heat - stroke.” This statement proves that the intense temperature was a life - threatening factor. The rough terrain and the encounter with a snake were two factors in his trip that just made his journey even more cruel. The physical strain of avoiding a snake in the middle of the road and navigating the dangerous terrain just put him in a more precarious position. In the end, his ability to persevere through all these challenges was truly remarkable.
315	6293	3	3	In Joe Kurmaskie's, “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the features of the setting affect the cyclist in a bad way. First of all, the cyclist is severely dehydrated from the intense heat and the lack of available water. “I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.” This sentence from the text shows that he is dehydrated, and because of this, it creates a major obstacle he must face. Dehydration made it difficult for him to pedal and maintain his balance on the bike. Also, another bad effect from the features of the setting the cyclist is facing is the rough road ahead he had to face. “ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT.” If I were the cyclist gazing at the sign, I would feel a sense of dread just knowing there was trouble up ahead. The rough road could damage his bike and slow him down. Luckily, the cyclist made his way through and managed his obstacles well, showing his resilience in the face of a harsh setting.
316	6294	3	3	There are many features in the setting that will affect the cyclists. One significant feature is the climate. When you are cycling under a scorching sun and the temperature is extremely high, you can dehydrate very fast as your body loses a large amount of water through sweating. If it is really cold, the frigid air makes it harder to breathe and catch your breath. Another feature in the setting that can affect a cyclist is the terrain. If there are too many hills that are really steep, you have to exert a great deal of energy to pedal uphill and will get very tired quickly. When the ground is rocky, there is a high possibility that you might lose control and fall off the bike and hurt yourself. The last feature in the setting that will affect a cyclist is how isolated the road is. If a cyclist runs out of water and there are no places such as shops or rest - areas to stop on the road, this could be almost deadly to a cyclist. Also, if the road is so isolated and you get hurt, it would be very difficult for anyone to find you. This is another deadly situation. These are the main features in the setting that can affect the cyclist and cyclists should be well - aware of them.
317	6295	3	3	The features at the setting affected the cyclist by rapidly dehydrating him. The setting had a blistering hot sun that beat down relentlessly, no trees to provide shade, and no water sources in sight. The cyclist was also feeling lethargic, lacking the energy to continue his ride. In the story he said “I and the growing … that I could drop from heat stroke.” Due to these harsh setting features, the cyclist was in a very dangerous situation and it clearly shows how the setting can have a detrimental impact on a cyclist.
318	6296	3	3	The setting was hot and dry, with the sweltering heat hanging in the air, which affected the cyclist greatly. She didn't have enough space on her bike to carry a lot of water and the necessary equipment to make potable water to drink. Also, listening to old guys who didn't know much about the route didn't help either. They gave her wrong advice and sent her on a much harder path to travel, filled with more uphill climbs and rough terrain. In such a situation, the cyclist faced a tough challenge and the negative impact of the setting and wrong advice was evident.
319	6297	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in a few ways. The first was the cool forested road that he set out on. Although the route seemed not too easy at first glance, he felt over - confident and, in his haste, started off in the wrong direction. Another factor was when he rode into the desert. The intense heat in the desert caused the cyclist to become dehydrated rapidly. Moreover, what little water he could find was contaminated and tasted like battery acid, making it difficult for him to rehydrate. These factors affected the cyclist by giving him false hope at the beginning and nearly leading him to his death. Cyclists should always be cautious of such setting - related pitfalls.
320	6298	3	3	The way the setting of the story helped the guy out a lot. He was riding on a hot day, but with “cool pines and a rushing river” along the way, it was definitely worth the ride. The cool shade provided by the pines and the refreshing breeze from the river kept him cool, allowing him to endure the heat. This enabled him to conserve his energy and reach the next town to get his water. That is why I think that the pines and river were a big help, as they made his cycling journey possible under difficult weather conditions.
321	6299	3	3	Whether the lack of water, the hills, the tumble weeds – all are things that significantly affect the cyclist. The lack of water affects the cyclist because it is extremely hot outside under the glaring sun, and he desperately needs water to keep his body functioning. The hills also affect him because it requires a great deal of strength and effort to peddle up the steep hills. Finally, there are the tumbleweeds. The tumble weeds show a distinct desert look as they roll across the arid landscape. When he sees tumble weeds, he tries his best to keep balance because he is partially dehydrated and doesn't want to crash on the rough ground. The dehydration / lack of water affects the author because he is very thirsty and everyone knows that water is essential for survival. When you are lacking water and energy, it makes your goal of completing the cycling journey even more difficult. In conclusion, these elements of the environment pose continuous challenges to the cyclist's ability to complete his ride.
322	6300	3	3	In “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affect the cyclist by gradually wearing him out and pushing his limits of hope and survival skills. At first, the cyclist enters a deserted town with an eerie quietness, but he remains calm and amused by this in the sentence, “I chuckled, checked my water supply carefully, and moved on steadily.” Soon after, the cyclist is troubled by a “ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, through the high deserts of California in June” which creates a desolate and discouraging atmosphere. He is visibly agitated by this, drinks a large amount and makes a significant dent in his water supply, and unfortunately continues his arduous journey. At the point where he is still isolated and lost beyond repair, the cyclist tries to stay hopeful but soon breaks down. He reflects, “Telling myself that if I could make it that far, I’d be okay.” The features of the setting become more and more disheartening at each leg of the journey for the cyclist, constantly testing his resolve. In conclusion, the harsh setting takes a heavy toll on the cyclist's physical and mental state.
323	6301	3	3	In the beginning of the cyclist's journey, he is very happy and carefree, whistling as he pedals. The cyclist comes to the first deserted town, and the setting isn't described because the cyclist is not worried yet, his mind filled with excitement for the adventure ahead. After leaving the first town, the cyclist barely noticed the heat because, “the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them.” The cyclist still has high spirits, pedaling with enthusiasm. The cyclist begins to get thirsty when he comes upon a water pump. He approaches it eagerly, attempts to get water but the pump is not in working condition, leaving him disappointed. Until this point in the story, the road has been mostly flat and straight, making the ride relatively easy. Then the cyclist notices that the road has some hills in it. At this point, the cyclist has no water and is very dehydrated, his body starting to feel the strain. After one hill, the cyclist sees a building. The building is an abandoned grape juice factory, which is ironic considering the state the cyclist is in, as he is parched. The cyclist sucks on rocks as a last resort and gives up hope of living when he comes upon a fish camp. He gets water from the bathroom and all is well. The setting in this story affects the cyclist because as the setting changes, so do the cyclist's moods and feelings about survival and the danger he is in. In conclusion, the changing setting acts as a catalyst for the cyclist's emotional and physical transformation during the journey.
324	6302	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. When in the essay it states, “The sun was beginning to beat down” This shows that this affects how he feels when he is cycling through the road under the intense sunlight, and this can affect his ability to keep cycling while the sun beats down on him hard, making him feel hot and uncomfortable. Also, when he states “I was doing a water - depleting 12 mph,” this shows he was also dehydrated once going, moving very slow because of the large amount of heat and lack of water that affected his ability to keep cycling vigorously in the area. The heat saps his energy, and the lack of water makes his muscles weak. In conclusion, the harsh setting severely restricts the cyclist's performance and endurance.
325	6303	3	3	I believe the cyclist is all alone in the vast expanse, and I think the old man should have shot him because the cyclist's long and seemingly ill - advised journey is causing unnecessary trouble. I believe a bike ride that long is a little retarded as it exposes the cyclist to numerous risks. I feel that no matter how great or horrible the shape you're in, you shouldn't even go on a really long ride on a bicycle. It's not a practical or safe choice. In conclusion, such a long - distance cycling trip without proper planning and consideration is a bad idea that can lead to dangerous situations.
326	6304	3	3	The setting affected the cyclist in a big way during his arduous journey. The blistering temperature being so hot rapidly tired the cyclist and constantly made him extremely thirsty. Also, the steep hills being so high to ride up made it incredibly hard for him to continue his progress. Since he was in the vast desert, there were not many towns nearby to go to for respite. All these factors significantly affected the cyclist on his long - distance journey, making it a real test of his endurance.
327	6305	3	3	The setting in the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” affects the cyclist in three ways. One way is that the area is very barren, so there is no shade at all to block the intense sun that is relentlessly beating down on the cyclist's body. This constant exposure adds to his severe dehydration and makes it difficult for him to maintain focus. Another way the setting affects the cyclist is the challenging terrain. The rolling hills and the vast desert he bikes through are tough obstacles. The hills make him work much harder, using up more of his limited energy and quickly exhausting his water supply. The desert, with its intense heat, makes him doubt himself as he starts to think the things he sees are mirages. The last way it affects him is the ghost towns. When he sees them, he gets a glimmer of hope for relief, thinking he might get water and escape the heat. But when he passes through them, he finds nothing, leaving him crestfallen and even contemplating death. All these aspects of the setting combine to make the cyclist's journey extremely difficult.
328	6306	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because it is extremely hot and dry in the California desert when you are on a bicycle. Being in such hot and dry conditions, along with having bad directions, in a vast desert is truly a nightmare. It was a long - distance ride under the burning hot sun, with only a small amount of water. The cyclist thought he was going to die because there was nothing in sight for miles around. The harsh setting made his journey a perilous one, pushing him to the brink of despair.
329	6307	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in more ways than one. For example, in the short story ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" the cyclist had to endure going over big, dark hills while being severely dehydrated and extremely tired from biking long miles to get to a destination. The setting can sometimes even cause you to lose hope and give up. The cyclist in the short story started to lose hope until he unexpectedly found a small store that sold fishing bait. The setting controls how long it takes you to reach your destination and how you get there. For instance, if you come across a dirt road and there's a large boulder blocking the way, you have to find another route to get there. In conclusion, the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways, making his journey full of unforeseen challenges."
330	6308	3	3	The setting affects the cyclist because he is in the sweltering California desert in June without any water. He is also cycling up and down curvy, hilly back roads. The cyclist eventually starts to lose water quickly, and his determination is severely tested as he struggles to reach the next town. He says “wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because I listened to some old gentlemen who hadn't been off their porch in decades. Caused me to laugh.” The author is showing how the difficult circumstances he is in are taking a heavy toll on him. He also states a road sign “Rough Road ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit.” This is ironic because he is already completely exhausted and now he is about to encounter a treacherous stretch of road. I have never cycled for long periods of time and can hardly imagine being pushed to such a state of extreme exhaustion. I can relate it to a time I played @NUM1 soccer games during the sweltering summer heat. It was extremely painful, and every time I received the ball, it took all my remaining strength to control it. The cyclist's experience in this harsh setting truly highlights the power of the environment to impact one's physical and mental state.
331	6309	3	3	In the story, the distinct features of the setting significantly affect the protagonist. As he traverses the arid landscape, he is running alarmingly low on water, a vital resource in such a harsh environment. To make matters worse, he encounters a menacing snake and has to carefully maneuver around it, which adds to his physical and mental stress. This challenging situation makes him extremely tired and dehydrated. His muscles become sore from navigating the rough terrain, which is unforgiving to his body. The relentless sun beats down on him, further exacerbating his dehydration. In the end, these combined elements of the setting take a severe toll on his well - being.
332	6310	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many profound ways because it is almost like the background and theme that sets the tone for the cyclist's journey. The features used in this story are predominantly about the background of the place he is traveling through and the sites along his route. He is vividly showing the reader how desperately he needs to reach a destination and just how much despair he is in at that moment. When he says “It was a sad, hopeless laugh, mind you, but at least I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself.” In this quote, he is indicating that he might be tired and physically not in his best shape, but at least he is aware that he is in a bad situation and in trouble. Yet, he can still laugh it off and remain aware, and he keeps trying anyway. This text, in my opinion, is a powerful showcase of many different ideas such as hope, awareness, and the ability and courage to realize one needs help but still continue to prove to oneself that they can finish what they planned to do.
333	6311	3	3	The features of the setting significantly affect the cyclist because he is in a harsh desert environment. The desert is extremely hot. I know this because in the story, he states that it feels around @NUM1 degrees, an almost unbearable temperature. He desperately struggled for water but couldn't find any that was cool. He came across a water pump in his search. From it, “a tar - like substance oozed out, followed by blackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.” This clearly shows that it was swelteringly hot and he was unable to find suitable water. In conclusion, the hot desert setting posed a major challenge to the cyclist.
334	6312	3	3	Many hazards and rigorous features affect the cyclist throughout his journey. He starts off his adventure with the advice of a short - cut from some old men. The cyclist is brimming with excitement at the thought of a short - cut and is carefully drinking his water to use it effectively. Soon, he begins to get lost, and the intense sun starts to beat down on him. He takes comfort in thinking about the cool, stress - relieving environment of @CAPS1. Even the imaginary setting of a fictitious stream has a calming effect on the cyclist. However, as time passes, the sun beats down on him even more mercilessly. The cyclist starts to run out of water and is constantly on guard, making sure that any water source he comes across is not a mirage. When he comes over the bend, he finally succumbs to his troubles of the difficult road and his intense thirst.
335	6313	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in numerous ways. The cyclist bravely persevered through the rough and unforgiving terrain, which gradually caused him to become extremely weak. For example, the author states “I looked at the majority of the pavement in front of me and ceased pedaling to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.” This clearly shows that the author is dehydrated due to the scorching heat, yet he kept going even with this physical obstacle. Another significant factor that affected the author was the overwhelming urge to give up because the terrain was just too harsh. For instance, in the text, “it didn't really matter; I was going to die and the birds will pick me clean, clearly waving only some experience outdoor gears.” This reveals that despite feeling like giving up, the author still had to press on even when times got tough. The text also shows how exhausted he is as the winds seem to be “eating at him” in his imagination of what would happen when he dies. He would dehydrate due to the high humidity of the desert and the blistering heat. In other words, the features of the setting had a profound and multi - faceted impact on the cyclist.
336	6314	3	3	The features of the setting affect cyclists because if you are going downhill and then suddenly hit a rough road surface, you're not going to fare so well. For instance, a cyclist might have been cruising on flat land smoothly, then the terrain changed to a series of hills, and finally, the road turned rough. These changing conditions can pose significant challenges and could seriously hurt someone, making the ride not only difficult but also dangerous. In conclusion, cyclists need to be vigilant about the changing features of the road to ensure their safety.
337	6315	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in a couple different ways. When the cyclist stumbled upon the ghost town, since there was no one around, he was unable to ask someone for better directions or get some much - needed food or water. The short rolling hills make it arduously hard to pedal because it requires a great deal of effort to pedal uphill. At the end of the story, he was fortunate enough to find a bait shop where he managed to get water and obtain better directions, which likely helped him continue his journey. In conclusion, the various features of the setting presented numerous obstacles for the cyclist, but he found a way to overcome some of them.
338	6316	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist by presenting all the big hills and the roughness of the roads. As the essay says, ""The flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills. After I crested the first few of these, a large highway sign jumped out at me."" Essentially, what it means is that the initially smooth flat road soon transformed into a series of rolling hills. If I were the cyclist riding up the hills, my legs would get extremely tired and sore after a while. For example, when my friend, @PERSON1, and I went bike riding, we went to @CAPS1 @CAPS2 in Fechmisburg. We had to ride up a big hill, and after just a few pedals, our legs started aching, so we decided to simply walk up the hill. In conclusion, the hilly and rough road conditions can make cycling a strenuous and sometimes unfeasible activity."
339	6317	3	3	There are many ways in which the setting of “Rough Road Ahead” affects the cyclist. First of all, he is bicycling through the desert. This poses a significant problem because the desert environment is extremely dry and hot. At one point in the story, the author writes that he was “trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.” It is quite obvious here that the lack of water is affecting him in a major way. He almost collapsed due to being so desperately thirsty. Another part of the setting that affects the cyclist is that he is in a very remote area. He says that “there was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” Since there was nowhere to stop immediately, the cyclist had to keep cycling and rationing his limited water supply until he could find a place to rest. Lastly, the “rough road” affected the cyclist. The uneven and bumpy road made traveling even more difficult and caused the cyclist to have a very tough time. If I had to bicycle for a long period of time, I would much rather have a smooth road so that I could conserve and renew my energy. The heat, remoteness of the area, and the rough road all combined to affect the cyclist negatively on his journey. In conclusion, the harsh desert setting with its various challenges made the cyclist's journey a truly arduous one.
340	6318	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist greatly in the story. The arid desert climate takes a toll on the cyclist by rapidly depleting his water supply. As he pedals through the dry expanse, the lack of moisture in the air and the scorching heat cause him to lose water at an alarming rate. He also began to get increasingly worried when every town the old men told him about turned out to be a ghost town. This situation planted seeds of doubt in the cyclist's mind that he might not survive the “shortcut” recommended by the old men. In conclusion, the desert climate and the non - existent towns in the setting created a perilous situation for the cyclist, threatening his ability to complete the journey safely.
341	6319	3	3	The features in the setting affect the cyclist because there are different kinds of hills, some steep and some gently sloping. He has to watch out for rocks in the middle of the road, which could cause him to lose control of his bike. He has to make sure he has a lot of water because it looks like he is in the desert, where the sun beats down mercilessly. There are no cars around but he still has to look for any cars in case they come out of nowhere, perhaps from a hidden side road. There are a lot of turns, sharp and winding, that require his full attention. It is very hot so he has to make sure he does not have a heatstroke. There are no places where he can stop because there is no shade, and there are no stores where he can stop and get water and food at either. That is the challenging setting the cyclist has to face.
342	6320	3	3	@CAPS1 the story shows that the condition of the problem often affects the mood of the cyclist. For example, when the sign said, “Rough road ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit,” he knew he was in for a tough stretch. This time, he saw a snake slithering across the road and he was extremely scared. He carefully eased past it, trying hard to keep his balance while he was already dehydrated, his throat parched and his body weak. The dry and hot climate, with the sun blazing down, began to become a real problem for the cyclist, sapping his energy and making his journey even more difficult.
343	6321	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example, he could have faced serious trouble if he drunk the battery - tasted water, which might have made him sick. Or if he didn't get enough clean water on time, he would quickly become dehydrated. Driving a bike for a long distance, with no water or any other supplies, is very energy - consuming. Every pedal stroke becomes a struggle as his body lacks the necessary hydration and nutrients. So you have to plan trips like that very wisely, considering all the possible challenges the setting might present.
344	6322	3	3	In the story, the setting greatly affects the cyclist. The cyclist, pedaling steadily through California, is obviously very hot in the “beautiful @DATE1.” The sun beats down on him, making his skin feel like it's on fire. He also runs out of water, which nearly dooms him. Without water, his throat is dry, and his energy levels plummet. But that's not the worst of it. The hills, some quite steep, make him run out of water and energy even quicker as he has to exert more force to climb them. There are also no places to stop for water, no convenient stores or shaded rest areas. The cyclist is truly lucky he survived the rugged terrain of California, with its unforgiving heat and challenging topography.
345	6323	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. If he wasn't in “High deserts of California in June,” he probably wouldn't be dehydrated. In @DATE1, the climate would be much more temperate and it wouldn't be so hot out, allowing him to conserve his energy and water. Also, if there weren't “short rolling hills,” which require extra effort to climb and descend, he would have had more energy to continue his journey. As you can see, the setting, with its specific climate and terrain features, affects the cyclist a great deal, making his cycling experience much more difficult.
346	6324	3	3	There were numerous features that significantly affected the cyclist. The lack of water gradually slowed him down, making each pedal stroke more arduous. Additionally, the steep hills and the intense heat of the sun were major problems that constantly challenged his endurance. All these factors combined made his cycling experience extremely tough.
347	6325	3	3	In the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed limit,” the features of the setting had a great deal to do with the cyclist. The roads were bumpy, winding, and full of many hills. As a result of these difficult road conditions, the cyclist had to drink a lot of water to keep going. As the cyclist rode into the so - called town, he found it deserted. As he says, “I began to pump the old rusted water pump, but nothing came out except nasty blackish water,” which left him in a dire situation.
348	6326	3	3	The way the features of the setting affected the cyclist was evident as she cycled through hot neighborhoods and along every rough road. The sweltering heat and the poor road conditions made her severely dehydrated and had a negative impact on her journey. This was further compounded by the long cycling segments where she had to pedal uphill, which drained her energy. All these factors together made her journey a real struggle.
349	6327	3	3	In the story, the cyclist starts out with a great deal of confidence, firmly believing that he can complete the whole ride. But after he left the first town, he had been riding for a while and desperately needed water. So he stopped at a fork in the road where he just had to get water from a pump. Unfortunately, the water tasted like battery acid. Then as he progressed further in his trip, he came to a sign that said “Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed speed limit” (Joe Kurmaskie pg @NUM1). This part of his trip made it extremely challenging as he had to face rough roads and mountains that he had to cross, which rapidly sucked the water out of him. Then as he came over the last mountain, he saw a sign for a gas station. So when he arrived, he got some water and got directions from a man who had the best map. Clearly, going over the mountains took a huge toll on the cyclist by dehydrating him, so he was incredibly relieved when he finally got the water at the end.
350	6328	3	3	The features of the setting in the essay entitled “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” affect the cyclist in an agonizing manner. He is severely dehydrated and completely exhausted due to the harsh conditions of the environment he was in. The cyclist became dehydrated not only because of the lack of available water but also because of the scorching heat of the desert. He sweated so much that he lost an enormous amount of bodily fluids. Moreover, the cyclist was traveling on an unpaved road, which required significantly more energy than traveling on a paved one. As a result, the cyclist became so exhausted that he almost lost his life. These are the ways the environment the cyclist was in affected him, highlighting the harshness of the setting on his journey.
351	6329	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in ways of feeling doubtful, confidence, determination, and relief. For instance, he feels extremely doubtful when he has hardly any water left in his bottle and has absolutely no clue where he currently is or where he is ultimately going to end up. He first felt quite confident when the old people sitting on the porch kindly told him the correct way to go. Then, at the end, when he firmly says he will listen to his map next time, that confidence is re - affirmed. He was also highly determined because he desperately wanted to reach the next town, which he eventually does. This achievement makes him feel relieved, and he still holds the strong desire to get to Yosemite National Park. That is how the setting affects the cyclist, influencing his emotions throughout the journey.
352	6330	3	3	The features of the setting in which the cyclist is in change his outlook on the trip significantly. When he first begins his trip, the road is in good condition, smooth and well - marked, so he becomes highly confident, thinking the journey will be a breeze. When the terrain began to change, he writes, “sometimes life can feel so cruel”. He grows despairing as he faces new, challenging terrain with so little water in his canteen. When he begins to see a building in the distance, he becomes hopeful and determined, imagining it to be a place where he can replenish his supplies. However, when he realizes it's an old, dilapidated juice factory, he grows bitter. When he leaves the factory, he feels as if he's lost all hope. The comparison can be shown when he writes, “somehow i climbed away from the abandoned factory of of juice and dreams, slowly gaining elevation while losing hope.” At the end, when he is revived with a cool drink of water, he almost looks back on the journey comically. The rider knows that his outlook drastically changed depending on the setting through his journey, and this experience has taught him the power of the environment on one's mindset.
353	6331	3	3	The features of California and the fact that the cyclist was near Yosemite made the terrain rugged and dangerous to the cyclist. California has a very hot climate, and is near a desert, so the need for water for the cyclist was much greater than if he had been cycling in a more temperate region. In the story, the cyclist had to travel through harsh, desert - like conditions with a limited water supply in his backpack. The cyclist even mentioned in the story how many hours into the ride the land changed to “short, rolling hills”. These hills were steep and rocky, which would have made it much harder to pedal, and making him work much harder. In the story, he also mentions how the scorching sun was beating down on him relentlessly, and that would also serve as a factor that helped deplete his hydration rapidly. Through all of the problems the cyclist faced, however, he managed to stay determined. When other people faced with his problems might not have been able to make it through, he persevered. Also, in the story, you can notice that in the different stages of his struggle, the author's tone changed from confident, to unsure, to desperate, reflecting the impact of the setting on his state of mind.
354	6332	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. The long, winding roads under the blistering sun made him extremely tired. The dry, arid air made him constantly thirsty, and he was gulping down water from his dwindling supply. As the miles passed and the heat intensified, he was near exhaustion, his legs feeling like lead and his energy all but drained. In such a setting, the cyclist's physical and mental state was severely tested, clearly showing how the environment can have a profound impact on a person during a strenuous activity.
355	6333	3	3	The cyclist in the essay “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” took the advice of older gentlemen who offered him a shortcut they knew to get to the national park. These gentlemen seemed so sure of the route, sharing their memories of the area. However, the land had changed long ago after these men were last here. The first town he came upon was a realistic version of a ghost town. There were abandoned buildings with broken windows and overgrown weeds. He laughed at how long ago those men must have been here, realizing the information was outdated. After long hours on the hot, dusty road and with depleted water in his bottles, despair sank in. He lost almost all hope when he reached an old and destroyed grape juice factory, its walls crumbling and machinery rusted. He had made it to a bait store for water at last, feeling a wave of relief. He would never take the advice of anyone but his map again, having learned a valuable lesson about relying on accurate information during his journey.
356	6334	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist by instilling a glimmer of hope in the author. When he came across a sign which clearly read ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"", his hope grew faint because he was pedaling at a water - depleting @NUM1 per hour. The rapid rate of water loss made him feel that life was cruel sometimes, and he started to think that he was on the verge of losing water. Also, when he unexpectedly came across the tumbleweeds and the large snake on the road, he quickly tried to avoid them. If he would have been bitten by that snake, he surely would have died. Finally, because of the intense heat, he might have also died from heatstroke as there were ""wide signs of dried"" areas all around. In the end, the setting's features posed a great threat to the cyclist's well - being."
357	6335	3	3	In the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”, many challenging features of the setting test the cyclists. The cyclist naively accepts information from some foreign old people, which turns out to be his first big mistake. After realizing this, as he himself states, “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California, in June.” The combination of the lack of water and the sweltering heat in California during June would have led to heatstroke for most people. Even further into the arduous journey, despite all those unfavorable conditions, it states, “the flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills”. Not only did he have to endure the excessive heat and the shortage of water, but he was also faced with troublesome roads. Although the cyclist must have been near to complete physical and mental exhaustion, he showed great perseverance and continued through. Fighting all the odds and elements, many features in the setting of this story significantly affected the cyclist, but he overcame them honorably, demonstrating remarkable resilience.
358	6336	3	3	The dry, desert - like setting would severely affect the cyclist because under the scorching sun, he could easily become dehydrated due to the significant loss of water through sweat. The cyclist specifically states, “I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state” (Rough Road Ahead). Clearly, the man is badly dehydrated, but driven by his determination, he continues to move forward. The terrain gradually changes from being flat to short rolling hills. The road he was on had been abandoned, just like the town he had passed through in the hope of getting water. The man further adds, “I toiled on, at some point, tumbleweeds unexpectedly crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake - it really did look like a diamondback - blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me” (Rough Road Ahead). The setting is obviously desert - like, characterized by dryness, intense heat, and a lot of dust. This kind of environment would definitely have a negative impact on his body as he is sweating continuously, which causes dehydration due to water loss. In conclusion, the cyclist was greatly affected by the harsh setting, yet his willpower kept him going.
359	6337	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist quite disastrously. First of all, he was “traveling through the high deserts of California in June”. The extreme heat and long - distance cycling made him run out of water quickly. The pump he found only produced “brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees” and “had the flavor of battery acid”. Such unpalatable water was of little help to his parched state. Then he came upon “rolling hills” and “Rough @CAPS1”. The difficult terrain added to his physical exertion. By the end of this grueling journey, he was exhausted, dehydrated, and in desperate need of clean, cool water. The challenging terrain made the story more meaningful in proving that one shouldn't blindly get directions from old guys, as their advice might lead to unforeseen hardships. In essence, the setting played a crucial role in highlighting the cyclist's plight.
360	6338	3	3	"In the essay, ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"", the cyclist encountered several daunting problems. The main conflict the cyclist faced in this text is the acute lack of water. Cycling is a strenuous and vigorous exercise that can quickly drain a rider's strength. Water is absolutely necessary to make sure the cyclist stays properly hydrated. In the text, the old men misguidedly had the cyclist take a detour through desert areas and hilly terrains. These areas are known for their hot weather and rough roads. Because of these unfavorable conditions, the cyclist became dehydrated much faster than normal. For example, the text vividly says, ""The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips, wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June."" The use of vocabulary such as ""tantalizing"" clearly expresses the cyclist's desperate need for water. Furthermore, later in the sentence, the narrator makes a direct reference to the old men, placing the entire blame on them for suggesting that ill - fated path. Readers can also conclude that the harsh setting of the essay, with its heat, rough terrain, and lack of water sources, greatly affected the cyclist's well - being and journey. In the end, the setting emerges as a major factor contributing to the cyclist's struggles."
361	6339	3	3	The features of the setting significantly affect the cyclist, making his travel an arduous task. The sweltering weather, with the sun blazing down mercilessly, leaves him extremely thirsty. As the towns along his route are abandoned, he finds no place to stock up on water. The terrain he has to cross is filled with numerous hills, and the road is in a poor condition, full of potholes and uneven surfaces. With the intense heat, lack of water, desolate ghost towns, and tough terrains, his journey becomes a formidable challenge to overcome. Despite all these obstacles in his way, he perseveres and is able to achieve his goal of getting water, proving his determination and resilience.
362	6340	3	3	The story “Rough Road ahead: Do not exceed Posted Speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie is about a man traveling through some extremely difficult settings. The cyclist's mood is clearly determined by the setting, as well as his personal needs and his strong determination to make it through. The setting of the story is early summer in California. The weather is described as blisteringly hot, with “The sun [beginning] to beat down” relentlessly. He “was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” Due to the excessive heat, he requires more water, which soon becomes the central conflict of this story. As things get increasingly difficult, his attitude towards the old men's advice changes from being grateful for their help to wishing he had never listened to them. Also, as the difficulty level rises, his determination to move on intensifies, as he keeps “telling [himself] if [he] could make it that far, [he'd] be fine.” Unfortunately for the cyclist, the setting's effect is entirely negative, posing numerous challenges to his journey.
363	6341	3	3	In the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” there are many features that significantly affected the cyclist. For example, as “The sun was beginning to beat down,” they started to feel the intense heat, which gradually made them hot and then tired. Then, when he came across all the bumps in the road, it became much harder to pedal the bike. He was also gulping down his bottle of water rapidly. This clearly shows that he was hot, getting tired, and starting to feel lost. The description “I got down on my hands and knees working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength” tells us that he was exerting himself too much. If he keeps working this hard, he'll be completely worn out and unable to ride. These are the main reasons why the features of the setting affected the cyclist so severely.
364	6342	3	3	First, the old men have a significant impact on the cyclist by throwing him off track. They do this by confidently telling him of a “shortcut” that they claim will take him right to his destination. However, after following their advice, the cyclist is faced with the rough rolling hills of a highway, which prove to be a much more challenging route than expected. Over his long and arduous journey, despite the difficulties thrown his way by the so - called “shortcut,” the cyclist still remains steadfast and determined to reach his destination, showing his unwavering resolve.
365	6343	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many detrimental ways. If the cyclist was riding his bike in a more temperate location in the middle of June, he wouldn't have gotten so severely dehydrated. This biker is currently riding in the high deserts of California, where the temperatures can reach up to 110 degrees. In contrast, in the middle of June in a more typical area, it barely reaches 70 degrees. Also, the desert is well - known for its barrenness. If he was riding somewhere else, there could be a gas station every mile, providing him with easy access to water. However, this cyclist is riding in “No Man's Land.” Lastly, the roads in the desert are a lot more dangerous. Since people rarely drive through these areas, no one regularly complains about the numerous potholes and other road issues. People are more concerned about the cities where many people travel, and there's no point in changing or filling pot holes where few people go. All these factors combined make the cyclist's journey in the desert extremely challenging.
366	6344	3	3	The setting really takes determination away from the cyclist. There were steep hills that made his ride extremely difficult. It says, “over one long crippling hill, a building came into view.” This clearly shows the hills were hard on him because he emphasizes they were long and crippling, sapping his energy with each pedal stroke. Another notable element in the setting was the building. He was extremely thirsty, and as he came to an abandoned grape juice factory, it said, “by the looks of it, it had been a @CAPS1 Grape Juice Factory and bottling plant.” These were two of several examples of the setting affecting the cyclist, demonstrating how the environment can pose significant challenges to his journey.
367	6345	3	3	The features of the setting have a major affect on the cyclist. It is a swelteringly hot day, and he is in a vast desert in California with a very limited water supply. As the sun beats down relentlessly, it starts becoming very hot, and his water supply begins to decrease quickly, leaving him parched. The old men who he says “have not left their porch since @PERSON1 was in office” gave him very wrong directions to Yosemite. Due to these inaccurate directions, he ended up getting lost out in the hot California desert, where the heat was almost unbearable. He eventually came to a small fishing store where he refreshed himself with a lot of water from the sink, quenching his thirst. Then he was off again on his way to Yosemite, hoping to reach his destination despite the challenges posed by the setting.
368	6346	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclists in a big way because the roads had broken bottles in them that could have easily caused him to get really hurt. One wrong move, and he could have had a flat tire or suffered a serious injury. Also, the water he was drinking was streaming, and it tasted like battery acid, making it almost undrinkable. Then came some rolling hills which would be another big challenge for him, requiring extra effort to pedal up. The setting was pretty barren for the cyclist because he also came across a venomous snake, adding to his sense of danger. Last, he thought he saw some mirages that tell me that the climate is extreme for the cyclists. The heat and the arid conditions were taking a toll on his mind and body. That’s how the setting affects the cyclists, presenting a series of obstacles that test his resilience.
369	6347	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist for a few reasons. One reason is that it makes it easier to vividly picture how the cyclist feels. The description of the scorching heat and harsh conditions allows the reader to empathize with his struggle. Also, it makes the cyclist seem a bit insane for doing what he’s doing in weather that he could, “drop from heatstroke.” The extreme heat is a constant threat to his well - being. @CAPS1 reason is that the weather is affecting the cyclist so bad that he’s seeing a mirage of a “building - abandoned years earlier.” This shows how the heat is playing tricks on his mind. The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the conditions seem impossible to make it in, yet he perseveres, highlighting the impact of the environment on his journey.
370	6348	3	3	Throughout the story, the cyclist describes the hot weather and harsh terrains of the midwest in his quest to find a source of water. He notes several times about the nice @DATE1 morning, which, as he pedals along, quickly warms into sweltering heat. The once - pleasant morning air turns into a stifling blanket of heat, making his journey more and more difficult. He also goes into detail about the change from flat ground to rolling hills on his journey. The flat ground gave him some respite, but the rolling hills required him to exert extra energy. These aspects make the story more immersive for the cyclist and give the reader a clear image of what he is going through, allowing us to understand the challenges he faces in his search for water.
371	6349	3	3	In the article “Do not exceed the posted speed limit,” the features of the setting took a toll on the cyclist in many ways. First off, the whole setting was a dry, dusty expanse that was not quite a desert but would wear down anybody. “The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it.” The heat affected the cyclist by dehydrating him severely, which brings me to the next point. “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” This extreme condition caused him to become even more dehydrated, resulting in him thinking he was going to die. Along the way, he found an old abandoned juice factory. The sight of this desolate place affected him by filling him with despair and hopelessness, causing him to push himself more and more to reach water. In the end, the features of the setting only made him more determined to reach water, spurring him on despite the hardships.
372	6350	3	3	The setting affected the cyclist in many ways. One way was the weather. In the story, it said “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June” (Kermaskie @NUM1). That quote indicates that he is in a desert, and deserts are usually warm. It also mentions June, which is typically a hot - temperature month. The weather affected the cyclist because it was scorching, and he started to become dehydrated with little water left. Another way the setting affected the cyclist was the surroundings. In the story, it said, “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind” (Kurmaskie). This means there was no one around to help him in case he got hurt or faced any issues. Also, there was nowhere nearby to get some water, leaving him in a vulnerable situation. Overall, the harsh weather and desolate surroundings made the cyclist's journey extremely challenging.
373	6351	3	3	Many of the features of the setting affect the cyclist. The most obvious and direct feature would be that this adventure took place in the “high deserts of California in June.” Analyzing about that passage reveals blistering heat; “high” meaning it is going to be closer to the sun, deserts where the world is hot, California, which is known to be smoggy at times, and June, which is the middle of summer. Also, the closest water supply was “somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees,” and there was a “long, crippling hill” all while the sun was beating down. All of these factors would most obviously affect the cyclist by making him extremely tired. He vividly explains this by expressing his fears of losing consciousness, showing just how much the setting was taking a toll on him.
374	6352	3	3	In the story, “Do not exceed posted speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affect the cyclist. One example is when the cyclist says “I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” This affects the cyclist because it makes him work harder when he is dying of thirst, especially on a hot summer day. The change in terrain makes his muscles work harder and use his strength more. In the summer time, it is extremely hot. When the cyclist is biking, it is sweltering; he says “... in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.” After this quote, he is explaining the difficulty of getting frustrated when there is no cold water. This affects the cyclist to think about water constantly and not bother to think about where he is. He could be lost as he didn't have a good map, leaving him in a precarious situation.
375	6353	3	3	As the cyclist goes on his trip, he is met with many dreary places and people. For starters, the old men he knew he shouldn't have trusted but did anyway. This led him through the desert. Even in a car, the desert can be a very despairing place. On a bicycle, it must be even worse, knowing that if you run out of water, no one will be there to save you from dehydration. The endlessly bleak landscapes also played a role in the cyclist's feelings. Another bad feature is the endless number of abandoned towns and spoiled water. Every time he thought he was saved, he was let down again by this fact. For example, he had to pump for minutes only to get bad - tasting water. Finally, just when his strength was about to give out, he found the bait place with water and a place to rest. Too bad there was another old man there. Despite this new encounter, the discovery of water and a place to rest gave him a glimmer of hope in this otherwise arduous journey.
376	6354	3	3	In the essay, the features of the cyclist affect the setting because the readers wouldn't have thought that he was in such severe danger if he hadn't been going through the vast desert. When the cyclist finally reached the grape factory, he stated that he was almost on the verge of dehydration. And then when he arrived at the bait shop, he eagerly drank from the faucet to quench his intense thirst. This shows how the cyclist's journey through the desert setting put him in a perilous situation.
377	6355	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist as there were long - rolling hills that continuously went up and down, which required a great deal of strength. Also, he barely had water because it was extremely hot; he kept drinking and ran out of water much earlier than expected. In the story, it says when he was riding, “He barely noticed that the sun was starting to beat down fiercely.” This quote clearly shows that it was starting to get swelteringly hot. Also, in the story, he says, “I checked my water supply.” This indicates that he's starting to realize his water is running short. So, in all, the setting is hot, abandoned, and there's no readily available water source. As a result, the cyclist is being significantly affected by all of these factors.
378	6356	3	3	SETTING WAS A CRUCIAL FACTOR IN THE STORY. IT WAS A DESERT, AND IN A DESERT, THERE IS A SEVERE LACK OF WATER. AND THE CYCLIST WAS ON A BIKE, WHICH IS HIGHLY DANGEROUS. BECAUSE YOU ARE USING YOUR FEET TO PEDAL AND MOVE FORWARD, WHICH TAKES OUT A LOT OF ENERGY, AND IT USES WATER FROM YOUR BODY TO KEEP YOU FUNCTIONING. ALL THESE ASPECTS OF THE SETTING PUT THE CYCLIST IN A PRECARIOUS SITUATION.
379	6357	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because he was laboriously biking up steep hills in extreme, scorching heat. He also had a very short water supply while heading in the wrong direction. This combination of difficult terrain, high temperature, and lack of water made his cycling journey extremely arduous and put him at risk. The heat sapped his energy, and the wrong direction meant he was further away from potential water sources. Overall, the setting had a highly negative impact on the cyclist's experience.
380	6358	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in multiple ways. The directions given to the cyclist by the elderly person were completely incorrect, and as a result, he got thoroughly lost in the unfamiliar area. The lack of water in the setting was so severe that it led to the desperate possibility of him sucking on pebbles to try and forget about his intense thirst. The long - rolling hills in the area caused the cyclist to use a large amount of extra energy. These were the significant effects the setting had on the cyclist, making his journey extremely challenging and dangerous.
381	6359	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist greatly. As she skillfully biked around a sharp bend, the wind rushed past, and “my troubles, thirsts, and fear were all behind me.” The surrounding scenery seemed to blur as the cyclist left her worries in the dust, finding a moment of peace and freedom on the road.
382	6360	3	3	In the story “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaskie, a cyclist set out on a bike ride in the sweltering heat of summer in California, where he was staying. Along the way, he met some friendly old people who kindly gave him a “short cut.” As he continued on, he found out that most of the places he was told about were desolate, abandoned ghost towns, devoid of a single drop of drinkable water. If he were in a different setting, like by a clear, flowing river or a natural spring, he would simply stop and drink from it. Or even if he was in a more populated, industrialized area, he could stop in any building and ask for a drink. But he was in the dry, hot, abandoned hills of California, parched and without any water. Under these harsh conditions, he grew tired, thirsty, dehydrated, and desperate for a drink. Finally, after what seemed like an eternity, he came upon a small bait shop that had water there, offering him much - needed relief.
383	6361	3	3	During the cyclist's journey, he was affected by the setting frequently. When he was cycling, the temperature started to rise, and it became very hot to him. At first, though, it wasn't so bad. “The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it.” This clearly proves that the cyclist was aware that it was getting hot, yet it did not have an immediate impact on him. Another factor that affected him was the time that he was traveling in. “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts in California in June.” This shows that the cyclist was constantly drinking because of the time of day and the month of the year he was out cycling. All of this indicates that the setting had a significant influence on the cyclist during his journey.
384	6362	3	3	I think that the features of the setting really do affect the way someone rides a bike because certain places have distinct types of terrain. Some types of terrain are not always suitable for a bike rider. For instance, if the ground is bumpy, with large rocks and uneven surfaces, then someone could easily fall off the bike. Also, if it is dark outside, you may not even be able to see where you are going, and you could hurt yourself very seriously. That’s why riding a bike in certain settings can be dangerous. On the other hand, if you are in an environment where everything is smooth, like a well - paved bike path, then you can have a nice, enjoyable bike ride.
385	6363	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in “Do not Exceed posted speed Limit” by changing him physically. He was in the arid California desert in the middle of June, with not a single drop of water left in his bottles. This harsh situation was taking a severe physical toll on him. The lack of water was making him weak, and his physical condition was also making him feel hopeless. He says, “It was a sad hopeless laugh mind you, but at least I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself.” So, the way he was suffering from dehydration physically affected his emotional state because he felt as though there was nothing he could do to improve his situation. Had he been in another place, for example, a coastal area where it does not get nearly as hot as in California, he would not have been suffering from dehydration and would not have been in such an isolated place. His cycling experience could be compared to the climbers who were lost in the snow storm in the Rocky Mountains. Instead of dehydration and heatstroke, however, they suffered from hypothermia. Had they been on a different mountain, there would have been no snow storm, and they would be fine. The outcome of this story and the climbers' situation was clearly determined by their respective settings.
386	6364	3	3	The conditions gave the cyclist no hope at some points because the intense heat of the land and the harsh features of the setting were so extreme. He had no hope, just like when the cyclist says, “I hope I make it to the horizon because there’s nothing else to compare.” He can’t say, “Let’s ride to the next building or mailbox” because there are none. The desolate desert features make the cyclist feel that it’s just him, and no one can help him. He fears he’ll die of dehydration. Then the features get even worse. He sees the Welch’s grapefruit building, giving him a glimmer of hope for survival. But then he finds out that it’s deserted, and that’s like the final straw. He gives up. The cyclist is almost unconscious when he runs into the fishing store where he has a sip of water. So, clearly, the features of the setting were the main reason the cyclist lost hope.
387	6365	3	3	The features of the setting affect the author because it leaves him dehydrated. The scorching desert sun makes the sweat pour out of him, and he has no water to replenish the electrolytes he loses. Also, once the author gets into the hills, he loses a significant amount of his energy. So, pedaling up the hills is a strenuous task. If I were the author, I would also have gotten tired because water is essential for the body to function and survive. In such a harsh setting, the lack of water and the challenging terrain take a toll on the author's physical state, making it clear that the setting has a profound impact on him.
388	6366	3	3	The features of the setting in “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” affect the cyclist greatly. In the cyclist's opinion, things began pretty well. He had a positive attitude as it states, “with strong legs and a smile on my face.” As the man moves on, he comes to a fort of sorts. To him, the sight was rather troubling. Though it was troubling, he still had the confidence that he could continue his journey. Next, he noticed the changes in the terrain. He explained, “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” This means that he would have to pedal harder and with greater force in order to get over the hills. The weather was sweltering, and the cyclist was running out of water. The possibility of heatstroke came to mind. “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind,” as told by the man. His mind entered a state of sad and hopeless thoughts, but he persevered and cycled on. At this point, he was extremely thirsty and felt his death was near. He said, “I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.” As he kept going, he spotted an old guy in sight. He regained a bit of hope and moved ahead. The features of this story affected the cyclist physically and mentally. Physically, he was exhausted and worn out. In this horrible state, mentally, he was becoming negative and pessimistic about his travel. Undoubtedly, the setting's features interfered with the cyclist's physical and mental state.
389	6367	3	3	In this story, “No Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” by Joe Kurmaskie, I believe the setting greatly affects the cyclist. I believe this because when it’s a long, downhill, cool road, the cyclist is fine. But if it is a straight uphill road and extremely hot, he feels like he can’t keep pedaling. The cyclist gets very weary when the setting is out in the hot desert with no one around. The blistering heat and the isolation make the journey seem endless and arduous. So, the setting has a huge affect on the mood in this story. Another example shows how the setting can either make the cyclist's journey enjoyable or a struggle, clearly demonstrating its significant impact.
390	6368	3	3	A cyclist is a bike rider. They can ride in groups with different people or they can be a solo cyclist. Some cyclists go for just a few miles when riding their bikes, while others can go for much longer distances, like @NUM1 miles. Some cyclists take on challenging terrains; they go over hills and through water. They do a lot with their biking adventures. They must have a good amount of free time on their hands to be able to ride a bike that far. Whether it's a short ride or a long - distance journey, cyclists are dedicated to their activity, and the various ways they experience cycling show their passion.
391	6369	3	3	The setting is as hot as a sweltering desert, with not a soul in sight, and the air is extremely dry. The intense heat outside takes a toll on the cyclist as he is drenched in sweat and desperately needs water. The searing heat gradually wears him down. Having no one around means he has no one to turn to for water, which is essential for his long - distance journey. These adverse conditions make him weak and make it even more arduous for him to find a place where he can get a drink. In such a situation, his journey becomes an uphill battle, but he perseveres, hoping to find water soon.
392	6370	3	3	The setting can significantly affect the cyclist, and it can be either a positive or a negative factor. If a cyclist is able to adjust his own settings according to the situation, such as adapting his speed, gear, or riding style, that is a good thing as it allows him to better cope with the environment. However, if someone else meddles with his settings without his knowledge, it could lead to problems. For example, incorrect gear adjustments might make pedaling too difficult or too easy, affecting his efficiency and comfort. In conclusion, the cyclist should have control over his settings to ensure a smooth and successful ride.
393	6371	3	3	In this narrative of a cyclist riding in California and heading for Yosemite National Park, he faces numerous challenges. He encounters a shortage of water and gets bad directions from a group of old men sitting on a porch. The setting plays a crucial role in his “challenge,” ranging from the tall pine trees to the desolate barren hills. At the beginning of his trip, he passes through a “ghost town” that clearly has seen better days. The dilapidated buildings and empty streets present him with his first doubt, and he continues his journey with caution. Then, he comes across the pines that, “had my name written all over them.” The sight of these pines gives him hope and reassurance, making him feel more confident about his journey. However, the rusty pump and the “ramshackle shed” that follow take away that hope and reassurance, making him cautious once again. The steep hills that require him to work hard to get over, the snake that crosses his path and slows him down, and the abandoned Welch’s juice company all add to his troubles. Finally, he gets some water at a bathroom, and everything seems better. If the setting had remained the same throughout the journey, he wouldn't have experienced the rise and fall of hope, and the story wouldn't be as interesting. The changing setting keeps the story engaging and showcases the cyclist's resilience.
394	6372	3	3	Winding hills, limited water sources, and poor directions are the main troubles faced by this cyclist. First, he approaches a group of old men sitting on a porch. These old men, who haven't been outside of their porch in a while, give him very bad directions. Then, he passes through the first town. In his haste or perhaps due to oversight, he doesn't fill his water bottles. As he continues, he gets lost and soon runs out of water. His situation seems dire until he finds a fishing store. There, he not only finds water to quench his thirst but also meets people who are kind enough to give him a better map. With the water and the new map, he is better equipped to continue his journey and overcome the challenges that lie ahead.
395	6373	3	3	The lack of water and the absence of proper direction have a significant impact on the cyclist. Water is crucial for the cyclist, as he himself said in the essay “I could drop from heatstroke” (Kurmaskie). In the scorching heat, without an adequate supply of water, his body is at risk of overheating and succumbing to heat - related illnesses. Moreover, having no direction is another major issue. Without clear directions, he will end up riding aimlessly for a long time, wasting his energy and time. This aimless riding can also lead to increased stress and frustration. In conclusion, the shortage of water and the lack of direction are the primary problems that the cyclist faces in the story, and they make his journey a difficult one.
396	6374	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he confidently thought he had packed enough water, so he set off on his way. As he cycled, the heat of the surroundings was taking a toll. He drank most of his water in less than half the journey to his destination. He didn't truly realize how hot it was until he was down to his last couple of sips of water. Soon, he started to become dehydrated. He then remembered that the old men had said the next town was about eighteen miles away, so he gritted his teeth and kept on going. When he finally reached the town, there was nothing to drink, just an old, run - down factory. In desperation, he took some rocks and started sucking on them for a bit of moisture. But then, as he went over a bump, he accidentally swallowed one. He said to himself that next time he would just go by what the map said, as everything he had passed on the way had been run - down and abandoned. Finally, he reached a bait shop and went inside the bathroom to get some much - needed water, relieved that his ordeal was over.
397	6375	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist a great deal. For example, the terrain had no hills, but the heat made him get dehydrated quickly. He was cycling down this rusty, bumpy road, which jolted him around and didn't help his dehydration at all. The constant movement on the rough road made him lose more energy and water. And another example would be that he found a plane wreck on the side of the road. He thought it could be a place where he could take a short break and figure out the best way to get where he was going. In the end, it was clear that the features of the setting had a significant and mostly negative impact on the cyclist's journey.
398	6376	3	3	The cyclist goes through many natural settings that affect him. First of all, he rides into a vast barren land. The desolate expanse seemed to stretch on forever. The cyclist portrayed this barrenness vividly by saying “it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.” This was in response to the first “town” he came across. The once - inhabited place was now empty, with broken buildings and overgrown weeds. Next, he speaks of a large snake that slithered close to him. The snake was a real danger, with its menacing eyes and sharp fangs. But luckily, he quickly and skillfully maneuvered out of its way. But the worst setting the cyclist had to deal with was the lack of water. In the hot and dry environment, water was scarce, and this is a threat to any living creature. But in the end, he found a small water source. After quenching his thirst, he was able to continue his journey, and the story ended fine as he overcame the challenges posed by the natural settings.
399	6377	3	3	In the essay “Rough Road ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” the setting relates to how the author is feeling. At first, when the author sees the abandoned first “town,” he is not too worried about it and moves on. “I chuckled, checked my water supply, and moved on. The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it.” At this point, the author is okay, and still has enough water to keep him going. Next, as he pedals on, he starts to get low on water. The heat of the high deserts of California in June is intensifying, and he becomes more panicked. This panic in turn makes the day seem even hotter. “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” Since the author is low on water, the day seems to get worse. Afterward, he continues on and runs into a rattlesnake. The sight of the dangerous snake makes him even more panicked. “And a ridiculously large snake. It really did look like a diamond back - blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me. I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.” However, when he got to the bait store and drank from the sink, things didn't seem so bad anymore. There was no more talk about water nor the heat. As a result, it's clear that the setting was closely related to the author's moods throughout the journey.
400	6378	3	3	The features of the setting did affect the cyclist in this small story. In this story, the setting is a hot, dry terrain which can be better explained by the name California. The arid desert climate was like an oven. The heat of the desert climate seems to start having an effect on him about after he reaches the first town. I know this by his statement. “This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time – say, before the last war – but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town. I chuckled, checked my water supply and moved on. The sun was beginning to beat down. The summer heat was intense during this time of the day, and he was drinking lots of water to stay hydrated. So, this setting does affect him greatly. It causes him to use his water supply at a rapid rate and it causes him to begin the process of dehydration. I know how the summer heat can affect you during outdoor activities. At times it feels like you are going to die, but there's always hope around the bend, just like for the cyclist who eventually found a way to deal with the harsh setting.
401	6379	3	3	"In Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit, the features of the desolate setting are extremely devastating to the cyclist's condition. Cycling ""@CAPS1 through the arid high desert of California"" is surely never an easy task to begin with. Under the scorching sun, without proper hydration, people often suffer heatstrokes or pass out, and in some severe cases, even perish. It is entirely worse for this cyclist because of the strenuous effort he is exerting, pedaling laboriously over “short, rolling hills.” Even worse, the trail that a few very old, eccentric men set to run on does not do much in the way of helping with a depleted water supply. The first town the cyclist comes across easily splits “the traditional definition of a ghost town,” with dilapidated buildings and an eerie silence. The only other water pump he comes to emits only sewage and incredibly hot brackish water. Therefore, the intense heat is only made worse by the false look of water on the cyclist's path. This combination of harsh features in the setting causes a great deal of distress to the cyclist, almost pushing him to the brink of death."
402	6380	3	3	There are many ways the setting affected the cyclist in this story, such as the sweltering weather, the scarce supply of food and water, the wrong estimation for old people, and the bumpy road. First off, the weather was extremely dry, and the temperature soared up to two hundred degrees. The searing heat made the cyclist sweat profusely and gasp for air as it was hard to breathe. The supply of water was extremely harsh, with very little water available around at all. When he tried to get water from the pumps, they would pump out not clean water but rather murky and undrinkable substances. The scorching weather and the scarce water supply were two major factors that had a significant impact on the cyclist, making his journey extremely arduous.
403	6381	3	3	"In the beginning of the story, the author is in high spirits, but towards the end, she grows increasingly upset. ""I rode into the morning with strong legs and a bright smile on my face” (@NUM1). This clearly shows how the author is in a good mood and happy to be on this adventure. She is on a journey full of hope, feeling as if no one can dampen her enthusiasm. Then, the story takes an unexpected turn. “With what I believed was my last burst of energy, I carefully maneuvered down the steep hill,” (@NUM2). After getting lost in a desolate town that seems far removed from any signs of life, the author suddenly hears the voices of people! She is extremely relieved to have found anyone who can offer her help. She gets much - needed water and is forever grateful. The desolate setting is truly horrifying to her because it makes her feel as if she can't survive even if she were a local. She felt utterly alone and feared that she would die in this desolate place. If the setting was in a bustling city surrounded by tall buildings, the author would still feel some sense of security even without water, as there would be more chances of getting help."
404	6382	3	3	The features of the setting have a profound impact on the cyclist. The main reasons are related to the water and the hills. One significant reason is the water situation. After he refilled his water bottles all the way up, the water was cooled down, which was a brief relief. However, as he continued his journey, the water quickly became scarce again. My last reason is the challenging rolling hills. These hills require the cyclist to exert a great amount of energy as he pedals up and down, making his ride much more difficult. Overall, the combination of the water issue and the rolling hills in the setting affects the cyclist's progress and well - being.
405	6383	3	3	There are features such as the blazing heat radiating off the sun, “short, rolling hills” that seem never - ending, and a complete lack of water sources. There was also the fact that the rider felt as if he was in the middle of nowhere, surrounded by nothing but desolation. This has a great effect on the cyclist, both physically and emotionally. The intense heat saps his energy rapidly, the lack of water leaves him parched and weak, and the constant uphill riding against the slopes of the rolling hills can take a huge amount of energy out of someone, making it extremely hard to keep pedaling. Not to mention, with no sign of help or water in sight, there isn't much hope left, which eliminates the whole “mind over matter” thing. All the harsh features of the setting put together can lead to major trouble for the cyclist, endangering his life and making his journey a life - threatening ordeal.
406	6384	3	3	Features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. After about @NUM1 miles, as the cyclist's throat grew parched and he was in desperate need of water supply, he found a rusty pipe. First, a tarlike substance oozed out of it, followed by a brackish water substance. When cycling, clean water is an absolute necessity. Next, the terrain gradually changed from being flat to very hilly. When already in need of water, facing hilly terrain is the last thing a cyclist wants as it poses more challenges. Later on along the road, there were no cars passing by or any buildings in sight. When the cyclist was feeling at his worst, he would have wanted someone to be near in case he fell out, but the road was completely deserted. Lastly, seeing the old Welch's Grape Juice Factory would surely affect the cyclist. Having the image of a drink factory right in front of him but knowing it was out of business must have made him feel like he would never make it through this arduous journey. These features of the setting had to affect the cyclist, making his cycling experience extremely tough.
407	6385	3	3	The features in the setting dramatically affect the cyclist. Initially, everything was going fine for the cyclist until he ran out of water and reached the hills. If he were in a more populated area like Callada, he wouldn't have become dehydrated so easily. However, the hills were not only a physical challenge but also played tricks on his mind. The most important setting element is the Welch's grape juice factory. He would have been able to quench his thirst with all the grape juice he wanted, but unfortunately, it was abandoned. He calls it an ironic twist. And the last significant setting is the bait shop that saved his life. There, an old man kindly offered him directions, which gave him a glimmer of hope in this difficult journey. Overall, the various features of the setting had a profound impact on the cyclist's experience.
408	6386	3	3	The features of the setting effect the cyclist because he was in the middle of nowhere, surrounded by vast emptiness, with no water or direction. The man was extremely thirsty as there was no water left in his water bottle. As time passed, his thirst became more and more unbearable. I found an example to show that he was thirsty. “The speed limit was @NUM1. I was doing a water - depleting @NUM2. Sometimes life can feel so cruel”. By saying he was doing @NUM2 when it should have been @NUM1, he was clearly indicating that he was getting very exhausted and desperately needed water to get him feeling refreshed once again. Also, the fact that there was no one in sight to give him direction affected him too. He didn't know where the next refuge was. “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind”. From the man's point of view, he probably thought civilization was many more miles away and he likely couldn't make it that far. The setting affected him by making him probably begin to stress or panic a lot for the most part, making his cycling journey a nightmare.
409	6387	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example, he feels extremely dehydrated and tired because he is riding through the scorching desert under the blazing sun and has a severe lack of water. I often feel the same way when jogging for extended periods of time, so I can empathize with his situation. The men in the story “who haven’t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office” also add an interesting element to the story. Due to their advice, the cyclist takes an unmarked shortcut that turns out to be a horrible choice, filled with rough terrain and obstacles. The Welch’s factory affects the cyclist because it intensifies his thirst and makes him constantly think about getting a drink. The sign showing grape juice looks irresistibly appealing to him, driving him to keep moving forward in search of anything to drink. The terrain change also affects the cyclist because it forces him to work even harder to pedal up the hills now rather than just smoothly ride on flat terrain. All these setting features combined make the cyclist's journey extremely difficult.
410	6388	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example, in paragraph @NUM1 it says, “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” The intense heat the cyclist experienced, since he was in a desert during the hot month of June, made him dehydrate at a much faster rate. The sweltering heat made him drink more water, causing him to run out of water more quickly. Then, in an attempt to conserve water, he would try not to drink, but this would cause him to dehydrate even more as he was losing body fluid in sweat. Secondly, in paragraph @NUM2 it says, “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” These hills affect the cyclist because he has to exert more energy to cycle up the hills. This extra effort causes him to become exhausted more quickly than he would on flat land. If the setting had been different, such as not being in a hilly desert, the cyclist would not have become as dehydrated and tired as he did. In conclusion, the features of the setting, including the heat and the hilly terrain, affect the cyclist in many ways, making his cycling journey a real struggle.
411	6389	3	3	The features of the setting directly affect the cyclist. “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” This affects the cyclist because in June, the high - desert climate is extremely hot. The arid desert environment exacerbates the heat, causing the cyclist to continuously drink water until his supply runs out. As he pedals, he expends energy, which makes him sweat profusely, further increasing his need for water. “One ramshackle shed. Several rusty pipes and a corral that couldn't hold the lamest mule greeted me.” This desolate scene presents a problem as there is no available water source. The cyclist has to conserve his remaining water and limit his energy expenditure. Clearly, cycling in a water - scarce desert setting has a far greater impact on the cyclist than cycling on a cold day.
412	6390	3	3	The cyclist in, “Do not exceed posted speed limit,” was affected greatly by the features of the setting. First of all, the weather was extremely hot, and this sweltering heat makes one feel completely exhausted, as if they have no energy to do anything. Moreover, there is no one in sight. The cyclist is all alone in this vast expanse, which makes her feel small and helpless. I can relate to this feeling; when I'm in an empty place, I tend to get scared. Finally, there is no water around. It's obvious that the author is dying of thirst. The lack of any visible resources around her makes her perception of thirst even more acute. All these factors in the setting combine to have a significant and negative impact on the cyclist.
413	6391	3	3	The setting affected the cyclist in multiple ways. The rough roads made it extremely difficult for the cyclist to pedal. The uneven surface and bumps on the roads constantly challenged his balance and strength as he tried to move forward. Additionally, he encountered a snake during his ride through the “town.” The sudden appearance of the snake startled the cyclist, making his heart race and his hands tremble on the handlebars. To make matters worse, he was running out of water. When he finally found some water, it tasted like battery acid, which was not only unpalatable but also made him question its safety. Overall, the setting was very rough on the cyclist, presenting a series of hardships during his journey.
414	6392	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by making him tired, scared, thirsty, and causing him to worry. The setting was a scorching hot California day in June. The cyclist was riding through the intense heat, struggling over the hills and difficult terrain. He describes the land when he says, “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” These rolling hills required extra effort to climb, gradually wearing him down. He also mentions, “Over one long, crippling hill,” which shows the extreme physical challenge he faced. As the cyclist progresses further, self - doubt creeps in. Fear and thirst start to take over him. He says, “It didn't really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean,” expressing his despair. When the cyclist finds the bait shop, he has almost lost all hope. On his way to the shop, he says, “Slowly gaining elevation while losing hope.” However, at the end, the sight of the bait shop makes the cyclist regain his strength. He says, “Then, as easily as rounding a bend, my troubles, thirst, and fear were all behind me.” The features of the setting put the cyclist on an unsteady ride filled with fear, hope, and confidence.
415	6393	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by helping him get water to quench his intense thirst. After suffering from the lack of water for a long time, he finally finds a source that allows him to rehydrate. This enables him to get back on the road and continue his journey to wherever he is trying to go. However, one notable aspect is that he never mentions getting his bait for the fish. It seems that his focus was primarily on survival and getting water. Additionally, the cyclist was severely affected as he almost died from thirst and the lack of a proper road. The harsh setting put his life at risk, but the discovery of water gave him a new lease on his journey.
416	6394	3	3	He is in a race, desperately trying to reach Yosemite while being close to some rushing river.
417	6395	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. Having desert stretches makes you want to just lay there and not try to go any further, because you don’t know where the end will be. The scorching sun and the endless expanse of sand can be extremely demoralizing. As for grassy, flowery land, it offers more of a scenic route, and makes you want to keep going and see many things. The gentle breeze and the colorful flowers create a pleasant atmosphere. Hills and terrain make it harder to keep going but more of a challenge, and a good workout at the same time. Clearly, the setting does affect the cyclist.
418	6396	3	3	When the cyclist first receives directions to Yosemite Park from the “old timers” he met, he was pretty confident that they knew what they were talking about. He thought they had years of experience and local knowledge. To his dismay, these elderly men sent him through life - threatening conditions in a deserted area. As the cyclist begins his journey through the hot, June weather, he “rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.” He was full of enthusiasm at the start. As he continues forward, he notices that there are no buildings, cars, or people of any kind. The silence was eerie. He passes abandoned towns and creeps into the desert flat land. The flatland however, morphs into crippling hills with tumbleweeds and snakes awaiting. Not only is the terrain suddenly different, but the cyclist is rapidly deteriorating. Tiredness and lack of water make the cyclist think “I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.” It was amazing that through all this, the cyclist was able to reach a small fishing camp where he is quickly replenished. “Gary and Wilber’s Fish Camp” saved the cyclist from almost certain death and taught him to always just use his map.
419	6397	3	3	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead Do Not Exceed posted Speed Limit.” The features of the area the cyclists rides through affect him greatly. For example, when the narration says, “At some point, humble weeds crossed my path” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The presence of these unassuming weeds in the desolate landscape shows the tone of the cyclist with despair creeping into his mind. Also, another good example is when the narration says, “After a long, arduous hill, a building came into view” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The sudden sight of the building makes the cyclist sound more hopeful than before. That is how the area the cyclist enters affects his state of mind.
420	6398	3	3	In the story the cyclist is affected by many features of the desert. The main feature is the heat. “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” The intense heat was almost unbearable. He’s also running low on water, “The water bottles only contained a few tantalizing sips.” The limited amount of water was a constant worry. He’s faced by extreme heat and lack of water. He’s tired and has a long way to go. So far, all of the towns have been deserted. The emptiness added to his sense of isolation. Finally he reaches a bait shop and refills his water and promised to stick to the map in the future, realizing that relying on others' directions can be risky.
421	6399	3	3	In the essay, the setting affects the cyclist in different ways. For example, the course must have been tough because he was visibly dehydrated, with his lips parched and his energy waning. It is described that there are rolling hills and rough roads, which would have made pedaling extremely strenuous. Another example is that there were dangerous animals like snakes that he unexpectedly came across on the path. These slithering creatures added an element of fear and distraction. In conclusion, these are some reasons how the setting significantly affects the cyclist.
422	6400	3	3	The terrain described in this essay adds a profound effect to the struggles of the cyclist. For example, when the author says “there were no cars nor buildings in sight,” it vividly adds to the effect that he is truly out in the middle of nowhere, surrounded by an empty expanse. Also, it adds a great deal of impact when he comes upon an abandoned juice factory. He is so desperately thirsty that he puts stones in his mouth to gather even a tiny bit of saliva. Moreover, when he finally finds water, an “old - timer” casually asks if he knows the best way to go, which further emphasizes his isolation and the challenges of the journey. In conclusion, the terrain and these encounters effectively illustrate the cyclist's arduous struggles.
423	6401	3	3	In the essay, the cyclist is riding in the desert. It is extremely hot out because it’s June, and the sweltering heat causes a lot of problems for him. He said that since it was so hot, he was afraid of getting dehydrated, constantly worrying about his dwindling water supply. Also, he explains that the roads were getting hilly, with the inclines becoming steeper. This would have caused him to work much harder, meaning he was losing more water through heavy sweating. In conclusion, the combination of the desert heat and hilly roads poses significant challenges to the cyclist.
424	6402	3	3	The features of the setting negatively affect the cyclist. When the cyclist arrived at the first “town,” he could immediately tell there’d be some issues. It was a deserted, run - down area with dilapidated buildings and a desolate atmosphere. The water was hot, making it unappealing and less effective in quenching his thirst. Down the road, the setting started to change from flat land to hills, which required more physical effort. There was a big snake in the road, startling him and causing a momentary loss of focus. He was becoming very dehydrated going through hilly areas with little to no water, his body gradually weakening. In conclusion, the various negative features of the setting severely hamper the cyclist's journey.
425	6403	3	3	I think it explains because they did a decent job, showing some competence and effort. However, it was not entirely good either because they did the right thing in some aspects, but they also made the same kind of mistakes. For instance, they followed a correct procedure in part, but then repeated a wrong step that undermined their progress. In conclusion, their performance was a mix of right and wrong actions, which is why the situation is as it is.
426	6404	3	3	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not @CAPS1 Posted Speed Limit,” by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the sweltering and desolate setting significantly affect the cyclist. Dehydration, caused by the intense heat and not having enough water, made the cyclist constantly sweat and feel nauseous. “Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from a heatstroke, caused me to laugh.” In this quote, he is thinking about all the bad and horrible things that could happen to him because he is already in a bad physical and mental state. In conclusion, these features of the setting, like the heat and lack of water, have a detrimental impact on the cyclist.
427	6405	3	3	The features of the harsh desert setting affect the cyclist in a big way. For one, the intense “heat beating down on him made him sweaty, extremely hot and utterly tired. The relentless heat had also made him extremely thirsty, which led him to drink a lot of water in a very little amount of time. As a result, he ran out of water before reaching the next town. Also, since he was in the vast desert, there were no trees to give him the shade that he could rest in. There were also no people around to help him or give him a much - needed drink of water. So, during the ride, he struggled more than he ever thought he could, facing the full brunt of the unforgiving environment.
428	6406	3	3	Some of the things that affect the cyclist was the severe lack of water. “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.” Water is of great importance to strong men. Your body needs water to function right. The extremely humid and dry weather of California was also an issue. “The high deserts of California in June.” “I could drop from a heatstroke.” The sun is unbearable, especially without shade and water, having a huge affect on the cyclist. The lack of human presence “There was No - one in sight.” It would have been a lot easier for the cyclist if a store or people would have been around. Another factor is the presence of animals. “A @CAPS3 large snake crossed my path.” “A diamondback blocked the majority of the pavement.” It was an added worry for the cyclist. These are all things that affect the cyclist and make his journey extremely difficult.
429	6407	3	3	Rolling hills, open terrain, high deserts - all are prominent features of the setting that affect the cyclist. First, the long - stretching rolling hills could gradually take a great deal of energy out of the cyclist when having to travel for miles on end, constantly pedaling up and down. The open terrain exposes the cyclist to the unrelenting beating sun, which also puts a lot of physical and mental pressure on the cyclist. Lastly, high deserts would have a significant affect on the cyclist because he has to pedal for miles on end in the rough and dry terrain, putting a great strain on his body overall. In summary, these setting features make the cyclist's journey arduous.
430	6408	3	3	In the case of the cyclist in the story, “Do Not Exceed Posted speed limit,” the setting has an enormous affect on the biker. Predominantly, the scorching weather causes him to feel severely dehydrated. He says that he “had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly.” @CAPS1, he tries to get water from the old well, demonstrating just how desperately he needed water. The water in this pump, the owner said, was “somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.” If the water has reached such a high temperature, the reader can infer that it must be extremely hot outside. The author implied this when he says he is in California in June, it is a sweltering day, and the sun was beating down mercilessly. Another aspect of the setting, the lane, dirty, “ghost town” infested land, had a large affect on the cyclist. As he begins to look around, he loses hope. He cannot see any signs of human life; “there was no one in sight, not a building, car or structure of any kind.” This empty land makes the cyclist himself feel empty inside. Most literally, the fact that the setting was unknown to the cyclist added to his confusion. He didn't know the best path to his destination and therefore relied on others for aid. Because of this, he ends up lost and in a difficult situation. In conclusion, the setting, with its weather, desolation and unfamiliarity, severely impacts the cyclist's journey.
431	6409	3	3	There were many different conditions that affected the cyclist. He did not have the proper amount of water for the long and arduous journey, which made it extremely difficult. He states in the story, “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.” Additionally, the rough terrain and numerous hills made it difficult. He ran into snakes and passed through very deserted country. But his unwavering determination led to success, and he finally arrived into a town, relieved to have overcome the challenges.
432	6410	3	3	"In the short story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”, the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. When he arrives in the first “town” that the old men told him to go to, the cyclist “chuckled and moved on”, and acted just sort of indifferent, showing little interest to seeing this old and dilapidated town. As he reached “the fork of sorts” twenty miles up the road, ""the sight was troubling to him as his water supply was somewhat deteriorating, so he became a bit uncertain. Finally when the cyclist read the sign that said “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”, the author continued to move on, but with a large chunk of his confidence gone. He was dehydrated, fatigued, and had lost a lot of hope after coming across all these desolate places. When he saw the sign for Gary and Wilber’s fish camp, he was as happy as could be, knowing he would drink some water, rest, continue his journey the next day, and not listen to old men’s directions again. Many people in stories or in real life are affected by the setting they are in. In the novel *The* Champions by *Author*, one of the characters named *Group* went on a journey to find an art exhibition, running into many problems on the way, which in many cases, gave him a lack of hope in reaching his destination safely. The influence of setting on characters is a common and significant aspect in both literature and real - world experiences."
433	6411	3	3	Some features can affect the cyclist. The weather can slow them down. For example, if it was extremely cold outside, the cyclist's muscles could stiffen, and if it was swelteringly hot, they could quickly become dehydrated, both of which can slow the person down. If the person does not have proper gear to deal with such weather conditions, the impact on their cycling performance can be even more severe. In conclusion, weather is an important setting feature that can have a notable effect on cyclists.
434	6412	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by the road that he was on. He was on a road that had snakes slithering around, and the trees were all fallen across the road, creating obstacles. The road was like a snake because it was winding and waved. It had a huge hill that made you go fast when descending, and it was hard to start going up because the hill was steep and slippery. It was so challenging that no one would ride that hill casually. If it was a popular race, then it would have been easier to ride the hill because there would be more people around. There would be some people who could help you if you get hurt. There is also no lights there. If you ride at night, then you can’t see where you are going unless you put a light on your bike or helmet, and then you can ride the hill at night with more ease. These are the features of the setting that affect the cyclist going down a hill where no one is there to help you if you need it. In such a situation, the cyclist has to rely solely on their own skills and equipment to navigate the challenging road.
435	6413	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because there was a lot of detours and distractions where the cyclist rode. The detours could lead the cyclist off - course, and the distractions, such as unexpected wildlife or strange noises, could divert their attention. The cyclist had to pay full attention to the road or else the cyclist could have been seriously injured. The features of the setting also affect the cyclist because he has to go down steep hills and navigate through windy turns. Going down steep hills requires careful control of speed, and windy turns demand precise steering. In conclusion, the features of the setting have a huge affect on the cyclist, influencing their safety, speed, and overall cycling experience.
436	6414	3	3	Setting can affect a cyclist in many ways. Just as I read in the story, being in a sweltering desert dehydrated him severely. The scorching heat was unbearable, the rough and bumpy road made the ride extremely difficult, and there were the lurking dangers of poisonous snakes. The cyclist could have died in many ways such as: heatstroke from the intense heat, falling off his bike on the uneven terrain, dehydration due to the lack of water, and a bite from a venomous snake. Say, if the cyclist was in the mountains of Colorado. There are many problems that face you there, like steep slopes, cold temperatures, and unpredictable weather. In conclusion, different settings pose various threats to cyclists.
437	6415	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist by causing him to be hit with his water bottle regularly as he jolted along the rough paths. The high deserts of California, with their arid expanse and intense heat, affected him greatly. Also, “Not many miles into the next section of the ride, he noticed a significant terrain change.” For example, the previously flat roads were replaced by short, rolling hills that required more effort to pedal. Then after overcoming that challenge, “A large highway sign jumped out at him saying or reading,” “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not exceed Posted Speed Limit. And that was 55 miles per hour. This forced him to slow down and be more cautious. Last, the author says, “Sometimes life can feel so cruel.” In conclusion, there were many things that affected the cyclist, from the terrain to the road signs.
438	6416	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. One way is that they would drink up all of their water because it was extremely hot and they would get desperately thirsty from all of that strenuous cycling under the blazing sun. The heat made the water evaporate quickly from their bodies, leaving them parched and in need of constant hydration. In conclusion, the hot setting had a significant impact on the cyclist's water consumption.
439	6417	3	3	In the essay entitled “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not exceed the speed limit” the setting changes as does the mood of the essay as well as the mood of the cyclist. For example, towards the beginning of the essay, at the peaceful reservoir campground outside of Lodi, California, the essay states, “At a reservoir campground outside of Lodi, California, I enjoyed the serenity of an early summer evening.” This shows how towards the beginning of the essay the cyclist is happy, just woke up feeling refreshed and getting ready to go on a nice, leisurely bike ride. However, this all changes when he gets directions from a couple of “old - timers.” From that point on, his trip goes downhill. The essay states, “About forty miles into the pedal, I arrived at the first ‘town,’ a desolate ghost town,” “The sun was beginning to beat down mercilessly,” This also shows that the setting of a ghost town and a setting with the sun beating down is affecting the mood of the essay and the mood of the cyclist. As he goes another twenty miles to a different ghost town with only a few rusty water pumps containing acid - flavored water. At this point, the cyclist is very worried because it's hot and he has no water, while knowing he has another thirty miles to go. Thirty miles of rolling hills and the hot sun while seeing a “A Rough Road Ahead” sign and a diamondback snake, he is sure he is going to die. However, it all changes when a different sign, one for a baitshop, offers a glimmer of hope. This is how the author, Joe Kurmaskie, uses the setting to affect the mood.
440	6418	3	3	The dusty, dry setting has a serious effect on the cycling author. It got so long and hot that, “...a slow blues tune ‘summer time’ rattled around in...my deteriorating brain.” The author has spent so long cycling through the searing heat that his brain is starting to shut down. It’s also because there is very little water left for him, and what little water he has is warm and unpalatable. Another problem is that every building/town except the last building is deserted. So without any chance of being refueled and restocked with food and water, it’s the author v.s nature. Plus, as the author states, the directions came from old people who, “...haven’t left their porches since Carter was in office.” The world has greatly changed. Towns have become deserted, buildings rundown but the roads are kept in shape. The towns the old people mention are now ghost towns, and are no help to the author. In conclusion, the harsh setting and unreliable directions have put the author in a difficult situation.
441	6419	3	3	"As the cyclist continues on his ride, the once - familiar and pleasant surroundings gradually transform. These changes in the environment ultimately have a profound impact on the cyclist's attitude. When he first set out on his journey to Yosemite that morning, he started with strong, well - rested legs and a wide smile on his face. He had eagerly received travel information from a few of the older, local residents. They assured him that this advice would help cut down the time it took to arrive at Yosemite National Park. However, as he pedaled along, the cyclist began to realize that perhaps the older men's travel advice was a bit out of date. With only a tiny bit of water left to hydrate himself and being surrounded by seemingly endless stretches of road and desolate desert, the cyclist couldn't help but let out a laugh. ""It was a sad, hopeless laugh, mind you, but at least I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself."" At this point, the cyclist was angry with himself for not just relying on the map he had brought instead of blindly listening to the locals. Although he remained determined to find water, his hope was steadily waning. Then, suddenly, he came across a bait store. Here, he was able to quickly rehydrate himself. With his spirits renewed, he continued on his journey, this time firmly relying on his map to guide him."
442	6420	3	3	The cyclist was riding on a rough, bumpy, and extremely dangerous road. The uneven surface made each pedal stroke a challenge, and he constantly had to adjust his balance. He had to be constantly on the lookout for wild animals that might try to attack or even kill him. There were snakes slithering near the roadside and coyotes lurking in the distance. Since he had no water left in his bottles, he was rapidly dehydrating. His throat was parched, and his energy was draining fast. Also, the road was hot, and despite it being well - traveled, it seemed to soak up his energy. Every bit of effort to get through it was a struggle. In this harsh situation, he knew he had to find water soon to keep going.
443	6421	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist significantly. It looks as if he is on a long, desolate highway in the middle of the desert, riding either his motorcycle or bike. The vast expanse of the desert around him gives an impression that he is either coming from or going on a vacation. The way he is riding, with the wind whipping through his hair and his body leaning forward, makes it seem like he is going extremely fast, almost on the verge of losing control and falling. The hot desert sun beats down on him, adding to the sense of urgency and danger in his ride. This setting not only impacts his physical state but also his mental state, making him more cautious and aware of his surroundings.
444	6422	3	3	The cyclist is out in the vast, arid desert. The scorching sun has been beating down on him all day, and he has been pedaling for hours. As a result, he is extremely tired. His legs feel like lead, and his arms are sore from gripping the handlebars. Also, he is running out of water. The little water he had brought with him is almost gone, and he is getting severely dehydrated. His lips are chapped, and his throat is dry and scratchy. He knows he has to find water soon or his situation will become life - threatening.
445	6423	3	3	"The setting of the story affected the cyclist by significantly changing his mood. At the start, he had high confidence and enthusiasm, which gradually faded once he entered the barren desert. The desolate landscape, with its endless sand and lack of any signs of life, sapped his energy and optimism. However, his mood picked up when he rounded a rest stop. A prime example of his mood swings is how he went from ""strong legs and a smile on my face"" to ""the growing realization that I could drop dead of a heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn't been off their perch in decades"" to ""I had an overwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber, kiss them, and buy some bait."" The overall mood of the story is closely based on how the author, through the cyclist's experiences, feels about the journey and the changing settings. It shows how the environment can have a powerful influence on one's emotions and mindset."
446	6424	3	3	The features of the setting in this story, “Do not exceed Posted Speed limit,” affect the cyclist in a huge way. The cyclist was biking through a desolate, desert - like area in California. The sweltering heat in this region can be unbearable, just as the writer describes, “wide rings of sweat circled my shirt.” The fact that the area he was biking through was a vast desert and he ran out of water put himself into serious danger. Also, since the cyclist had no water, he was rapidly becoming dehydrated. The area he was biking through had barely any people around, which meant there was no readily available water for him. Therefore, if the setting had taken place in a cooler area with lots of people, the cyclist would have easily found water. Without this type of harsh setting, the story would have completely changed, as the cyclist's struggle and the tension of the story would have been non - existent.
447	6425	3	3	The setting very much affects the cyclist. The statement “I maneuvered down the hill” clearly shows him navigating down a rather steep hill. If the hill wasn't there, it would have been a whole lot easier for him to get to his destination. He wouldn't have to carefully control his speed while going down and would have saved a significant amount of energy. Without the hill to slow him down or consume his energy, he could have maintained a steady pace and reached his goal more quickly. If there weren't any hills to get in his way, the journey would have been far less arduous, and he would have likely completed it with much less fatigue. In conclusion, the presence of the hill in the setting had a notable impact on the cyclist's journey.
448	6426	3	3	"The setting in this story was hot and filled with rolling hills. These factors greatly affected the cyclist. The hot weather was extremely bad for the cyclist because he had a very limited water supply. The text says, “The sun was beginning to beat down” (@NUM1), clearly showing that the temperature was steadily rising. As the heat intensified, the cyclist's need for water increased rapidly. Moreover, the text says, ""Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills"" (@NUM2). To make matters worse, the author's battery was leaking acid, which made it even harder for him to pedal and make it over the hills. It seems like everything went wrong for this man, but despite all these difficulties, he still persevered and made it to his destination, highlighting his determination in the face of a challenging setting."
449	6427	3	3	In the start of the story “Do not exceed speed limit,” the time of year and place setting were the main things that affected the cyclist. This story takes place in the deserts of California in June. The fact that the story took place in June, and especially in a California desert, really is what caused the cyclist's dehydration. Anywhere in this country, June is summer, and summer means that it gets hotter and more humid than usual. In the California desert, the heat is even more intense. This extreme heat caused the cyclist to lose a large amount of water through sweating, leading to dehydration and the “growing realization that I (the author)” was in a difficult situation. Without this specific time and place setting, the cyclist would not have faced such a severe struggle with dehydration, and the story would have had a very different tone and outcome.
450	6428	3	3	The settings in the story affected the cyclist throughout the story. With winding roads and hills, peddling can already be tough, tiring, and challenging. The cyclist had little to no knowledge of the roads, which made the journey ten times harder to deal with. Navigating the winding roads without prior knowledge required extra concentration and energy. And with no landmarks or places in sight, it was extremely hard for the cyclist to have confidence. There was nothing tangible to keep him going, no visible goal on the horizon. This lack of direction and motivation made the already difficult task of cycling on winding roads and hills even more demoralizing. In conclusion, the settings in the story significantly hampered the cyclist's progress and mental state.
451	6429	3	3	Donít let anything stop you from achieving your goals. One such goal could be going to Yosemite National Park. Reaching there takes a journey that leads you away from the comfort of home. After traveling forty miles into the journey, you come to a small town. You stop at a water station but are disappointed as old men say, ìthe water taste like buttery acid.î Then you continue, leading towards the hills and desolate towns. You can ride on without anything to drink. People unfortunately die from heat - attacks because they donít take the time to rest and replenish with water and food. But donít let these challenges stop you from your goal.
452	6430	3	3	Features in the setting of the cyclist do in fact affect him in many significant ways. The setting in the passage includes distinct features such as no one to be seen anywhere, a complete absence of buildings, a dirty and bumpy terrain, extremely hot weather, and an abundance of thick vegetation. All these features have a negative impact on the cyclist. For example, the dry and sweltering weather affects the human body by causing dehydration, which the cyclist is clearly suffering from. This dehydration further weakens the cyclist and makes his journey even more arduous.
453	6431	3	3	The setting in the story affects the cyclist a great deal. It is June in the vast California desert. The scorching sun is beating down on him relentlessly. Another major problem that he faces is the very rough and uneven terrain. Pushing through this terrain requires a lot of energy. All of these factors together make him consume his water supply even faster. As he runs out of water, the setting is making him feel extremely desperate, and this desperation only worsens his situation. In the end, the harsh setting truly tests the cyclist's resolve.
454	6432	3	3	Each person has a really remarkable ability that stands out prominently. Someone can be good - looking, highly intelligent, or exude confidence. There are those who never give up and do exactly what they wish to do. The cyclist in the story is a man with an incredibly strong will. He has a deep - seated desire to be alive. He has encountered too many difficulties on his way to reach the place he wanted to be. He listened to some old guys' advice and unfortunately lost his way. The sun was beginning to bear down with full force. He was completely out of water, yet he continued riding determinedly to reach his goal. As he rode on, he was gradually losing his strength. The weather was extremely hot. The water he found tasted like acid from a battery. But he firmly believed in himself that he could stay alive. He managed to gather more strength by believing in himself even though his physical strength was waning. Every place that he passed by was a new and valuable experience for his life. These experiences were like a challenging game that he managed to overcome successfully. He never gave up. He did everything within his power to not lose his sanity. He didnít want to lose the mental battle, and his unwavering spirit kept him going.
455	6433	3	3	The features of the setting made the cyclist even more tired and extremely thirsty. The rolling hills presented a tough challenge where he had to pedal strenuously up and down. The desert stretched out before him, with no water in sight, just endless dry land. Everything in the setting was intensifying the conflict in his story. The old Welchís Grape Juice Factory was a taunting sight; it was as if drinks were right there but were now long gone. If it would have been Yosemite with its cool pines and flowing rivers, he wouldíve felt completely at ease. There were no people in sight, which made him lack a sense of security, and there was also a shortage of water and no buildings for shelter. The tumble weeds blowing around gave no hope of getting anywhere, and the sight of snakes and vultures waiting to feast after one died was terrifying. Everything in the story was the complete opposite of what he wanted until he finally reached his last hope, the bait shop. This bait shop became a glimmer of hope in his otherwise harsh journey.
456	6434	3	3	In the story “Rough Road Ahead; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”, the setting of the story majorly affected the cyclist. The story tells us “...I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June.” The extreme heat of the summer, with temperatures soaring high, definitely put a strain on the cyclist causing him to have to drink lots of water. Unfortunately, the “towns” were very far apart and many did not have good water, creating a dehydration problem. “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or a structure of any kind.” None of this would have happened had he been cycling at a marathon with people handing him water when requested, or if he had been smart enough to follow a good map to avoid such difficult situations.
457	6435	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist significantly. For example, on page @NUM1, Kurmaskie said “I got down on my hands, laboriously working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength”. This vivid description shows his desperation due to the lack of water, highlighting how the setting's water - scarcity issue had a direct impact on the cyclist.
458	6436	3	3	The features of the setting have been a major affect on this cyclist in the story. On the normal road, the ground is smooth but it is also a lot like a maze, curvy and winding. The cyclist also comes across bumps and non - paved roads that make it extremely hard to maneuver through. Then, you add the fact that there are not really any towns nearby and he is in a blazing heat with little water. The harsh conditions of the setting, including the difficult terrain and lack of resources, played a key role in the story, making the cyclist's journey a challenging one.
459	6437	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he is in the high deserts of California where it is very hot. In such high - temperature conditions, you need a lot of water to stay hydrated. Then he needs more water and finds a water pump but can't use the water because it was “somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees”, which is far too hot to consume. Then the terrain changes when he says “Flat road was replaced”. This change in terrain further complicates his journey, showing how the setting's various features continuously impact the cyclist.
460	6438	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because I was talking about the exceed posted speed limit. How the speed limit or where it says “Never accept travel advice from a collection of old - timers who haven’t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office”. They are trying to say that if you do what they say, your travel will not work as expected. So, you should make the right choice and do the right thing, like relying on your own judgment and proper planning to deal with the challenges presented by the setting.
461	6439	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in that he or she should act, behave, or talk according to the specific settings. This implies that no matter where they are and what the surroundings look like, they need to adapt themselves. They also have to adjust their mood based on their location. As described in the story, the cyclist is feeling comfortable, and thus, there's no need for any change in the setting or location. In conclusion, the features of the setting affect the cyclist as they need to make improvements and changes according to their current location.
462	6440	3	3	In the beginning, the cyclist was full of energy, ready to go, and extremely happy about the journey ahead. As time passed and he got half - way to his destination, he started “losing hope”. The weather was very hot, and he was completely alone on the road. By the end, he was greatly relieved because not only did he manage to find water to quench his thirst, but he also discovered an easier way to reach Yosemite. The first group of old men he met didn't offer any help, but the second man was kind enough to assist him. This shows that the journey had its ups and downs, but in the end, things worked out for the cyclist.
463	6441	3	3	In the story “Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the features of the setting have a significant impact on the cyclist. This is evident as the cyclist gives us an insight into what's going on around him and how he feels about it. It describes, “one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn't hold the lamest mule greeted me.” The author further mentions that this troubled him. In fact, it made the author scared, thinking that maybe he was all alone in the desert with a ghost - town. An unplanned situation was that the roads were in a rusty condition where the speed limit was 55 mph, but since he barely had any water, he was only going 12 mph. This indicates that he was troubled and confused about the surrounding environment. As the desert stretched on, it seemed like the author was slowly losing hope as he traveled further. I think it's similar to how some people, as soon as trouble appears or seems imminent, start losing hope and their good judgment, making life seem much harder.
464	6442	3	3	In this story, it seems as if every part of the environment is dry. The rider, continuously cycling under such conditions, would be getting extremely thirsty. He is all by himself on this journey, and this solitude could make any man feel vulnerable because if he were to have an accident, there would be nobody around to help. Moreover, he is going up and down steep hills. These steep slopes require him to be extra careful while cycling to avoid any mishaps. In conclusion, the dry environment, his solitude, and the hilly terrain all pose challenges to the rider.
465	6443	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For instance, if you were cycling in a very cold climate, your body wouldn't perspire as much, and you wouldn't need to drink as much water. However, in the story, the cyclist is in a very hot climate, and he quickly runs out of water. The quote “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips, wide circles of sweat circled my shirt and the growing realization that I could drop from heat - stroke on a gorgeous day in June…” clearly explains that the setting of the cycling plays a huge role in the cyclist's experience. Also, the terrain can have a significant impact on the biker. If one were to ride on a flat terrain, there would be much less wear - and - tear on the cyclist's body, making it an easier ride. All of these reasons clearly show that the settings affect the cyclist in numerous ways.
466	6444	3	3	The setting plays an important part in the author's mood. When the author stumbles upon the dilapidated ghost town, he is still full of high spirits and finds it quite amusing. He muses that it's a bit comical that the old men’s “town” has now been completely abandoned. “…(the town) fit the traditional definition of a ghost town. I chuckled…” This clearly shows that the author is still in good spirits as he can still let out a laugh. When “a tar - like substance slowly oozed out of the water pump at the next stop, the author became a bit unsettled since he was running critically low on water. But he still clung to optimism. Once the rolling, expansive hills came into view, the author let out a “sad, hopeless laugh.” At this point, the author was depressed, severely dehydrated, and had almost given up. However, he summoned the will to keep going and eventually managed to reach some water, thus ending this arduous part of his journey.
467	6445	3	3	In the passage “Rough Road Ahead Do Not Exceed Speed Limit,” the setting definitely affects the cyclist. When the cyclist first arrives at the abandoned “town,” he eagerly searches for water. But all he finds is water that tastes like battery acid. “When I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid.” This situation makes his dehydration seem even more dire because although he has water in sight, it's completely undrinkable. The rough road ahead gives a sense of determination. As the cyclist is on his last legs, he has to work even harder to get water. “A flat road was replaced by short rolling hills,” this quote shows that despite his poor condition, the cyclist must persevere. Also, the quote “tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake” - tumbleweeds and snakes give a feeling of desolation and of being alone, which is exactly how the cyclist feels at this point. The setting of this story directly correlates with how the cyclist is feeling, influencing his state of mind throughout the journey.
468	6446	3	3	On a scorching hot day in June, a cyclist was riding his bike in the desert. He rode off towards the sun, heading on his way to Yosemite National Park. Some old men gave him directions on the map, even though they hadn't been through that way in many years. When the cyclist started his day, he was full of energy and ready to go. He naively thought he would be able to stop and get water regularly. But soon he realized he was right in the middle of the desert with no water in sight. The man pushed himself hard and tried to stop thinking about water. He even put pebbles in his mouth to suck on so that he could keep his mind off his parched throat. The man showed great intelligence in this situation, and he knew exactly what to do to survive. This experience has made him stronger, both physically and mentally.
469	6447	3	3	FLAT ROADS, HILLS, BUILDING - ALL ARE SETTINGS THAT AFFECTED THE CYCLIST. While the hills were flat, the cyclist was extremely determined. He firmly believed he could make it and was not going to give up on himself. He pedaled steadily, with a clear goal in mind. However, when the hills got bigger and it became harder to pedal, he began to feel the strain. His legs started to ache, and he grew exhausted and tired. Lastly, the buildings were what almost made him want to give up. When he sees the building of the Welch’s Grape Juice Factory and a young boy drinking, he “hung his head.” He was getting more and more tired as he went along. The land, with its changing terrains and the sight of the factory, was making him feel as if he didn't have the energy to keep moving along. But perhaps, deep down, he still held a glimmer of hope to overcome these challenges.
470	6448	3	3	The setting affected the cyclist greatly. He had no water and was “traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” The deserts, with their searing heat and vast emptiness, and the lack of water could have been a matter of life - or - death for him. This situation made him extremely stressed and constantly thirsty. Coupled with the physical exertion of biking, he became a severely dehydrated man in the desert! When he was between the “ghost town” and the bait shop, he says, “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” This desolate view would make the cyclist fear that there was no hope for his survival if he were to pass out. The deserts of California have a profound impact on any cyclist, especially one like the cyclist in the story who is without water. The setting not only tested his physical limits but also his mental fortitude throughout this harrowing journey.
471	6449	3	3	It think it means to truly be all that you are capable of being, to reach your fullest potential.
472	6450	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because of how extremely hot it is, with the scorching sun beating down relentlessly. The size of the hill is quite substantial, making the ascent a real challenge. Moreover, there is a severe shortage of cold water. For example, it is so swelteringly hot that the cyclist begins to doubt he is going to make it. Also, all he could manage was a water - depleting @NUM1. The hills became so large that he crested the first couple, but then a sign suddenly jumped out saying rough road ahead: do not exceed posted speed limit. Lastly, he had some rough and uneven terrain to ride over, and with no water, he reached a severely dehydrated state. He could only do a water - depleting @NUM1 when the speed limit was @NUM3, which made the already difficult journey even more arduous.
473	6451	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by causing him to become dehydrated and start to lose consciousness. For example, the town he was supposed to come to turned out to be just an abandoned, desolate factory. He then had to travel another @NUM1 miles or so under the blazing sun, with absolutely no water in sight. This lack of water in the harsh setting took a toll on his body, pushing him to the brink of collapse.
474	6452	3	3	The humid climate and hot weather will strongly make you want to keep going over if you don’t have water in your possession. Like near the end of the essay, the person resorted to sucking on stones in a desperate attempt to retain water better. It's something I've never heard of before. This kind of weather is the direct cause of the character's dehydration, which is a well - known symptom of the lack of water in the body. Such a situation clearly shows how the climate can have a detrimental impact on a person's well - being.
475	6453	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because in paragraph @NUM1 it states that the temperature was steadily getting high. When he drank the water, it tasted like battery acid, a sign that the water was getting extremely warm due to the heat. This would affect him greatly because with it being so hot and the water starting to heat up, it becomes incredibly difficult for him to get through the day without passing out. Also, in paragraph @NUM2, it mentions that the roads changed to hills. When you ride up and down these hills, you become tired from constantly pumping your legs. As a result, you would feel hot and extremely tired and would not have the energy or motivation to ride the bike. This is precisely how the features of the setting affect the cyclist.
476	6454	3	3	The cyclist in the story is significantly affected by the features of the setting in the story. The hills affected him because they were harder to get over, requiring more physical effort and energy to pedal up, which slowed his progress and made the journey more arduous. This shows how the setting can pose real challenges to the cyclist's journey.
477	6455	3	3	"The features of the setting, or environment, in which the cyclist is situated greatly affects him. First of all, after leaving the campground with directions from the older gentlemen, he enters an area that is greatly isolated. In paragraph @NUM1, he wrote, ""This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time but on @TIME1, it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town."" This state of being alone later affected the cyclist because his increasing dehydration was becoming dangerous; if he were to collapse, he would most likely die. This drove the cyclist to continue on in order to survive. Another aspect that affected him was the extremely hot temperature. In paragraph, he implies the weather is hot by telling the reader he is traveling through the California desert in June. The intense heat gives the cyclist another obstacle to overcome in his struggle to get to the next town for water. Lastly in paragraph @NUM2, he mentions the terrain changes to gently rolling hills. This shows that the cyclist must not only get over the physical and metaphorical obstacles of the heat and isolation but must also find the mental drive and determination to carry on. Overall, the setting creates a series of challenges that test the cyclist's resilience."
478	6456	3	3	The setting affects the cyclist in a lot of ways. One way is that if you don't know where you're going, you could get hurt. For example, getting lost in an unfamiliar area might lead to encountering dangerous animals or getting into an accident. Also, if the road conditions are very bad, such as having potholes or being uneven, it can cause the cyclist to lose control and fall. That is how the setting affected the cyclist, highlighting the importance of a favorable setting for a safe and smooth cycling journey.
479	6457	3	3	In this essay, features of the setting affect the cyclist in his journey to get to Yosemite and make it worse. First, for example, the cyclist was in the high deserts of California in the heat of June. Which makes it bad because the intense heat makes it harder on the cyclist, causing excessive sweating and fatigue. Also, being in the deserts, there wasn't any water supply. So after the cyclist ran out of water, it got worse because he got dehydrated, and this caused him to become weaker and not pedal as fast. Moreover, the author says that the terrain changes from flat roads to short rolling hills, which also made it more difficult because the short hills made it more work, and since it was so hot and he didn't have water, he couldn't function as well as if he was hydrated. In conclusion, the setting presented multiple challenges that made the cyclist's journey to Yosemite extremely tough.
480	6458	3	3	The features in the setting of this story affect the cyclist very much so. Throughout this story, this poor person has to get lost and end up in the middle of nowhere. By her being out there, her cycling was being affected. She was just trying to get somewhere and get things done, but of course she didn't. She kept moving on down the road, facing the difficulties brought on by the unfamiliar and desolate setting. This story was very good and showed that she cared and wanted it bad, as she persevered despite the challenges posed by the setting.
481	6459	3	3	In this story, the cyclist had to ride through the scorching desert during the sweltering month of June, with only a meager supply of water. I would say that this has a big effect on the cyclist since he dehydrates a great deal and is constantly threatened with heatstroke. Also, he had to ride carefully past a huge, menacing snake which could have easily hurt him. Personally, I don't know what he was thinking riding through the desert by himself, and that's his own problem. This solo and ill - prepared journey clearly put him in unnecessary danger.
482	6460	3	3	"In the sign ""Do not Exceed Posted Speed limit"", the elements of the setting many ways affect the cyclist. Three of those things are the intense heat, the severe lack of water, and the desolate state of the town. The heat affects him because he gets extremely hot and fatigued. For example, the text states, ""I could die from a heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June."" This shows that it was extremely sweltering. The cyclist had a lack of water and was parched. For example, it states in the text, ""I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state."" This shows that he was very thirsty from the lack of water. The last way the setting affects the cyclist is when he goes into a town and finds it completely empty. The text states, ""On that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town."" This shows that he expected it to be there so he could rest but it wasn't as it appeared to be. All these things clearly show how the setting affected the cyclist."
483	6461	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in a couple of ways. The first and main way was that he was riding through the arid desert. This caused him to sweat profusely and get severely dehydrated. The second way was that there were rough, bumpy roads and hilly stretches. This made him more tired at a faster pace. In conclusion, the harsh setting did not offer any assistance to him whatsoever, only adding to his struggles.
484	6462	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. The cyclist should have carefully looked at his map instead of blindly taking the old man's advice because all the necessary information was clearly on the map. He almost lost his life because he listened to the old man and didn't bother to look at his map. If the cyclist was in a car, maybe he would have had better luck because he would be traveling faster than on the slow - moving bike. In this situation, relying on the wrong source and not using available resources put his life at risk.
485	6463	3	3	Many things on the cyclist's journey affected him. It was in the middle of a blistering summer in California. The heat is unbelievable and ridiculously scorching. “… I could drop from heatstroke…” He was so badly overheated and dehydrated that he could have perished any minute. He could have also been killed by a giant, venomous snake. “…look like a diamondback - blocked the majority of the pavement…” It could have easily ended his life if he wasn't extremely careful. But with his unwavering determination and indomitable spirit, he pulled through and finally made it to a fresh supply of water. If he would have given up, his life would have been over. His perseverance in the face of such extreme challenges was truly commendable.
486	6464	3	3	When the cyclist went to ask the old men about the road, they told him it was a good way he should go. However, the old man hadn't seen the land for a really long time. He didn't realize that the land had changed. So, when the cyclist went back to ride on the roads and found everything was different, the cyclist didn't know what to do and stood there, feeling quite confused.
487	6465	3	3	There are many reasons regarding how the features of the setting affect the cyclist, both mentally and physically. Mentally, cyclists can lose determination and pride if they cannot endure the cycling journey. For instance, facing long - distance and difficult terrains might make them doubt their abilities. Physically, when the setting is hot and rough, the cyclist would have a lack of water and food supplies. The heat can cause fatigue and dehydration quickly. These are the ways how cyclists would be affected by the features of the setting both mentally and physically.
488	6466	3	3	The cyclist in “Rough road Ahead” was riding his bike in the middle of June, in California. Both factors are very bad if you are lost and on a bike. In June, it is usually hot, and in California, it is usually always hot. Since the cyclist is on a bike, he has to pedal everywhere he goes. This not only uses up all his energy but also makes him extremely hot. When you are this hot, you need to keep hydrated. But if you are lost and use up all your water before finding safety, you are in major trouble. Also, in California, there are hills, mountains and such, and pedaling up a mountain is not an easy task at all. All these factors make the cyclist's journey very difficult.
489	6467	3	3	The features of the cyclist's situation affect him in many ways. One way that the features affected him was that when he ran out of water, all the buildings were like a ghost town. He said that there was no one in sight. In the story, it says “the building abandoned years earlier.” If I were him, I would have turned around and gone back to avoid taking the chance of dying out in the middle of an abandoned area. This desolate situation really put the cyclist in a tough spot.
490	6468	3	3	The setting is the main factor having effects on the cyclist. The cyclist's main problem is that he is low on water and dehydrated, as he says “trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.” The author wouldn't have been so dehydrated if it weren't so hot. Also, all the problems he faces are setting - related, like encountering a snake and dealing with a rough road. If the story had taken place in a more mild area, there wouldn't have been any conflicts. Clearly, the setting plays a crucial role in the cyclist's difficult situation.
491	6469	3	3	In the story, the cyclist is affected by the setting as described in the @NUM1 paragraph. It details him spotting the old water pump and his attempts to draw water from it. As the story nears its end, he becomes enraged upon seeing the old Welch's juice factory. This is because he realizes that the old men he'd spoken to earlier didn't know what they were talking about. Fortunately, at the very end, he experiences relief when he locates Gary and @ORGANIZATION1. The reason for his relief is that there is a water source there, which he so desperately needed. This shows how the setting throughout the story significantly impacts the cyclist's emotions and circumstances.
492	6470	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaskie in a very profound way. As he pedals along, he looks around and sees “no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” When he becomes acutely aware of his solitude while in a state of near - dehydration, a sense of despair washes over him. Due to the seclusion of the setting, having only come across “One ramshackle shed in many miles,” the cyclist almost loses all hope. However, his spirits are lifted when he thinks of “the cool pines and rushing rivers of @CAPS1.” These thoughts of a more pleasant and resource - rich setting give him the strength to carry on. In this way, the cyclist's emotional state is transformed from despair to hope by the influence of the setting.
493	6471	3	3	The setting has a notable impact on the cyclist. It is extremely hot outside, and as a result, he is gradually losing his energy. The setting dictates various aspects of his cycling. It affects how fast he rides, when he decides to stop, and when he consumes food or drinks. All these actions depend on the type of weather he is riding in. For instance, in the story, it was so swelteringly hot that when he saw a building in the distance, he instinctively wiped the sweat from his face. He did this to ensure that what he was seeing was not a mirage, highlighting how the harsh weather conditions were playing tricks on his senses. Clearly, the setting plays a crucial role in the cyclist's journey.
494	6472	3	3	In the essay “Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the features of the setting had a great impact on the hard - working cyclist. The weather, the land, and the surrounding objects really determined the cyclist's mood and ability. One vivid example is the statement, “cool pines, rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them.” The refreshing nature and the cool air of this imagined setting made the cyclist feel confident, energized, and eager to continue. Another instance is the quote, “One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn't hold in the lamest mule greet me.” Here, the cyclist feels both troubled and a bit curious about what lies ahead. The water available there was not of good quality, and he was understandably worried. The last example is when “a flat road was replaced by short rolling hills...tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake.” In this situation, the cyclist has to try hard to stay focused amidst these distractions. The area is deserted, and he also feels dehydrated. As his route comes to an end, he encounters many more aspects of the setting, each creating a different feeling or influencing his ability. Therefore, the nature of the places his bike passed through and the things he saw had a significant impact on his choices and his overall cycling ability.
495	6473	3	3	There are many features in the setting that affect the cyclist. One prominent feature is that he finds himself in the middle of California, riding his bike under the scorching sun with a limited amount of water. The harsh sunlight beats down on him, and the lack of water takes a toll on his body. As a result, he almost collapses from heatstroke and severe dehydration. The combination of the intense heat and the scarcity of water in this particular setting poses a serious threat to his well - being. This clearly demonstrates how the features of the setting can have a life - threatening impact on the cyclist's journey.
496	6474	3	3	The features of the setting in this essay affected the cyclist in many ways. “One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn't hold in the lamest mule greeted me.” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The cyclist, who had been pedaling for hours with high hopes, was expecting a small town bustling with people and equipped with some type of good water supply. However, he instead found a deserted ghost town, its silence eerie, with only a rusty pump that didn't even supply water. It made the cyclist feel deeply depressed because he was running low on water and could easily dehydrate without it. “The speed limit was @NUM2. I was doing a water - depleting @NUM3. Sometimes life can feel so cruel.” (Kurmaskie @NUM4). The cyclist is possibly being passed by cars on the highway going @NUM2 while he is only going @NUM3, the wind from their passing making him feel even more insignificant. This probably makes him feel as if he is getting nowhere at all. It would be all the more reason for him to give up. But he keeps trying to reach his destination. The feeling of being passed by the cars makes him determined to continue and finish his journey, proving to himself that he can overcome this desolate setting.
497	6475	3	3	The cyclist had very little water left in his canteen, just a few swallows that wouldn't quench his growing thirst for long. It was very hot, the sun beating down mercilessly on his back, turning the air around him into a stifling oven. He had a long way to go, the end of his journey still a distant dot on the horizon. The road was very bumpy, full of potholes and uneven patches. So he couldn't go too fast or his tires might bust, and replacing them in this desolate place would be next to impossible. There were no cars in sight, the long stretch of road empty and silent. So if he did break down, it would have taken even longer for help to arrive, leaving him stranded under the scorching sun. In such harsh conditions, his determination to reach his destination was truly being tested.
498	6476	3	3	The setting effects the cyclist in many ways. And following old - timers' advice wasn't too smart of him. In that essay, he was headed to the Yosemite National Park, full of excitement for the beautiful scenery that awaited him. He had a map to follow and he trusted himself; as a cyclist, he knew his way around. But then he came around a couple of men who seemed friendly enough and told him a shortcut. He trusted them, which he shouldn't have, and he was on his way. The setting was rough. He was riding through a California desert; the heat was probably way too intense, and he was desperately looking for water. The only thing that he found tasted like battery acid, and so that was no good for him. It was a flat land at first, then rolling hills that made his pedaling even more difficult. The next town would have been in the @NUM1 miles, a distant promise of relief. This cyclist was really pushing himself. While riding along these lands, there was nothing more in sight, no buildings or cars; it was like a dead road. Those old men had him in a tough spot, but once he made it to the next town, he knew that with those conditions, he had learned a valuable lesson about trusting strangers' advice.
499	6477	3	3	On the cyclist's way to Yosemite National Park, he is given directions from a group of old men, but their directions aren't so good. The deserted place affected him because there was nowhere for him to stop and take a break, eat a bite, or refill his water bottle. “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” The landscape was barren, with only the occasional rusted water pump. These pumps had hot water, the kind that did nothing to cool him down after hours of cycling under the blazing sun. His surroundings led him to the state of dehydration, his throat dry and his body weakening with each passing mile. As he continued to pedal, he realized how much he had relied on the wrong advice, but he still hoped to find a proper place to recover and continue his journey to the park.
500	6478	3	3	The features of the setting including vast emptiness, hills, heat, and no water all create obstacles for the cyclist in “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” Due to the vast emptiness of the area in which he was traveling, with miles of nothing but open land stretching around him, he could not stop somewhere to ask for help or to take a rest. Also, there were no other travelers on the desolate roads, so he could not ask for assistance from them. Another obstacle during his trip are the hills. The steep inclines required him to put in more energy to pedal up, so he ends up tiring easily and taking longer than expected. There is also extreme heat, the kind that makes the air shimmer and turns the ground into a hotplate. This causes him to sweat profusely and become even more thirsty. So he ends up running out of water. In the story he writes, “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.” He is now becoming thirsty and if he doesn't find water he will dehydrate. He searches for a place to rest where there might be water but he is not able to. All of these obstacles cause the cyclist to become devastated and give up hope but he continues his travel, his legs aching and his body protesting. Eventually, he finds a place to rest, a small oasis in the midst of this harsh setting. All of these obstacles tying into another, making his journey a true test of endurance.
501	6479	3	3	I really thought the story didn't make sense at all. The setting was so crazy that it was hard to follow. I really wasn't feeling it from the start. In my opinion, it wasn't even a good story.
502	6480	3	3	The features of the setting affect a cyclist in many ways. If you have a bumpy ride, then the cyclist will have a much harder time maintaining balance and speed. Also, if it is really hilly, then it is not only harder to pedal but will also take longer to cover the same distance. As the text says, “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” It will definitely take him longer to reach his destination. Animals in the setting can also have an impact. For example, “and a ridiculously large snake - it really did look like a diamondback - blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.” Animals can get in the way like this snake did for the cyclist. If a squirrel or some kind of animal was to run across the road right in front of you, it could scare you and you could lose control and clash. Sometimes trees make it cooler because you don't have the sun beating directly down on your back. If there is a fresh - water stream, you can stop and wash all the sweat off of you and get a refreshing drink. The setting in which a cyclist is riding can either help or hinder the cyclist, and these various factors all play a role in the cycling experience.
503	6481	3	3	It affected him by severely dehydrating him and wearing him down physically to the point where he was on the verge of giving up. But despite the overwhelming exhaustion and the intense urge to quit, he never gave up. As the end neared, a deep sense of satisfaction emerged from it all. This satisfaction was a testament to his perseverance and the victory over the challenges he faced.
504	6482	3	3	The trees were an integral part of the landscape, and their presence added a touch of red to the overall colors. There were also volcanoes and tall pine trees that covered parts of the landscape. Many millennia ago, geological changes occurred, and this led to the transformation where the swampland gradually became the desert. This shift in the landscape over time is a fascinating aspect of nature's evolution.
505	6483	3	3	There were a few features in the setting that affected the cyclist. One very important feature is that the cyclist was in the desert. This is clearly demonstrated by the statement “I was travelling through the high deserts of California.” Not only was the cyclist in the desert, but he was there in June, one of the hottest months of the year. It is evident that he was there in June as indicated by the statement “I was travelling in June.” Being there at that time made dehydration an even bigger risk for the cyclist. It was also extremely hot there. We know this because when he was at the water pump, he stated, “blackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.” From this, we can affirm that not only was it hot, but the water was dirty. The water also “had the flavor of battery acid.” This was extremely bad for the cyclist who was running low on water because he “had been hitting (his) water bottles pretty regularly.” The fact that he had little water left is demonstrated in the statement, “The water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips.” The cyclist was in a truly bad situation. These factors had ganged - up against him in his trip. These features are the desert, the high temperatures, and the blackish water which tasted like battery acid. The fact that he was low on water made it even harder to fight these features. With enough water, he would be able to battle the desert and high temperatures more effectively and have no need to pump bad water. Again, the features of the setting that affected the cyclist are the desert, the high temperatures, and the bad water which he could not drink, and these all combined to make his journey extremely challenging.
506	6484	3	3	In the story “Rough Road Ahead” the cyclist was extremely excited and firmly determined to get to Yosemite National Park. The cyclist must have been thinking of the beautiful waters with “His name written over them”. The rough terrain and harsh weather took its toll on the unaware cyclist. The scorching sun beat down on the cyclist's back. He tried his best to ignore it, but soon the intense heat made him frequently drink his water until there were only sips left. The cyclist was told by the old man that a town was only @NUM1 miles away. The town was indeed the traditional definition of a ghost town. “That probably gave the cyclist no hope for surviving or finding anyone to help him reach his destination. The poor conditions of the roads, the lack of water which made him see a mirage, made the cyclist not trust the words of an old man who had led him to the abandoned locations he had seen. The cyclist was affected by the settings in a bad way but in the end was given a little help from a traditional map, which gave him a glimmer of hope to continue his journey.
507	6485	3	3	In the essay, “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting severely affected the cyclist because it made it much more difficult for the cyclist to survive and make it through his arduous journey. In the essay, it says, “I arrived at the first “Town”…this place might have been a thriving little spot at one time… but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost @NUM1). In the essay, the cyclist carefully takes directions from a few old men to get to Yosemite National Park. The cyclist has a very limited amount of water, and it was an extremely humid day for traveling. Because of the intense humidity, the cyclist nearly ran out of water when he had to cycle up, “short, rolling hills” (@NUM2) in the sweltering hot weather. Had the town been thriving, he could have easily bought more water to make his trip easier to accomplish. Also, if the road in the story would have been flat, the cyclist wouldn't have gotten as tired as he did and needed more water. It would have been far less strenuous on the cyclist to pedal on a flat road rather than a hilly road. The challenges facing the cyclist reminded me of that of the main character of the movie @PERSON2. In this movie, the main character must make his way through the extreme and unforgiving conditions of the desert, just like the cyclist had to in order to reach his destination. In conclusion, the setting clearly affects the cyclist’s journey in a negative way, making it a real struggle for him to achieve his goal.
508	6486	3	3	In the story, “Rough Road Ahead”, by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist was significantly affected by the setting. The cyclist has said that he had to ride over terrain that was initially smooth but then unexpectedly turned into rolling hills. He also had to cautiously find his way around a big snake while being severely dehydrated. The cyclist was mainly affected because he was completely out of water when he was riding on his bike through a desert - like area. However, due to his strong determination to reach water, he summoned the strength to make it through, finally seeing a sign of hope in the distance.
509	6487	3	3	In the selection “Do not exceed posted speed limit” there are a lot of great and vivid details of the area around the cyclist. In the text, it makes it abundantly clear that the route the cyclist is traveling is very deserted. When the drinking water was described as oozing out and tasting like battery acid, you can easily tell that people hadn't been there in a long while. Also, being informed that he was traveling through a desert, in June. I am fully able to understand how desperately thirsty he is. Also, he is traveling for miles over a rough and uneven terrain and “crippling hills,” according to the text, so he has to be utterly exhausted. I could completely understand why he was so upset with getting wrong directions. Based on the troubles he encounters, when he finally reaches the camp and drinks water, you too are genuinely glad he has reached somewhere that wasn't empty and deserted, as it marks a relief from his long - suffering journey.
510	6488	3	3	The features of the setting have a profound impact on the cyclist because he was traveling through a swelteringly hot place at a particularly hot time of year and didn't have an adequate supply of water. In the text it says “I was traveling the high deserts of California in June.” The deserts are always extremely hot and June is a very hot month. The cyclist was getting thirsty at a much quicker rate from the intense heat and wasn't able to drink much because he had very limited water, which put him in a very precarious situation during his journey.
511	6489	3	3	The setting affected the cyclist because since it was the arid California desert, and it was the sweltering month of June, the air was extremely hot and dry. This intense heat caused him to get very thirsty and rapidly drink all his water. After almost all his water was gone, he began to feel extremely tired. Since it is the desolate desert, there isn't anyone around to help him if he dehydrates and blacks out. So, he has to persevere and really push through the difficult situation if he wants to survive. But he eventually finds a small bait shop and he has a refreshing drink there so he is okay and can continue his journey.
512	6490	3	3	"In the story ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"", the setting greatly affects the cyclist. With long, tiring rides on winding hilly roads and very little water to sustain him, the cyclist was surprisingly in good spirits. I mean, he could have been very angry about the challenging conditions, but he kept his cool and stayed calm throughout the ordeal. This shows his resilience in the face of a tough setting."
513	6491	3	3	The towns, the rugged terrain, the dilapidated Welch’s Grape Juice factory - all are integral parts of the setting that affect the cyclist. “This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time - say, before the last world war,” describes the cyclist with a hint of melancholy, “but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.” The desolate town intensifies the cyclist's growing feeling of doubt. At this part, he is really regretting taking the old guy's advice in taking the “shortcut.” “Not two miles into the next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing,” reveals the cyclist. The cyclist is already very worried and very doubtful, and the rough, unforgiving terrain is making it worse. It mirrors the town in which the cyclist had stopped at earlier, again making his feeling of doubt increase. The cyclist exclaims, “By the looks of it - had been a Welch’s Grape Juice Factory.” The cyclist gets very excited when he sees this, and gets a great feeling of hope. So throughout the whole story, the setting of where the cyclist is at affects his mood by giving him doubt, but by also giving him hope, making his journey a roller - coaster of emotions.
514	6492	3	3	The cyclist was biking through the vast California deserts during the warm summer months. The scorching heat and the long, uninhabited canal were the biggest struggles for the cyclist. For example, he thought there would be many convenient stops for water during his trip, but he was sorely mistaken. Also, he runs out of water very quickly because of being severely dehydrated in the blistering heat. The cyclist became irritated with himself for blindly trusting someone else to give him directions for a shortcut. The harsh setting affected the cyclist’s mood in a negative way, leaving him frustrated and disheartened.
515	6493	3	3	There were many features in the setting of this bike race that affected the cyclist. It stated, “The previously flat road was replaced by short, steep rolling hills” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The cyclist was pedaling smoothly and steadily until these big, challenging hills came into play, and his energy was gradually running lower as he labored up each incline. Also it stated, “At some point tumbleweeds randomly crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake slithered across” (Kurmaskie @NUM2). This debris and the menacing snake made him stop abruptly because he got scared and significantly slowed him down. There were a lot of features in the setting that affected the cyclist, causing him to slow down and lose precious energy, ultimately hampering his progress in the race.
516	6494	3	3	Many things can affect a cyclist and how they ride. In this essay, several factors influenced the cyclist, such as the setting of the story. One of the problems with the setting was the absence of stores or even people. Another, and most crucial, was the lack of water around the cyclist. So, many things can affect a cyclist while they are riding, including their surroundings. These various elements combined to have a notable impact on the cyclist's riding experience.
517	6495	3	3	The second photograph better communicates ideas similar to those expressed in the essay “A Sea Worry” because the story is about a boy who surfs as a job. In the second picture, a boy is clearly seen surfing. The author states, “My son body - surfs. He says it’s his ‘job’.” This quote clearly explains that he is a body - surfer and that surfing is his occupation. Due to this strong connection between the essay and the second photograph, it is evident why I chose the second photograph as it effectively mirrors the key idea from the essay.
518	6496	3	3	The condition the cyclist is in affects a great deal of how they ride. One clear example of this is, “I was travelling through the high desert of California in June.” Due to this fact, the cyclist had entered a “dehydrated state” because of not having an adequate supply of water. When you are travelling in hot - weather areas without much water, your body will become dehydrated from sweating profusely. Cycling in different conditions will affect cyclists differently, and this example clearly shows how adverse conditions can significantly impact a cyclist's state and riding ability.
519	6497	3	3	Many features of the setting affected the cyclist in “Rough Road Ahead.” First, the scorching heat of the desert in June was a major problem that pushed him to the brink of dehydration. In the text, it states, “I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June.” This clearly shows the severe effect the exposure to intense heat had on the cyclist. Also, the challenging terrain posed a threat to his well - being during the story. In the text, it says, “I toiled on.” This illustrates the significant increase in effort and strain that the difficult terrain caused on the cyclist during his adventure. Overall, these setting features had a profound and negative impact on the cyclist's journey.
520	6498	3	3	In the story “Do not Exceed Posted Speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. The hot weather affected him because it made him extremely thirsty. Moreover, being out in the middle of the vast desert meant that he had no access to water. The steep hills further exhausted him, making him tired and weak. All of these features in the setting had a cumulative effect on him, leaving him feeling powerless and desperately thirsty. In conclusion, the setting played a crucial role in hindering the cyclist's experience.
521	6499	3	3	The features that affect the cyclist are that he is riding his bike in the vast, arid desert and doesn't have any water left in his bottles. That affects his journey because he is severely dehydrated, feeling dizzy and weak. So he needs to find water fast. This is making him get to Yosemite slower because he has to constantly stop and search for water sources. That is a feature that significantly affects the cyclist's progress.
522	6500	3	3	In the story, the setting has a large and detrimental affect on the cyclist. After taking the seemingly well - meaning advice from some old people in a small town, he ended up in a desolate desert area with no cars passing by, no buildings in sight, and not a single person around. He was running critically low on water and had absolutely no way of getting any more. He was really dehydrated, felt extremely tired, and his legs were giving out. He almost gave up because of the scorching heat and the lack of water. All this was caused by the harsh setting he was in, which clearly hampered his journey.
523	6501	3	3	The setting of the place was a “ghost town” as the author said. It was a sweltering hot summer day in June, and the sun was beating down mercilessly. So, of course, the cyclist would be rapidly dehydrating, his throat parched and his lips chapped. There was no one around for miles, so he couldn't ask for help. It was like an old - fashioned town because he ran into some elderly men who were so out of touch that they knew nothing of the new world. They were so unfamiliar with modern directions that they told him the wrong way, further complicating his journey.
524	6502	3	3	The setting affected the cyclist in a few different ways. At first, it helped him. “The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed. The cool pines and rushing rivers” This is saying the refreshing pines and the gurgling rivers helped him forget about the intense sun, providing a pleasant and calming environment. Later on, however, the setting was against him. There was no place nearby to get water, and he was becoming increasingly dehydrated. The terrain was getting rougher, with more rocks and uneven ground. There were no people around to offer him a helping hand, but there was a slithering snake on the path, adding to his distress. All these features were working against him until he finally made it to a small bait store. This bait store gave him much - needed water and a reliable, detailed map to continue his journey.
525	6503	3	3	In the story “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe @PERSON1, it tells of a cyclist heading for Yosemite National Park, and the numerous problems he faced. For example, the intense heat was a major issue the cyclist had to face. In the story, it said “Drop from heatstroke.” This shows that the setting affected him in a very negative way. The blistering heat was a major part of the setting that made the cyclist's journey extremely difficult, sapping his energy and putting his health at risk. The heat in the setting clearly had a significant and adverse impact on the character's progress towards Yosemite.
526	6504	3	3	The features of the setting affected the author’s story a great deal. It had an impact by making the trip appear even more difficult to the reader. This was achieved by vividly describing how sweltering hot it was and elaborating on how the road was replete with bumps and numerous hills. The story states “over one long, crippling hill.” This makes the reader perceive the trip as extremely arduous since the character has to pedal up so many steep hills. But if the road was not as hilly, then the trip would seem far less difficult. This would also give the impression that the old guys provided good directions. But the whole point of the story's setting is to create a challenging narrative for the reader to engage with.
527	6505	3	3	As soon as the cyclist gained information about which way to go, he eagerly set off through the tall, cool pines. The thick foliage of these pines gave him a strong feeling of confidence, and at the same time, physically cooled his overheated body down. As he pedaled steadily down the road, he encountered various small towns, none of which looked promising at all. This lack of viable options gave him a deep - seated feeling of despair, especially in accordance with his dwindling supply of water. Even further into the journey, he found one last town and a rundown welche’s @CAPS1 factory. The sight of the factory increased his thirst and gave him a strong feeling of spite towards the old men who had given him advice. However, he soon chanced upon a bait house where he could get water and escape the scorching heat. For this fortunate discovery, he was thoroughly satisfied and extremely grateful to the kind - hearted owner. It made him realize that he should never again blindly trust the old men's advice.
528	6506	3	3	The setting affects a great deal in a cyclist's experience. For example, if you are cycling in a bustling city, you feel rushed, tired, and overwhelmed by the constant noise and traffic. The honking horns and fast - paced environment add to the stress. But when you find yourself in a serene forest, surrounded by the sounds of nature, you are happy and a bit less stressed. The gentle rustling of leaves and the chirping of birds create a calming atmosphere. A setting not only sets the mood but also influences the attitude in the story, making it an important element in how the cyclist perceives and endures the journey.
529	6507	3	3	The features of the setting affect the author's disposition as well as his ability to complete the journey, thus creating a significant obstacle that the author must overcome. At the end of paragraph five, the author writes that “I was traveling through the high deserts of California.” This particular setting is crucial because it adds a palpable sense of urgency to his trip when he starts to run low on water. In the arid desert, water is scarce, and the risk of dehydration looms large. This is similar to when I was backpacking and a bear got most of our food. Our normal, leisurely backpacking trip had suddenly become more of a game of survival. So, the water issue was clearly the main point of conflict that the author presented in the setting. He also writes that “Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” This aspect of the setting also affects the cyclist because it makes it much more strenuous for him to progress than if it was a downhill road. In short, the setting of the story presents the main points of conflict to the author and thus was essential to the essay as it drives the narrative forward.
530	6508	3	3	In the essay, “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the unbearable setting affects the cyclist with its harsh conditions. At first, in the cyclist’s own words, “things began well enough.” However, this soon changes. The road is long and filled with numerous obstacles, and the cyclist has hardly any water to take a sip from. He does not give up, though. In the text, it says, “got back on the bike, but not bothered gathered up a few peldder and stuck them in my mouth.” He does this in order to reduce his need for water and continues his journey, bravely ignoring the challenges that the unforgiving setting brings upon him. Despite the hardships, his determination shows that he is willing to push through the difficult circumstances presented by the setting.
531	6509	3	3	The cyclist is affected by the setting in “Rough Road Ahead” because the road is a specific place. If it is rough or its conditions are unknown, it has a direct impact on the traveler, who in this case is the cyclist. For instance, if it is a hill, then the cyclist would have to exert extra effort to climb it. In the text, it said, “over a long crippling hill,” and the “crippling hill” part clearly stresses that the setting is a challenging hill, which makes the cyclist's journey more difficult. This shows how the setting can directly affect the cyclist's experience.
532	6510	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because there is no water, there are hills, and there are deserts. When the cyclists saw water, they had an intense urge to jump in. All they could think about was the water they lacked, which felt like battery acid in their throats. Then, the hills slowed them down on their way to the water. The desert, with its scorching heat, just made them want water even more. These are some of the prominent features of the settings that significantly affected the cyclist's journey and well - being.
533	6511	3	3	There were many features in the setting that affected the cyclist. One was the extreme heat during the June heatwave in California. The speaker vividly said that he could have easily died from heatstroke due to the blistering temperatures. The rough road was also a major problem for the cyclist. The numerous bumps, steep hills, and unexpected wildlife along the way affected the cyclist’s journey. The thing that most affected him was the lack of water. It was such a severe problem that he had to suck on stones to distract himself from the intense thirst. As you can see, these problems in the story had a profound impact on the speaker’s journey to Yosemite National Park, making it a challenging and arduous one.
534	6512	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. He is riding in the desert where there is little to no rain. This means that if he runs out of water, he can't collect any from natural sources to drink. Also, deserts are extremely hot. The searing heat will rapidly speed up the dehydration process, so he will need a large amount of water to survive. If he runs out of water, he will face a life - threatening situation. The cyclist finds a building, but unfortunately, it is abandoned and completely empty. All these features of the setting have a detrimental effect on him. Since he can't find water, he has to carefully conserve what little water he has. Also, the heat is taking a toll on his body. It doesn't help that the only building he finds is abandoned. During the whole time when the threat of death looms in the air, with the desert showing no signs of life, no water in sight, the cyclist is constantly thinking about his possible death. As long as he dwells on his death, the situation seems even more hopeless. But as soon as he puts the pebbles in his mouth to stop thinking about death and being thirsty, he sees a bait shop which saves his life. He starts thinking about his survival, and immediately, he finds a place where he can drink and replenish his water supply.
535	6513	3	3	The setting affected the cyclist greatly throughout his ride. “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke (pG @NUM1 kurmaskie).” This quote is clearly saying that because of the intense heat, the rough and uneven terrain, and the unexpectedly long length of his “shortcut,” he is rapidly running out of water. That’s when he has a terrifying realization that he could die from heatstroke because he heedlessly listened to a bunch of old men's advice. This shows how the setting can turn a simple ride into a life - threatening situation for the cyclist.
536	6514	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. He finds himself in the vast expanse of the desert, where the scorching sun beats down relentlessly, and he has a meager and dwindling supply of water. Without an adequate water supply, his body quickly succumbs to fatigue, and he tired very easily. On top of that, he had to pedal a bicycle through the unforgiving desert terrain. So, he was constantly thirsty and utterly exhausted from rambling in the desert. This is how the setting affected the cyclist, making his journey an arduous struggle.
537	6515	3	3	The setting significantly affects the cyclist. The cyclist has to constantly worry about the road condition. If the road is full of potholes, uneven surfaces, or gravel, then the cyclist must reduce his/her speed to maintain balance and avoid accidents. The cyclist also has to be vigilant about whether it is day or night. If it is night, visibility is severely reduced, and they must be extremely careful as cars may not be able to see them easily. In the text, the cyclist was in extremely hot weather, with the sun baking the ground and the air filled with stifling heat. This is extremely dangerous to the cyclist if they are not prepared with essential things such as an ample supply of water. Overall, the setting presents various challenges that the cyclist has to face during the journey.
538	6516	3	3	The setting affects the cyclist because the cyclist initially believes that he has a nice, short, flat distance to travel to get to Yosemite. He imagines a smooth and effortless ride, but instead, it turns out to be a long, hilly (rough), and sweltering journey. He only prepared himself for a quick ride, bringing only a small amount of water, just enough for what he thought would be a brief trip, and wasn't prepared for the harsh reality of his ride. First of all, he is riding in the middle of the day, which is the hottest part of the day, in the “high deserts of California in June”. I know when I go to camp here in @LOCATION1 during the summer, I drink six to seven liters of water to stay hydrated, but the author only mentions a “few bottles of water”, which clearly aren't going to be sufficient to sustain him in that intense heat. Secondly, the cyclist believed that the old men had given him a safe and reliable path to follow, but instead, he unexpectedly came across a “ridiculously large snake. It really looked like a diamondback”. That is a highly poisonous snake, and the cyclist has barely been able to “ease past” it because of his lack of water, which has weakened his physical state. Lastly, the cyclist expected the old men to give him an easy path on a flat terrain, but in fact, the flat stretch was replaced by short, rolling hills. This means he has to put in more physical effort, using up more water in the process, to climb the hills. The setting definitely affects the cyclist because it makes it much more difficult for him to reach his destination. However, without these unexpected challenges and bumps in the road, how is he to learn a valuable life lesson about being better prepared and expecting the unexpected?
539	6517	3	3	The cyclist is affected by the features of the setting a great deal. For example, the dry and hot place creates an intense thirst in him as the heat causes his body to lose water rapidly through sweating. Then, the ghost towns he passes through are desolate and abandoned, making it extremely hard for him to get essential supplies like food, water, or spare parts for his bike. Also, the bad road, which is full of cracks, potholes, and loose gravel, slowed him down considerably. The rough surface of the bad roads even would probably hurt him and his bike. His body jolts with every bump, and the constant vibrations can damage the bike's components. The roads also would make him work harder as he has to pedal with more force to move forward on the uneven ground. In conclusion, the setting's features have a significant negative impact on the cyclist's journey.
540	6518	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many bad ways. For example, in the text it says how “I eased past trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state”. This means that he had a great deal of trouble being in a place he didn't know well. The unfamiliar surroundings added to his stress, and he was also severely dehydrated, which further impaired his physical and mental abilities. His body was weak, and his judgment was clouded, making it difficult for him to navigate safely. In conclusion, the setting did affect the cyclist, presenting numerous obstacles and challenges that made his journey a difficult and perilous one.
541	6519	3	3	First, the biker sets off on his journey. The bike smoothly encounters flat roads in the vast desert, where the lack of obstacles makes navigation through these areas very easy. When he arrives at his first town, he remains determined and keeps going, still focused on reaching Yosemite. As his water supply starts going low, he actively looks for some more water to keep himself going. Then he continues on his way and comes across a fork in the road. After choosing a path at the fork, he keeps pedaling forward and soon faces another problem. An old person tells him that it's @NUM1 miles to the next town, but he doesn't trust the guy. Despite his doubts, the biker decides to listen and goes on down the road. Next, he faces yet another challenge. The previously flat road starts to become quite uneven with short, alternating high and low hills. These hills gradually reduce his stamina greatly as he struggles to climb them. Then he has to deal with a rocky and bumpy desert road that jolts his bike and makes the ride uncomfortable. Suddenly, he has to face a snake on the road and quickly maneuvers to avoid it so that it doesn't attack him. Finally, the biker conquers his last long hill and is relieved to find a bait and tackle shop with lots of water. There, he can replenish his supplies and regain his strength for the rest of his journey.
542	6520	3	3	In “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the cyclist is significantly affected by the features of the setting, making him feel even worse than he initially does. The cyclist is lost in the unfamiliar area, has only managed to find dirty water, and is constantly moving on rough ground. The features of the setting are described as “cool pines and rushing rivers,” creating an idyllic image. However, the cyclist comes to find that the so - called “rushing river” is not as refreshing as it sounds. It might be dirty or difficult to access, leaving him disappointed. He also experiences a terrain change, transitioning from a flat road to short, rolling hills that require more effort to pedal through. There is a prominent sign, “Do not exceed posted speed limit,” which is also the name of the passage, with a limit of 55 mph. In contrast, the cyclist is only going a slow 12 mph, highlighting the vast difference between his pace and the speed limit. Ironically, he stumbles upon a picture of a boy drinking grape juice at the factory. This sight makes him hang his head in misery as his intense thirst becomes even more unbearable. Finally, he comes to a fish camp. When he encounters the owner, the owner, in an ironic twist, tells him he’d be better off using his map, leaving the cyclist still in a state of uncertainty about his journey.
543	6521	3	3	The features of the setting have a profound impact on the cyclist because he is destined to be on the road for a long time. The desolate setting, with no buildings in sight, no people around, and no cars passing by, affects the rider deeply. When he is running low on water, he feels utterly helpless in this empty expanse. The mention of a ghost town doesn't help his situation either. An old man told him about it, and he had high hopes of being able to get more water there. But when he arrives, he finds it just as barren as the rest of the area. The grape juice factory also affects him negatively. He thought he would finally get a refreshing drink there, but to his dismay, it is abandoned. There are no signs of activity or any available drinks. All these features combined create a difficult and discouraging situation for the cyclist, clearly showing how the features of the setting impact his journey and well - being.
544	6522	3	3	Features of the setting would have a significant impact on me if I were the cyclist. Just like him, I would start thinking that I was going to die. There is absolutely nothing interesting to look at in this desolate landscape. There is no gentle breeze to cool me down, and no wind to provide any relief. The cyclist has already seen a snake, which adds to the sense of danger. And to make matters worse, he has no water. He has gone through three towns, hoping to find some supplies, but each town has been completely empty with nothing to offer. The sun is slowly setting down on him, and the heat is still intense. He has no hope left as he struggles to continue. Who knows, maybe if he would have just strictly followed what the map had said, he would have been fine and avoided all these hardships.
545	6523	3	3	The features of the setting have a profound and multi - faceted impact on the cyclist. The cyclist is in a dire situation, running out of water and being exposed to the intense heat in “the high deserts of California in June.” The sweltering heat is relentless, sapping his energy and leaving him parched. The tumbleweeds that randomly cross his path add to his sense of desperation. They seem like a symbol of the desolation and isolation of the place. Not only do the features of the setting affect the cyclist physically by dehydrating him in the scorching heat, but they also take a toll on his mental state. The cyclist has to encounter various challenges along the way, such as rolling hills that make pedaling difficult, tumbleweeds that disrupt his path, rattlesnakes that pose a real threat, and ghost towns that offer no help. All of these factors gradually make the cyclist start to give up hope. He becomes more and more discouraged as he realizes the harshness of his environment. In conclusion, the features of the setting affect the cyclist both physically, by weakening his body, and mentally, by eroding his will to continue.
546	6524	3	3	The features of the setting greatly impacted the cyclist. First, the setting at the middle of the story was an empty expanse with no place to get water. The desolate landscape stretched as far as the eye could see, with not a single oasis in sight. This filled the cyclist with doubt and despair, and he/she thought they would die under the scorching sun. The setting also made the cyclist extremely thirsty because of the extreme heat that seemed to suck the moisture out of every pore. Finally, the cyclist was filled with regret because they regretted listening to the old men's advice. As a result, the cyclist didn't make it where he/she wanted to go, and the journey seemed like a wasted effort.
547	6525	3	3	The author thinks that the setting means he is not getting any closer to his destination. As he looked around, the vast and barren landscape seemed to stretch on forever, making his progress feel like a futile endeavor. However, he found out that there was still people around. Their sudden appearance in the desolate setting caught him off guard, and he panicked, thinking he was going to die. The places were deserted, with broken-down buildings and overgrown weeds, and he thought they led nowhere. He was a little scared at the fact he might die because everything around him was in a sense dead, with no signs of life or hope.
548	6526	3	3	The setting really affected the cyclist. Since he was in the desert on a bike, he was bound to be hot and tired. The relentless sun beat down on him, its rays like a furnace baking his body. The heat radiated from the sand, making the air shimmer and the ground feel like it was on fire. This exhaustion and heat would come from the sun coming down on him with full force. You know he was hot where it said “wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt.” The dried sweat was a clear sign of the intense heat and the toll it was taking on his body.
549	6527	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because they are extreme and do not change. The cyclist was riding on a narrow, dusty small road in the desert. The desert was a vast expanse of sand and rock, with no shade or relief from the blistering sun. In the desert, it was swelteringly hot, and because of this, the cyclist was sweating profusely and getting dehydrated rapidly. Also, because he was in the desert, with its featureless landscape and lack of landmarks, he had no sense of direction. He felt like he was wandering aimlessly in a sea of sand. Also, the towns were all run down, with dilapidated buildings and empty streets, with nothing in them. So, the cyclist couldn't get any water to drink to rehydrate himself. Only when he came to a small, shabby bait shop close by did he finally get water, which was a huge relief.
550	6528	3	3	"The setting really affected the cyclist a lot. The blazing sun and the sweltering hot weather dehydrated him quickly. His body was losing water at an alarming rate, and he felt weak and dizzy. He also had pretty much run out of water. In the story, he says ""The bottles contained only a few drops,"" which clearly shows that he had drank almost all of his water. Then it says ""the growing realization that I could drop from a heat - stroke"" shows the heat was affecting him severely. His head throbbed, and his vision started to blur, making him fear for his life. The setting had truly taken a toll on the cyclist's well - being."
551	6529	3	3	The setting was calm and peaceful as he started out riding his bike. With a wide smile on his face, he pedaled steadily, his strong legs propelling him forward. As he hit the @NUM1 town and saw a ramshackled shed, rusty pumps, and a corral, a sense of unease began to creep over him because he was running out of water. As the flat roads were replaced with short, rolling hills, his worry deepened. When he saw a building, his face lit up with hope, but when he found out it was run - down, he felt sad, thirsty, and utterly tired. When he finally saw an old man and told him he had a map, he became a little happier because he knew the map was going to help him reach Yosemite. As the setting became worse, with the landscape growing more desolate and the sun beating down mercilessly, his mood became worse as he had less and less water and felt very hopeless. But when he saw the man, the glimmer of hope returned, as he believed the map would guide him to his destination.
552	6530	3	3	The setting of this story is very rigorous. At the beginning of the story, the boy was in good spirits. He had a bottle of water with him, which he carried carefully to ensure he didn't get dehydrated. When he was riding, he started to feel the sun getting higher into the sky, though he could barely notice it because of the tall pines that shaded the road and the cool feel of the nearby river. The cyclist got to the second town on his journey. He had been sipping his water all day and was almost out. He had found a water pump. He got down on his knees, his body tired from the long ride, and pulled hard on the handle. All that came out was blackish water. He just feared the water and stated that it tasted like battery acid. He began to ride again. Not two miles up the road, the terrain changed. Not only was it rolling hills, but it was also getting hotter. He was majorly dehydrated because he was out of water except for a few “tantalizing sips”. Dry sweat circled his shirt and he was afraid he could suffer from heat - strokes. Where he was at was in the middle of nowhere, with no buildings, cars or structures in sight. Over the tops of the hills, a building came into view. He wiped the sweat off his eyes to make sure it was not a mirage. By the looks of it, it had been a Welchís @CAPS1 @CAPS2 Factory. He was so dehydrated and tired that he could imagine a “Young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice in his mouth.” The problem was that it was abandoned. This person was imagining things. He got back on his bike and stuck pebbles into his mouth to help take his mind off being thirsty.
553	6531	3	3	I read “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” written by Joe Kurmaskie. In the story, the features of the setting affect the cyclist by making him accept advice from “old timers who haven't left the confines of their porches while @CAPS1 was in office”. These old - timers, with their local knowledge and experience, offer guidance that the cyclist takes to heart, as the challenging setting makes him rely on any help he can get.
554	6532	3	3	In the essay “Do not exceed posted speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. First, the sun is making the cyclist hot and dehydrated. He states “The sun was beginning to beat down,” clearly indicating that the sun was a big factor in its effect on the cyclist. The intense heat made him sweat profusely and drained his energy. Also, the hills of the country roads. Going up and down hills take a lot of work; you have to use a great deal of energy. The cyclist says “@CAPS2 were replaced by short, rolling hills.” Moreover, there were snakes in the road, which made the cyclist timid, constantly looking out for snakes so he would not get bit. Again, the cyclist states “diamond back - blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.” Additionally, there was an old factory that gave the cyclist hope and then crushed his hopes. The factory even made him more thirsty as he imagined the refreshment it could have provided. In conclusion, there were many affects on the cyclist due to the setting.
555	6533	3	3	The features of the setting take their toll on the unfortunate cyclist. For example, “I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June.” The deserts of California, especially in June, are extremely hot and dry. The scorching sun beats down on the cyclist, causing him to use much of his water supply very quickly. As he “toiled” on, the terrain features became even more trying, “over one long, crippling hill…” By this time, the cyclist was so exhausted that he barely had enough energy to make it over a hill. All the wear and tear his body was put through by the features of his setting, such as the heat, the dryness, and the difficult terrain, left him on the verge of collapse. In the end, the harsh setting had truly tested his limits.
556	6534	3	3	The settings of this story have an encouraging impact on it, as the ride he undertakes is quite challenging. The terrain in the story seems rough, and he spots a sign that clearly reads, “Rough road ahead, do not exceed posted speed limit.” He has to navigate up and down hills filled with rocks, and there is no water source in sight. Such a setting for a really athletic ride can be truly devastating, making the outcome of the journey highly uncertain.
557	6535	3	3	The features of the cyclist and the settings aren't that good. There are incidents that pose problems. One of them is the bad weather. The temperature is such that it makes it feel pretty close to @NUM1 degrees. He stops at a water pump, and although water comes out, it is far from cool. He takes two tiny sips, and it tastes like battery acid. If he were to drink a large amount of that water, it would probably either kill him or make him extremely ill. He desperately needs something because there is another town @NUM2 miles down the road, so he has to find a way to keep himself going. As he pedals down the road, he sees a sign: “Rough Road Ahead.” Even though he is going at 12 mph, he could still hit a hole and go flying over his handlebars. If he does go over his handlebars, he could run into the snake he saw earlier and then get eaten by the birds because he wouldn't have any energy to get up. There are indeed some interesting scenes in the story that add to its tension.
558	6536	3	3	Heat, water supply, energy – all are crucial features of the setting that can significantly affect a cyclist. First, there is heat. When it is overly warm outside, it not only makes the ride more difficult but also extremely inconvenient. The sweltering heat can sap a cyclist's strength and motivation. Second, water supply is vital. If you are in the middle of a ride and start to run low on water, you are in serious trouble. The author describes, “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.” This shows that if you aren't well - prepared for your cycling journey, it will be extremely inconvenient when you run out of supplies. Lastly, energy is the key. If you run out of energy while cycling, you have nothing. Your energy is what keeps you moving forward and motivated. “With what I believe, was my last burst of energy, I maneuvered down the hill,” the author describes. When you are out of energy, your ride comes to an end. All of these aspects are essential to consider and have in place before deciding to go on a cycling journey to ensure a successful and enjoyable ride.
559	6537	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in multiple ways. Firstly, the combination of the heat and the lack of water leads to dehydration and can even cause him to see mirages. The intense heat makes him lose a large amount of water through sweating, and with little water available, his body starts to suffer. Secondly, he loses strength as he goes over the many hills. The steep inclines and rough terrain require a great deal of physical effort, gradually draining his energy. Moreover, there is a very large snake that he has to ride by, which poses a real danger as it could have bitten him. All these factors together make the cyclist's journey extremely difficult and perilous.
560	6538	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because when there are hills to climb and only a small amount of water, dehydration is inevitable. The physical exertion of climbing hills makes the cyclist sweat profusely, and without enough water to replenish the lost fluids, his body starts to suffer. Also, the heat from the desert is so intense that it further exacerbates the dehydration problem. If you don't pace yourself and don't drink an appropriate amount of water, you will struggle to reach your goal. Taking breaks to rest is also a big factor. If you don't have enough energy due to lack of rest, you won't be able to cover much distance. Therefore, proper planning and management are essential for a cyclist to overcome the challenges posed by the setting.
561	6539	3	3	The features of the setting significantly affect the cyclist. The steep hills made it extremely hard for him to ride his bike uphill as he had to exert a great deal of energy with each pedal stroke. Moreover, he was afraid of the grass because it was tall and had a rather scary - looking appearance, which made him cautious while cycling through areas with such grass. In the end, these setting features clearly hindered his cycling experience.
562	6540	3	3	In the story “Do not exceed Posted Speed limit”, a determined cyclist embarks on a journey through the challenging terrain to reach the beautiful Yosemite. In that particular part of California, there are very few towns and the population is sparse. The road he is riding on is not only very dangerous but also incredibly long, with potholes and sharp turns. It is very dry and hot out there, and the lack of shade makes the journey even more arduous. Despite these difficulties, the cyclist perseveres in his quest to reach Yosemite.
563	6541	3	3	The setting can affect a cyclist in a multitude of ways. One prominent way the setting affects a cyclist is when the weather is hot. In such conditions, it becomes notably harder to cycle long distances. I say this because in the story, the narrator vividly states “...and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke...” Another crucial part of the setting that impacts cyclists is the terrain they cycle on. For instance, it is much easier to cycle on flat, smooth ground where the wheels roll effortlessly than it is on rolling hills with rough, rocky ground that constantly jolts the cyclist. This is clearly shown with the quote “...ride down into distances I could see over the horizon, telling myself that if I could make it that far, I’d be fine.” Setting can have a great deal of impact on a cyclist, depending on whether it's smooth or rocky, or hot or cool, ultimately influencing their cycling performance and experience.
564	6542	3	3	In Joe Kurmaskie’s “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed the Speed Limit”, the features of the setting affect the cyclist to a great extent. Each distinct feature causes the cyclist to take specific actions. For example, upon reaching the “ramshackle shed”, the cyclist discovers that the water there is unusable. This forces him to carefully conserve the little water he has left and attempt to head for the next town. That action leads him deeper into the sweltering high deserts of California during the hot month of June. Also, as the terrain gradually changes from a flat road to short, rolling hills, the cyclist must adjust his speed to better endure and continue in his dehydrated state. The scarcity of buildings in this dry and barren desert terrain compels the cyclist to check every “shack” or building he comes across in the hope of finding water. In this story, the features of the setting strongly dictate the actions of the cyclist in his desperate quest to survive in the desert.
565	6543	3	3	The cyclist in the essay, “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”, is on what starts as a great adventure but soon turns bad. He initially has everything he thinks he needs, yet somehow, things take a turn for the worse. He gets low on water, and the setting is truly horrible. He is on his way from a campground in @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1 to the Yosemite river. He receives bad directions from some old guys at the campground. On his way, he runs into two abandoned towns, and as he pedals on, he starts running out of water. Then he comes to a sign that says, “Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” He is pedaling over hills, and with each passing moment, he becomes more and more dehydrated. When he thinks he is going to die, he comes to a bait shop. There, he gets water and meets an old guy who offers to give him directions. However, he decides he better stick to the map. Even though the setting gets worse as the story progresses, he sticks it out and finally makes it to the end of his challenging journey.
566	6544	3	3	Heat, hills, and ghost towns – all are prominent features of the setting that significantly affect the cyclist. First, the intense heat dehydrates and exhausts him, pushing him to the brink of a heat - stroke. As the sun beats down mercilessly, he starts drinking more often, and soon realizes he's nearly run out of water. Next are the hills. These steep inclines demand massive amounts of energy to climb, further adding to his dehydration as he pants and sweats his way up. Finally, the desolate ghost towns. Their empty streets and dilapidated buildings make his long journey seem hopeless, and there's a real risk that this could cause him to lose the will to carry on. Overall, these elements of the setting combine to make the cyclist's journey an extremely challenging one.
567	6545	3	3	The cyclist is in the sweltering desert where the temperature soars to @NUM1 degrees. The water he has, which is his only relief, tastes like battery acid, making it a bitter necessity. The harsh desert environment plays tricks on his senses, causing him to see mirages. Meanwhile, the copious sweat pouring down his face keeps getting into his eyes, stinging and blurring his vision. In the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, these desert - induced hardships are integral to the cyclist's experience. All these factors combine to make his journey in the desert a truly arduous one.
568	6546	3	3	In the story, “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the author shares a tale of when he followed the advice of the “old folks” and ended up getting lost. The setting of his journey had a profound impact on him. For example, he describes how “tumbleweeds crossed my path, and a ridiculously large snake...”, which gives a vivid picture of the wild and unpredictable environment. The mention of a “crippling hill” also emphasizes the physical challenges he faced. These quotes clearly explain that the setting was quite scary, filled with elements that made his journey both dangerous and nerve - wracking. In conclusion, the setting in this story is a crucial factor that adds to the overall sense of adventure and peril.
569	6547	3	3	He's in a very hot climate, specifically in a vast, arid desert. Due to the scorching heat, he needs large amounts of water to stay hydrated, but unfortunately, he has a limited supply. To make matters worse, he's riding on hilly terrain. The steep slopes and uneven ground make pedaling incredibly difficult, expending even more of his energy. As if that weren't enough, he can't find any towns that aren't abandoned. The desolate, empty towns offer no respite or assistance. All these factors combined create a very tough situation for him during his journey.
570	6548	3	3	In the story, the features of the setting affect the cyclist in numerous ways. One significant way is time. The rough and uneven road forces him to go slower, meaning it takes him much longer to reach the town. Every pedal - stroke is a struggle on this difficult surface. Also, because the road is so hard to pedal on, he expends a great deal of energy and quickly gets thirsty. To make matters worse, the water he has is really hot, offering little relief from his thirst. In conclusion, the setting's features conspire to make the cyclist's journey both time - consuming and physically draining.
571	6549	3	3	There were several notable features of the setting that held an impact on the cyclist in this story. For one, the cyclist was riding in a sweltering hot desert. The intense heat in this condition normally makes it extremely difficult for one to obtain water. Seeing as how water was an absolute necessity for the cyclist to keep going, the lack of it due to the arid desert created the critical conflict of dehydration. Additionally, the desolate and abandoned town that the cyclist passed through triggered a spark of deep - seated doubt in the cyclist’s mind. The cyclist now had to ride with his brain clouded in doubt and his body in a state of desperate hope. By the time he/she reaches the old, dilapidated factory, the cyclist is extremely dehydrated. Now his head is screaming with annoyance from the heat and exhaustion, and his body is screaming with an intense lack of water. This abandoned juice factory almost completely wiped out the cyclist's last shreds of hope. A man is little to nothing without hope. Therefore, this abandoned factory had a profoundly negative affect on him. Now, the only reason he continues is out of his/her primal desperation for survival, an instinct deeply ingrained in all of us. In conclusion, the desert removed the essential water, and the abandoned homes and factory removed the precious hope, and all three elements combined created a severely negative affect. The cyclist is truly lucky to have survived.
572	6550	3	3	The setting had a profound and direct impact on the cyclist, because he didn’t know if he was going to die or live in this harsh environment. The scorching heat made him use up all his water at a rapid pace. As he pedaled on, the heat bore down on him like a furnace, and his mouth became as dry as a desert. Every breath was a struggle, and his throat felt like it was lined with sandpaper. With no end in sight and no immediate source of water, the cyclist was in a life - threatening situation. The setting, with its unforgiving heat, had put his very survival at stake. In conclusion, the harsh setting was a major factor that endangered the cyclist's life, and his fate hung in the balance.
573	6551	3	3	In the short story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, he shows that the features of the setting played a significant role in affecting the cyclist in many different ways. A prominent setting the cyclist faces is that it is so swelteringly hot that he keeps constantly taking (drinking) water, and he is constantly worrying that he is going to run out. Kurmaskie writes, “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in the blistering heat. The sun was beating down mercilessly, and the dry air was sucking the moisture out of me.” This is what the cyclist gets affected by throughout the whole story as he realizes he could die of a dangerous heatstroke if he doesn't carefully watch how much water he's drinking. Also, this is what a lot of people normally face when traveling in such extreme conditions, which is a huge challenge because of the ever - present threat of dehydration. In conclusion, the hot desert setting in the story is a major obstacle for the cyclist, endangering his well - being.
574	6552	3	3	With age comes wisdom and all that, but the world is a constantly fluid place where things change rapidly. No, a better piece of advice for the solo cyclist is this: Never take travel advice from old - timers who haven’t left the confines of their front porches. As the cyclist continued on his journey, the previously flat road was gradually replaced by short, but challenging rolling hills. Up ahead, a sign warned “Rough Road ahead. Do not exceed posted speed limit.” The rough road was full of potholes and uneven surfaces, making the ride even more difficult. The cyclist had to be extra cautious to avoid accidents. In conclusion, the changing road conditions and the unreliable advice added to the difficulties of the cyclist's solo journey.
575	6553	3	3	Many things about the setting in “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” have a substantial impact on the cyclist. The terrain in this story is not only hilly but also filled with vast, arid deserts. The steep inclines and declines of the hills, combined with the dry and hot desert environment, contribute to the cyclist's nagging and persistent sensation for a drink of water. The strenuous ride on the hills and through the unforgiving desert also tire him out dramatically. His muscles ache with every pedal stroke, and his energy is rapidly depleting. Not to mention that while he is severely dehydrated, and when he finally finds water, it is “tarlike” and “in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees,” making it almost undrinkable. The cyclist in this story really must have a strong desire to get to Yosemite National Park if he is willing to go through all this trouble. The old men he asked in Lodi, California hadn’t left the town in decades and gave the cyclist faulty directions that could have potentially killed him. So he asked for directions and was given inadequate information, which made life extremely difficult for the cyclist. In conclusion, the challenging terrain, the lack of proper water, and the unreliable directions all combined to make the cyclist's journey to Yosemite a perilous one.
576	6554	3	3	The setting of “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” affects the cyclist in so many ways. First of all, the cyclist is riding in a vast desert, in mid - June, with the intense heat “beginning to beat down” mercilessly on him. This sweltering feature of the setting causes the cyclist to drink more water to stay hydrated. However, when his supply of water was running low, he was unable to drink much water to hydrate himself properly. The cyclist began to realize that he “could trap from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June.” Additionally, the long distance and significant changes in the terrain that the cyclist was travelling on, affected him greatly. The distance the cyclist was travelling to Yosemite National Park consisted of hours and miles of arduous riding, over vast and varied changes of terrain. The “flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills,” which severely affected the cyclist's speed and depleted his energy to finish his trip. In the end, the harsh setting posed a serious threat to his journey.
577	6555	3	3	A response that explains how the features of setting affect the cyclist by getting the wrong direction from the old man. One feature is when he passed through a ghost town. The old people in the town didn't know what they were telling him. It made it hard for him because there were more difficult roads and less available water. The rough roads required more effort to cycle on, and the scarcity of water left him parched. He almost died due to the combination of the wrong directions, tough roads, and lack of water. In conclusion, the setting features in this ghost - town encounter nearly cost the cyclist his life.
578	6556	3	3	The features of the setting will affect the cyclist because the roads are steeply hilly and he is an elderly man, so it will be extremely hard for him to ride up them. The inclines require a great deal of physical exertion that his aging body struggles to provide. It was very hot, with the sun blazing down relentlessly, and he had a scarce supply of water. The heat was so intense that he was seeing things that weren't there, a sign of heat - induced delirium. When he did try to get some water, the weather was so hot that the water from the pump came out hot, which was of little help in quenching his thirst. In the end, the harsh setting made his cycling journey a life - threatening ordeal.
579	6557	3	3	Well, some features of the setting like the intense hotness are affecting the cyclist. For example, he was riding through the high deserts of California, where the sun was scorching, and he was drinking too much of his water to combat the heat. So when he stopped at a place, the pipes and other means to get water were rusty and old, making the water unappealing and potentially unsafe. Another instance was when he thought he could make it to the other town to get water there. He started his ride, and the roads were hilly and short, which made pedaling difficult. Then the road turned bumpy too, jolting him around on his bike. So no matter what, he was having a very hard time. In conclusion, the hotness, poor water sources, and rough roads in the setting made his cycling experience a nightmare.
580	6558	3	3	The character in this short story has a mood that changes with his surroundings. Towards the beginning when he was enjoying his ride, he said, “The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name all over them.” He was full of excitement and anticipation for the beautiful destination. As time goes on and he begins to realize that nobody inhabits the path he is on, he becomes anxious. Moreover, the terrain becomes rougher, with uneven ground and perhaps some unexpected obstacles. This combination of isolation and difficult terrain further dampens his mood. In the end, the changing setting completely transformed his initial enthusiasm into a state of unease.
581	6559	3	3	There are many ways the features of the setting affect the cyclist. For instance, the desert is not a humid environment, making its lack of water a bigger deal than normal. The cyclist has to constantly worry about dehydration. Also, there are many hills, making him have to use full force to get up them, which further depletes his energy and makes water an even bigger necessity. In conclusion, if the temperatures were level and it was flat land, he could go further with a less water supply as he wouldn't expend as much energy.
582	6560	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist, and one important aspect is to never accept travel advice from a collection of old - timers who haven’t left their porches since Carter was in office. After all, you don’t know if they are a reliable source or what kind of information they possess. Some people have remained on their porches for such a long time, perhaps due to various reasons. Maybe they have health issues or simply prefer a sedentary life. I don’t know exactly why people have not left their porches since Carter was in office, but it's clear that relying on their advice can be risky for the cyclist.
583	6561	3	3	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaskie, he accepts directions from old men for a shortcut to Yosemite National Park. He ends up cycling in a desert with no water, barely able to push the pedals of his bike. The setting affects the cyclist severely as it is extremely hot, he has nothing to drink, there is nowhere to get water or food, and he might be seeing mirages. In the essay, it states, “Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from a heatstroke.” This clearly shows that the lack of water and the harsh surrounding environment with nowhere to go is making him give up hope to survive. It also says in the essay, “I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn’t a mirage, and tried not to get too excited.” The cyclist is admitting that the desert has him doubting his own senses, and having false hopes when he sees something that might not be real. The desert setting of this essay affects the cyclist in many ways other than just one, all of which are detrimental to his journey.
584	6562	3	3	In “Do not exceed posted speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, I think that the setting affected the cyclist because he was extremely thirsty and he thought he was going to die. In this case, he had no water left and he was in the scorching desert. The heat was unbearable, and his throat was parched. He was regretting not taking the advice of the stranger and was slowly dying of thirst. Also, he didn't have the mindset that he wanted to live; the hopelessness of the situation was overwhelming him. That's how I think the setting affected him, making his situation in the desert a life - threatening one.
585	6563	3	3	The features of the setting have a big impact on the cyclist. One feature is the hot weather and the area he is in. He says he is in the “high deserts of California in June.” With June being a hot month in California, and the cyclist being around deserts, the heat is intensified. “I could drop from a heatstroke,” he says. The sun is beating down on him relentlessly, taking away the cyclist’s energy that he needs for riding his bike. Another feature that affected the cyclist was his lack of water. “Trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.” This affected the cyclist by making him extremely tired. Being tired from no water, the cyclist had great trouble going up hills on his bike. The last feature that affected the cyclist was all of the hills in his path. “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” These hills made it hard to go up on a bike, especially considering his lack of water and the intense heat. All of these features affect the cyclist by making him lose energy, get tired, and become frustrated because of their combined negative impact on his cycling journey.
586	6564	3	3	Nature has an impact on everyone, even when they don't realize it. This is especially true for cyclists traveling far and wide. In “Do not exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, it serves as a perfect example of how settings affect people like cyclists. When you're riding your bike as a means of cross - country transportation, you need to be well - informed about what you're doing and where you're going. The cyclist in this story decided to take advice from older fellows and ended up on the wrong route. At these so - called “towns,” there was no water because they weren't proper towns anymore. Without water, like this cyclist, the hills could be life - threatening. For instance, “I gathered a few pebbles and stuck them in my mouth. I'd read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst.” This cyclist knew a bit of survival tips. If he had gone all that way without dealing with his thirst and the challenges of those hills, he probably would have suffered some kind of stroke. These are just a few ways that the setting could harm you, highlighting the importance of being prepared when facing nature's elements on a cycling journey.
587	6565	3	3	Some of the features of the setting that affected the cyclist were quite challenging. The seal on his equipment was starting to give way, but he only truly noticed it about twenty miles up the road when he came to a sort of park. The cyclist was riding through the sweltering high deserts of California in June. He got down on his hands and knees, working on the heated handle of the rusty pump. The pump began to shoot out a tar - like substance, and the water was around two hundred degrees. After two more miles, he noticed the terrain changing from a flat road to short, rolling hills. He said tumbleweeds crossed his path and a large snake slithered across the pavement. He gathered some pebbles and stuck them in his mouth, having read that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst. After reading about these experiences, it's clear that these settings had a significant impact on the cyclist, making his journey arduous and full of obstacles.
588	6566	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. First, the “town” the cyclist first comes upon is described as a desolate ghost town. Although the cyclist chuckles about it at first, this setting foreshadows the long and difficult journey ahead of him. There were other features that would negatively affect the cyclist. For example, “...I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” (pg @NUM1). Flat land is much easier for a cyclist to pedal on. The shift from flat land to hills took a toll on his stamina and his will to keep going. He really had to dig deep and push himself to trudge up and down each hill. His determination finally led him to, “Gary and Wilber’s Fish camp...” (pg @NUM2). He finally found a glimmer of hope in the midst of the challenging setting, showing how the setting can both hinder and, in rare cases, offer a bit of relief.
589	6567	3	3	In the story “Rough road ahead do not exceed posted speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting had a more negative impact on the cyclist. The cyclist got exhausted due to the large hills, and the only positive aspect was the scenic view. “The water bottle only contained a few tantalizing sips.” He didn't have enough water and was extremely thirsty. “At some point, a ridiculously large snake—it really did look like a diamondback—blocked the majority of the pavement.” It was a dangerous area where he was riding, and even though he was on a bike, he could have been bitten. All of these points clearly show the negative effects of the setting on the cyclist, making his journey a struggle filled with physical and safety - related challenges.
590	6568	3	3	The desert - like land affected the cyclist by making him extremely tired and causing a significant loss of body water. As a result, he desperately needed water to continue his journey. I think the constant thought of being so thirsty made him even weaker. If he hadn't been so preoccupied with his thirst, the ride wouldn't have been as rough. The harsh desert environment, with its lack of water and arid conditions, took a toll on the cyclist's physical and mental state, demonstrating how the setting can greatly influence a cyclist's experience.
591	6569	3	3	In the cyclist’s outlook on his journey through Yosemite’s park, readers can get a vivid good feel of how it might be to be riding right alongside him. It seems that the entire stretch of the bike ride is extremely beautiful. As he pedals along, he sees such a vast and diverse variety of scenery. This includes gurgling rivers that wind through the landscape, expansive sandy dry deserts that seem to go on forever, as well as tall and cool pines and other trees within the park part. He said it was also breezy, with a gentle wind caressing his face, which probably made for an enjoyable and comfortable temperature, enhancing the overall experience of the ride.
592	6570	3	3	The features of the bike ride to Yosemite through California in June significantly affect the cyclist. Some of the prominent features were the sweltering hot high deserts, where the sun bore down relentlessly, and the complete lack of water sources. This affected the author in a harsh way, making him severely dehydrated and extremely tired. The exhaustion made it incredibly hard for him to find water or to continue his journey to Yosemite. In this case, the author says “The sun was beating down on me,” clearly indicating how the intense heat was taking a toll. He is hot from the unforgiving sun. He also says “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips,” showing how he has almost no water and is most likely severely dehydrated. All of those features are negatively affecting the way he is traveling and his ability to reach a water supply.
593	6571	3	3	In the essay, “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” there are many distinct features of the setting that greatly affect the cyclist. Many of these features impact him in a negative way. One such prominent feature is the numerous hills that are present in the essay. These steep and challenging hills probably exasperated the cyclist even more than he already was with the scorching sun beating down on him, making each pedal stroke a struggle. Another feature was the road sign that said “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” “The speed limit was @NUM1. I was doing a water - depleting @NUM2. Sometimes life can feel so cruel.” The author/cyclist probably felt like he would never make it to his destination. Also, the sign advertising grape juice probably made him feel life was even crueler with its sadistic irony, as he was parched and in desperate need of a drink. Finally, the bait shop offered much - needed relief to the cyclist. “I had an overwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber, kiss them, and buy some bait.” All in all, the setting affected the cyclist in some pretty bad ways until the end, when the bait shop provided a glimmer of hope.
594	6572	3	3	Many features of the setting affected the cyclist. First, the intense heat was the main part of nature that threw him off balance. The blistering sun caused him to go dehydrated because of the lack of available water. As a result, he went kind of delirious. He started to think he was seeing things that weren't there and his vision was distorted, making it difficult to focus on the path ahead. Next, the water he had to come across in the pump was undrinkable. There was a tarlike substance coming out of it, and the degree of water he said it was, which was @NUM1 degree, made it unfit for consumption. Lastly, the Welch’s factory that he came across was teasing him in a cruel way. He was in desperate need of liquids, but he couldn’t have the refreshing drinks. The little boy advertised on the building was drinking his refreshed Welch’s juice, adding to his misery. Not only did the cyclist get off track because of the directions, the setting made his bike adventure to Yosemite even more unbearable and challenging.
595	6573	3	3	The setting affects the cyclist in many ways. First is that it is extremely hot in the desert, with the sun shining brightly and the temperature soaring. The searing heat makes every moment of the ride a struggle, sapping his energy and dehydrating him quickly. Second is that there aren’t many towns out there. The vast expanse of the desert is mostly empty, with long stretches of nothing but sand and heat between potential rest stops. Finally is that water is hard to find out there. So if he gets thirsty, it would be a real challenge to get more water if he didn’t find a town in time. The combination of these factors makes the cyclist’s journey through the desert a difficult and arduous one.
596	6575	3	3	The setting affects the cyclist in almost every aspect of what he does and what he encounters. The setting is a sweltering hot day in June in the desert. There are numerous hills, and the terrain changes several times throughout the journey. Because the day is extremely hot, the cyclist drinks large amounts of water. And because he consumes so much water, he very soon runs out. In the story it states, “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” This quote clearly shows that because it was so scorching hot, the cyclist drank lots of water, and as a result, he very quickly ran out of water. Also in the story it states, “Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.” This quote suggests that because the terrain changed to hills, the cyclist became extremely tired and hot from having to pedal up and down those hills. And because this caused him to become hot and tired, he also drank his water more quickly than if he was pedaling on a flat paved road on a cool day in @DATE1. In conclusion, the setting causes the cyclist to become tired, hot, and thirsty, which significantly affects his entire journey.
597	6576	3	3	The features of the setting in the story affect the cyclist by vividly describing that he is in a desert - like area in Lodi, California. They emphasize that it is extremely hot, and there is sand covering every visible surface. There also aren't many suitable places to cool off at, such as shaded spots or air - conditioned areas. They also described the water and the general temperature in Lodi to be about @NUM1 degree. The cyclist was desperately trying to get to Yosemite to escape from the unbearable heat and to have the comfort of cool, shady pine trees to sit under and cool fresh water to drink. This affects the cyclist because he quickly gets dehydrated due to the horrid, unrelenting heat. In summary, the harsh setting in Lodi poses great challenges to the cyclist's well - being during his journey.
598	6577	3	3	The features of the setting have a large impact on the cyclist. If a cyclist would happen to be cycling in the snow, he or she could eat snow to keep from dehydration as snow can provide a source of water in that cold environment. If the cyclist in “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” was cycling in winter time, he would have been constantly so thirsty all of the time because the cold air can cause increased water loss through respiration. Also, if the whole ride was downhill, he would be extremely tired as the constant braking and control of the bike to maintain speed can put a strain on the muscles. In conclusion, different settings can bring various difficulties and physical demands to the cyclist.
599	6578	3	3	The conditions for the cyclist in the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” are pretty dangerous. “a ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the pavement balance my dehydrated state bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips” (kurmaskie, @NUM1). There was a rather large snake right in his path, coiled menacingly. You can tell he isn't an expert on snakes because he couldn't even begin to identify what kind of snake it was. Because he is in the arid desert on a long bike ride, he is severely dehydrated. His water supply is almost completely gone, with only a few drops left in his bottles. The cyclist feared many dangerous challenges in his journey, such as this snake encounter and the threat of further dehydration. In the end, the harsh desert setting and the unexpected obstacles make his journey a perilous one.
600	6579	3	3	The features of the setting that affect the cyclist are the terrain, the lack of provisions and the power of self - determination. The terrain affected the cyclist by having him/her ride through rough and uneven paths in order to reach their destination. For example, if you walk on sharp rocks, you are bound to reach some rough spots where it seems you can't move forward easily. But that is where self - determination kicks in. The power to keep yourself moving even though there might be obstacles in your way; you know there will be a better path or a reward at the end. Another example of a feature is a lack of provision on your trip. When you don't have the right provisions, like enough food and water, to keep yourself energized, you can't get over your obstacles or even push yourself to do anything. This is why the features of the setting, including the difficult terrain, insufficient provisions, and the need for self - determination, have a significant impact on the cyclist.
601	6580	3	3	In “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the harsh terrain has a notably negative effect on the author. He claims that “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June” (Kurmaskie). This clearly shows that he has been drinking his water too fast due to the intense heat from being in the desert during summertime. After traveling for a long time with no water in sight, he lets out a few chuckles, thinking of how he shouldn't have ignored the old men's advice. He explains that “It was a sad, hopeless laugh, mind you, but at least I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself.” This is a prime example of how badly the unforgiving terrain had affected him. It's gotten to him so much that he even applauds himself for having the mere energy to feel sorry for himself, highlighting the extreme toll the journey has taken on him.
602	6581	3	3	The features of the desolate setting significantly affect the cyclist because the cyclist is already extremely tired and desperately thirsty. The features include a vast desert - like setting of California, where it is swelteringly hot. There are absolutely no signs of civilization in sight, giving an overwhelming sense of isolation. The roads are like never - ending hills that stretch throughout the arid desert. On top of those harsh facts, the cyclist is rapidly dehydrating because his water supply has supposedly diminished, leaving him in a precarious situation during this grueling journey.
603	6582	3	3	"The setting of the short cut affected the cyclist in numerous ways. For example, he came across rusty water, and as he described, ""it tasted like battery acid."" Due to this repulsive taste, he was not able to drink it, which gradually made him become severely dehydrated. Also, in the story, it says, ""flat roads were replaced by short rolling hills."" This change in the terrain could have made the journey even more arduous for the cyclist because now he had to exert a little more effort to pedal up the hills. One more example is towards the end when he says, ""I began breaking my ride down into distances, I could see the horizon telling myself I could make it there."" By the cyclist saying this, it seems like he has almost given up and he realizes that this seemingly never - ending journey will only end when he succumbs to exhaustion. That is how the unforgiving setting in the story affected the cyclist."
604	6583	3	3	Some features of the menacing setting affected the cyclist deeply. The continuous rolling hills, the unexpected encounter with a poisonous snake, and the poor conditions of the road worried her greatly. For example, @CAPS1 said, “I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean, leaving only some expensive outdoor gear and the diary.” @CAPS1 had an overwhelming sense of doubt when uttering that quote. @CAPS1 truly didn't think @CAPS1 would ever make it through this harrowing journey. Finally, after much struggle, @CAPS1 reached another destination and once again found herself asking another older man for directions, still in the midst of this challenging and uncertain adventure.
605	6584	3	3	In “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by @PERSON1, the features of the desolate setting greatly affect the struggling cyclist. The first major example is when the cyclist finds that the initially flat road is gradually turning into “short, rolling hills.” These pesky hills are steadily increasing the difficulty of the ride and are causing him to have serious doubts that he will make it to his destination. An additional part of the setting which caused major doubt was that he was in a vast, deserted desert. As he described, “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” The distant horizon was what kept the cyclist going. He said, “I began breaking the ride down into distances: I could see on the horizon, telling myself that if I could make it that far, I’d be fine.” The horizon kept him hopeful and determined. Without the challenging setting he would not have been in such a serious predicament, but luckily in the end, the very same setting helped him muster enough determination to make it through the tough journey.
606	6585	3	3	I guess really safety comes first, and you have to be extremely cautious when you're out in the streets on a bicycle. You never know what might happen. I really don't understand much about cycling safety details, so I can't write much on this topic. But it's clear that being careful is crucial.
607	6586	3	3	When the biker listened attentively to the old folks, he felt a sense of confidence. He pedaled steadily and biked to the first town, but upon arrival, it was like a “ghost town.” After all, a town is a town, yet this one seemed deserted. Soon after that, as he continued on his journey, he did not see anything around. There were no cars passing by, no buildings in sight, or anything of that sort. He was getting increasingly sad and severely dehydrated. The old men had sworn there was a town coming up, so he put his trust and confidence in them once again. He saw a building gradually coming up in the distance, but it was just an old, worn - down factory. He thought he was let down. He was sure he was going to die, right there and then. Then he saw a sign for a fish company! He was overjoyed! The place was really there! He thought of them as his saviors! The settings effect the cyclist tremendously, making his journey a real test of will.
608	6587	3	3	In the story “Rough Road Ahead Do Not Exceed Posted Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, there were many settings that significantly affect the cyclist. One vivid example would be when he came up to a water pump that looked quite old and rusty. He tried his best to get water out, gripping the handle tightly and working it with all his strength. But unfortunately, water didn't come out. “...working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength. A tar - like substance oozed out...” (Kurmaskie). Another example is when he came across rolling hills that seemed never - ending, and the scaring heat that made him sweat profusely. He also came across a snake that took up most of the narrow pavement, which really startled him. These settings clearly had a major impact on the cyclist's journey.
609	6588	3	3	The features of the settings affect the cyclist significantly. If the environment is just filled with tall buildings on both sides and cars constantly moving around, the cyclist won't be able to break free and bicycle freely. The limited space between buildings restricts his movement, and the presence of cars makes him more cautious. So, it's evident that such settings can have a negative impact on his cycling experience and freedom.
610	6589	3	3	The setting in the story was extremely hot. The biker was sweating a great deal, and his clothes were soaked. The whole town was completely empty. As he rode along, he passed by numerous empty buildings that looked desolate. There were also rivers that he had to cross carefully and big hills that he had to laboriously ride through. As it says about the buildings, “somehow, I climbed away from the abandoned factory of juices and dreams, slowly gaining elevation while losing hope.” The setting would affect the cyclist because there was no one in the town to offer help or company. Also, the high hills made his cycling extremely strenuous. All these factors combined made his journey a real challenge.
611	6590	3	3	The feature of the setting greatly affected the cyclist. He was in the California desert in the scorching month of June. The vast expanse of the desert had no readily available water sources, so he had to rely solely on the limited water he had carried with him. He says the sun began beating down harder, its rays relentless, and the terrain gradually turned into short rolling hills. These hills made him exert more energy with each pedal stroke, which further dehydrated him quickly. And since there was no water in the arid desert, he was at a high risk of dying of dehydration. In such a harsh environment, every drop of water and every bit of energy became crucial for his survival.
612	6591	3	3	When you're with your family in Ocean City, biking down the bustling boardwalk, your only real obstacle is the throng of people strolling along. However, when you're in a race on winding roads, you could encounter a multitude of obstacles. The weather could prove to be your greatest challenge. You could pass out due to the lack of water and the scorching heat that beats down mercilessly. You could also fall over on the slippery roads caused by a sudden downpour of rain. Along with that, nature could take its toll on you. For instance, a ridiculously large snake once blocked the majority of the pavement in front of the cyclist, just like that, you never know what unexpected thing you could come across in such a situation. In the end, racing on winding roads presents far more complex and unpredictable challenges compared to a casual bike ride on the boardwalk.
613	6592	3	3	Many of the features of the setting affect the cyclist. The cyclist is biking through the desolate deserts. “A ridiculously large snake” – this quote clearly shows that not only is the weather and climate against him, but also the unexpected elements of nature. “I could drop from heat stroke” – another great quote that vividly depicts how sweltering hot it really is where the cyclist is pedaling. “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” This is a great detailed description of the desolate area where the cyclist finds himself, highlighting just how deserted it is. “The bottle only contained a few tantalizing sips.” This indicates that the cyclist is running critically low on water in the unforgiving desert, and in a desert with no water, that could spell disaster. The above quotes really draw you in and allow you to see the many features of the harsh setting and what it's like for the struggling cyclist. In conclusion, these setting features pose significant and life - threatening challenges to the cyclist.
614	6593	3	3	The features of the setting in “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” affect the cyclist in many ways. First, in the essay when the cyclist says he is in the deserts of California, this setting can have a major impact because it gives people an idea of how extremely hot it most likely was out there and how the lack of water can really harm someone in such an environment. The searing heat can quickly dehydrate the cyclist and sap their energy. Also, when the cyclist describes the water pumps and the unappetizing substances that come out of them, it can give the cyclist a strong feeling of disgust and serve as a constant reminder to always keep a good and reliable water supply. In summary, the desert setting and the state of the water sources in the area create difficult conditions for the cyclist.
615	6594	3	3	Many things in the setting of the essay “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” affected the cyclist throughout his arduous journey. One very important part that affected the cyclist greatly is the fact that he was in the deserts without a sufficient and reliable supply of water. The parched desert offered no easy access to water, and the limited water he had was quickly being depleted. Another part of the setting that challenged the cyclist was the considerable length of his journey. Pedaling mile after mile in such a harsh environment required immense physical and mental stamina. Those two factors of his journey to Yosemite combined are probably the worst and most challenging things that affected the cyclist. In the end, these setting - related challenges tested the cyclist's limits in every possible way.
616	6595	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because of the harsh environmental conditions. It was a lack of water, and he was in the high deserts of California. The desolate landscape offered little in terms of resources. For example, in the text, it stated, “when I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid.” That showed clearly when he tried to get water from a pump, what came out was undrinkable. The setting was extremely hot, and the scorching sun beat down on him. This heat made the cyclist miserable in such ways that it sapped his energy and made each pedal stroke a struggle. In the end, the unforgiving setting posed a significant challenge to his journey.
617	6596	3	3	In the story, the features of the setting affect the cyclist because there is not much he can depend on. The desert setting is vast and barren. Usually, there is nothing but sand and heat as far as the eye can see. The cyclist only has a limited supply of what he needs, such as water and food. Riding through the desert does not help him as the long, arduous journey under the blazing sun quickly depletes his resources. For example, the old men who gave him directions made him think he could make it longer before he needed to refill. This affected him because throughout his journey, his lack of water slowed him down and made him feel weak. He started to doubt if he was going to make it. When he finally got to “Gary & Wilber’s fish camp,” he learned a lesson. When an old man asked if he knew the quickest route to Yosemite, he said, “yes, I have a very good map,” realizing the importance of relying on his own resources.
618	6597	3	3	In many real - life situations, nature or a setting can be the biggest hindrance in succeeding, or even surviving. For example, the cyclist withstood the blazing heat of the sun as he pedaled through what seemed to be the desert’s living room: Dry, desolate, and extremely scorching. The hot sand reflected the sun’s rays, intensifying the heat. “Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from a heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June.” This description clearly depicts the intense heat of the desert. Another feature in the setting was the ever - hanging hills. Though pedaling down the hills was an easier task, traveling up the hill, as well as maneuvering the twists and bends, served as a direct conflict. For instance, “with what I believed was my last burst of energy, I maneuvered around a sharp bend.” How the setting affects a situation is ultimately shown when the cyclist reached his destination in great relief. But the biggest hindrance was the harshness of his setting, which tested his physical and mental limits throughout the journey.
619	6598	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because they made the simplest challenges more difficult for him. The lack of water was a major issue. In the arid desert, water sources were scarce, and his limited supply was quickly running out. This made him constantly thirsty and weakened his body. Another problem was the snake in his path. The snake suddenly appeared on the narrow desert trail, startling him. He had to quickly maneuver his bike to avoid it, which required extra energy and focus. These elements of the setting combined to make his journey a real struggle. In conclusion, the harsh setting significantly impacted the cyclist's ability to complete his journey smoothly.
620	6599	3	3	First, by accepting the old men’s advice, the cyclist was setting himself up for some hardships that he would easily have avoided by using his map. He first encounters a “ghost town,” a place that is completely lifeless. The empty streets and abandoned buildings were a clear sign of its desolation. Most importantly, it was waterless, leaving him parched and worried about his dwindling water supply. Then, he encounters a pump that gives out water tasting like “battery acid.” The foul - tasting water was undrinkable and only added to his distress. Next, he rides past a “Rough Road Ahead” sign; not the most encouraging thing on his already challenging journey. The rough road would surely make pedaling more difficult and put additional strain on his bike. To add to the despair, he has to maneuver his way past a tempting yet empty juice factory. The sight of the factory made his mouth water, but there was no relief to be found. Finally, the parched cyclist arrives at “Gary and Wilber’s Fish Camp.” To him, this simple bait shop was like a beacon of hope, offering him a chance to replenish his supplies and rest his weary body. In the end, the cyclist learned the hard way about the importance of trusting his own map rather than relying on others' advice.
621	6600	3	3	In this story, the enthusiastic cyclist was trying to make it to the beautiful Yosemite, California. In the beginning, full of self - assurance, he decided to ask some old men on a porch. These old men looked as if they hadn't left their porch since Carter was in office for directions. Unfortunately, the old men ended up leading him into the middle of the desolate desert. In the desert, the scorching sun was relentlessly beating down on him, and he had only a limited supply of water. There was absolutely no sign of civilization whatsoever. These sweltering conditions made the cyclist extremely hot, incredibly tired, and desperately thirsty. But his determination didn't waver; he kept pedaling forward and eventually came upon a small, charming town where he could drink cool, refreshing water and take a well - deserved rest, rejuvenating himself for the rest of his journey.
622	6601	3	3	Through most of the story, the various features of the setting affect the cyclist in a predominantly negative way. For instance, he made it to a town that a guy had sworn was there. However, when he arrived, he found it to be completely abandoned. Disappointment washed over him, and he let out a sad, hopeless laugh. Despite his exhaustion, he still had the energy to wallow in self - pity. Another notable feature was the Grape Juice Factory, also in a state of abandonment. When he saw it, he hung his head dejectedly, and the melancholy blues tune “Summer Time” kept rattling in his brain. A third significant feature was his intense thirst. To distract himself, he stuck some pebbles in his mouth. Then he started to think about how lucky he'd be if he checked, realizing that the situation was quite negative for him. All these features combined to make his journey a truly arduous one.
623	6602	3	3	The features from the essay affect the cyclist in many ways. As he pedals along, his body is getting fatigued, and he is drinking more and more water to keep himself going. The roads are becoming increasingly rough, filled with potholes and uneven surfaces. So, he has to slow down his cycling speed. If he slows down, he expends more energy, gets tired more quickly, and thus needs more water. Unfortunately, he is all out of water. On top of that, the old men he asked for directions really didn't know what they were talking about. Their misinformation led him astray, and all these features combined have a profound and negative impact on the cyclist, making his journey a real struggle.
624	6603	3	3	The setting affected the cyclist in numerous ways. For example, the heat was unbearable, like a furnace constantly beating down on him during this long, grueling ride. To make matters worse, there was nowhere around him where he could fill up his water bottle. As a result, he was dying of thirst, his throat parched and his lips cracked. He didn't know where he was going or how far he still had to go. The uncertainty and the harsh conditions added to his distress. The setting was truly crucial in this story, shaping the cyclist's experience and testing his limits to the extreme.
625	6604	3	3	The setting in the beginning of the story is flat and easy, allowing the cyclist to pedal along smoothly. But as the path becomes unfamiliar, it transforms into a terrain full of many steep hills and sharp turns. This change affects the cyclist significantly because he was already low on water and was beginning to show signs of dehydration. The effort required to climb the hills and navigate the turns further depletes his energy and increases his need for water. With his limited water supply, the situation becomes increasingly dire, making his journey a challenging and potentially dangerous one.
626	6605	3	3	The setting significantly affects the cyclist. As he pedals along, he starts to see things that gradually seep into his mind. The desolate scenery passing around him makes him start to feel abandoned and misled because there are no clear signs indicating he is going the right way. Eventually, he realizes he must persevere and trust his instincts to find the correct path.
627	6606	3	3	The cyclist has to overcome a lot of obstacles during his journey. For example, there is a large snake coiled in his path, so he cautiously and carefully rides around it to avoid any danger. Also, there are a lot of steep hills on the route, and he wasn't sure if he could muster the strength to make it up those challenging hills. Furthermore, he is almost out of water, and in the scorching heat, he could die of heatstroke or dehydration. In conclusion, through sheer determination and effort, he overcomes these obstacles and achieves his goal of reaching his destination.
628	6607	3	3	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead,” the author goes through many diverse sceneries. All of the places that the author visits, from arid deserts to rocky terrains, make him even more determined because he desperately wants to find water and he just wants to get to the beautiful Yosemite. The unwavering determination pushes him to keep going further and further, no matter how difficult the journey becomes. And then the determination finally pays off after he goes around a sharp turn because he then sees a small, inviting place where he can get something to drink and a place to cool down, bringing relief to his long - awaited quest.
629	6608	3	3	The features of this desolate setting significantly affect the author while he is cycling. They gradually change his initial hope to deep - seated doubt. There were no buildings or cars in sight, which led him to believe he would never get to Yosemite. Also, it had a rough and uneven terrain that made him doubt that he would ever find water to quench his thirst. I'm sure if the setting had buildings, people, even just a hint of civilization, then the cyclist would have been fine and his doubts would have quickly dissipated.
630	6609	3	3	Blazing temperatures, lack of water, dwindling hope—all are the crucial parts of the setting that severely affect the cyclist. Blazing temperatures are a major issue because the hotter it gets, the more the cyclist perspires, leading to a lack of hydration. As the water in his body evaporates, he can't replenish it fast enough, and without water, his body can't function properly. Finally, the dwindling hope takes a toll on him. The cyclist didn't think he was going to live through this harsh ordeal. However, he tried hard, pushed himself beyond his limits, and success was achieved. He lived to tell the tale of his challenging journey.
631	6610	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he gets tiring easily. The character, in the story, is riding his bike for a long period of time under the sun and he gradually gets tired. He rides alone with nothing or no one around him except the tall trees and wild animals in the forest. The isolation and the long - distance riding take a toll on his energy, making his journey more challenging.
632	6611	3	3	The features of the cyclist's journey are rough because of the hills, snakes, heat, and the limited amount of water. The hills give you a refreshing breeze when going down, which is a small relief, but going up gives you a really hard time as you have to pedal with great effort. The snakes can hurt you by biting, injecting venom that could cause serious harm. The intense heat could make you sick, leading to symptoms like dizziness and nausea. The insufficient amount of water can really hurt you by causing you to become dehydrated, which can severely affect your physical performance and even endanger your life. In such conditions, the cyclist's journey is fraught with difficulties.
633	6612	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in several ways. The features of the setting affect the cyclist through the posted speed limits. These speed limits can restrict the cyclist's pace, making the ride less free - flowing. Due to how the setting is, the cyclist has to face a rough hill with a sharp incline. This hill makes it difficult for the cyclist to maintain a good speed, constantly slowing him down. Overall, the setting's features significantly impact the cyclist's riding experience.
634	6613	3	3	The hills and bumpy road slow him down considerably, and he is severely dehydrated. The lack of smooth terrain makes each pedal stroke a struggle, and the dehydration is also slowing him down because he needs water to keep his body functioning properly. There are obstacles in the road too, such as a big snake laying lazily across the middle of the road. This forces him to stop and find a way around, further delaying his journey. He is lost without water and could possibly die of a heatstroke in this hot and arduous environment. His situation is truly dire, and he urgently needs to find help and water.
635	6614	3	3	He knew what he was getting himself into, so if he needed water or anything like that, it was probably his own fault. He should have been more prepared and brought some water with him. Before starting the journey, he should have considered the possible challenges and made the necessary arrangements. By not doing so, he put himself in a difficult and potentially dangerous situation. It's a lesson learned about the importance of preparation in any adventure.
636	6615	3	3	"The cyclist and his journey in ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed limit"" were significantly impacted by the setting. The scorching ""deserts of California in June"", with their blistering heat, caused him to be weary very easily as his energy was quickly sapped. The terrain change from the flat, easy - going road to challenging hills made him feel less confident because he felt the road sign was taunting him by saying ""DO NOT Exceed 55 mph"". He could only manage a slow pace of @NUM1. Finally, a large, menacing snake created an obstacle for him by blocking the majority of the pavement right in front of the cyclist. All of these features affected the cyclist in some way, making his journey a true test of endurance."
637	6616	3	3	The story is basically advocating that more people who currently rely on cars should opt to ride bicycles to work or to school. By doing so, there won't be a large amount of pollution in the air. Bicycles are an eco - friendly alternative, and if more individuals make this switch, it can lead to a cleaner and healthier environment. In conclusion, encouraging cycling over driving cars can play a vital role in reducing air pollution.
638	6617	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. The high temperature in the area makes him drink water more frequently, and this excessive consumption leads him to worry that he is going to die because he is running out of water. The ""towns"" he comes to are so utterly deserted that he starts to think he is going in the wrong direction. All the settings in the story, despite causing these doubts, also serve as a motivation for him not to give up but to keep on going. In conclusion, even though he had to battle through all that self - doubt about whether he was going to be alive in the end, he still persevered and tried. In the end, he did make it, and all his efforts were indeed worth it."
639	6618	3	3	There are many settings that affect the cyclist. One prominent feature would be the rough and uneven terrain around him, which makes pedaling more difficult. Also, the various obstacles faced by the cyclist, such as fallen branches or large rocks on the road, pose challenges. Another feature would be the presence of wild animals and the scarceness of water around. The sight of wild animals can instill fear, and the lack of water is a constant threat. Also, an old man he met gave him unimportant and non - updated information, which added to his confusion. All of these would affect the cyclist because they wear and instill fear on his physical and mental strengths, making his journey an arduous one.
640	6619	3	3	I think that there were many things contributing to the cyclist's state at the end of the story. First, there was the factor of time. He was cycling in June, which is very hot as it is the peak of summer. The sun beats down relentlessly. Second, he was cycling through California, a state that is warm even in early @DATE1. And third, he was traveling through the deserts, where the heat is intensified. So, when you put all of that together, he was cycling on a sweltering hot June day in the deserts of California. These three things all contributed to the character's state. He went through dead towns in his desperate search for water and found an old well pump with extremely hot water that tasted like battery acid. He drank too much water at the beginning, perhaps due to the initial shock of the heat, which left him with just spit toward the end. He was incredibly lucky to find a fish camp in the middle of nowhere and to have found water. The three factors made him drink too much water at first and barely left him with enough to sustain him throughout the journey. In the end, his survival was a close - call due to these challenging circumstances.
641	6620	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because in some ways they throw you off a little with other lines and then you will get confused about what they're actually talking about. For example, the littlest thing that could throw you off is the line when it says ""before the last world war"". That kind of threw me off a little. This confusion caused by the setting features can disrupt the cyclist's sense of the situation and make it harder for them to fully understand the context."
642	6621	3	3	The setting that was affecting the cyclist was the lack of water he had. As the text clearly states, “the water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips”. Moreover, it also mentions “I’d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing the spit to circulate”. He wouldn’t be trying to get his mind off of thirst if he wasn’t thirsty. This shows that the scarce water supply in the setting had a significant impact on the cyclist's well - being.
643	6622	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because it was June, a typically hot month, and the cyclist had little water. The cyclist became dehydrated as a result and couldn't find any building or water source for many miles. In this difficult situation, the cyclist took advice from old - timers who, unfortunately, didn't know what they were talking about. Their advice led the cyclist further astray. In conclusion, the hot weather and the remote location affected the cyclist, making his journey extremely challenging.
644	6623	3	3	The cyclist pedaled through all types of different terrain, including steep hills, arid high desert, long flat roads, and dense woods. This cyclist took the advice of a bunch of old men who thought they knew a short cut to the Yosemite national park. However, this so - called short cut turned out to be a nightmare. The cyclist had only brought a limited number of water bottles and was quickly drinking them all due to the strenuous pedaling and the hot conditions. The setting of this story changed a lot, at times making the cyclist have to pedal faster to overcome obstacles and at other times forcing them to slow down. The cyclist was quickly worn out and started to lose hope in himself. The constantly changing terrain made it hard for him not to be thirsty. Eventually, he drank all of his water and knew he would die of dehydration or a heat stroke. As he came up over a long hill, he saw a bait store and stopped inside to have a drink. He then vowed not to listen to a bunch of old guys again, having learned a hard lesson from this experience.
645	6624	3	3	The features of the setting make him happy because he meets some people that tell him of a route that will take a lot of time off his trip. This is evident from what the text says, “what I shouldn’t have done was let them have a peck at my map. Like a foolish youth, the next morning I followed their advice and launched out at first light along a ‘shortcut’ that was to slice away hours from my ride.” At first, the promise of a quicker journey made him excited. He also talks about not taking directions from old timers later on. As the text implies, he realizes that relying on the advice of these old timers might not be a good idea. This shows that while the initial discovery of the shortcut made him happy, the experience also taught him a valuable lesson.
646	6625	3	3	During the cyclist's journey to Yosemite, many unforeseen things got in his way and significantly slowed him down. For instance, he naively listened to a group of old men who gave him wrong directions to his intended destination. Also, his water supply was steadily getting low, which drained his energy a lot quicker than usual. The blistering heat also played a crucial part in his energy loss. The intense heat made him sweat profusely, causing the water in his body to evaporate rapidly and be of little use. All these factors combined made his journey to Yosemite an extremely arduous one.
647	6626	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many detrimental ways. For example, he found himself in the California desert in June, a time when the sun beats down relentlessly. The searing heat and lack of water can cause people to become severely dehydrated, pass out, or even die. There are very few reliable sources of water in the deserts, leaving the cyclist constantly at risk. The terrain didn't help him much either. The numerous hills required him to use a lot of energy and made him perspire heavily, causing him to lose vital fluids from his body. In conclusion, the cyclist was greatly affected by the harsh features of the desert setting.
648	6627	3	3	The rider in the story “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaskie has a very analytical mind, which is easily influenced by the things around him. At first, the rider “rode into the morning...with a smile” because of the bright sun shining down, and the refreshing sight of the “cool pines” and “rushing rivers”. He was very confident in the directions given by the old men. The first sign of disappointment came when he came across the “ramshackle shed”. The dilapidated sight of this shed was deeply troubling to him, but he mustered the determination to ride on. As he rode over the “crippling hills”, he started to think that maybe this journey wasn't such a great idea after all. Finally, he came to an old bait shop. The “modern bathroom” that he entered to drink from provided him much - needed relief from the harsh desert he had just been riding through, showing how the environment constantly affected his state of mind.
649	6628	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist a great deal. The landscape was extremely hard to ride on, with uneven terrain and rocky patches. There was intense heat that seemed to sap his strength away, and there was little water available along the way. As a result, it turned out to be a long and arduous trip, and he faced a difficult time reaching his destination. In the end, the unforgiving setting truly tested his endurance and resolve.
650	6629	3	3	At first, the trip was easy - going and the path was flat. It was a pleasant day out, with the sun shining brightly. However, as he rode on, his water supply was gradually draining. Soon, the path transformed into a series of hills and became rough and bumpy. Even though the tall pines provided some shade, it wasn't enough to alleviate the cyclist's discomfort. Eventually, after enduring a grueling climb and a long cycle trip through the dense woods, he finally reached a somewhat civilized area. His perseverance through the challenging journey was finally rewarded with the sight of civilization.
651	6630	3	3	"The essay on ""Rough Road Ahead"" is about the real and present dangers of excessive speed and aggressive behavior. It's simply a friendly reminder to follow the given instructions carefully and pay close attention to all the signs along the way. You should always keep a sharp eye out for any signs and other important details. By doing so, you can ensure a safer and more informed journey."
652	6631	3	3	The setting that affected the cyclist was the water temperature, rolling hills, and the condition of the roads. Water was a crucial factor because he needed cool water to stay hydrated. After running out of water, he came across a shed with pumps. He started pumping the water, but unfortunately, it was hot. Despite his efforts to let it cool down, it didn't work, so he had to take it as it was. Rolling hills were another challenge for the cyclist. The road started off flat but then ended up with hills. Going uphill can strain the legs and make it much harder to keep riding. Another hardship was the road condition. It was smooth at first, but then it became rough and rocky. These were some of the challenges the cyclist had to overcome to continue his journey.
653	6632	3	3	Setting depends on how you can go or move. The flat parts of the town and some of the hills actually helped the cyclist in certain ways. However, the steep up - hills were a real problem. When the cyclist saw the towns, he got a bad attitude. He was upset and mad because he didn't want to die, yet he thought he was going to. He said he would never trust old men anymore because they didn't seem to know what they were talking about. It makes one wonder how and why he trusted them in the first place. In the end, the setting and his interactions in it really tested his mental and physical strength.
654	6633	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many significant ways. For example, ""I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills."" This quote clearly shows that his surroundings were presenting him with difficulty and a real challenge for his travel. By specifically describing the hills as ""rolling"", it vividly helps the reader imagine the obstacles he was going through. Also, the sign that read, ""Rough Road Ahead; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit."" gives the reader a strong feeling that the character is in danger. This sign serves as a clear warning of the potential hazards ahead. Lastly, an example of the setting that helps show the character's hardships is, ""no one in sight, not a building, car or structure of any kind."" If anything were to happen to the character, as the author was foreshadowing, he'd be stranded and all alone to face the consequences. He'd be in serious trouble and there would be no one around to offer help. If the author did not use these well - chosen examples, the reader would not easily get a clear picture of the troubles he had to overcome. In conclusion, these examples added great emphasis and deeper meaning to the text, making the cyclist's journey more relatable and impactful."
655	6634	3	3	Well, the features of the setting affect the cyclist in a lot of ways. When his water was too hot to drink, he got some pebbles and stuck them in his mouth. He had heard somewhere that if you do that, it will dilute your spit and make you feel a bit less thirsty. The terrain of the story was very rocky and hilly. The rocky parts made it difficult for the bike to move smoothly, and the hills required a lot of physical effort to climb. These are the key features of the terrain that presented challenges to the cyclist during his ride.
656	6635	3	3	The features of the setting significantly affect the cyclist as he makes his way through the challenging terrain. The hills, with their steep inclines, pose a great difficulty for him to ride. Each pedal stroke requires immense effort, and his legs start to ache with fatigue. The abandoned town also has a profound impact on him. When he reaches the town, he is desperately hoping to find a source of water and take a well - deserved break. However, upon arrival, he discovers that the town is completely deserted, with no one to offer help or a place to rest. The highway is another obstacle; its rough surface and lack of proper cycling lanes make it hard for him to maintain a steady pace. Moreover, there is no sign of water anywhere around him. All these features of the setting combine to make his journey extremely arduous, leaving him feeling exhausted and discouraged.
657	6636	3	3	"The features of the setting gradually contribute to the cyclist's growing anger. At the start of the story, as the cyclist pedals along, he unexpectedly comes across poisonous snakes slithering in the grass. The sight of these dangerous creatures sends a shiver down his spine. He also notices ""one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn't hold in the lamest mule."" All these dismal sights trouble the narrator deeply, and he begins to feel frightened and neurotic. As he continues cycling, his water supply starts to deplete rapidly. When he stops to restock, he is disappointed to find that ""the water wouldn't cool down"" and ""it had the flavor of battery acid."" This lack of proper water frustrates him to no end. To make matters worse, the hills he encounters become increasingly steeper, adding to his annoyance. The final straw comes when the cyclist passes by what he initially thought ""had been a Welch's Grape Juice Factory."" In an outrage, the narrator rants about how he hopes to die out on the road, simply to spare himself from the dreaded features of the unforgiving setting."
658	6637	3	3	"The features in the setting most definitely affect the cyclist as he travels on his long and arduous journey. The cyclist is incredibly thirsty, his throat parched, and extremely tired, with his legs feeling like lead. The setting he is placed in offers him no hope of survival. He first arrives at a ""ghost town,"" a place that looks desolate with dilapidated buildings and overgrown weeds. At first, this encounter with isolation in such a desolate place doesn't have a huge impact on him as it is the first place he comes across. However, as the story progresses, the rest of the setting mimics this desolation. As he moves forward, he is met with barren land as far as the eye can see, with no sign of water and no people in sight. It's June in California, and the scorching sun beats down on him. The cyclist fears that he will soon suffer from heat - stroke if he doesn't find water quickly. It only adds to his despair when he comes to an abandoned juice factory, which stands there like a cruel taunt, reminding him of the one thing he desperately needs to survive. All in all, the features in the setting make the cyclist lose hope, and he feels that he will surely die if he doesn't find water soon."
659	6638	3	3	"The setting in the story ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" is based in the hot and dry terrain of California. This particular setting has a significant impact on the character's mood. It does so because some of the features included in the setting can be seen as actual metaphorically - based moods. For example, when the story mentions, ""The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite..."", this quote vividly describes the scenery. The coolness of the pines and the rushing sound of the rivers can suggest a tone and mood that is calm and relaxed. As the character views this scene, the tranquility and peacefulness of the setting seep into their being, influencing their mood in a positive way. In this way, the setting not only provides a backdrop but also directly affects how the character feels."
660	6639	3	3	"The features of the setting that affect the cyclist depend greatly on where they are located. In this story, the cyclist is surrounded by a desolate landscape. The feeling of ""nothing"" around him, the vast expanse of the desert, and the intense heat give him absolutely no hope. It truly is a matter of location when it comes to cycling. The quote, ""It didn't really matter I was going to die,"" clearly states his feelings as he is dying of thirst. He feels completely numb, with no energy or will to continue. He is certain that he is going to die until he spots a faint sign of civilization in the distance. As he gets closer, his hope begins to rise, and he starts to feel a glimmer of optimism. This shows how the setting can have a profound impact on the cyclist's state of mind, from despair to a renewed sense of hope."
661	6640	3	3	I think the features of the desolate setting on that long - distance cycling journey affect the cyclist in many ways. The long, hot, and lonely ride under the scorching sun had a profound effect on him. The isolation and the relentless heat scared him, which made him pedal longer to reach a safer place. He had nothing to drink after exhausting his water supply, and the thought that he was going to die made him physically and mentally weak. The snake lying lazily in the middle of the path caused him to stop longer as he carefully maneuvered around it. Every such stop that occurred along the way affected his progress and state of mind. All these factors combined to make his cycling experience extremely challenging and arduous.
662	6641	3	3	I would think even riding a bike for an extended period can be quite uncomfortable for the behind due to the constant pressure. But on the flip side, it is also great exercising, especially for the legs as all the strength you build comes from the muscle contractions. To know precisely where you're going on a long - distance bike ride could take forever as you have to constantly check maps or follow directions. But I do know cyclists would have to face all types of weather, be it scorching heat or heavy rain. However, as long as you have the appropriate gear on, like waterproof jackets and sun protection, no major harm could come to you, and you can enjoy the ride safely.
663	6642	3	3	At first, he was extremely mad because he took advice from old men who never left their porch. Their limited perspective led him into this difficult situation. He got scared that he was going to die because he had drunk all his water in a short time, and he didn't know how long it would be until he got some more. He really shouldn't have drunk his water so quickly, considering he had a long way to go. Then, a glimmer of hope appeared when he saw the bait sign. It was as if a light at the end of the tunnel. With new - found energy, he biked quickly down the hill, eager to reach the place and get some water. This change in his mood and action shows how quickly his situation could shift during this journey.
664	6643	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist, in the story Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit, in many ways. The cyclist is affected because the setting is depressingly desolate and frighteningly quiet. When the cyclist first sees the speed limit sign of 55 mph, he mutters, “Sometimes life can be so cruel” under his breath. This is because he can only go a meager 12 mph considering he's on a bike, making the vast distance seem even more daunting. After seeing the sign, a menacing snake crosses his path. He's frightened by it because it looked like a diamond back, a venomous species. He was desperately trying to keep his balance and slowly ease past it, his heart pounding in his chest. Since the main problem the cyclist is faced with is the lack of water, the dry, long hills seem to sap his energy, making him more weak and tired. Tumble weeds crossed past him in the desolate landscape, and there was no water in sight. That is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist, making his journey a true test of endurance.
665	6644	3	3	The features of the harsh setting affected the cyclist greatly. It made him become severely dehydrated. For example, in paragraph @NUM1 sentence @NUM2 he stated “I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.” This clearly shows how the intense heat and the dry climate of the setting affected him. The heat made him dizzy, throwing off his balance, and gradually led to him getting dehydrated. The setting of the story “Do not exceed posted speed limit,” by Joe Kurmaskie, has a significant impact on the cyclist in the story. It not only affects his physical well - being but also his mental state as he struggles to cope with the difficult conditions.
666	6645	3	3	The setting in this story greatly affects the cyclist. It is extremely hot in California at present while the narrator is aiding his ride. The scorching heat makes the air thick and heavy, almost suffocating. This causes him to become fatigued much faster while he is on a “Short hit” leading nowhere. “Wide signs of dried outcast winded my limb, and the growing realization that I could drop from a gorgeous day in June”. This gust shows how calm that day really was and the fact that the cyclist is sweating profusely shows how much the weather is affecting him. The rolling hills in the story also affect the cyclist. By cycling up and down the hills frequently, it makes his journey more arduous. It deters him and takes even longer for him to reach a town with water. The deserted areas in the setting also negatively affect the narrator. It gives him a hopeless feeling as there is no place to stop and his water supply is depleting. In conclusion, the combination of heat, hills, and deserted areas in the setting significantly hampers the cyclist's journey.
667	6646	3	3	Joe Kurmaskie had a rough time trying to get to Yosemite National Park. First, he received directions from an old man. Joe followed these instructions without hesitation; little did he know that he would be headed for many hardships. After he reached the first town, he checked his supply of water and food. About @NUM1 more miles down the road, he realized his bottle was getting low because he was travelling through the high deserts of California. It is extremely hot out there, and then the terrain changed from flat to hilly. He no longer had an adequate amount of water. He ran into a snake, which he swore was an almond back, slithering across the path. Finally, he came to another town, got some water and then left after passing through ghost towns. Riding in conditions that are hot and unfamiliar are hard to do. Adding hills to the heat is not a good combination, and with nothing around, it can be very dangerous, even fatal. Before you bike, think of what conditions are ahead of you to avoid such difficult situations.
668	6647	3	3	Because he was told to make it right, he decided to go at night. He was eager to achieve his goal because he was trying to cover a long distance. He was driving at 55 mph per hour and sometimes at 12 mph. The speed variations made the journey quite unpredictable. Sometime life can feel so cruel in life, you know? The challenges on the road seemed never - ending. And that is all I can say right now. In conclusion, his attempt to make the journey right was fraught with difficulties and the harsh realities of life on the road.
669	6648	3	3	Each time the author comes to a point where the setting isn't very appealing or helpful, he loses hope for reaching his destination or finding a nice place to rest and get some fresh water. For example, the text states, “one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn't hold in the lamest mule greeted me. This sight was troubling” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The author has a sort of negative, sarcastic tone at this point. His words are laced with disappointment as he describes the dilapidated scene. This shows that he's getting frustrated and losing some hope. He also mentions that the “sight was troubling” which shows how big of an impact the features around him or the scenery can have on his state of mind. In conclusion, the unappealing setting constantly chips away at the author's hope during his journey.
670	6649	3	3	Lots of features in the setting play an effect on the cyclist. Some that @MONTH1 play an effect are the intense heat, which makes the air feel like a furnace and saps the cyclist's energy. The flat road that's hard to ride on, perhaps due to its rough surface or strong headwinds, also poses a challenge. Or how there are long stretches with no signs of civilization, leaving the cyclist feeling isolated and vulnerable. In conclusion, these various setting features can significantly impede the cyclist's progress and experience.
671	6650	3	3	This essay is an American tale that expresses how hard it is to do something. But one can achieve it through determination. The cyclist is faced with many changes not only physically but also mentally. There was no one in sight, not a building or anything. As this rider comes to think about the substantial beating he took from the ride, he is tired and with no sight of a destination, he says he might not be able to do it. However, he gathers his remaining strength and continues, knowing that perseverance might just lead him to his goal.
672	6651	3	3	The features of the setting greatly affect the cyclist. First of all, he is travelling through a desert in California in June, so the weather is extremely hot. The scorching sun beats down relentlessly on the cyclist, and he needs water. However, as he is running out of the water he brought along with himself, he cannot find any other water source by himself. Thus, he is thirsty and almost dehydrated. Also, it frustrates him that when he finds water, not only is it hot but it tastes like battery acid. When the cyclist decides to conserve some of his water and go to the next town to get more water, there is another setback. The condition of the road is so poor, full of potholes and uneven surfaces, that the cyclist cannot go more than 12 mph. Thus, if he ever reaches the next town, he still will have to wait longer for the much - needed water, travelling at such a slow speed. The snake is also another setback that the cyclist was fortunately able to escape. Thus, his major concern is the lack of water, which could potentially endanger his life during this arduous journey.
673	6652	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many different ways. At first, it was a bright shiny day and the cyclist was happy, enjoying the gentle breeze and the clear sky. He reaches the first town which is a ghost town. The desolate streets and abandoned buildings make him sad. Riding on, he begins to lose water as the heat intensifies. The once bright shiny day began to beat the searing heat down on the cyclist, making him sweat profusely. He reached a ramshackle shed and began to lose hope as the shed offered little shade or relief. He loses water quickly and becomes more dehydrated, feeling weak and dizzy. The terrain becomes slopes and hills and the ride becomes harder as he has to pedal with all his might. When he reached the grape drink factory, his hopes were almost gone as it seemed deserted. But just over the hill was a fishing shop. He used his remaining energy to speed down the hill to get water and get his energy back, feeling a glimmer of hope again after this long and difficult journey.
674	6653	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example, when it says, “The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them.” The features of this setting, with the refreshing pines and the lively rivers, are making the cyclist determined. The thought of reaching such a beautiful and inviting place spurs him on. Another example is when it says, ""At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake – it really did look like a diamondback blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me."" The features of the setting, with the unexpected obstacles like tumbleweeds and the menacing snake, are making him brave and courageous. He has to face these challenges head - on. The last example is when it says, “I hung my head.” The features of the setting, perhaps a desolate and unforgiving stretch of land, are making the cyclist have despair. In conclusion, the various features of the setting can have a wide range of impacts on the cyclist's emotions and mindset."
675	6654	3	3	In the essay “Rough road ahead do not exceed posted speed limit,” the cyclist is affected both positively and negatively by the setting. Setting is the surrounding in which the story takes place. In the story, a cyclist loses his way and is put into danger because of it. The setting of the story can be described as mountainous with many rolling hills. The author describes the setting by saying “@CAPS1 two miles into the next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing.” The change in terrain, with steeper slopes and uneven ground, made it more difficult for the cyclist to pedal. However, he also used the land to give him hope that he was almost there. He told himself that he’d make it if he made it over the next hill. The setting of the story gave the cyclist hope and problems in his journey to survive, making his adventure a complex and challenging one.
676	6655	3	3	The cyclist was affected by the fact that he took advice from some old men whose information was not accurate. These old men seemed confident as they shared the so - called shortcut, but it was far from the truth. Then he cycled along the desert which was extremely hot, with the scorching sun beating down on him all the time. He had a limited supply of water and that also affected him in a very bad way. As the water dwindled, his throat became parched, and his energy levels dropped rapidly. He almost had a heat stroke a few times. He was probably angry that he took these men’s advice and got himself into this difficult situation. Then when he found the fish camp, he was overjoyed with relief. But at the same time, if he had asked someone else for directions, he would not have been in this situation in the first place. So it’s really confusing because he probably felt relieved and mad at the same time. And then the other old man asked him did he know the best way there. He was right to say yes because if he didn’t, the old man would have given him some more messed - up directions and he would have been out there again, about to have another heat stroke, which could have been life - threatening.
677	6656	3	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist by the exhilarating rush he/she got when speeding down the hill. The wind rushes through the cyclist's hair as they pick up speed, feeling completely free. The fresh morning air, with a hint of dew and the scent of nearby grass, fills their lungs. It's a moment where there are no limits, just you and your feet working in tandem with the pedals. Speeding, going as fast as you can with your heart pounding in your chest, creating a rhythm that matches the rapid movement of the wheels. There are no boundaries, when you can go where you like, when you like. No people to get in the way of you and your need for speed. This sense of freedom and pure thrill that the setting provides truly makes the cycling experience unforgettable.
678	6657	3	3	In the short story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” it is shown that the features of the setting do affect the cyclist through the story. In the story the cyclist is faced with the mental and physical journey he takes while riding his bike. Being unaware of where he is on his journey, the setting begins to really affect him. For example, as he keeps making his journey, he is affected by the old towns and desert places. These old towns have a desolate and abandoned look, with crumbling buildings and empty streets. He even says that “The sight was troubling.” As he continues to California in June, the heat and the long journey really began to affect him both mentally and physically. The sun beats down relentlessly, making the air feel like an oven. For example, he says, “I got down my hands and knew working the hands of the rusted water pump with all my strength.” The quote shows that because he is biking so long and is looking for water and there is not a town in sight, he becomes weak. Although he is determined to make it through this journey, he is becoming more hopeless and sorry for himself because of the setting he is placed in. The harsh environment and lack of resources are taking a toll on his spirit, making the journey an even greater challenge.
679	6658	3	3	“@CAPS1 directions, June, lack of water” all are elements that affect the rider on his ride. He took directions from older people who promised the rider a shortcut. These older people seemed well - intentioned, but it turned out that their shortcut was wrong. When the rider went on this trip, it was June in California. In June, California experiences high temperatures, and it would have been burning hot under the sun. The heat made the ride extremely strenuous and sapped his energy. Lastly, he had drank most of his water during the trip. As the water supply diminished, he started to feel the effects of dehydration, with a dry mouth and fatigue setting in. He could have died if he didn’t find the other water source. These were some elements that affected the rider on his trip, making it a perilous and difficult journey.
680	6659	3	3	The feature of the setting greatly affect the cyclist in “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” The features in the story changed the speaker’s mood throughout his journey. For example, in the beginning, he came across a deserted town. The town had an eerie silence, with broken windows and overgrown weeds, so he was cautious, constantly on the lookout for any potential danger. Next, he came across a fork in the road. The uncertainty of which path to take was troubling to him, as a wrong choice could lead him further astray. Then he passed a snake, a sudden and unexpected encounter that made his heart skip a beat, and he also had the obstacles of the hills. The steep inclines required a great deal of physical effort, but they also made him become determined to overcome them. Finally, his determination changed to relief where he reached Gary and Wilber’s fish camp. The sight of the camp, with its friendly faces and a promise of rest, was a welcome sight. In conclusion, the setting in the story greatly affects the cyclist by changing his moods and attitude towards his journey, making it a roller - coaster of emotions from start to finish.
681	6660	3	3	In the essay, “Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed posted speed Limit,” it tells the tale of a man who follows some ill - advised directions. As he pedals on, he finds himself in the middle of a vast, desolate desert, completely stuck without a drop of water. He starts to lose confidence in the directions once the setting undergoes a change. He recalled, “After forty miles of hard pedaling, I arrived at the first town. It fit the traditional definition of a ghost town perfectly.” He had been led to believe this was a bustling, thriving town, but all he was left with was an empty expanse. This was a huge letdown, and the cyclist began to doubt that this had been the right choice. He keeps on pushing himself, riding forward, only to find another disheartening sight. “One rickety ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps that looked like they hadn't worked in ages, and a corral that wouldn't even hold in the tamest of mules greeted me.” @CAPS1 was another place said to be good, but all he got was water that tasted like battery acid. On the last stretch of his bike journey, he was met with rough, rolling hills that seemed to go on forever, a diamondback - looking snake slithering menacingly nearby, and an abandoned juice factory that added to the eerie atmosphere. All of these experiences brought his spirits lower and lower until he felt as if he was on the verge of death. Eventually, the cyclist ended up finding a store, but he was deeply discouraged by the harsh environment he was in. It was swelteringly hot, and he realized he could have easily died out there.
682	6661	3	3	In the essay, the cyclist is significantly and visibly affected by the features of the setting. Under the harsh conditions he faced, he could barely manage to survive and make it to his destination. It becomes abundantly clear that the features of the setting are having an impact on him when he states, “The speed limit was 55 mph. I was doing a water - depleting 12 mph. Sometimes life can be so cruel.” In his arduous efforts to keep going, he is slowly getting weaker. The sign he sees only serves to make him feel worse because it seems to him as if it is mocking his slow progress. He also remarks, “I'd read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you had left to circulate. With any luck, I'd hit a bump and lodge one in my throat.” This statement shows that he is on the verge of giving up completely and wouldn't really care if he died. From the author's despairing tone, it is evident that the features of the setting do indeed have a profound effect on the cyclist, sapping his will and energy.
683	6662	3	3	Features of the setting such as the scorching hot sun, the lack of potable water, and “Gary and Wilber’s Fish Camp,” greatly affected the cyclist. Since the cyclist was traveling through the high deserts of California in the blistering month of June, the temperature soared to extremely high levels. The hot sun beat down relentlessly on him, leaving “wide rings of dried sweat” on his shirt and making the cyclist acutely aware that he could drop from a heatstroke at any moment. Also, the fact that the only water around felt “somewhere in the neighborhood of two - hundred degrees” and “had the flavor of battery acid” was a major problem. This prevented the cyclist from drinking it and put him in a severe “dehydrated state.” @CAPS1, “Gary and Wilber’s Fish Camp” affected the cyclist in a positive way by solving his problem of dehydration. Upon his arrival, there was cold, refreshing water available for him, which was a much - needed relief after his long, arduous journey through the harsh desert.
684	6663	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in numerous ways. First of all, if the cyclist hadn't listened to the old man's advice, he would have never found himself in this troublesome situation. Also, the fact that he didn't have an adequate supply of water when he set out on his ride caused him to become severely dehydrated. He should have turned back as soon as he ran out of water, but he kept going. The sweltering heat made him extremely hot and constantly thirsty, sapping his energy with each passing moment. He should learn from this experience and know how important it is to never blindly trust any strangers and instead try things on his own. By relying on his own judgment and being better prepared, he could avoid similar difficult situations in the future.
685	6664	3	3	The features of the setting have a significant effect on the cyclist. The setting makes him feel extremely thirsty, his throat dry as a bone, unbearably hot, and completely lost. In the story, the setting plays a crucial role in the cyclist's will to ride to the next town. First, the cyclist asks for directions from a guy who hasn't left his house in decades. This naturally creates a sense of doubt in his mind about the accuracy of the directions. Also, in the story, it says “Tumbleweeds cross my path.” This desolate sight makes the cyclist feel even more lost in the vast expanse of the desert. Finally, it states that “the water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.” This scarcity of water makes the cyclist both thirsty and incredibly tired. Clearly, the features of the setting definitely have a strong and negative effect on the cyclist, challenging his resolve and making his journey an uphill battle.
686	6665	3	3	In the story “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”, the cyclist is significantly affected by the setting in numerous ways. He was biking right in the middle of the sweltering summer in the extremely hot state of California. The intense heat causes him to sweat profusely and he is rapidly running out of water, which means he could very possibly become dehydrated. Moreover, the roads are extremely hilly, so he has to exert a great deal more energy to pedal up the hills. That’s precisely why I firmly believe the cyclist is extremely affected by the setting in the story “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed”. The combination of heat and hilly terrain makes his biking experience arduous and challenging.
687	6666	3	3	The cyclist had to deal with some tough terrain throughout his long - distance ride. First, he was in the “high deserts of California in June”. The mention of June in the high deserts usually brings a vivid picture to my mind of a very dry, parched, and hot place. The cyclist faced great trouble finding the water he desperately needed, and he constantly worried that he might die of heatstroke in such harsh conditions. Also, there were numerous hills. The cyclist specifically said he had to ride over “one long, crippling hill”. From my personal experiences as a cyclist, hills are indeed the worst part, especially when you’re extremely thirsty. The climate in this story was very hot and dry, and the terrain was full of steep hills. So altogether, that would make for one truly bad and exhausting bike ride.
688	6667	3	3	Snake, searing heat, and steep hills – all are what the biker had to deal with because of the specific settings. He had to encounter a venomous diamondback snake, which added a dangerous element to his journey. He was going through the scorching desert where it was like a blistering 110 degrees. The intense heat made every moment of his ride a struggle. While he was biking, he had to laboriously pedal up crippling hills. The combination of a dangerous snake, extreme heat, and difficult hills created a ridiculous setting for him to have to bike in. I would never be able to endure what he did, as the challenges he faced were simply overwhelming.
689	6668	3	3	The cyclist had a lot of problems with his setting. It was extremely hot, with the sun beating down relentlessly, and he started getting critically low on water. This lack of water quickly caused him to become dehydrated, leaving him feeling weak and dizzy. There was hardly any sign of civilization around, so no one could come to his aid in case of an emergency. Also, the path he decided to take was long and extremely vigorous, filled with uphill stretches and rough patches. All these factors combined made his cycling experience a nightmare, highlighting the difficulties he had to face due to the unfavorable setting.
690	6669	3	3	In the story “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” written by Joe Kurmaskie, the author vividly describes the setting as hot, tiresome, and oppressively muggy. You get this clear picture from the author when the bikerider is elaborately describing his surroundings. The bikerider depicts his location as the high deserts of California in June, emphasizing that it is not only hot but also musky, with a rough and unforgiving terrain. This detailed description gives you a vivid image of what the bike rider feels both physically and emotionally. This image clearly shows how incredibly tired, desperately thirsty, and unwaveringly determined the bikerider really is. By skillfully using words, powerful metaphors, and evocative imagery, the author effectively puts you in the shoes of the bikerider both emotionally and physically, making you feel the full brunt of his experience.
691	6670	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by the behavior and advice of the people around the area of @LOCATION1. Taking well - intentioned advice from older, experienced people in an open landed place can significantly influence the cyclist's decisions and journey. This shows that the human element within the setting plays a crucial role in the cyclist's experience.
692	6671	3	3	In the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” By Joe Kurmaskie, the settings affected the cyclist by determining how hard his ride is. When the road was smooth, his ride was fast as he could pedal with ease and maintain good speed. However, when it was the hilly sections, it took him longer to get to the next town as he had to exert more energy to climb the slopes. Clearly, the nature of the road in the setting directly impacts the cyclist's progress.
693	6672	3	3	Various features of the setting affect the journey and mood of the cyclist in the text. The first feature of the setting that affects the cyclist is the desert. He is “traveling through the high deserts of California in June”, and the scorching heat of the desert sun is making him really thirsty. “[He] had been hitting [his] water bottles pretty regularly” because of this intense heat. He later runs out of water, and becomes hopeless. He becomes hopeless because there is no building or establishment anywhere in sight. Therefore, there is no water and there isn't a place to get any water. Another feature of the setting that affects him is the people that gave him directions. They told him about a shortcut, and he listened. This threw everything off, and he was left with despair. Another feature is Gary and Wilber’s fish camp. This led him to the success of finding water. This affected his mood because he had hope again. In conclusion, many of the features of the setting affected his mood in many ways, highlighting the strong influence of the setting on his cycling experience.
694	6673	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist for many reasons. If the setting is dark and rainy, there aren't going to be many people running outside. The gloomy and wet conditions make the environment less inviting for outdoor activities. Similarly, if it is snowing, the cyclists are not going to be swimming in the water as the cold and the presence of snow make the water extremely cold and unfit for swimming. Thus, the weather - related features of the setting clearly limit the cyclist's activities and choices.
695	6674	3	3	That explains how the features of the setting affect the cyclist. It is because some people don't care about these features. Everybody is working for a good feature, but others, unfortunately, @CAPS1 still take from people who work hard every day to have new features. This unethical behavior related to the features of the setting can disrupt the cyclist's experience and the overall balance, emphasizing the importance of respecting and protecting these features.
696	6675	3	3	"In “Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the desolate and challenging setting affects the cyclist by making him extremely doubtful. The cyclist is doubtful that he won’t make it to Yosemite National Park, as the long and arduous journey through the sparse landscape takes a toll on his spirit. ""It didn't really matter. I was going to die and the vultures would pick me clean, leaving only some expensive outdoor gear and a diary with the last entry in praise of old men, their wisdom and their keen senses of direction.” This vivid statement shows how deeply he is doubtful. Finally in the story, the cyclist doesn't think that they will make it, succumbing to the despair brought on by the unforgiving setting."
697	6676	3	3	In the passage, the unique features of the desolate setting affect the cyclist because every time he comes across something different, a new and often negative idea about his survival comes into his head. First, when the cyclist sees the mule standing alone in the vast expanse, he says, “This sight was troubling.” He is now troubled by the fact that he had not seen a town yet and starts to doubt the old men's advice, as the lack of civilization makes him question his route. Also, when he sees the dilapidated juice factory in the distance, he puts some pebbles in his mouth and says, “It didn't really matter, I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.” This shows that seeing the broken - down juice factory, a symbol of hope lost, gave him no hope and he tells himself that he will die, trapped in the harsh setting.
698	6677	3	3	In the essay, “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the harsh and unforgiving setting had a major impact on the character. The cyclist was trying to get to Yosemite National Park, but on the way, he had some troubles. The fact that there was not much civilization, with long stretches of empty roads and no water sources, affected the cyclist because he was not able to refill his water bottles, so he grew very thirsty. Also, the many steep hills and the fact that it is summer, with the scorching sun beating down, impacted him greatly because he became tired out more easily and could not pedal as fast. When it says, “A tar - like substance oozed out. Wouldn't cool down,” it showed how the heat was so intense that he wasn't able to drink properly due to the discomfort. Also, when he passed the grape juice factory, the sight of it, filled with the promise of liquid that he couldn't access, must have been torture to him since he was so thirsty. If he hadn't taken the advice of the men in the first place, he would have had a much shorter ride and would not have been so exhausted. The setting affected the cyclist a lot in this essay, highlighting the power of the environment on the journey.
699	6678	3	3	The cyclist is beginning at what seems a fine idea and place, with the sun shining and the road ahead looking promising. Then the conditions become hot, dreadful, and maybe sticky, as the summer heat in the open landscape intensifies. The constant heat without any breeze was getting to the character, making his every pedal stroke a struggle. Mirages appeared, or so he thought, as his parched mind played tricks on him. He actually thought he might die, as the heat and lack of water took a toll on his sanity. Not quite an optimistic one is he? “It didn't really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean…” The heat must have been bad, as he wasn't thinking straight and was slowly checking himself into a mental center! Although the painful heat was a brilliant way to learn a lesson in cycling, and the old men “helping” with directions that led him into this predicament, it taught him the harsh realities of relying on others and the power of the elements.
700	6679	3	3	As he began his journey, he had full confidence in the directions given to him by the old men, believing in their local knowledge and wisdom. After he came to the first town and there was no water, he rode on, determined to reach his destination. After he found an “ramshackle shed” in the middle of nowhere, he became troubled, as he “had been ‘hitting’ his ‘water bottles regularly’ and was traveling through the ‘desert of California in June’ and was running low on water. The dry heat was sapping his strength. Coming to a place where he saw a building over hills, he “maneuvered” his way down with hope in his heart, only to find it long deserted and himself close to despair. He was desperate for water; he needed it soon, as his throat was parched and his body was weakening. Finally, he came upon “@CAPS1 and Wilber’s Fish Camp” and quenched his thirst, and was relieved. Then on, he wised up, and took no more directions from old men who knew little to nothing about cycling, having learned his lesson the hard way.
701	6680	3	3	The features of the setting in the story “DO Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” significantly affect the cyclist in numerous ways. Firstly, the lack of water is a major issue. The cyclist has very little water with them, and there isn't a water source anywhere around for miles. As described in the text, “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” This evidence clearly shows that the cyclist is starting to get worried. Another crucial aspect of the setting is the high temperature. The cyclist is out in the hot, unforgiving desert. The text states, “Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June.” By using these elements of nature, the author aims to make the reader concerned and scared for the main character. The final key factor is the distance the cyclist has to travel and the road conditions. Although the desert is generally flat, the cyclist begins to notice some hills on the road. Covering such a long distance in the heat could be extremely dangerous. In conclusion, the setting's elements have a profound impact on the cyclist in this story.
702	6681	3	3	The cyclist of “Do not exceed posted speed limit” was greatly affected by the setting of his bike ride, which caused him a great deal of pain and displeasure. He is traveling in the high deserts of California in June. He even exaggerates that water there was “@NUM1 degers,” highlighting the harsh conditions. The intense heat forces him to drink large amounts of water, causing his water supply to deplete much faster than he had hoped. Moreover, the heat saps the energy out of him, making his ride even more difficult. Along the way, there is literally nothing around, and he has nowhere to replenish his water supply. The hilly and rough terrain also demands hard and arduous pedaling, further draining his energy. In conclusion, the combination of the heat, difficult terrain, and lack of places to stop results in an extremely awful ride for the cyclist in this story.
703	6682	3	3	The lone biker in “Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit” by @PERSON1 is strongly affected by the features of the landscape. The sun is the most crucial factor. It first makes the biker consume his water rapidly and then compels him to search for a water source. As the quote “The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it...I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly” reveals, even though the biker hadn't consciously acknowledged the sun, his body's need for water had led to the depletion of his water bottles. The biker describes the lack of water, saying it felt like two hundred degrees and had the flavor of battery acid. The only water the biker can find is undrinkable. The most important factor for the biker's survival is the fish camp that he finally reaches. The text states, “I stumbled into a rather modern bathroom and drank deeply from the sink.” The biker was on the verge of dehydration, and the fish camp is where he finally regains the strength to continue his journey. In conclusion, the landscape features play a vital role in the biker's experience and survival.
704	6683	3	3	Dry, thirsty, and tedious - all are features of the setting that have a significant impact on the cyclist. First of all, everything is extremely dry. The cyclist is nowhere near a town that could offer any help. He has been pedaling in the scorching heat outdoors for a long time. Secondly, he is extremely thirsty. The way he is traveling clearly indicates his urgent need for water. He pedals for forty miles before reaching the first town where he can stop. Additionally, since he is on a bike, he doesn't have much space to carry a large amount of water. Lastly, the trip is incredibly tedious. He has been cycling for forty miles, while the speed limit on the road is 55 mph, but he hasn't exceeded 12 mph. All in all, the cyclist's trip seems to be an adventure that requires a great deal of determination and perseverance.
705	6684	3	3	The setting affects the cyclist very strongly in the story because mentally and physically, he was not prepared for where he was going. For example, the text states, “No, a better piece of advice for the solo cyclist would be never to accept travel advice from a collection of old - timers who hadn't left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office.” So, a young guy took misguided advice from older guys about how to get to a backpacking spot. In their day, it probably was a shortcut, but the current conditions and the actual route turned out to be much more challenging than expected. In conclusion, the cyclist's reliance on faulty advice and his unpreparedness for the setting make his journey a difficult one.
706	6685	3	3	The setting affected the cyclist because it was extremely hot, with the scorching sun beating down relentlessly. He didn’t have any more water left in his bottles. Also, there weren’t any towns nearby that had good, clean water in them. He pedaled on, parched and fatigued, until he eventually arrived at this fishing competition area. Due to his lack of water, he became severely dehydrated and really weak. “With what I believed was my last burst of energy, I maneuvered down the hill,” this quote clearly shows that he was beginning to become dehydrated and losing his energy. In the end, his arrival at the fishing comp was a relief as he hoped to find some water there.
707	6686	3	3	Different settings can significantly affect how well your bicycle ride goes. If it is swelteringly hot and you have to navigate lots of steep hills, it makes the ride incredibly hard. The heat saps your energy, and the hills require extra effort. On the other hand, if you have no hills and it is a sunny, breezy day, with the gentle wind caressing your face, it makes it a truly nice and enjoyable ride. In the essay, the biker had no water left but was going down a hill. The going down the hill part was probably easy as gravity did most of the work, but the fact that he had no water left was not a good thing. This lack of water could potentially lead to dehydration and make the rest of the journey difficult. Overall, the setting plays a crucial role in determining the quality of a bicycle ride.
708	6687	3	3	The setting from the story left the cyclist in a troubled mental state because most of the time the blazing sun was constantly on his mind. This was due to the fact that he was pedaling hard on a sweltering hot summer day in June. The cyclist had very little water left in his canteen, and with him biking under a beating sun, it wasn’t exactly helping his situation. He had to face several disastrous events, like pedaling up slopes at a much slower pace than the normal speed, encountering a snake blocking the path which gave him quite a fright, old men warning him to take a different route to avoid getting infected, and the fact that his water supply was low made him think he was going to pass out under the burning sun. However, his determination was strong as he continued on pedaling through all these difficulties. He eventually found himself in another town but this time with people bustling around, the sight of fish in the nearby waters, and most importantly, access to water. This new town brought a sense of relief and hope after his arduous journey.
709	6688	3	3	From the setting that affected the cyclist are possible conditions such as the weather, which could be extremely hot or cold, and the surrounding environment like hills that can be steep or gentle, streams that might be shallow or deep, or even types of animals and if they are poisonous or not. For example, a venomous snake in the path can cause a cyclist to panic. The setting has and can change the decision a cyclist makes. A cyclist might choose to take a different route if the terrain is too rough or if there are dangerous animals. In conclusion, the setting is a crucial factor that influences a cyclist's journey and decision - making process.
710	6689	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One way is that the hot sun, shining brightly and radiating intense heat, makes the cyclist dehydrated. Since there are no water sources around, like no nearby streams or shops, the cyclist is not getting any water to quench his thirst. The rough terrain, with its uneven ground, rocks, and bumps, makes the cyclist tired as he has to constantly adjust his balance and use more force to pedal. All these factors combined can make the cyclist's journey extremely challenging and can even force him to stop if the conditions become too harsh. In conclusion, the setting's features have a significant impact on the cyclist's experience.
711	6690	3	3	"Many features of the Californian desert influenced the cyclist during his arduous ride. Ghost towns, rolling hills, and dangerous snakes significantly influenced the cyclist's experience during the so - called ""shortcut"" to Yosemite. The desolate ghost towns along the journey symbolized the world deserting him during his ride. They offered no help with water supply, nor were they a place to cool down, with their empty, dilapidated buildings baking in the sun. The road sign warning of rough terrain was another formidable barrier on his bike ride. He had to push through the pain of dehydration to reach his goal, Yosemite. The diamondback rattlesnake caused additional horror to the cyclist's ""ride from hell"". He had to carefully maneuver around the menacing serpent while being unstable from dehydration. All these features of the cyclist's riding setting combined to greatly affect his challenging ride to Yosemite."
712	6691	3	3	The features of the setting have a profound impact on the cyclist. If it is raining or snowing, the pavement can become wet and icy. This slippery condition of the road causes the cyclist to be at a high risk of slipping. When the cyclist slips, they may fall hard on the ground, potentially getting injured on @DATE1. A serious fall could lead to cuts, bruises, or even broken bones. Also, a cyclist must wear a proper helmet for safety. If it is very hot outside, wearing winter clothes would be extremely uncomfortable. This would make the cyclist unfocused as they struggle with the heat, and as a result, the cyclist wouldn't be able to finish any race successfully. In conclusion, the setting's features can make or break a cyclist's performance and safety.
713	6692	3	3	"The features of the setting greatly affect the cyclist. He can't go any farther easily because of the steep hills that sap his energy and the menacing snake that poses a real threat. When he finally finds the bait shop, he is visibly relieved. He is relieved because he can get something refreshing to drink to quench his parched throat. He can also buy the worms to eat as a desperate source of sustenance. The cyclist didn't really know where he was going because there wasn't a car, building, or any recognizable structure in sight. The vast expanse of emptiness made it difficult for him to orient himself. So the cyclist just keeps on riding, pushing himself forward until he comes across the bait shop or what he calls the first ""town"" in the essay. When he comes across the road that has a 55 - mph speed limit, and he is only 12 years old, he realizes that he is not going anywhere near Yosemite National Park. In summary, the setting's features constantly challenge and misdirect the young cyclist."
714	6693	3	3	"The features of the setting in ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" affect the cyclist in numerous ways. First, the setting does not match what the cyclist has been told it would be like. The cyclist had stopped to get directions from a group of older men. Unfortunately, their directions were out of date, leading the cyclist astray. Second, the conditions of the road have a significant impact on the cyclist. In the essay, the cyclist explains that the previously flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills. These hills require more effort to climb, slowing the cyclist down. A final feature of the setting that affected the cyclist was the temperature. The hot sun beamed down relentlessly on the cyclist, causing him to overheat and lose energy quickly. As you can see, the features of the setting in ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" all work together to affect the cyclist in many challenging ways."
715	6694	3	3	The different settings in the essay/writing affect the cyclist because of how old and hopeless they appear. I think this because when the cyclist stops at the first town, he looks around with anticipation, expecting to find a quaint, bustling little place full of life. Instead, he is met with these abandoned, decimated old houses with broken windows and peeling paint. If you can put yourself in his shoes, you can imagine how discouraging and almost frightening that must be. As the cyclist continues for a few more miles under the scorching sun, he is becoming slowly dehydrated. Finally, he sees a building in the distance. At first, he thinks this building is a mirage, a trick of his parched mind. He was wrong, but for him in this situation, it was worse - an old, dilapidated juice factory with rusty machinery and overgrown weeds. At this point, you kind of get the feeling that everything is turning against him and that there's no hope left. But when he finds the fishing camp, with its friendly faces and available water, his entire perspective of things changes, and he just feels so thankful to have been saved from the desolation. In conclusion, the varying settings in the story have a powerful emotional and physical impact on the cyclist.
716	6695	3	3	The setting affected the cyclist as the people from Lodi misguided him onto the wrong way. Stranded there, he found himself in a parched landscape with no water in sight. The next stop was at the bait store, so he was determined to reach that next stop destination. He didn't want to give up on his own. When a guy offered him directions, he firmly said he was not going to be fooled twice and continued his arduous journey, hoping to finally reach the bait store and find some relief.
717	6696	3	3	"It can't be known as ""easy"" to ride through a desert on a bike. Adding rough pavement that jolted the cyclist with every turn, rusty water pumps that were a struggle to operate, and not so friendly animals that lurked in the shadows adds to the discomfort as well. The cyclist in this story encountered all these things, making his supposedly pleasurable ride turn to a semi - brutal experience. ""It got down on my hands and knee, working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength. Alike substance ooed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees."" This quote shows how the conditions of his water supply were, which eventually lead him to dehydration. ""ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT @CAPS1 SPEED LIMIT."" This quote also shows how the riding conditions were making the cyclist have a harder time keeping speed. ""At some point tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake - it really did look like a diamond back - took up the majority of the pavement in front of me."" Clearly, this quote shows some of the dangers the cyclist encountered. If these features did not appear, then maybe the story would be describing a nice bike ride, but once you read about them, it becomes more of a disaster that tests the cyclist's mettle."
718	6697	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist greatly. The sweltering heat in the area where he was cycling was so intense that he kept sipping his water absent - mindedly. Before he knew it, he only had a couple of sips left in his bottle. The undulating terrain also made him extremely thirsty. As he had to constantly pedal up and down the hills, his body demanded more and more water. Moreover, the fact that he did not see any town except one ghost town for miles on end filled him with despair. He started to doubt if he was going to make it to the next town alive. The setting truly played a major role on the cyclist because it affected his physical and mental state to such a great degree, almost pushing him to the brink of giving up.
719	6698	3	3	Setting plays a big role in this story. Without being in the desert under the scorching sun on that hot @DATE1, there would not be a conflict. In a normal environment, there would be no need to worry about water scarcity, so there would be no importance in saving the water to avoid dehydration. The long flat roads in the desert are a symbol that the journey has still got a far way to go. They seem never - ending, stretching out like a never - ending line on the horizon. But as the straight roads gradually turn into hills, it shows that there is a change in the journey. It gives a glimmer of hope that something better is about to happen, perhaps an end to the arduous journey or a discovery of a water source. Thus, the setting shapes the story's conflict and progression in a significant way.
720	6699	3	3	The setting affect is used to a great extent in the short story “Do Not @CAPS1 Posted Speed Limit”. The cyclist had been going for a very long time, pedaling mile after mile when he finally came to the first town. To his dismay, there was no water available. At this point, you could clearly tell that he had lost confidence in the “old timers'” directions. From this quote; “a ton - like substance oozed out.” This quote shows how after @NUM1 miles of relentless pedaling, when he was supposed to have come to two towns by that point, his one chance of water had been depleted. The next time the setting affect is used is when he came across a building that was completely rusted out. He said, “I hung my head.” This shows how he almost completely lost all hope. He was so dejected that he was sure that he was going to die in this desolate place, with no water and no end to his journey in sight.
721	6700	3	3	The cyclist is affected by a couple different things. First, he is given directions that are out of date, which leads him to take a longer and more confusing route. Then he has to deal with the intense heat of the weather in the early summer of California, with the sun beating down relentlessly on him. If that wasn't enough, he then runs out of water, which he needs very badly to stay hydrated during his ride. He runs into a couple more problems, like seeing a big, menacing snake slithering across his path and coming to a factory that used to make juice and it was now run down and empty, giving an eerie feeling. After all of these obstacles, the cyclist pulls through with determination and makes it to a fishing store, where he gets water to quench his thirst and regain his energy.
722	6701	3	3	During the cyclist's biking adventure he encounters several interesting situations. Each experience is in response to the setting in which it takes place. For example, this young man starts out confident with a bright hope of eventually reaching Yosemite National Park, his eyes shining with excitement. The first spot he comes to is a ghost town, with dilapidated buildings and an air of desolation. This sight doesn't immediately affect him, however it greatly adds on to the long - term effects, making him a bit more cautious. He decides to continue on his trek, reaching the next ghost town. By this time he is becoming dehydrated due to his lack of water supply, his throat parched and his lips chapped. He decides to keep pursuing his goal and figures there must be water up ahead in the next town. In order to get to the next town he must encounter some precarious situations including some changes in terrain, like steep slopes and rocky paths. Eventually after reaching a source of running water, clear and cool, he is overjoyed with happiness and relief, splashing the water on his face and gulping it down. As evident in the provided text this man was affected by each feature of the setting. The different settings greatly affected his nature of confidence, sometimes shaking it but also making him more resilient.
723	6702	3	3	The setting affects the rider because if it's hot, the scorching heat makes you feel extremely thirsty and you have no water to relieve the dryness in your mouth. The sun beats down mercilessly, causing your body to lose moisture rapidly. This kind of question is hard to answer as there are multiple aspects of the setting that can impact the rider, not just the heat but also the terrain and the availability of resources. In such a situation, the rider has to endure the discomfort and keep going, which shows how the setting can have a significant influence on the rider's experience.
724	6703	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist by making the journey more dangerous and difficult. For example, in the reading it states that ridiculously large, poisonous diamond - back snakes blocked the majority of the pavement. These snakes were coiled menacingly, their fangs visible, ready to strike. So, the cyclist had to keep his/her balance carefully to ease past them, his/her heart pounding with fear. The terrain also changed into short, rolling hills, with the inclines making it even more strenuous to pedal. The cyclist had to put in extra effort to climb each hill, his/her legs aching from the exertion. Overall, the combination of the snakes and the hilly terrain made the cyclist's journey a real challenge.
725	6704	3	3	The features in the setting of the essay affect the author in one major way, dehydration. There are several features that cause the author to dehydrate. First off, he is riding through a desert located in California, where the arid landscape offers no respite. The blistering heat from the sun is constantly beating down on him, causing his body to sweat profusely. Also, the change from “Flat road” (Kurmaskie) to “short, rolling hills” affected him in terms of getting dehydrated. This change caused him to use more energy to climb up the hills, as he had to pedal harder against gravity. This means he used more water because he got thirstier faster, his body working overtime to keep up with the physical demands. This is how the features in the setting affected the author of the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” The setting played a crucial role in making his journey a struggle with the constant threat of dehydration.
726	6705	3	3	The features of the setting in “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” affect the cyclist in various challenging ways. For example, the tough terrain, with its uneven ground and rocky patches, made it extremely difficult for the cyclist to reach his destination, Yosemite. He was already very fatigued from hours of cycling but had to continuously overcome the steep hills. In the essay, he states, “I noticed the terrain changing. The once - flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills that seemed to go on forever.” The setting features also affected the cyclist when he encountered the snake. He was severely dehydrated, his throat parched and his body weak, and could barely navigate around the dangerous snake. The cyclist explains, “At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake, it really did look like a diamondback, blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me. I eased past it fast, trying desperately to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.” The setting also affected the cyclist because there was no one around him to help. The cyclist describes, “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind as far as the eye could see.” The cyclist was all alone and had to rely on himself to make it to Yosemite. In conclusion, the features of the setting in “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” significantly affect the cyclist. He had to overcome rugged terrain without sufficient energy, avoid a menacing diamondback snake, and make it all the way to Yosemite because there was no one around to offer assistance. As you can see, the features of the setting have a profound impact on the cyclist's journey.
727	6706	3	3	The features of the land around the cyclist caused him to confront nature head - on. When he began his trip, taking advice from “old coggers,” he “rode out with strong legs and a confident smile.” As he came to the first town, he describes it as a desolate “ghost town,” having no water source and no human contact for quite some time. This should have been a clear cue for him to stop and turn around in hopes of finding another route to Yosemite. But with unwavering determination, he pedaled on. Through the long miles, he encountered a ramshackle shed that looked like it could collapse at any moment, rusty pumps that were clearly non - functional, snakes slithering across the path, and the wicked terrain. The short rolling hills tested his “inner spirit” and caused his dehydration to worsen further. The land around the cyclist not only took a toll on his health but also made it a rather poor way to spend a vacation, as he struggled through one hardship after another. In the end, the unforgiving land truly challenged the cyclist's resolve and made his journey far from a relaxing getaway.
728	6707	3	3	The harsh features of the setting affect the cyclist by severely hindering his journey to Yosemite National Park. As the cyclist is traveling along “The high deserts of California in June,” a series of problems arise. The intense heat from the pounding sun in the desert takes a heavy toll on the cyclist, causing him to drink more water at a rapid pace and rapidly deplete his supply. The cyclist is also traveling through small “ghost towns” instead of stopping at appropriate rest stops. These ghost towns offer no proper facilities to refill with water and take a relaxing break. Also, while on his way, he encounters hazards such as “Short rolling hills” in the ghostly terrain and even a large, menacing snake. All of these features in the setting impair the cyclist's ability to maintain confidence in whether he will make it to his destination and dampen his positive attitude toward the journey. In conclusion, the harsh setting features act as major obstacles, making the cyclist's trip to Yosemite a challenging and uncertain one.
729	6708	3	3	Cycling is a very good sport that offers numerous health benefits. People who regularly engage in cycling are generally in good physical shape. Their bodies are toned, and they have strong calf muscles due to the continuous pedaling motion. The repetitive movement of the legs during cycling helps to build strength and endurance in the calves. However, I think it's also dangerous as well. Cyclists are exposed to various risks on the road, such as traffic accidents, uneven surfaces that can cause them to lose balance, and bad weather conditions. Despite the risks, with proper safety measures like wearing helmets and following traffic rules, cycling can still be an enjoyable and beneficial activity. In conclusion, while cycling has its advantages in terms of fitness, one must also be aware of the potential dangers.
730	6709	3	3	In the story, the author says, “The sun was beginning to beat down, and I was struggling to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.” This gives you a vivid idea that the intense heat is getting to him and is steadily depleting his water supply. As the sun's rays bore down on him, his body was losing water rapidly through sweating. At one point, he almost gives himself up to despair and succumbs to the threat of dying of dehydration. It seems that he will never reach his goal and he will continue to suffer in the grueling heat that shows no sign of relenting. I could almost feel the sweat trickling down my back and the overwhelming heat that the cyclist was feeling. Also, I could almost feel the lump in my throat when he says, “with any luck Iíd hit a bump and lodge a pebble in my throat,” expressing his extreme desperation. The heat definitely affects this man's cycling in a bad way. He was completely exhausted and could not go on without water. In conclusion, the heat acts as a major obstacle, severely hampering the cyclist's ability to complete his journey.
731	6710	3	3	The cyclist found the journey incredibly hard. Moreover, he was extremely upset that the old - timers provided such bad directions, which made his already tough ride even more difficult.
732	6711	3	3	The setting affects the cyclist in many ways. First, he couldn't get water from anywhere because he was in a vast desert with nothing but ramshackle sheds and rusty, dilapidated camps. Second, there were short, uneven rolling hills, and the rough, unpaved roads made it arduous to ride on. There were tumbleweeds constantly getting in his way and large, venomous snakes lurking around. The intense heat made it extremely hard to keep riding. And there were no buildings, structures, or people around to give him a lift or offer him water. That is how the setting affects the cyclist.
733	6712	3	3	In this essay by Joe Kurmaskie, a young man is lured into accepting outdated information by a group of old men. He pays a heavy price later when, on his bicycle, he is almost killed by heatstroke or dehydration. The setting is an excellent way to portray his feelings of hopelessness, despair, and fatigue. While he is just starting out, the road is flat and smooth, making the ride easy. It is cool and pleasantly breezy. When he begins to run out of water, the terrain becomes bumpier and much harder to navigate. He sees empty, barren plains, cracked, parched dry ground, and the scorching hot sun. He begins to despair even more. After a while when he thinks he can go no more, he sees a shabby store that once held gallons of grape juice. He laughs at the cruel irony. The setting does do a wonderful job of describing his sense of helplessness.
734	6713	3	3	In this passage, the cyclist was affected by the setting because if it had been anywhere else, he would not have suffered or learned at all. Because the setting had both a lack of civilization and the water that he desperately needed, it caused him to almost faint from thirst. This is an example of the setting affecting the cyclist, “With what I believed was my last burst of energy, I maneuvered down the hill.” This shows that had the setting been a paradise, he would never have learned anything.
735	6714	3	3	The features of the setting in the essay caused the cyclist to suffer and yet continue being determined. The author of the essay used phrases such as ‘the sun was relentlessly beating down’ and “high deserts of California in June” to emphasize the extreme, sweltering heat that caused the cyclist extreme thirst and severe heat exhaustion. The essay also says “short, bumpy rolling hills”, “tumbleweeds constantly blowing across” and “long, energy - sapping crippling hill” to describe the difficult terrain the cyclist faced that caused him to be extremely tired and ride at a slower pace. Finally, the cyclist is faced with a “rediculously large, menacing snake” and plants and weeds which keep getting in his way and force him to slow down.
736	6715	3	3	The setting affects the cyclist very much, especially in the very dry climates. In such dry conditions, the cyclist faces challenges like rapid dehydration and increased fatigue. The lack of moisture in the air makes it difficult for the cyclist to maintain normal body functions, and the intense dryness can also cause discomfort in the eyes, nose, and throat. Overall, the dry climate significantly impacts the cyclist's physical state and the ease of the journey.
737	6716	3	3	"The setting in the story ""Rough road ahead"" plays a great role in the character's journey. Some features that are mentioned in the story are the intense heat, the rough and uneven road, the long and crippling hills, and an abandoned Grape Juice Factory. The sweltering heat in the story drives the cyclist into a state of dying thirst. The cyclist does her best to conserve her limited water throughout the trip, but the dry desert heat doesn't allow it. Then comes the rough road ahead. The cyclist tries to keep a steady and secure pace as she pedals along the numerous bumps and breaks in the road. The long and exhausting hills are next in line; the cyclist has to use all her energy to work up the hill. She wipes the sweat from her eyes to make sure it's not a mirage and then she sees it, the abandoned factory. This is where the cyclist loses all hope, for if she doesn't receive water soon, she is sure to be in great danger, perhaps even being at the mercy of scavenging birds. “Then, and as easily as rounding a bend, my troubles, thirst, and fear were all behind me. Gary and Wilber Fish Camp.” The cyclist rushed to the bathroom to drink the refreshing water from the sink. A sense of pride and accomplishment overwhelms her as she realizes she has overcome the arduous journey."
738	6717	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because it gives him the feeling of hopelessness. When the cyclist got directions to Yosemite from these two rather elderly old people, he thought he was getting a good shortcut. In reality, he was just led on a desolate road that seemed to head nowhere. Along this road, he saw many things that added to his feeling of hopelessness. For example, the author writes, “I toiled on. At some points, tumbleweeds slowly crossed my path, and an unusually large snake, which really did move like a diamondback, blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.” This shows that the cyclist is getting increasingly tired and seeing tumbleweeds, which usually represent a place being completely deserted, and deadly snakes that get in his way. This answers the question because it clearly shows how the desolate setting leads to his feeling of hopelessness.
739	6718	3	3	The story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” was a rough and arduous undergoing story about a cyclist going through rough climate and terrain. In this story, the description was like a scorching path of nothingness for as far as human eyes could see. In paragraph @NUM1, the text says “Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could die from heatstroke” expresses how the intense climate felt. This clearly explains the searing heat and how the cyclist felt during this difficult experience. From the description of the dried - sweat rings and the fear of heatstroke, one can imagine the cyclist's suffering. This whole trip sounds like an extremely painful and challenging ordeal.
740	6719	3	3	The features of a setting can affect the cyclist in many ways. For example, while he was riding under the blazing hot sun, the high temperature made his body lose a large amount of water through sweating. As a result, he became very thirsty because he only had a few drops of water left in his bottle. The hot sun not only causes dehydration but also makes the cyclist feel extremely fatigued. The lack of sufficient water further exacerbates his discomfort and makes it difficult for him to continue the journey. That is how the setting can affect the cyclist.
741	6720	3	3	The features of the setting, such as the intense heat and arid environment, affect the cyclist greatly. They make it extremely hard to concentrate, because of its sweltering heat, they make the situation unbearable. The setting has the effect of inducing drowsiness and thirst, as described by the words “Dry bitter land, longing, longing...” In such a setting, the cyclist's journey becomes a real challenge.
742	6721	3	3	In many ways, the setting affected his journey to Yosemite. If the setting wouldn't have been so harsh, the long ride wouldn't have been as strenuous on his body. Since the setting was a very hot day in June, in a desolate California desert, when he did find a well he said, “followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.” One thing about the setting is, if it wouldn't have been so scorching, he wouldn't have needed as much water. And, if he would have gotten the water he needed because it was so hot, it wouldn't have been so physically exhausting on his body. I know it was physically draining because he said “I could drop from a heat - stroke on a gorgeous day in June.” In conclusion, the setting played a major and undeniable role in the story, significantly influencing his journey.
743	6722	3	3	In the story “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the man was riding a bike through rough and unforgiving lands. His adventure wouldn't have been an adventure if he was just riding his bike on a flat and smooth surface. The fact that the hills were steep, rocky, and there were many of them is what made his bike ride the challenging and memorable experience it was. The rough terrain truly defined his journey.
744	6723	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist, starting with the old - timers' advice of how to get somewhere. The town they told him to go to turned out to be a ghost town, completely deserted. After he kept going, the place that they told him to get water was very old and rusty. When he pumped it, he said tar came out. Then, as he made his way in the desert, a snake suddenly slithered onto the road and he had to carefully go around it. So, it's clear that one should never blindly take advice from old timers as it can lead to unexpected and difficult situations.
745	6724	3	3	In the story, “Do not exceed posted speed limit,” the features of the setting affect the cyclist by vividly showing the rough conditions he went through, and somehow he persevered through them. The author states numerous times the lack of water, and the endless rolling hills. The description “Followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees” is a clear indication of the hardships. This shows the intense struggle he went through and supports the setting's role in the story and how it affected his trip. This also shows how he persevered through his struggles and made a determined effort to finish his journey, demonstrating his resilience.
746	6725	3	3	The rider's condition was rough as he traversed from flat land to rolling hills. This challenging terrain would be extremely hard for someone who was dehydrating. There was a snake slithering across his path, so he carefully went around it. This situation was dangerous as he could blackout from the lack of water and then get bit by the snake, which would put his life at great risk.
747	6726	3	3	The cyclist depicted in the essay is greatly affected by his surroundings. First, he vividly described a blazing, beating sun and tall pines and rushing rivers. All these items are very animated things. The river is even described as rushing instead of, maybe, being described as violent. The setting is full of activity just like the cyclist. Next, a dilapidated ramshackle shed is acknowledged, as well as rusty pumps and a poorly - sounding corral. When these old, forsaken things are mentioned, it can be clearly noticed that the cyclist starts being a little in despair. And to top that off, he drinks water that tastes like “battery acid.” Battery eats at skin just like the setting is gradually eating at the cyclist, wearing down his spirit.
748	6727	3	3	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead” the setting is able to affect the cyclist's emotions and moods in both positive and negative ways. As the author travels through the sweltering desert, he is already upset because it is so hot and water is scarce, clearly showing how the harsh terrain is a negative influence. Another example would be when the author first sees the old water pump and he is relieved, showing a positive influence. But the pump oozes a shiny substance he refers to as tasting like “battery acid,” quickly changing his mood for the worst. Finally, the pebbles he puts in his mouth show his desperation and willingness to try anything to survive, showing a new positive outlook on the desert until a piece of the pump “lodges in his throat,” making yet another negative influence. All of these features lead him on his way to “Gary and Will's fish camp” and give him an extra, albeit difficult, boost on his arduous journey through the desert.
749	6728	3	3	"The features of the setting affect him because it is swelteringly hot and there is nowhere to take shelter. An example from the text is when they said ""There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind."" There was also a part where he got to a sign that said ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT. The speed limit was 55 mph, but he was doing a water - depleting 12 mph. Sometimes life can feel so cruel. What affected the cyclist the most were the searing heat, the hilly roads, the lack of water, the presence of snakes, the rough roads, and most of all, the absence of directions, which made his journey extremely tough."
750	6729	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because of where they were. It was like they were in the middle of nowhere, and every person they asked for directions seemed to be having a hard time themselves. They got the wrong directions to the nearest town. The old guy told him it was @NUM1 miles down the road. When he cycled @NUM2 miles to the next town, he said to himself that he will never take directions from a guy that has all - timers and hasn't left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office, realizing that relying on such unreliable sources was a mistake.
751	6730	3	3	When the cyclist was in the “serenity of an early sunset evening,” the man thoroughly enjoyed his cycling, all the while just hoping he could cut his time in half. Then, once he got the advice and headed down the long, desolate road, he saw a ghost town, which is never a good sign. Next, he came to the fork in the road, and the town he arrived at had no water. On the way to the new town, he encountered a bumpy road and was going at a certain pace (@NUM1). He soon found himself out of water. But finally, after much determination, he made it to a place that was very nice. So, as you can tell, the features of the scenery and the road affected him greatly, shaping his entire cycling experience.
752	6731	3	3	I think that the setting, with its harshness and isolation, made him find more courage inside himself to save his water and go to the next town without any water. This difficult situation forced him to dig deep and rely on his inner strength. By rationing his limited water supply and pushing forward despite the lack of it, he showed remarkable resilience. In the end, it was this courage born from the setting that allowed him to persevere and reach his destination.
753	6732	3	3	The environment affected the cyclist violently in the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” It seems that all of the harsh conditions of cycling in California, such as the scorching heat and long, arduous miles, had worn down this kid who took some faulty directions from older people at one stop. The heat and lack of water supply made the boy severely dehydrated. It says in the essay “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because I listened to some gentlemen.” This clearly explains how simply exhausted he had become due to the miles of cycling, the beating down sun, and the total lack of water due to the absence of all towns. He came to the point of almost dying from heat exhaustion because of the faulty directions of the old people. Next time, he better make sure to keep extra water and stick to the map for directions to avoid such life - threatening situations.
754	6733	3	3	As the cyclist makes his journey towards Yosemite, the setting causes him much worry and concern. In the beginning, the narrator is content and excited. He is doing something that he loves, is heading for a beautiful destination, and has found a short cut to save him hours of time. He is confident in the directions given to him by the old men. However, as he continues down the long, winding road, his environment makes him doubt their judgement. The first town he comes to is entirely deserted. Though at first he tries to laugh it off, he later realizes just how much trouble he is in if he doesn't come to a civilization soon. The cyclist runs across “ramshackle shed[s]” and shut - down factories, and as his water supply sinks lower, the road seems to taunt him. He passes a water pump (just what he needs), yet the water is something close to toxic. A road sign reminds him not to go too fast, though he might (@MONTH1) die if he doesn't pick up the pace. He is forced to look at a picture of a happy boy guzzling grape juice as he dehydrates. All these features of the setting, in addition to the overpowering heat and the blazing sun, drive the narrator to the breaking point, making his journey a true test of endurance.
755	6734	3	3	The feature of setting affects the cyclist because every thing that was happening years ago is happening now in today's world, meaning wars, rights, and so on. Today's features are the same as in the past. Everything is repeating itself. This cyclist, in his journey, might be facing the same kind of uncertainties and hardships that people have faced throughout history. The setting, with its echoes of the past, adds a layer of complexity to his experience. It shows that no matter how much time passes, certain challenges and patterns remain constant, and the cyclist has to navigate through them just like others before him.
756	6735	3	3	When riding a bike, it may not seem too hard at first glance. However, for a cyclist, everything becomes more serious. There is a burning determination to win and be the best, even if it means pushing oneself to the limit. In this essay, the author underestimates the older cyclist. In reality, they are the ones with more knowledge and experience. Some of the things that can be hard for a cyclist are the rough roads. Not only is there a risk of being killed by dehydration or being run over, but riding a bike is really hard work when having to ride in hundred - degree weather. One has to keep drinking drink after drink, yet often there is no water available. No water and the extreme heat could cause a heat stroke. As the roads get worse, the chances of encountering obstacles like tumble weeds and snakes increase. But he was determined to win. After all was said and done, and he faced the horrors that nature brought him, he knew he was wrong. He was wrong about underestimating them and their intelligence.
757	6736	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in numerous different ways. The fact that he was in the vast California desert and the intense heat took a toll on him. With limited water supplies and the constant exertion of riding the bike, his energy was quickly sapped. The “towns” he came across also had a significant impact on him. Since he couldn't get more water or find a place to rest, his situation grew more desperate. “I was doing a water - depleting ride. Sometimes life can feel so cruel,” he thought. This clearly shows how the hilly terrain, combined with dehydration and the sweltering heat, are severely affecting the cyclist. In such a harsh setting, the cyclist's journey becomes an arduous battle against the elements.
758	6737	3	3	Two of the biggest settings in this story are the vast desert and the rolling hills. This would affect the rider because of the dehydration that he would inevitably experience. Being in the desert, it is obviously extremely hot, causing the rider to sweat a great deal. The water loss through sweating is rapid, leaving the rider at risk of dehydration. Meanwhile, the hills would make it tough on his body. He has to put extra strain on his muscles to pedal up them, which further exhausts him. So all together, this would be a grueling bike ride, testing the rider's physical and mental endurance to the limit.
759	6738	3	3	In the story, “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist experiences severe dehydration on his journey. The cyclist takes directions from older guys who look like they haven't left their porches in ages. He naively takes their advice, but then suffers in the long run. It is a hot summer day, and he cannot find water anywhere. He hikes uphills in the blistering sun, constantly fearing a heat stroke. There is no sight of civilization, not a building in sight, nor a passing car. In this desolate and harsh environment, the cyclist's situation becomes increasingly dire, highlighting the perils of relying on untested advice in such extreme conditions.
760	6739	3	3	The setting will either affect the cyclist in a good way or a bad way. In the story “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaskie, it affects the cyclist in both a bad way and a good way. In the story, it continuously talks about the lack of water. “When I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid,” the cyclist remarks. This shows that the heat made the water warm, so it did not cool him down and was almost undrinkable. But a good way it affects him is through the pebbles. “I read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you have left to moisten your mouth.” This shows that even though he has no water, the pebbles can make him feel less thirsty. This is how the setting affects the cyclist, in both good and bad ways, demonstrating the complex relationship between the cyclist and his surroundings.
761	6740	3	3	In this story, it is clear just how difficult the cyclist's journey is. He has to conquer wrong directions that lead him astray, a severe lack of water that parches his throat, menacing rattle snakes that pose a real threat, and the ever - present fear of dying. However, he shows great determination and control. An example of his determination is “The old guys had sworn the next town was only eighteen miles down the road. I could make that.” This shows his unwavering determination as he firmly believes he can go on such a long and arduous journey. An example of his self - control is shown in paragraphs @NUM1 and @NUM2. When he finds this building to be abandoned, with no juice or any useful resources, anyone else would have become frustrated and wanted to give up. But not this cyclist; he controlled his anger and again showed remarkable determination. And it paid off in the end as he found his water and survived. This story is a great one that vividly shows the power of determination and self - control.
762	6741	3	3	Early in the crisp morning, the cyclist is brimming with eagerness and fully ready to face the adventurous path that had been mapped out by the older, more experienced travelers. He hardly noticed that “the sun was beginning to beat down” with its intense rays. He was calm and was eagerly looking forward to the “cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite.” Never once did he imagine the kind of trouble he had gotten himself into. As he began to approach the vast, arid desert, he noticed that he was running dangerously low on water. The strenuous activity of biking, combined with the scorching heat of the desert, began to take a severe toll on him. The cyclist was so desperately thirsty that he had to put pebbles into his mouth. He had once read, “that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you have left to circulate.” The cyclist was desperately hoping for a way out of the misery he had come across. Dehydration took its toll, and he started to feel hallucinations. He was beginning to lose hope. The heat, the challenging hills, and the lack of water had the greatest impact on the cyclist. Had he not been riding through a hilly desert one afternoon in June, he would have been just fine.
763	6742	3	3	In the cyclist story, the setting took a huge role in how the story unfolded. The water, or rather the lack of it, had a lot of effects on the cyclist. The setting of the story took place in the high, barren deserts of California in June. As soon as you read that, you know something is bound to go wrong. In the story, he says, “the sun was beginning to beat down.” This is going to affect him because he's riding through the desert on a bike, which causes him to quickly become dehydrated. He eases past, trying to keep his balance in his dehydrated state. He's beginning to lose his mind because he has no water, all due to the harsh setting. Everything about the setting, the blistering heat, the desolate landscape, and the lack of water, causes the cyclist some serious problems. The heat, the unforgiving setting, and the lack of water almost cost him his life. In conclusion, the setting was a major factor that put the cyclist's life at risk.
764	6743	3	3	The setting affects the cyclist in a lot of ways. The first way is that he was riding in the middle of a sweltering desert in June. If he was riding in a cooler, more temperate place like @LOCATION1, it wouldn't be painfully hot, and he could have enjoyed a more comfortable ride. Also, the rolling hills probably didn't help his situation. If it was mostly downhill, he would have been fine. Riding a bike up a hill when you're tired and dehydrated is near impossible. The combination of the hot desert setting and the challenging terrain really took a toll on the cyclist.
765	6744	3	3	In the story “Do not exceed posted speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the path to @ORGANIZATION2 greatly affected the cyclist. On the way to the park, the cyclist came across a huge snake that completely covered the road, which greatly frightened the biker. The sight of the menacing snake sent shivers down his spine. Also, the roads were long, and they were very bumpy and windy. The road wasn't the most comfortable to be riding on; every bump jolted the cyclist and made his journey even more difficult. There was nothing in sight for the cyclist to see, just endless stretches of desolate road. The cyclist did not have much energy because he had no hope for himself. The author states, “... gaining elevation while losing hope.” Last, the weather was hot and dry, which quickly tired the cyclist out. He had no water with him, and with the unforgiving weather, he had no energy or hope to help him through the long and arduous journey to Yosemite National Park. In conclusion, the various features of the path, including the snake, the poor road conditions, the lack of scenery, and the harsh weather, all combined to make the cyclist's journey to the park extremely challenging.
766	6745	3	3	In the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”, the cyclist experienced a few life - threatening times during his adventure. The first instance was when he was in a desert with temperatures of @NUM1 degrees. The hot, arid air seemed to suck the moisture out of him, and his little bit of water, which had been sitting in the heat, tasted like battery acid. As he pedaled on, trying to keep going, the relentless sun and the desolate landscape wore him down. He lost hope and thought he was going to die right there in the vast expanse of sand. This affected him deeply because as he lost hope, he started to think more negatively about everything. He didn't think he would make it to safety. But then, a spark of determination, an inner agility, welled up within him, and he found the strength to move on. In this story, the setting affects the characters dramatically, truly testing the cyclist's will to survive.
767	6746	3	3	The feature of the setting is making the cyclist extremely frustrated, desperately thirsty, and utterly confused. The harsh conditions of the setting are making him frustrated as he thought he was going the right way. He had carefully planned his route, following what he believed were reliable signs, but in reality, he was going out of his way. The lack of clear landmarks and the disorienting landscape added to his confusion, and the parching heat was making his thirst almost unbearable. All these factors combined due to the setting were taking a toll on his mental and physical state, leaving him in a state of distress.
768	6747	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the features are what cause the climax of the story. An example of this would be the line, “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California.” This line shows that the author was in a very hot place, being in a desert where the sun beats down mercilessly. Moreover, it indicates that he has a low water supply as he has been consuming it regularly to combat the heat. These two conditions, the intense heat and the limited water, are what cause the climax. The cyclist is constantly at risk, with the possibility that he could collapse at any minute from heat exhaustion. The sweltering heat and the dwindling water are like ticking time - bombs, pushing the story towards its peak moment. This is why the features of the setting affect the cyclist so significantly.
769	6748	3	3	Certain features of the setting affected the cyclist. In the essay by Joe Kurmaskie, he describes his experiences when he cycled through the desert. “...arrived at the first town”...it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town. The empty streets, dilapidated buildings, and an eerie silence hung over the place. At first, the cyclist was a bit amused at this town and maybe a little unsettled because the old “codgers” had told it to be a thriving place. He had expected a bustling community with supplies and a place to rest, but instead, he found a desolate wasteland. Halfway through his journey, he stated “sometimes life can be so cruel.” Water was running low, and he could feel his throat getting drier with each passing moment. He still had a long way to go until he made it to the park. The endless expanse of nothingness around him was demoralizing. All that he saw around him were hills of barren land under the scorching sun, with his limited amount of water. There were no buildings in sight to offer shade or a respite from the heat. The ghost town and the lack of shade or solution are very prominent features of the setting that make the cyclist feel like a fool for taking advice from older men, realizing too late that he was ill - prepared for this harsh environment.
770	6749	3	3	I am going to explain how the setting of the cyclist affected him. The setting of the cyclist affected him by making him very hot. The scorching sun beat down on him as he cycled through the arid landscape, and the hot, dry air seemed to sear his lungs with each breath. He was constantly drinking his water to try and cool down, but with each sip, he could feel his supply dwindling. He knew he would soon run out of water and dehydrate. For example, in the story, the cyclist would always bring up the little bit of water he had left. Throughout the essay, he talked about the early signs of dehydration he was experiencing, like dizziness and fatigue, and even thoughts of death started to cross his mind. Another example is the relief he had when he drank the water from the sink. The cool, refreshing liquid was like a lifesaver. In conclusion, the hot, water - scarce setting had a profound impact on the cyclist, putting his life at risk and testing his endurance.
771	6750	3	3	This paragraph tells about how extremely careful you should be on the roads. It emphasizes that being vigilant is of utmost importance. This also talks about what specific things you have to be aware of while on the road. There are so many unexpected things that could happen, such as sudden stops of other vehicles or pedestrians crossing unexpectedly. You have to take full control when you're on the road to ensure your safety and that of others.
772	6751	3	3	The features of the setting in “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie significantly affects the cyclist in many ways. For example, it states “This place might have been a thriving little spot before the last world war; it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.” This statement is precisely talking about the town he arrived at when he was trying to reach Yosemite with high hopes. This would affect the cyclist because he was riding with confidence in the beginning, imagining a smooth journey. But then the first town he arrives in looks like a desolate ghost town, which would gradually bring his confidence a little bit lower than before. Just like when people travel and they know exactly where they are going, they feel good and assured. But once they come to a place they are unfamiliar with, they won't feel so confident anymore. Another example is when he has to ride on rolling hills, which already require a lot of effort. And then he comes across a “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” sign. This would affect the cyclist because then he would be extremely frustrated and stressed out. He rode all that way with determination, and now he can't go any further as he wishes, and that is not the place he wanted to be at. Therefore, the features of the setting in “Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie have a notable impact on the cyclist.
773	6752	3	3	The conditions that the bicyclist faced that affected his trip were a various amount of things that could really mess up your ride. Some of the conditions were the intense heat. It was very hot, and the sweltering heat makes it hard to think fast, move quickly, and make good decisions. Another challenging condition was the loose gravel on the road. The loose gravel makes it tough to maneuver the bicycle smoothly, and you have to constantly watch your speed to avoid slipping. So, he's not going anywhere in a hurry. Also, there were lots of hills on the route. The continuous ascent and descent of the hills make for an uncomfortable ride and a tiring one at that. Adding to his troubles, he was fresh out of water. Running out of water can mean dehydration, which leads to poor judgment and even the risk of heat stroke or exhaustion. Another bad thing is that he was in the middle of nowhere. It's not like he could simply stop somewhere and ask for a drink. There was nothing around for miles, leaving him in a desperate situation. These things clearly show how rough the road was made because these difficult conditions existed.
774	6753	3	3	The setting was very hot, dry, and was a vast desert. The scorching sun beat down relentlessly. This setting affected him as it was making him very dehydrated and extremely hot. The lack of moisture in the air and the high temperature sapped his energy. It was very hard for him to go any further, but he knew deep down that he had to keep going to reach his destination. Also, the land was very barren, with nothing but sand and rocks around. Clearly, the harsh setting had a significant impact on the biker, making his journey an arduous one.
775	6754	3	3	The setting affected the cyclist because they were in California in June, a time when the heat can be quite intense. They were traveling on back roads, which are often less populated and lack proper amenities. There was no place to stop for water along the way. If the cyclist would have followed the path they originally intended on following, the ride probably would have been more enjoyable. They wouldn't have had to worry about a heatstroke or running out of water. They would have been in a better - equipped area with access to water and rest stops, and thus they would have been fine and could have completed the journey more comfortably.
776	6755	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist greatly. There were steep hills and large rocks, venomous snakes, and not a single building or person in sight. The steep hills and large rocks would make it much more difficult to stay strong and be able to keep riding. The sight of an abandoned building and the complete absence of people could affect him emotionally. It would make him lose hope and the determination to keep going to find his destination. He did not think he would get through this after seeing a deserted town. After all, he did say, “It didn’t really matter. I was going to die … ” (Kurmaskie). This difficult setting truly tested the cyclist's physical and mental strength.
777	6756	3	3	The main features of the setting that affected the cyclist are the fact that it was June, a typically hot month, and the intense desert heat. “ … I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June … ” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). This helps us realize how extremely bad the heat is in June in the middle of the California desert. The sweltering heat affected the cyclist by causing severe dehydration, and the fact that he was in the middle of nowhere with no one to help him made the situation even worse. This is how the month of June and the desert heat affected the cyclist, highlighting the harshness of the setting on his journey.
778	6757	3	3	The features of the setting greatly affected the cyclist in this story. First, when he got to the road sign that clearly said “Rough Road Ahead” he was already running low on water, but that warning made things much worse. The rough and bumpy road made it significantly harder for him to pedal; therefore, he was working much harder and getting extremely thirsty. Also, when he stopped at the old Welch’s Grape Juice Factory, he noticed some small pebbles on the ground and quickly shoved them in his mouth. “I’d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing the spit you have left to circulate”. Lastly, “GARY AND WILBER’S FISH CAMP”, could possibly have saved the cyclist’s life. He stopped there and finally got a well - deserved, cool drink of water to settle his dehydration and ease his fear. The setting and its features severely affected the cyclist throughout his arduous journey.
779	6758	3	3	In “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”, the features of the setting affect how the author feels. In the beginning of the essay, the author is confident and happy, and the setting is a peaceful reservoir campground outside at Lodi, California (Kurmaskie @NUM1). This serene and beautiful place sounds like an ideal spot to be refreshed and to feel confident. Later into the bike ride, the author is affected negatively by the desolate and barren area he comes to when he says, “This sight was troubling” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The emptiness and lack of resources in this area clearly took a toll on his mood. Finally when he reaches a modern store, he is relieved due to the modern facility when he states, “Then, as easily as rounding a bend, my troubles, thirst, and fear were all behind me” (Kurmaskie @NUM3). The various areas the author goes through have a significant effect on his emotions and overall experience.
780	6759	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because they don't ride as frequently as they used to and don't keep up - to - date with the best routes to take. So they just rely on their old routes, naively thinking they are still the better way. However, when they use these old routes, they quickly realize how tiring and poorly maintained they are. The changing features of the setting, such as new construction or road damage, make these old routes less suitable, and the cyclist suffers the consequences of their lack of updated knowledge.
781	6760	3	3	At some point, tumbleweeds unexpectedly crossed my path. Being out in the vast, arid desert with limited or no water can truly make one feel like life is very cruel. The scorching sun was beating down mercilessly, and when he reached a certain point, no water or shade was in sight. The sign that said “Rough @CAPS1 ahead; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” must have been quite intimidating. Considering he was on a bike, he could only move at a relatively slow pace. Those old men probably hadn't stepped off their front porch since Carter was in office. Yes, like the writer said, “the world is a fluid place. Things change.” The old men probably had little clue about what they were talking about considering things have changed since @NUM1 (when Carter was in office). The snake that he came upon, slithering menacingly across the road, must have been rather intimidating. Knowing there is a creature like that, there is bound to be more. In essence, I think the setting was a major part of the reason why the cyclist felt so desperate and challenged.
782	6761	3	3	From what can be seen in this picture, the cyclist is riding through a dry and desolate area, which could mean that it is extremely hot. The cyclist looks to be going down a winding hill with a lot of sharp turns. From the tense body position of the cyclist, it's evident that he seems to be trying his absolute best and working incredibly hard to make it to his destination. All of this could be a huge source of stress on the cyclist. He may be sweating profusely and feeling extremely tired. The strong wind in @MONTH1 might not be helping him at all, perhaps pushing against him and making his progress even more difficult. In the end, this challenging situation clearly shows the tough conditions the cyclist has to endure on his journey.
783	6762	3	3	In the short story “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Speed Limit” by @PERSON1, a determined cyclist travels through an extreme climate and tough terrain that nearly ends his life to get to his destination. After getting outdated directions from some elderly locals sitting lazily on their porch, the protagonist sets off on his long - awaited journey to Yosemite National Park. Soon thereafter, the cyclist notices something is amiss. The first “town” the locals said he’d find is completely deserted, with not a soul in sight. And now, twenty miles into his journey under the blazing sun, the cyclist desperately needs to refill some of his water supply. The water pump there has “the flavor of battery acid,” making it almost undrinkable. With the next town @NUM1 miles away, the cyclist struggles to carefully conserve his water to make it there. Even then, things get worse. As he is, “traveling through the high deserts of California in June,” “flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.” @CAPS1 sternly tell him not to exceed the speed limit of @NUM2 as he does a “water - depleting @NUM3.” Eventually, even on his few sips of water, the cyclist finally finds a spot to fill up on water, learning the hard way to strike out on better days and get better directions in the future.
784	6763	3	3	The features of the setting significantly affected the cyclist. When she was riding, the sweltering heat was almost unbearable. This intense heat caused the cyclist to rapidly lose energy and start to dehydrate. Also, when the cyclist went through a terrain change, the road smoothly changed into rolling hills. This constant up - and - down motion caused the cyclist to become extremely tired because after riding up and down those hills, your body gets exhausted. Also, being as the weather was so hot, this made the cyclist drink a large amount of water to stay hydrated. Eventually, she ran out of water and then got severely dehydrated. This whole difficult situation implies the importance of sticking to your original plan. If the cyclist would have done that, she wouldn't have had to go through all these hardships and could have had a much smoother journey.
785	6764	3	3	Each new feature of the setting in the essay entitled, “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” by Joe Kurmaskie, affects the cyclist in some way. For example, in the text, when the narrator stated that he had to quickly avoid a “ridiculously large snake” slowly crossing the road, he became more acutely aware of his surroundings. He was on high alert, and almost seemed to forget how thirsty he was until he finally passed by the large, menacing reptile. Also in the text, when, “over one long, crippling hill, a building came into view,” a glimmer of hope was replenished into the cyclist. This hope gave the narrator the extra motivation to become more tenacious about his journey in order to arrive at the old building. Whether for better or worse, a few features of the setting appear and affect the cyclist at every step of his arduous journey, constantly testing his will and endurance.
786	6765	3	3	Many features of the setting of the cyclist’s excruciating trip affect him mentally and physically. When he first sets out, the tall pine trees and clear rivers kept him cheerfully riding through the beautiful landscape. When he sees the dilapidated corral and the rusty pumps, he becomes discouraged and begins to notice his tiredness and thirst. When the cyclist encounters a rough terrain filled with tumble weeds and slithering snakes, he is both mentally and physically exhausted. He begins to doubt his consciousness and worries that he may not complete the journey. The abandoned grape juice factory is also a let - down for the cyclist’s mental state. When all hope is seemingly lost, he finally comes across a small stream of water, and his unique (but very important) lesson about perseverance in the face of harsh settings is learned.
787	6766	3	3	The features of the setting had a significant affect on the cyclist. I know this because in the story the cyclist said that he was “going to drop from heat exhaustion”, clearly showing the toll the environment took on him. He is riding through the scorching desert in @DATE1, where the sun beats down relentlessly. He took directions from three old “gentlemen” sitting on a porch, and these directions likely influenced his journey in unforeseen ways. Overall, it's evident that the setting's features were a major factor in the cyclist's experience.
788	6767	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist. First, since he was in a vast desert, the intense heat of the desert greatly dehydrated him on his long - journey to the parts. Also, the bumpy roads and steep rolling hills slowed the bike down to 12 mph since it was too extreme for him to handle at high speeds. When he sees the first building, he is initially relieved but soon after he loses all his hope because it is completely deserted. Even the old men that live in the area have an affect on the cyclist because they give him out - dated directions that almost stranded him. Because of this, he will probably rest first in an old man’s short tents again. This is how the various features of the setting affected the cyclist.
789	6768	3	3	Well first off, it's very hot and dry, with the scorching sun beating down, which can dry a person out easily. And the steep hills are hard to get up as the incline makes pedaling a real struggle, so it would be a challenge to get to the top. All I know is the lack of water can kill you if you get heatstrokes easily, as the body quickly loses vital fluids in such a harsh environment. In such conditions, one must be extremely cautious to survive.
790	6769	3	3	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affect the cyclist. At first, the cyclist thought that the journey he was about to go on was going to be a good one, imagining smooth roads and pleasant scenery. But that soon changes. For example, “Never accept travel advice from a collection of old - timers who haven’t left the confines of their porched since Carter was in office.” This quote tells how at first the cyclist thought his journey was going to be a good one, but getting information from two old men sitting lazily on their porch soon changed that. The features of the setting, like the unknown roads and the advice from the old men, affect the cyclist in the essay “Rough Road ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”, highlighting the importance of being wary of the environment and the advice one receives during a journey.
791	6770	3	3	The features of setting affect the cyclist in that the scorching desert - like temperature, similar to that of a real desert, and the challenging terrain on which he must bike make him more prone to thirst and exhaustion. The intense heat in @MONTH1 causes the cyclist to dehydrate faster than normal. This is especially true in this case because of his limited supply of water. With each passing moment under the blazing sun, the cyclist's body loses precious moisture rapidly. The cyclist might pass out or suffer a heat stroke. The terrain of rolling hills will tire out the cyclist quicker than if he were still on the flat road. As he pedals up and down the hills, his muscles start to ache and his body desperately needs water and rest. The story would totally change if the setting were different. If the cyclist were biking in the @DATE1 on a cold day in the mid @NUM1, he would not have a chance of suffering a heatstroke. There would be a significantly less chance of him becoming dehydrated. The setting is very important in every story and can change everything, as it directly impacts the experiences and well - being of the characters.
792	6771	3	3	In Joe Kurmaskieís essay ìRough Road Ahead,î the speaker is biking through some extremely rough terrain in blistering heat, not to mention covering long distances. He has to laboriously ride up and down small and large hills through what he believes is a shortcut to his destination. This supposed shortcut turns out to be a grueling path. He has a limited water supply, and he keeps coming across ghost towns. In these desolate places, the only water available is boiling brackish water that is unfit for human consumption. Probably the worst setting feature for this guy is the Welchís Grape Juice Factory (abandoned of course). Adding salt to the wound was ìA sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seenî (kurmaskie @NUM1). To the narrator with his dwindling water supply, this billboard was especially daunting to him on his arduous journey, constantly taunting him with the image of something he so desperately craved.
793	6772	3	3	Desert, Hills and road condition and lack of water – all are how the setting affected the cyclist. First, the cyclist reveals he is in the desert when he exclaims, ìI was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.î This means it was swelteringly hot, with the sun beating down mercilessly. Second, the hills and road conditions were horrible. The cyclist reveals this when he describes, ìflat road was replaced by short rolling hills,î and again, it read: Rough road ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit. The uneven and hilly road made his cycling extremely difficult. Lastly, he had thought that he would have stops on the way to get water from. So he drank at the rate he wanted without a second thought. He then figured out he needed to conserve it, but by then it was too late as his water supply was already depleted. The examples show that the cyclist's conditions were harder than he expected them to be, highlighting the significant impact of the setting on his journey.
794	6773	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. The winding road, with its sharp and unexpected bends, could affect his turns because he could turn too far one way and fall off his bike and get hurt real bad. As he approaches each curve, he has to be extra cautious to maintain his balance. Another feature that could affect the cyclist is the thick grass on both sides of the road. If he tries to take a short - cut and ventures into the grass, he could hit a hidden rock and flip off his bike and get hurt. The grass may seem like an easy alternative, but it conceals many potential hazards. That is how the features of the setting could have a detrimental impact on the cyclist, making his ride a risky endeavor.
795	6774	3	3	The setting of where the cyclist was, was a California desert in the middle of June. The sweltering heat of the desert sun beats down on him relentlessly. He thinks he's going to die towards the end because of the directions he got. ìNever accept travel advice from a collection of old timers who havenít left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office.î This means to never take directions from people who havenít been to the place for a while. Relying on such outdated advice in a harsh desert environment can lead to life - threatening situations. The cyclist's experience serves as a cautionary tale about the importance of getting accurate and up - to - date information when traveling in challenging settings.
796	6775	3	3	The setting was a sweltering hot desert in California where a biker got stuck while en route to Yosemite National Park. These harsh settings took a heavy toll on the cyclist. For example, he naively listened to some old people who led him astray and could have put his life at risk. He was rapidly running out of water and his legs felt as if they were about to break off. All of these troubles did indeed affect his trust in the old locals. He learned that just because they are old and seem wise, the information they possess is probably older than the artifacts at a museum. Besides, he has a trust map: He gained a great deal from this arduous trip, realizing the importance of self - reliance and caution.
797	6776	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in numerous ways. For instance, in the so - called “ghost towns,” there is absolutely no one around to ask for directions or even have a simple chat with. Also, some of the water pumped from the water pumps has a taste as foul as “battery acid” and could most likely make someone extremely sick. Moreover, there are not only poisonous snakes but also other dangerous animals like wild coyotes lurking in the area. All these aspects of the setting make the cyclist's journey extremely challenging and hazardous.
798	6777	3	3	There are many features in the story that affect the roles, such as running out of water and getting bad directions. The narrator describes the situation and says, “the water bottles contain a few tantalizing sips.” This clearly indicates that there is hardly any water left, yet he still has to persevere and keep going until he can find some. In the story, water is a major obstacle he has to overcome because by the time he arrives at the fish store, he is completely out of it. This lack of water not only affects his physical state but also his mental resolve as he struggles to continue his journey.
799	6778	3	3	In this assignment, I will explain how the features of the setting affected the cyclist. In the short story “Rough Road Ahead Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the whole ordeal takes place in the “high deserts of California.” According to the text, the cyclist had relied on “out - of - date” directions from elderly people who thought they knew the way. The cyclist encountered a venomous snake, a desolate ghost town, and a shutdown factory. Most of the time, the cyclist was facing difficult and unexpected challenges due to the setting, which significantly impacted his journey.
800	6779	3	3	The setting in “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” adds significant drama into the story by how it affects the cyclist. He was traveling through the “high desert of California in June.” June is one of the hottest parts of the year, and since he was in the hottest desert region, the heat was almost unbearable. The terrain changing into “short rolling hills” didn't offer any relief to the cyclist. The hills made the riding far more difficult. Anyone who rides a bicycle is well - aware that it takes much more effort to pedal up a hill than on a flat pavement. With the cyclist's lack of water, he was truly struggling to keep going. Most people might not have had the determination to keep moving. He didn't set a specific long - term goal; he simply aimed for the “next Horizon.” He just wanted to keep going despite all the odds. Another problem with the physical environment was the poor road conditions. When the “Rough Road Affect” sign appeared, the journey then became even more arduous. A bike tire requires far more effort to roll over uneven pavement, which is precisely why the cyclist had so much trouble. All these factors combined made his journey a test of his endurance and willpower.
801	6780	3	3	In the story “Do not exceed posted speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the desolate setting affected the cyclist in a harsh way. With only a few sips of water left in his nearly empty bottle, he said, “... abandoned years earlier, by the looks of it it had been a @CAPS1 Grape Juice factory and bottling plant. A sand - blasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be faintly seen. I hung my head.” When one is parched with only a few drops of water and sees such an enticing image, it would surely increase the thirst more. Another way the setting affected the cyclist was when he noted, “The speed limit was 55 mph. I was doing a water - depleting 12 mph. Sometimes life can feel so cruel.” This made him acutely aware that he was not in a car, and he wasn't even going half the speed limit. The setting affects the cyclist by constantly reminding him of the long and arduous journey ahead, and at this point, he is clearly suffering. The combination of the abandoned factory and the slow progress is taking a toll on his physical and mental state.
802	6781	3	3	In the essay, “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the setting the cyclist is in affects him greatly. One evening while he was taking a well - deserved rest, he got into a deep conversation with a couple of elderly men. As the conversation flowed, they eventually got to talking about his long - distance journey. The two men, with their local knowledge, kindly gave him directions for a shortcut, hoping to make his trip easier. “But on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.” When he arrived at the first town, he found it completely deserted. This had a significant impact on the cyclist because he would eventually need to replenish his water supply. As he continued his ride, he came to a slope in the road. “After I had braked for the first few of these, a large highway sign suddenly jumped out at me. It read: ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT.” This sign was a clear indication that the road was going to be bumpy, which made the journey even more challenging for the cyclist. So, the setting is very important in this essay because it has a lot to do with how the cyclist feels. When he encounters the abandoned towns, it's easy for him to start feeling hopeless. When the road gets bumpy, he quickly gets tired. When he finally reaches an actual running store, he feels a wave of relief wash over him, showing just how much the setting influences his emotional state.
803	6782	3	3	The feature of the setting affects the cyclist because the feature serves as just a brief preview of what the text is going to be about or who is involved in it. The cyclist presents the necessary information clearly, so the effect of the setting becomes evident. Once the feature has run its course, no one would want to see the cyclist continue in such a difficult situation. The setting's features set the tone and give an early indication of the challenges the cyclist will face, and as they unfold, it becomes clear that the cyclist is in for a tough ride. In the end, the setting's features play a crucial role in shaping the overall experience of the cyclist's journey.
804	6783	3	3	"In the story, ""Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting have a profound impact on the cyclist. The setting of a story encompasses the background, the place, and the time when the story took place. In this story, a determined cyclist needs to reach @CAPS1 Park. Along the way, he stops and has a conversation with a group of old men. These men, perhaps a bit out of touch with modern mapping, give him directions. He follows their advice but soon realizes the consequences. “At some point, tumbleweeds lazily crossed my path, and a ridiculously large snake – it really did look like a diamondback – blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me. I carefully and nervously eased past it.” The desolate desert setting, with its lack of water sources, the presence of dangerous wildlife like the snake, and the confusing directions from the old men all contribute to the cyclist's difficult journey. The setting not only presents physical challenges but also adds to the cyclist's mental stress as he tries to navigate his way to his destination."
805	6784	3	3	The cyclist chose the worst possible time to embark on his ride. It was an “early summer evening” in California. At this time of the day and in this location, the sun beats down mercilessly, making the heat almost unbearable. With little water in his supply and being lost in an unfamiliar area, it was far from the best choice he could have made. Before setting out on a long - distance cycling trip, a cyclist should be well - prepared for the weather conditions. This includes checking the weather forecast, bringing an adequate supply of water, and wearing appropriate clothing. Additionally, they should carefully check a map of the place before going anywhere to avoid getting lost. By not taking these precautions, the cyclist has put himself in a difficult and potentially dangerous situation. In conclusion, proper preparation is key for any cyclist to have a safe and enjoyable journey.
806	6785	3	3	The cyclist ran into a diamond - headed snake. He was out of water and stuck in the middle of nowhere. In such a desperate situation, the thing I would do is find some rope or cord from an old building or a nearby tree and hang myself for taking directions from old people that haven't left their porches since Carter was in office. It's clear that blindly following their advice led to this miserable predicament.
807	6786	3	3	The features of this particular setting affected the cyclist in many different ways. Upon arriving at the “ghost town” early in his journey, he felt a slight sense of amusement at the desolate and rather peculiar situation. But he soon became very troubled when he became aware of the several rusty pumps, which looked like they hadn't worked in ages, and a weak corral, next to a ramshackle shed that seemed on the verge of collapse. The cyclist additionally experienced a bit of irony as he approached the 55 mph speed limit sign complete with a stern warning to strictly obey it. On his bicycle, moving at a slow pace of 12 mph, he could not even reach the 55 mph speed if he had wanted to. Before he reached what appeared to be an abandoned Welch's Grape Juice factory, the cyclist felt this twisted amusement yet again, as he let out a short laugh. The text states, “It was a sad hopeless laugh, mind you, but at least I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself.” Fortunately, his suffering was through when he discovered a “fish camp,” with a modern bathroom and working sinks. The cyclist's relief was so immense that he “had an overwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber (the owners), (and) kiss them.” This shows how much the harsh setting had taken a toll on him.
808	6787	3	3	The setting of this story takes place with a man biking and then taking advice from old - timers to a faster route. The biker knew from the start that he should not have given away his map. But thinking that the old folks, who seemed so confident, knew the route well, he took their advice. What the biker should have done was look for someone reliable to ask and make sure the route would actually work. But jumping to where he wanted to go without proper verification led him to dehydration and much more struggle than was needed. You should always think things out before you take action, just to be safe. Rushing into decisions based on others' advice without due diligence can lead to avoidable hardships.
809	6788	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he first didn't know where he was going and took directions from people that he wasn't really sure about. It was swelteringly hot, and he was quickly running out of water. He had no idea where he was, and to make matters worse, there were snakes slithering around. His water was running out fast, and there were no signs to guide him. He kept berating himself, thinking that he would never take directions from old guys again and that he would stick to the future, relying on more reliable sources of information. This shows how the harsh setting and his hasty decision - making combined to put him in a difficult situation.
810	6789	3	3	At first when he gets the directions from the old men, he thinks he will be fine. He is full of confidence, believing that they know the way well. When he gets to the first town, he's tired and almost out of water, but still, in his mind, he thinks he will be in Yosemite soon. When he gets to the water pump in the middle of the desert, he's extremely tired and desperately thirsty. At this point, he realizes that the directions the old men gave him were out of date. He's really not happy about listening to them and not following his map. When he gets to the fishing place, he is grateful for the water in the sink and for the chance to rest. And when the old man offers to give directions to Yosemite, he thinks he will just use his map. Throughout the story, the cyclist's needs change from feeling confident at the start, to feeling depressed when he realizes his mistake, to feeling relieved when he finds a place to rest and get water. This transformation in his state of mind clearly shows the impact of his experiences on his decision - making process.
811	6790	3	3	In the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”, the setting seemed to have a profound impact on the main character, the cyclist, during his arduous pedal. For instance, the vast and dry desert setting made him wrongly assume that he could survive without an adequate supply of water. As a result, he soon became severely dehydrated. The first town he came across, where the water was at @NUM1 degrees, simply could not meet his standards for proper hydration. The old velches June factory he passed by was in a dilapidated state, completely run - down and out of business. It was much like the surrounding desert, just old, barren, and unusable land. While the cyclist managed to survive the pedal, the unforgiving desert setting posed a great challenge for him, testing his physical and mental limits to the extreme.
812	6791	3	3	There are numerous features of the setting that significantly affect the cyclist. One prominent feature is the steadily rising temperature. As it gets hotter and hotter, it will inevitably take a toll on him. The line “I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn’t a mirage.” clearly indicates that the intense heat might already be starting to have an impact on his perception and physical state. Another crucial feature is his location in the desert and the dwindling supply of water. The line “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly” shows that he is consuming a large amount of water, which is a clear sign that he is running low. Moreover, he is riding in the high deserts of California in June. The story specifically mentions “and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” Not only is June typically a hot month, but being in a desert environment further exacerbates the heat. There is no doubt that under these circumstances, he will get dehydrated. These are some of the many features that have a detrimental effect on the cyclist, making his journey extremely challenging.
813	6792	3	3	The setting has a significant impact on the cyclist as it creates a desolate and deserted atmosphere, which effectively helps set the mood of the essay. The mood of the essay, in my opinion, is reminiscent of a sweltering dry summer day, the kind where one would exclaim “oh my gosh, it’s really hot!” The setting is a dry summer day in June, with a deserted town, tumbleweeds rolling by, all contributing to a sense of hopelessness. Although the cyclist was fortunate enough to be safe and didn’t die, based on the lack of water, the scorching hot sun beating down on him, and the long distance he had to cover while enduring these harsh conditions, it seemed as if he would surely not make it. So, the setting affects the cyclist in a way that could have potentially led to his demise, highlighting the power of the environment on his journey.
814	6793	3	3	The features of the setting have a notable effect on the cyclist because the old guys he met had informed him that the next town was only eighteen miles down the road. This information, combined with the harsh realities of the setting, made the journey described in the story “Do not exceed Posted Speed Limit” extremely dangerous and unsafe for people to ride on. The unforgiving terrain, the intense heat, and the long - distance with limited resources all contributed to the hazardous nature of the cyclist's path. In such a setting, riders are constantly at risk of dehydration, exhaustion, and other life - threatening situations. Therefore, the features of the setting play a crucial role in determining the safety and outcome of the cyclist's journey.
815	6794	3	3	The setting had a substantial impact on the cyclist. The terrain was bumpy and riddled with a lot of hills, which meant that he had to exert far more physical effort to keep moving forward. Additionally, the blistering heat was taking a heavy toll on him, causing him to become dehydrated. In the story, after the cyclist had been riding for a long time, it says “I eased past trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state” (kurmaskie @NUM1). This clearly shows the dire situation he was in. With very little water for his long trip, he was constantly at risk of further dehydration and physical collapse. The combination of the difficult terrain and the heat - induced dehydration made his cycling journey an extremely challenging and potentially life - threatening endeavor.
816	6795	3	3	The way the features of the setting affect the cyclist I think is disregardment. First of all, a reason would be because at the beginning of the story when the warning sign is passed, the cyclist disregards it by going down the hill anyways, showing a lack of concern for the potential risks. Also, it states that “I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.” This indicates that the cyclist was overconfident and not taking the setting's features seriously. Overall, the cyclist's disregard of the setting's warnings and overconfidence likely set the stage for potential issues later in the journey.
817	6796	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he went through many ups and downs. At one point, he flowed by blackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees. The intense heat was unbearable, and the weather wouldn't cool down. This extreme heat and the challenging terrain took a toll on the cyclist, making his journey even more difficult. In the end, the harsh setting clearly had a significant impact on the cyclist's experience.
818	6797	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because they caused him to need water. He was worn out because the setting was so intense. “Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” This quote from the text shows that the cyclist's terrain was changing and these changes affected him. The hilly terrain required more effort to pedal, which made him sweat and increased his need for water. As a result, the features of the setting made the cyclist's ride more physically demanding.
819	6798	3	3	The features of the surrounding landscape affect the cyclist both physically and mentally. First, the sun constantly beating down on the cyclist causes his or her body to sweat more, which makes one's body use more energy. The sun rays also add to the heat the cyclist feels, making the ride even more uncomfortable. Also, the rough road forces the cyclist to pedal very hard, which drains him or her of even more energy. For example, when the cyclist in “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” reached the rough roads, he had to pedal harder, which made him sweat more, and caused his amount of energy to decrease. Finally, the lack of civilization can make a cyclist feel hopeless, which is how the cyclist in the essay felt when he had no water or could see no nearby town. This can affect the cyclist's will to keep pedaling, and if they have no determination, the cyclist will not go anywhere. In conclusion, the features of the setting can physically exhaust and mentally strain the cyclist, which makes it harder for him or her to keep going on the journey.
820	6799	3	3	Snake, heat, hills - all are what the biker had to deal with because of certain settings. He had to deal with a diamondback snake, which posed a real danger to his safety. He was going through the desert so it was like @NUM1 degrees, an extremely high temperature that sapped his energy. While he was biking, he had to go up crippling hills, which required a great deal of physical effort. All these challenges made his bike ride extremely difficult. In the end, the harsh settings presented multiple obstacles that the biker had to overcome.
821	6800	3	3	The setting acts as a catalyst in this story. It is the aspect of the story that is constantly challenging the character right until the very end. In the story, it states, “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” This clearly shows that the terrain is opposing him, making his journey more arduous. Also, in the story, it says, “The speed limit was 55. I was doing a water - depleted 12 mph. Sometimes life can be so cool.” This not only shows how much the elements are overpowering him but also reveals his resilience and how satirical life can be. The ultimate irony in this story is when he stumbles across the Welch's grape juice factory and there was a picture of a boy “pouring a refreshing glass of juice in his mouth.” No matter where the cyclist goes, he is always trying to overcome the elements, and the setting continues to test his mettle throughout the story.
822	6801	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many significant ways. For example, the lack of water begins to take a heavy toll on how fast he can reach the next town. As he pedals on, his body craves for water, and his energy levels start to decline. Another example would be the terrain, which is uneven and full of obstacles, only slowing him down more. The combination of these factors makes the cyclist's journey extremely challenging, and it is evident that the setting has a major impact on his ability to progress smoothly.
823	6802	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by making him use up the last of his water because it's swelteringly hot, and then there's no one around because he's out in the deserts of California. “I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn't a mirage…” (@NUM1.). This excerpt from the text strongly supports my previous statement about how it's hot because the speaker tells us how he's sweating profusely and that he might be seeing a mirage, which is a clear sign of the extreme heat. “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or any structure of any kind” (@NUM2.). This shows that there is no one around to help him if he falls down from a heat stroke or anything like that. So, the setting is severely affecting the cyclist's endurance, putting his life at risk in this desolate environment.
824	6803	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by making it much more difficult to ride. “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” This sudden change in terrain requires the cyclist to exert more energy. “I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June.” The intense heat makes the ride unbearable. “A large highway sign jumped out at me.” The sign might have added to his stress. “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed limit.” The rough road further hampers his progress. “Sometimes life can feel so cruel.” The cyclist's frustration is palpable. The fact that it was such a hot day made the ride seem even longer. When out of water, you feel extremely exhausted. You will do just about anything to try to withstand the heat, but the setting continues to make the cyclist's journey a struggle.
825	6804	3	3	Author Joe Kurmaskie learns the dangers of a lifeless wilderness during his experience described in “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” As a cyclist riding in one of the most undeveloped areas in California, the lack of water found in this setting proves extremely crippling to his survival. The trails he was directed to had no towns or sources of fresh, drinkable water for days. The combination of constant exercise while riding through the rugged terrain, lack of water and resources, the scorching California summer weather, and the lack of civilization drains the author's energy and causes him to suffer from dehydration. Too much exposure to these harsh conditions could have easily killed him. The modern time - period and year also caused the directions the author was given to be inaccurate, and, thus, causing the cyclist to find himself in such a dangerous area of the country. The setting of “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” places the cyclist in a life - threatening situation, highlighting the perils of venturing into such unforgiving landscapes without proper preparation.
826	6805	3	3	The features of a setting could encompass a wide range of different elements. It could be snowing and extremely cold, with the snowflakes gently falling and blanketing the ground, or raining and of course wet, with the raindrops pelting down steadily. It might be hot and dry, with the scorching sun beating down relentlessly, or breezy and humid, where the gentle breeze carries a hint of moisture. The features could be a busy thoroughfare filled with cars and people bustling about or a solitary country road that winds through peaceful landscapes. There could be rough terrain with uneven ground and rocks, or long straight - aways that seem to stretch into the horizon. The setting of a place exerts pressure on the reality of what will happen to a cyclist. In the essay, a young cyclist takes advice from some elderly man and ends up riding through the searing hot sun and desolate ghost towns, not knowing if he would survive. The intense heat had him feeling as though death were creeping closer with every pedal stroke, and the overwhelming thirst had him becoming more determined to reach the next town so he could stay alive. If the features of the setting had been different, say he was riding on a flat road in a busy town with a pleasant breeze and places to stop for water everywhere, he would not have feared for his life. The features of the setting significantly affect how the cyclist feels and thinks. He can feel angry due to the difficult conditions, happy when he encounters a favorable stretch, sad because of the desolation, or scared of the unknown. He can even start to think about his own death. These, I believe, are some of the effects settings have on cyclists, clearly demonstrating the powerful influence of the environment on a cyclist's experience.
827	6806	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example, when the author says “flat roads were replaced by short rolling hills”, this change in terrain made the author have to ride more safely. The unevenness of the hills required him to adjust his speed and balance carefully to avoid any mishaps. Also, when he says, “the ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the pavement”, it presented a real obstacle. The author had to slow down on his bike, carefully assess the situation, and find a safe way around it so he could get past without disturbing the snake or getting into danger. Finally, when the author says “no one in sight, no building, car, or structure”, he is affected because he is lost and thirsty. Without any people or facilities around, he can't ask questions or find a place to get water. The setting makes it hard for the author to maneuver and get to where he wants to go, highlighting how the environment can pose significant challenges to a cyclist.
828	6807	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the person who rode the bike was very tired. After riding on his bike for @NUM1 miles, his legs were aching and his body was in desperate need of a rest. Every pedal stroke was a struggle as his muscles were fatigued from the long - distance ride. Also, it affected the cyclist because of all the riding he had to do, struggling to get where he was trying to get. The terrain might have been hilly or the wind might have been against him, making the journey even more arduous. But he was a strong man and he was willing to finish his forty miles of pedaling. Despite being restless and uncomfortable, he persevered. In the end, his determination allowed him to overcome the challenges posed by the setting, showing that while the environment can be tough on a cyclist, a strong will can make a difference.
829	6808	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” because it goes through many different terrains. The cyclist starts at a town, a place full of life and activity, and he is working his way to Yosemite when he decides to listen to a group of old men. He starts out strong, with a spring in his step and a sense of excitement for the journey ahead. However, when he gets to the first town, which is totally abandoned, the silence and desolation start to set in. The empty streets and dilapidated buildings give an eerie feeling. He keeps going to another abandoned town, and the sense of isolation grows. He decides to keep going until he sees a sign. The terrain is a lot different now, with rolling hills that make pedaling more difficult and tumbleweed rolling by, adding to the desolate atmosphere. And then there's a snake on the road, which makes him stop and be cautious. Through listening to the old men, the cyclist almost died from the threatening heat and lack of water. The setting affected the cyclist even more seriously than he could have imagined, clearly showing how the environment can turn a journey into a life - threatening ordeal.
830	6809	3	3	In the story, the setting greatly affects the attitude of the cyclist. When he starts out, it is an early summer evening, and the warm glow of the setting sun creates a peaceful atmosphere. He is serene while he is talking to the old men, enjoying the friendly conversation. He starts cycling the next morning, and as he pedals along, he is thinking of Yosemite, his destination. He is relaxed and confident, looking forward to the adventure. However, his attitude about the day changes greatly when he comes across the rickety old shed, rusty pumps, and a corral at the park in the road. The dilapidated state of these structures makes him a little worried, but he is not discouraged yet. When the terrain changes from flat to hilly, he has to work harder to pedal, and he is a little discouraged. Then, when he comes across the abandoned factory, with its broken windows and overgrown weeds, he is most definitely a lot discouraged. A little later he comes across @PERSON1’s Fish camp. The sight of the camp, with its warm lights and friendly faces, makes him very relieved and thankful to the owners. The cyclist’s attitude changed depending upon whether the setting was very beneficial to him or not, clearly demonstrating the strong link between the environment and a cyclist's emotional state.
831	6810	3	3	The features of the setting have a great impact on the desperate travels of the weary cyclist. The scenery he passes, which is sometimes disappointing and sometimes uplifting, affects him physically and emotionally. When he passes a portion of the road with nothing but a “ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral…”, he becomes disturbed. The cyclist is running low on water, and he becomes even more distraught at a road with a speed limit posted as 55 mph when he was, “doing a water - deleting @NUM1.” The intense heat of the hot, June sun beating down on him affects the cyclist and puts him in a state of dehydration. In an, “ironic twist”, the cyclist is affected emotionally when he passes a @ORGANIZATION1 factory that has been abandoned. The factory features a picture of a boy pouring a glass of juice into his mouth, which upsets the already thirsty cyclist. This combination of the harsh setting elements continues to make his journey a difficult and distressing one.
832	6811	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist more than anything in the reading of “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted speeding Limit.” In the beginning, when the cyclist had just begun his cycling journey, he uses a positive tone to describe the setting. For example, in paragraph four he says “the cool pines and running rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them.” When he says this, the reader can vividly imagine someone in an excited state, eagerly looking forward to reaching his destination on a dry day. As the cyclist's attitude becomes lower, the reader can make the connection that it is because of the setting. In paragraph thirteen, when the cyclist says, “I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn't a mirage and that not to get too excited”, the reader can clearly sense that it is getting quite serious for the cyclist to continue as is. Overall, as the setting changes to a “burning sun” and extremely hot conditions, with a shortage of water, the cyclist becomes more sarcastic and less upbeat. For example, when talking about the rocks in his mouth, he states “with only luck I'd hit a bump and lodge one in my throat.” This clearly shows a bad mood affected by the features of the setting, highlighting the strong influence of the environment on the cyclist's state of mind.
833	6812	3	3	The rougher the road gets for him, the more determination he has at the beginning. However, towards the end, he had the mindset that, “it didn't matter, it was going to die.” This negative thought took a toll on him, and it was extremely hard for him to go on. He then realized that he didn't want to die that way, so he summoned the remaining strength within him and kept on going. Eventually, his perseverance led him to civilization. His journey shows that even in the face of extreme adversity, the will to survive and the decision to keep pushing forward can lead to a better outcome.
834	6813	3	3	The features of the setting affect the biker a lot because the rough terrain is described, which implies that the biker probably had a hard time. Half - way through the story, he said, “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” He said this to specifically describe the difficulty in this race. The change in terrain not only makes the biker work harder but also makes the race seem exciting because it changes things around. It wouldn't be exciting if they simply said that flat roads turned into even flatter roads, or if they didn't show the terrain change at all. The dynamic nature of the setting adds an element of challenge and thrill to the biker's experience, making the race more memorable and engaging.
835	6814	3	3	“Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.”, an essay written by Joe Kurmaskie, is about a solo cyclist going on a journey to Yosemite National Park. He listens to a group of old guys and unfortunately ends up lost on a rough road. He has no water or a reliable supply, and the flat road he was on was replaced by short rolling hills. Large highways loomed ahead, and a sign jumped out at him. It read: “ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT.” The rough road forced the cyclist to work harder, made him want more water, and just made things tougher than what they already were. This difficult situation on the road continued to test his endurance and resolve throughout his journey.
836	6815	3	3	The settings of your environment always seem to have a notable impact on your mood. Take for instance the cyclist. In the beginning, he approached the journey with a positive and enthusiastic attitude. But once he arrived at the first town, his attitude started to decline steadily from there. He describes the town as perhaps having been a thriving spot at one point, “but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.” Ghost towns typically come across as very old, run - down, and dull. This desolate sight affected the cyclist deeply because, since it was not as the old men had described, he began to feel doubtful. This doubt, in turn, did not give him the same motivation as when he had started the journey. Then, when he expected to find water and instead “a tar - like substance oozed out,” it made him nervous and angry because he was unsure if he would make it to his destination. However, his attitude changes as soon as he sees the store. The setting becomes more positive, and so does his mood. So, clearly, the setting does have a significant effect on the cyclist's mood and attitude, highlighting the strong connection between one's surroundings and emotional state.
837	6816	3	3	Many of the settings' features have a profound impact on the cyclist. One of the prominent features of the desert - like setting is the dry air and extremely hot temperatures. This intense heat made it extremely hard for the cyclist to keep going. In a moment of despair, the author says, “I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.” Another feature of the setting was the desolate towns that did not contain any water. This lack of water made his journey truly horrible as he struggled to continue on. The thirst was so excruciating that he had to put pebbles in his mouth. Sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing what little spit you have left to circulate. Yet another feature of the setting that affected the cyclist was the abandoned Welch’s Grape factory. This factory gave the cyclist false hope because, in his thirst - stricken state, it would have been so wonderful to have some grape juice. The narrator called the factory an “Ironic twist.” Overall, these various features of the setting combined to make the cyclist's journey a challenging and arduous one.
838	6817	3	3	The effects from the setting that have an impact on me are quite evident. While riding on the bike in hot weather with only a very small amount of water to drink, I would have given up if I had nothing left to drink. The water, having been exposed to the heat, was bound to be hot. In the text, it says “I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.” I don't think I could have lasted long if I was dehydrated. From the description, it seems that I would have dropped dead of heatstroke. The combination of the hot weather and limited water supply in the setting would have made the situation extremely difficult for me to endure, clearly demonstrating how the setting can have a detrimental effect on one's ability to continue an activity.
839	6818	3	3	Many features of the setting have a significant impact on the cyclist. For instance, in the story, “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the lack of water in the dry desert had a long - lasting and profound effect on the cyclist. “Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn't been off their porch in decades, caused me to laugh.” This passage shows the reader how all the heat and the shortage of water have made the cyclist feel extremely hot and dehydrated, to the point that she could pass out at any second. She is also thinking beyond the immediate discomfort, as she is laughing at herself and trying to conserve every bit of energy she possibly can. As a result, the effect from the setting on the cyclist is that the lack of water has not only presented challenges but has also given her a sense of humor and the courage to keep going, determined to reach her final destination point. This shows how the setting can both test and strengthen a person's resolve.
840	6819	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in numerous ways. The bumpy roads made his ride extremely uncomfortable, constantly jolting him as he pedaled. Sand kept getting into his eyes, causing irritation and making it difficult for him to see clearly. The thirst hit him hard, exacerbated by the too - hot and humid temperatures. Maybe he got so tired of pedaling that he had to get off the bike and walk for a while. When he got into town, a wild dog chased him, adding to his stress and fear. To make matters worse, he had no money to buy a drink. All these factors combined made the cyclist's journey a truly challenging one, clearly demonstrating how the setting can significantly impede a traveler's progress.
841	6820	3	3	The cyclist of this story is greatly affected by the intense heat of his surroundings. While he is riding to @CAPS1, the scorching heat of the day began to steadily increase. The text reads “I had been hitting my water bottle regularly.” Due to the blistering heat of the day, the cyclist was down to his last bit of water, consuming large gulps of it at a time. He struggled to keep going under the oppressive heat.
842	6821	3	3	When the cyclist vividly mentions how extremely hot, dry, and open the desolate terrain is, it makes me strongly feel like he is right in the heart of the desert. I also know that it’s swelteringly hot because he is profusely sweating and severely dehydrated, which clearly shows the harshness of the environment he is in.
843	6822	3	3	At first the cyclist feels perfectly fine, though he gets a little bit discouraged now and then, but basically he’s in good spirits. “The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them” (@CAPS1). He feels completely relaxed, because he is right at home with the clear water and the tall pine trees. They give him a strong sense of comfort and tranquility. He thinks that after the first “tree” not being that remarkable, the others will surely be better. He knows deep down that he has it in him to make it through, but he doesn’t know yet that he will have to travel a long, arduous way to get water. When he sees the sign, “It read: ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT.” he knows that things are going to get tough, because “the speed limit was 55 mph. I was doing a water - depleting 12 mph”. At that point he starts to get really worried, because he is out there more isolated, and he realizes that he doesn’t have enough water. As he runs out of water, the landscape, and his surroundings, start to get drier and more barren. He states, “tumble weeds crossed my path.” The landscape seems to get more menacing too, “a ridiculously large snake.” The landscape changes in tandem with the state of his water supply, highlighting his precarious situation.
844	6823	3	3	The setting affects the cyclist significantly because the blistering heat and the complete absence of humanity make him utterly crazy. If he was in a place like @LOCATION2, it would be just the heat issue because there are people everywhere in @LOCATION2, which would at least provide some sense of security. If he was in @LOCATION1 it would be the severe temperature drop along with no sign of humanity, and he would probably not be able to survive such harsh conditions.
845	6824	3	3	The features of the setting that the cyclist runs into do have a notable impact on him. For example, when the setting changes from an abandoned town to an empty, deserted road that hasn't been used in thirty years, it gives the cyclist far less motivation to push himself to go on and even saps his remaining strength, making his journey even more difficult.
846	6825	3	3	Joe Kurmaskieís “Rough Road ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” tells the tale of how a cyclist seeks directions from older men sitting on their porches. Unfortunately, these men don't correctly tell him the way to get to Yosemite. As a result, the cyclist ends up lost in the vast expanse with hardly any water left in his bottles. Features of the setting such as the unforgiving terrain and the blazing sun have a profound impact on the cyclist in the story. On that sweltering summer's day, the sun was extremely hot. Without water, it became even more difficult for him to keep moving forward as he was parched and overheated. @PERSON2 remarks, “The sun was beginning to beat down… I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The terrain was also bumpy and rough, making each pedal stroke a struggle. The combination of the sun and the terrain can greatly affect the cyclist when out on a hot summer day, testing his endurance and willpower.
847	6826	3	3	The features of the setting taunt the cyclist with cruel irony. As the cyclist continues down his solitary path, he passes through a desolate ghost town, its empty buildings standing as silent witnesses to the past. Then, twenty miles up the road, he spots a ramshackle shed and some rusty water pumps. Desperate as he is running out of water, he attempts to get water out. With all his might, he works the handle of the pump, but all he can get is muck. What little liquid comes out is what he described as “water feeling two - hundred degrees, it had the flavor of battery acid.” Further down the road, there's a sign that clearly says rough road ahead, and it instructs to adhere to the posted speed limit of 55. Meanwhile, he's only going 12 mph, struggling against the harsh conditions. Even worse, he finds an abandoned juice factory on the way. At that point, he is completely out of water, left to face the arduous journey ahead with a parched throat and dwindling hope.
848	6827	3	3	Do not Exceed posted speed limit. A valuable lesson is also to never accept travel advice from a collection of old timers who haven't left the confines of their porches since Carter was in the office. Twenty miles up the long and dusty road, I came to a confusing fork. Frustration welled up as I realized my predicament. I got down on my hands and knees, putting every ounce of my strength into working the handle of the rusted water pump. The water bottles I had were nearly empty, containing only a few total sips. The person I might have encountered on the way could have been a sad individual. Or perhaps he was just a bum loitering around in this desolate area. In such a situation, it's hard to tell who can be trusted and who might lead you further astray.
849	6828	3	3	The features of the setting could definitely affect this cyclist. In this particular case, it does have a significant impact on the cyclist. According to the text, “Sometimes life can feel so cruel.” This is a fitting example because the cyclist was well - aware that this road was going to be rough. Despite knowing this, he was only able to go at a speed of 12 mph due to the challenging conditions. The rough terrain and other elements of the setting made it difficult for him to pick up speed. So, it's evident that the features of the setting did indeed affect the cyclist, making his journey a difficult and arduous one.
850	6829	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist very much in this trying situation. The scorching hot weather made him constantly have a dry mouth, which quickly led to a critical lack of water. With no immediate source of water in sight, he resorted to an unusual method. He used stones in his mouth and said, “Iíd read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you have left to circulate.” He clung to this small piece of knowledge, using it as a survival technique to get through the ordeal. This shows how the harsh setting forced him to come up with creative ways to endure the lack of water and the oppressive heat.
851	6830	3	3	"The features affected the cyclist in many ways. One notable feature was the highway sign, ""ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT."" This sign served as a constant reminder of the challenging road conditions ahead. The terrain was now short, rolling hills, which would make it harder on the cyclist to pedal up the hills. Each ascent required a significant amount of effort and energy, as the cyclist had to battle against gravity. Also, there were roadblocks. At some point, tumbleweeds blocked the cyclist's path, and a ridiculously large snake slithered across the road. These roadblocks posed a danger to the biker, as he'd have to maneuver around them carefully. This not only caused him to lose time but also wasted precious energy, resulting in him drinking more water. No water is a great danger because it was June, a hot day, and he was at risk of getting dehydrated. There was also nobody around, so if he desperately needed water, he couldn't find any. In such a situation, the cyclist had to rely on his own resilience and determination to continue his journey."
852	6831	3	3	"After reading ""Do not Exceed Posted Limit,"" I have seen how the scene of an area can affect your mood and attitude around things. In this story, the main character is a cyclist who takes the advice of a few old men sitting in a poseh. They tell him a bad shortcut, which leads him into unexpected difficulties. As he is riding, he comes across some hills. Those hills really affected him physically. He gets tired from pedaling up and down continually. ""that mood"" was replaced by short, moving hills. The cyclist could not gauge the terrain accurately and tried everything to keep going. The hills did not show how long he would have to continue going up and down. There at one point, he says, ""@CAPS1 can feel so cruel."" There, he is upset because a road sign came up through the tough roads and told him not to exceed 55 miles per hour when he was only going 12 miles per hour. This can be viewed as metaphorical also. When you take a shortcut in life, there are always consequences. For example, if you decide to drop out of high school and go on with your journey, there is always the possibility of it not working out. You might end up crying with no diploma and struggling to get a job. In the end, this shows that taking shortcuts may not always lead to the desired outcome."
853	6832	3	3	"In the short story, ""Do Not exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" the setting affects the cyclist in the story significantly. For example, the dry hot air begins to slowly dehydrate him. As the heat intensifies, it causes the cyclist to lose all sense of reason, and the heat also plays tricks on his mind. He may start to hallucinate or make poor decisions due to the extreme conditions. Also, the rolling hills exhausted him from working hard to cycle up them. Each hill presented a new challenge, and the cyclist had to use a great deal of strength and endurance. This, combined with the heat factor, caused him to use up his much-needed water supply at a faster rate. The setting in this story deeply affects the cyclist, making his journey a difficult and arduous one. In such a harsh environment, the cyclist's ability to persevere is truly tested."
854	6833	3	3	Features from the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. The area he was in had a major impact. He was in Cali, which is a big desert. In the middle of the desert, it is extremely hot. The sun beats down relentlessly, and the dry air sucks the moisture out of his body. Bike riding on roads in the desert with no trees or shade of any sort is quite harsh. The lack of shade means that the cyclist is constantly exposed to the scorching heat, which can lead to heatstroke and dehydration. And to be riding around where there is not much civilization, so that you can't get water easily, is a major issue. Without a reliable water source, the cyclist's health and safety are at risk. In such a desolate environment, the cyclist has to be extremely cautious and resourceful to survive.
855	6834	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because there is a poisonous snake out there. It lurks in the grass or behind rocks, ready to strike at any moment. You are the only person riding down those hills all by yourself. The isolation adds to the cyclist's sense of vulnerability. The guy had said that the next town was @NUM1 miles from where he was at. This long distance means that the cyclist has to endure the harsh conditions for an extended period. The lack of water is a critical problem. There were not any streams or rivers around; he was just in a desert with nothing but sand and heat. Without water, the cyclist's body will start to shut down, and his chances of reaching the next town safely become slim. In this situation, the cyclist has to make every effort to conserve his energy and find a way to survive until he reaches civilization.
856	6835	3	3	The setting is mid - summer in the California desert. The sun beats down relentlessly, and the air is hot, humid, and extremely dry. There's hardly a cloud in the sky to offer relief. In his bag, there's a severe lack of water. He's on a solitary trip, making his way down the lost, rough, and rigorous roads, where every pedal stroke is a struggle.
857	6836	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because it was a sweltering hot June day in a desolate desert in California. For instance, you're out in the desert, cycling for many long hours under the scorching sun, and you only have a limited supply of water. This situation affects the author as you have to carefully conserve the water you have to be able to make it to the park. Another example is that you're constantly going up and down the rolling hills, and your legs get so very tired that they simply don't want to move any more. And the most obvious example is the sun is pounding down on you, and you're sweating profusely. You might even start seeing things, but all you desperately want to do is see something that has water. These are all things that affected the cyclist very much.
858	6837	3	3	The cyclist in the story is running into a lot of problems in this story. For example, the cyclist is out in the blistering summer heat in California, pedaling away on a bike. After several long minutes of this, your throat starts to feel parched, and you will become extremely thirsty. The cyclist brought some water, but after constant sweating due to the intense heat, the water supply has nearly run out. Not having enough water can cause a person to become dehydrated, which then can cause them to pass - out and possibly die. So as you can see, the cyclist is affected by the setting in the story. He has been affected negatively by the blistering heat and by the lack of water.
859	6838	3	3	There are many ways that the features of the setting affect the cyclist. For example, the cyclist was in a very hot and arid place. Meaning there was no water anywhere to be seen for miles around. Also, towns were nowhere to be found as it would be extremely hard to sustain life out there. This quote supports that there weren't many towns: ''About forty miles into the pedal I arrived at the first town.'' This clearly shows there aren't many towns in these parts. It was so hot and the cyclist was so thirsty as the text claims, ''I read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst.'' This clearly shows the man was very thirsty. Also, it was so hot out there that the man could see strange visions as the text states, ''As the looks often had been a grape juice factory and bottling plant.'' Why would there be a grape juice factory in the middle of nowhere? Therefore, these statements above show how settings can affect one's mind and physical conditions of the cyclist.
860	6839	3	3	The setting that affects the cyclist is the condition of the road because the road twists and turns in all different ways, and it goes steeply uphill. This makes it incredibly harder to pedal up the road. The cyclist has @NUM1 miles before he gets to a town, and he could easily run out of water. If he runs out of water before he gets there, he might have to make frequent stops so he doesn't make himself sick. When he finally gets to the town, he can replenish his water supply.
861	6840	3	3	"The features of the setting affected the cyclist by making him hot and thirsty for most of his way. As he pedaled steadily along the trail, he started to get tired slowly, and he grew more and more thirsty. He drank his water at first without thinking too much about it, but as he went on, he slowly found himself trying to conserve it carefully. By the time he got to the second wild town, he was so thirsty and exhausted that he thought it might have been a ""death"" scene. So he wiped the sweat from his eyes gently to make sure it wasn't a mirage. The only time people see mirages is when they are hot, tired, and desperate for some water. After his long journey to Yosemite National Park following the directions given by old men, this is exactly how the cyclist felt."
862	6841	3	3	The features of the setting include “There are no one in sights, not a building, car, or structure of any kind” which precisely describes the desolate trail the cyclist was taking. These stark features of the setting vividly describe how the cyclist is affected because it elaborates on his growing doubt about whether he will survive or not. In this empty expanse, with no signs of human presence, his sense of isolation and fear intensify, making his survival seem increasingly uncertain.
863	6842	3	3	Many features of the setting affect the cyclist in various ways. The speed - limit sign, standing there rigidly by the road, makes him feel like life is cruel as it seems to mock his slow progress. His first glimpse of the Welch's Juice factory, with its colorful signage and the sweet smell wafting in the air, makes him feel excited, a brief spark of joy in his long journey. Meeting the deserted fork in the road, with its overgrown paths and an air of mystery, makes him feel troubled as he has to make a crucial decision. When he finally arrives at his destination, he feels a wave of relief wash over him. These are all clear examples showing that features of the setting affected the cyclist throughout his journey.
864	6843	3	3	The many features of the setting greatly affect the cyclist and his performance. For example, the cyclist is riding through a very hot area of California. This is clearly stated at the end of paragraph @NUM1: “and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” The high deserts of California are extremely windy, filled with fine sand that gets into his gears, dry as a bone, and scorchingly hot. It's not an ideal terrain for cycling. Had the setting been the mountainous regions of California, the weather would not be as hot, and he wouldn't feel as tired because the mountains are a cool, although still dry place. Had I been cycling, I would rather have cycled in a different setting, such as the mountains, than an arid desert. That way, I would not have to endure the discomfort a cyclist experienced in the desert heat.
865	6844	3	3	The features of the setting in the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” are very important to the cyclist. In this story, the setting really affected the cyclist because it was set in California, which is a really hot place during the summer. The cyclist faced numerous problems because of the sweltering weather and the shortness of water. Since there was a shortage of water, he had to conserve it meticulously, which slowed him down as he couldn't ride as vigorously. Although there was a cool wind and a river from Yosemite, he had to pass quickly down the hill, which added even more challenges. This is why the settings of the story really affected the cyclist and severely limited how much he could ride, making his journey a difficult and arduous one.
866	6845	3	3	In the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. In the story, it talks about how the man is pedaling twenty miles here and forty miles there under the scorching sun, and it's very hot outside. He only has a limited supply of water, and he doesn't think he'll make it to his destination because he desperately needs more water. As the narrator says, “I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June,” which is extremely hot in California in June. The desert's hot weather made him limited on water supply, and the fact that he was in the middle of nowhere, with no buildings around, makes him lose all hope of making it through. There were snakes in the desert which endangered him, and the bumpy road made it harder for him to hold on and get to somewhere safe. “I began breaking the ride into distances I could see on the horizon, telling myself if I could make it there I'd be fine.” This quote shows his struggle because of the area he was in but also his persistence. The features of the setting significantly impact the cyclist in this essay, highlighting how the harsh environment can pose great challenges to travelers.
867	6846	3	3	Many features of the cyclist’s surroundings affect his speed and confidence. He was the only one on the long, empty road. There were no other cars, bikes, motor - cycles, or even buildings in sight. It’s like he’s in the far - reaching countryside where nature stretches out as far as the eye can see. So that makes him want to go faster, because he won’t hit anything. The fact that he’s alone in the wide, open spaces boosts up his energy level and makes him feel more confident, allowing him to fully enjoy the freedom of the ride. In such a setting, the cyclist can experience an unhindered and exhilarating journey.
868	6847	3	3	To be able to have a good bike ride, you must have a good setting. To me, a good setting would be about @NUM1° outside and sunny. The warm temperature and bright sunlight create a pleasant atmosphere for cycling. You can’t go bike riding in snow because there is no way that the tires will move smoothly in the thick snow. You can’t go in rain or hail because the roads get slippery and you could get in an accident that could injure or kill you. If it is sunny outside, you will be able to ride freely on dry roads with a gentle breeze to go through your hair and you could be refreshed. That is why I believe it is important for the setting to be just right for a bike ride, as it directly impacts the safety and enjoyment of the experience.
869	6848	3	3	This story is set in the sweltering desert in June and the character is a cyclist trying to get to a National Park. The setting affects the cyclist because the hotter it is, the more water you need to keep you hydrated, but the man is alone in the vast expanse of the desert. This quote “about forty miles in the pedal I arrived at my first ‘town’.” The place might have been a thriving little settlement at one time. This quote shows how deserted the desert is and how as he rides there is nobody around, no place to re - hydrate, no place to get directions. He was all alone in this desolate environment, facing great difficulties in his journey to the park. The harsh desert setting truly takes a toll on the cyclist's ability to reach his destination.
870	6849	3	3	In the essay, “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting greatly affected the cyclist. In this story, the cyclist is heading for Yosemite National Park. Thinking it wise, he accepts directions from a group of eccentric old men. He begins his journey confidently on the flat, smooth terrain and with a large supply of water, ready to embrace the adventure. The first of three promised towns had been resigned to that of a ghost town, with empty buildings and a spooky silence. The second offered only water that slightly resembled battery acid, which was undrinkable. The cyclist soon becomes exhausted from lack of water and having to cross the now hilly and challenging terrain. He barely makes it to the third town to realize that the juice factory was out of business. The cyclist becomes sure that he is going to die of lack of water when he stumbles across a bait store. If it hadn’t been so hot, if the “towns” along the way had offered better resources and if the terrain hadn’t been so hilly, the cyclist would have had a very enjoyable ride. All of the aforementioned factors of the setting greatly affected the cyclist, demonstrating how the environment can turn a hopeful journey into a struggle for survival.
871	6850	3	3	Hot, sweltering weather, challenging terrain, and being in the middle of nowhere - all are prominent features of the setting that significantly affected the cyclist. First, the intense hot weather in California, with the sun blazing down relentlessly, made the cyclist extremely thirsty and almost on the verge of dehydration. There was scarcely any place to stop for water and if there was, the water was bad - tasting and warm, offering little relief. Second, the different types of rough and uneven terrain, such as rocky paths and sandy stretches, made the cyclist really thirsty also and physically exhausted. Lastly, the cyclist was in the middle of nowhere, surrounded by vast emptiness. He couldn't get water to hydrate himself or find a proper place to sit down and rest. All these factors combined made the cyclist's journey an arduous one.
872	6851	3	3	The setting for the cyclist is a harsh, hard and extremely dangerous one. He had very little water, and his area was filled with tough, unforgiving terrains. “I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June” (@NUM1). The searing heat and lack of water left him severely dehydrated and he still had a long way to go. I once went on a bike ride that was many miles long in @LOCATION2, and we did not have water because we could not take a break due to the continuous stretch of the route. The terrain was tough, just like the author’s terrain, with rocky patches and steep slopes. The extreme heat was affecting his brain, making him disoriented and he just wanted to get it over with. I am just glad I don’t have to bike in that kind of harsh terrain as it can be life - threatening.
873	6852	3	3	The cyclist in “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed @CAPS1” was riding through the dry, desolate California desert in June. This dry, bare setting made it utterly impossible to find any source of water. The only time that this cyclist found water was when it was a murky, brackish puddle that was dirty and tasting of battery acid. There was nowhere for him to find water for miles, with the vast expanse of the desert stretching out all around. This lack of water and the scorching heat made him travel slow and wearily, as if every pedal stroke was a struggle. He even says that he could only go 12 mph in a 55 mph zone. By taking the advice of the old men and taking a “short cut”, the cyclist passed through ghost towns with no water, the empty buildings standing as silent witnesses to his plight. This “short cut” prolonged his trip, most likely by hours. If he had gone through populated area despite the fact that it is a longer path, there would have been more water to drink, which would allow him to go faster. The dry, hot setting of the old men’s “short cut” made this cyclist’s trip last much longer than necessary, turning what could have been a manageable journey into a grueling ordeal.
874	6853	3	3	When the man began cycling he thought that this was going to be an easy, enjoyable ride. For example in paragraph @NUM1 he says “Things began well enough. I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.” As he got further along the route, he realized that he was in the middle of nowhere. The scenery was getting more and more empty, with fewer and fewer signs of human habitation. There was eventually nothing but vast stretches of barren land. The desolate scenery was putting down his hope of ever getting out of the desert. For example: In paragraph @NUM2 it states, “a large highway sign jumped out at me. It read: Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” He realized this was going to be hard. He had to travel on bumpy roads, feeling every jolt and shake, and pass snakes without getting bit, constantly on high - alert. The scenery created a sense of hopelessness because it was abandoned, with no signs of life or help. When he saw the bait shop, a small oasis in the desert, his spirits lifted and he was now hopeful and relieved, knowing that he was not alone in this desolate place.
875	6854	3	3	When the cyclist began his journey he was confident in succeeding, with a spring in his step and a determined look on his face. Throughout the story however, the cyclist endures many conflicts to his success in his journey. The cyclist faced his first difficulty once he reached a small, abandoned town. “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June” (kurmaskie @NUM1). The cyclist realized he had not conserved his water and his “water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips” (kurmaskie @NUM1), leaving him in a precarious situation. On top of his water problem the heat was unbelievable, with the sun beating down mercilessly. He was losing hydration from all the sweat, and he was losing it quickly, his body starting to show signs of distress. The cyclist was also dealing with the difficult roads, full of potholes and ruts that made each pedal stroke a challenge. There were many things this cyclist endured throughout his journey, but he was determined to finish his trip and was filled with deep - seated satisfaction once he overcame these hardships, having proven his resilience and willpower.
876	6855	3	3	The features of the setting put a significant affect on the cyclist. The first notable aspect is listening to old men who seemed utterly clueless about the distance, duration, or the actual condition of the roads where they were sending him. These old men would casually give directions, not realizing the challenges that awaited the cyclist. Another thing that affected him was the road condition. Along the way, there were tumbleweeds rolling across the path, and he even encountered a ridiculously large snake slithering nearby, which startled him. The second major factor that came into play was the sweltering hot weather. The intense heat made dehydration a real threat as his body quickly lost fluids. In conclusion, the combination of misleading directions, poor road conditions, and hot weather took a toll on the cyclist's journey.
877	6856	3	3	One main feature of the setting that significantly affects the cyclist is the blistering heat of the day. When you ride a bike under the scorching sun during the heat of the day, your body is bound to use up a large amount of water at a rapid pace. Another crucial factor is the limited supply of water. The cyclist might have started with a small amount, not anticipating the long and hot journey ahead. The final factor is the wrong directions from the aged men. Aged people aren't always wrong, but their information can be out of date. They might recall roads and places as they were years ago, not considering the current changes. In conclusion, these three elements - the heat, limited water supply, and incorrect directions - make the cyclist's journey a challenging one.
878	6857	3	3	The features of the setting in the essay affect the cyclist because as he was riding his bike throughout California, he entered the hot deserts where the sun beat down mercilessly. Soon, he found himself almost out of water. The cyclist was in a very bad dehydrated state as he pedaled his bike, his throat parched and his body weak. He was constantly on the lookout for water or anything drinkable that would successfully get rid of his dehydration. After a little while, the cyclist found himself completely alone in the vast desert with no one in sight. An example of this desolate situation is “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” Another example to show how the cyclist was struggling and fighting against dehydration is “wise rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn’t been off their porch in decades.” This clearly shows how the settings of this essay affected the cyclist greatly, putting his health and safety at risk.
879	6858	3	3	During the author's ride to Yosemite, he didn't have the proper tools to go along the long stretch of the California desert he was to face, and by tools, specifically, I mean water. The California desert is extremely hot, with the sun baking the ground relentlessly. It can be potentially dangerous depending on your situation. The author was describing in detail how the lack of water was affecting him. He used vivid sentences like “Rattled around the dry honey combs of my deteriorating brain” to convey the severity of his condition. The author clearly cannot face the rugged heat with his immense lack of water. As he rode on, he was getting near heatstroke, being passed by desert snakes slithering across the path and tumbleweeds blowing in the wind. The author was clearly in a tough struggle against the unforgiving desert heat, which made his journey to Yosemite extremely difficult.
880	6859	3	3	The settings and features are very important to cyclists. One key reason is that for water and food, cyclists might carry a simple water bottle and a small snack, but they need to have a clear idea of where they are going and if they will need to bring extra supplies or not. In the story I just read, the cyclist didn't bring enough provisions to last him through the journey. He then sought directions, but unfortunately, they were bad. As a result, he was in serious trouble, wandering aimlessly in an unfamiliar area. It's extremely important that a cyclist knows where they are going and what kind of environment is around them so they don't get lost and end up having no access to essential food or water. In conclusion, proper planning and awareness of the setting are vital for cyclists to have a safe and successful journey.
881	6860	3	3	"The features of the setting affected the cyclist because he found himself in a vast desert in the month of June. The desert heat was intense, with the air being extremely hot and dry. There were absolutely no trees around, meaning there was no shade whatsoever for him to take a relaxing break. As a result, the scorching sun relentlessly beat down on his back. Moreover, there were numerous hills in the desert. These hills were not easy to navigate; for instance, the text mentions ""over one long, crippling hill,"" which required a great deal of his strength to overcome. There was also a large and unexpected twist in his path. To make matters worse, he even saw a venomous snake. All these factors combined made him extremely tired. He had a limited supply of water, and the intense sun caused him to become hot and dehydrated. With no shade available, he had no choice but to endure the sun's rays on his back. Jumping over and riding up the hills consumed a significant amount of his energy. Since all these challenges occurred one after another without any respite, it completely exhausted him."
882	6861	3	3	In the story, it vividly explained the captivating beauty of the night. It also delved into the allure of the outdoors and how it was influencing his trip. The features of the setting had a notable impact on the cyclist. The setting was described as mild, with a warm and calm atmosphere that could be almost felt through the descriptions. It also showed how the setting related to us in a certain way. The characteristics of the setting seemed to mirror those of the cyclist. For example, the calmness of the night might have reflected the cyclist's inner peace during the journey, while the mildness could be compared to his measured approach. In this way, the features of the setting had a profound and multi - faceted effect on the cyclist, enhancing his overall experience of the trip.
883	6862	3	3	The cyclist was in the sunny state of California during the month of June. The blistering sun was beating down mercilessly on him, which made the cycling ride extremely difficult, especially considering his limited and short water supply. As he pedaled along, the man came across several towns that were completely abandoned. These desolate towns offered no source of water, further reducing his already scarce water supply. The terrain he encountered was quite diverse. At first, it was long and straight, which allowed for relatively easy riding. However, it soon transformed into tall and imposing hills. These hills were a real challenge to ride up, requiring a great deal of physical effort and determination. All these factors combined made his cycling journey in California a tough and arduous one.
884	6863	3	3	How the features of the setting affect the cyclist is through the condition of the roads, the presence of rolling hills, and the intense heat. The conditions of the road in the setting have a significant impact on the cyclist because the roads are extremely rough. An example from the text is “I noticed that the terrain was changing. The flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.” These rough road conditions and the rolling hills make it very difficult for the cyclist; they present a real challenge. The rolling hills are not only physically demanding but also require great skill to navigate. It is quite easy to lose control on these hills, and they constantly test the cyclist's ability to stay on the road. The heat and the sun also play a crucial role in affecting the cyclist. An example from the text is “I chuckled, checked my water supply and moved on. The sun was beginning to heat up, but I barely noticed at first.” As the sun rises higher, especially in the high deserts, it starts to take a toll on the cyclist. The heat becomes more and more intense, making the ride even more challenging. In conclusion, these features in the setting affected the cyclist in many ways, but his determination was unwavering, and he kept pushing himself to move forward.
885	6864	3	3	"In the setting of ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" the cyclist is riding a bike at a breakneck speed on a rough and bumpy road. The rough surface of the road makes it difficult for the bike to maintain a smooth ride. Every bump and pothole on the road jolts the cyclist, testing his balance and control. The cyclist has to be extremely vigilant as he speeds along, constantly adjusting his grip on the handlebars and his position on the seat to stay on the bike. Despite the challenges posed by the rough road, he continues to ride fast, perhaps driven by a sense of adventure or a specific goal. This high - speed ride on a rough road sets the tone for an exciting and perilous journey, where the cyclist must use all his skills to overcome the obstacles presented by the setting."
886	6865	3	3	The cyclist had a couple of affects in his journey. One of them was the hills. The steep inclines of the hills were a problem because it used most of his energy and slowed him down significantly. The other one was water, specifically the lack of water. If he had energy - boosting water, he would have gotten a much - needed boost that would have kept him going steadily until he reached his destination.
887	6866	3	3	In the essay, “Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed Posted Speed Limit”, the features of the setting significantly affect the cyclist. Firstly, the cyclist had been pedaling through the “high deserts of California”. The arid expanse of these high deserts made it clear that the temperature was hot and dry. With the sun relentlessly beating down on him, he must've been getting thirsty regularly and exhausted from the intense heat. Second, he began to ride through hills. As common sense dictates, hills are much harder to ride on a bicycle, especially going uphill. The constant need to exert more force on the pedals wears you down. These hills, along with a lack of water, must've tired him out and given him extreme difficulty to make it without much water. As you can tell, the difference in setting plays its crucial part on the cyclist and his precious water supply, making his journey a real challenge.
888	6867	3	3	The setting affects the cyclists because he can not take the searing heat. His water supply is running low and he is severely dehydrated. It says this when the character says, “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide wings of sweat circled my shirt and the growing realization that I could drop from heat stroke”. This is saying he is afraid he might pass out and die before he finds more water. In such a dire situation, the setting's heat and lack of water are clearly taking a heavy toll on him.
889	6868	3	3	The setting affected the cyclist in several ways. The first place he arrived at was a “ghost town”, a desolate and eerie place with an air of abandonment. Then he reached a water pump about twenty miles up the road. The water was extremely hot and tasted very nasty. The text states, “...water heating somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees...when I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid”. Then he had to travel without water and became dehydrated. Travelling up and down the hilly terrain, he thought he began to imagine a building that could possibly provide him with water. The building was there but it was completely abandoned. He decided he was going to suck on a couple of pebbles. The text says, “I'd read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst...”. This shows how the unforgiving setting continuously tested his endurance.
890	6869	3	3	It is very hot, so the cyclist is very dehydrated, extremely tired and suffering from a lack of water. “I checked my water supply and headed on” is a good example of this. There are also a lot of sad and deserted places with no cars around. The absence of any sign of life bars the cyclist's hope of finding civilization. Also, not seeing any buildings and when he does see one, it being deserted makes this very hard on the rider. Another event that takes a toll on him is when he reaches the pump that has tar, dirt, and then hot water in it. The unpalatable water is of no help. Also, the road plays a toll on him. I know this because he says, “If I could just make it to that next horizon/hill I'll be alright”. This is how I know the setting and features in the setting are affecting the cyclist mentally and physically, making his cycling journey a true struggle.
891	6870	3	3	Hot, sweltering heat, alone on an empty road, with no water in sight – all are reasons why the features of the setting affect the cyclist. It is extremely hot as the cyclist is riding under the unforgiving sun. This makes the cyclist constantly worried about getting dehydrated and his energy waning. The cyclist is completely alone and there is nothing but vast emptiness in sight. If anything happened to him, like a sudden illness or a mechanical issue with his bike, there is no one to help. The cyclist had very little water left in his bottle and had to conserve it carefully in order to stay active and have enough energy to keep pedaling. With very little water, it is incredibly hard to stay hydrated and keep his body functioning properly. Hot, alone, no water - all are reasons why the features of the setting have a significant impact on the cyclist.
892	6871	3	3	The terrain that a cyclist is riding on has a big and noticeable affect on them. The first clear example of this is when they are riding on steep hills, it makes it much more difficult for them. For instance, when the rider in the story saw that he was going to have to ride on a long stretch of hilly terrain, he was, obviously, disappointed as he knew it would require a great deal of effort. Another thing that affects cyclists is the smoothness of the road they are riding on. In the story “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” the main character came to a particularly rough spot in the road, with potholes and uneven surfaces, and was disappointed and didn't want to ride it as it made the journey bumpy and uncomfortable. Another aspect that can affect cyclists is the intense heat. Several times in the story, the cyclists says that he is extremely tired and dehydrated. At one point, when the heat was at its peak, he thinks he is going to die of heatstroke. Those are the effects that the rider's setting have on him/her.
893	6872	3	3	"The setting in the essay ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" has a major and profound effect on the cyclist. The setting is the high deserts of California, where it is June and the sun beats down mercilessly, making it very hot. The path of the cyclist suggested by some old men makes the heat even worse because there are no people or water in sight for miles. In the essay, the cyclist starts out the day confident and excited for his ride to Yosemite National Park, looking forward to the beautiful scenery and the adventure. His mood changes throughout the day as after @NUM1 miles he arrives in a ""ghost town"" that the old men led him to believe would be a settled town where he could get more supplies and cool off in the shade. Soon as the temperature rises to what feels like ""two hundred degrees"", the cyclist begins to run low on water and feels ""sometimes life can feel so cruel"" as he realizes the dire situation he is in. The heat and lack of people and water lead the cyclist to desperation and make him feel like as he says ""i was going to die"". The setting of the cyclist's journey provides the mood of hopelessness and amplifies the feeling of determination felt by the cyclist to keep going at all costs because he knew he was going to die if he stopped. The author, @PERSON1 uses the setting of the essay to help bring across his message that by blindly trusting people instead of trusting yourself, things could end up being hard for you to overcome."
894	6873	3	3	In the story “Do not Exceed Posted Speed limit” the cyclist sees many different settings. When he left, it was early summer and it was already pretty hot outside, with the sun starting to warm up the day. He rode into the morning, the continuous pedaling making him gradually tired. The first town he reaches upon was a ghost town, which means he couldn't rest or get his supplies as he had hoped. Then he arrived by cool pines and a rushing river, the sound of the water and the shade of the trees probably making him feel relaxed and at ease. Then he showed up at a ramshackle shed with several rusty pumps and a carrel that could hardly hold anything useful. Gloomy - looking men around there made him feel uncomfortable, and the pumps did not give him water, so there was no relief in sight. Then he was riding through the California deserts in June, the hot sand and dry air which probably made him even more dehydrated and miserable.
895	6874	3	3	The cyclist should have never taken the advice from the older men. The map would have been a lot safer and easier to follow. People seem to always look for a shortcut, including myself, thinking it will save time and effort. He could have died from heat stroke and lack of water in that harsh desert environment. He did have great perseverance though; he never gave up even when the situation was extremely dire and that is what ultimately saved him. Being in that situation and setting, with the scorching heat and no water in sight, I would have given up as it would have been so hard to keep going. But the cyclist's determination is a lesson that sometimes, even in the most difficult circumstances, we should keep pushing forward.
896	6875	3	3	When cycling, it's crucial to make yourself well - aware of the type of terrain, such as whether it's flat, hilly, or mountainous. Also, make sure to check the weather forecast, like if it will be sunny, rainy, or windy. Additionally, assess the environment, for example, if it's a busy city street or a quiet country lane. Most importantly, ensure you have enough resources, including water, snacks, and a basic repair kit. These things are key before taking any cycling trip. They are very important in determining the type of trip you will have, whether it's an enjoyable and relaxing one, or a long and miserable journey.
897	6876	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist significantly when travelling very far to his destination. For example, ""About forty miles into the pedal I arrived at the first town."" It was a good thing that he was carrying water; otherwise, who knows if he would have survived or not. I think the biggest mistake was that he asked probably someone who had never been on the road for directions. When he asked the person, he ended up at a sign that said ""Rough road Ahead: Do not exceed."" That was the moment I felt sorry for him, and that was probably the most impactful feature of the setting that affected him, making his journey much more difficult."
898	6877	3	3	In the story “Rough Road Ahead Do Not Exceed Posted Speed” by @PERSON1, the settings of the story affect the rider in many ways. The first and most obvious is the temperature; it is swelteringly hot, therefore the rider is extremely hot and becoming dehydrated, making him desperately thirsty. A second way the setting affects the rider is the fact that there is nothing around him. Since there are no facilities nearby, there is nowhere for him to get water, adding to the effect of dehydration and making him even more thirsty. The rider says “One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and the corral that couldn't hold the lamest mule greeted me.” This statement from the author supports the fact that there is nothing around. One more feature of the setting that affected the rider was the hills. The steep hills made the rider extremely tired, requiring more pedaling and wearing him out. The setting features had a great affect on the rider, from heat and dehydration to hills and energy depletion. One thing that the setting didn't have was a positive effect on the rider, as it only made his journey tougher.
899	6878	3	3	In the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting affected the cyclist. It was a scorching hot June day, and the water supplies he had were quickly running out. He got the wrong directions from these old men, so he had to ride his bike longer than he originally planned. Pedaling all that extra distance for nothing made his need for water even more urgent. Since he was going in the wrong direction, there were no buildings where he could get water. There were no people around, so he couldn't communicate with anyone, and there would be no one to call for help in case he overheated from the intense heat. This difficult setting really put the cyclist in a tough spot during his journey.
900	6879	3	3	In the story, the rider faced several melancholy sites. For example, the “ghost town” that he ran into at first really put a burden on him because he had no one to ask for further directions or a place to freshen up. Further on down the road, the hill he came up on was a physical obstacle that he had to overcome. With the blazing sun beating on his back and the emptiness of the long, desolate road, he might have begun to want to turn back. However, he kept on persevering, which was how he managed to make it down the other side. The lack of water also made it extremely difficult for him. Traveling with his water running out and starting to feel sick did not bode well for him, but his determination kept him going through this arduous journey.
901	6880	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in a negative way. For example, a tarlike substance oozed from the ground, followed by brackish water that felt scalding, somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees. This affects him because he can't get clean water from the well. So this means he desperately needs water, but cannot obtain it. Also in the essay it says the terrain is bad, with numerous potholes and steep inclines. So that means that the cyclist has to pedal harder to keep moving and he has to work extra hard to not break down. So all this puts a strain on him from just what's around him. The old abandoned factory with the boy drinking juice had the most effect on the cyclist because he was so parched and that was when he was on the verge of giving up. In this essay the setting had a lot of impact on the cyclist to the point where he thought he might die, such a dire situation highlighting the powerful influence of the setting on his experience.
902	6881	3	3	In the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” the setting affects the cyclist in many ways. The speaker tells us that he’s riding his bike in the middle of the desert in June. The intense desert sun beats down on him, which shows the author is probably very hot and uncomfortable. The author tells us that the road turned into hills and bumps, with some hills being quite steep. This would make it more difficult for the author because he would have to use more energy to move up the hill, his legs straining with each pedal. And lastly, the cyclist tells us that the “towns” he came to were abandoned and uncared for, with dilapidated buildings and dry wells. This would not be good for the cyclist because he would be unable to get water for his trip, leaving him at risk of dehydration. In conclusion, the harsh desert setting in June, the difficult hilly road, and the lack of water in abandoned towns all combined to have a significant negative impact on the cyclist's journey.
903	6882	3	3	The cyclist is affected in many ways. The major thing that affects him is the lack of water. Throughout the story he repeatedly mentions the lack of water, his throat parched and his body craving moisture. He also continues to say to himself he should not have taken that route. For example, “I could drop from a heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn’t been off their porch in decades, which caused me to laugh.” The cyclist says things about the older gentleman throughout the story, expressing his regret and frustration at following the man's advice. In the end, the lack of water and the poor route choice take a toll on the cyclist, making his journey a difficult and regrettable one.
904	6883	3	3	Setting very much affects the cyclist and how he feels. If he was in a bad setting, with harsh weather and difficult terrain, then he would most likely be in a bad mood. Mood is highly affected by the general setting. In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” the cyclist feels very confident of himself at the start, and the setting helps to boost that confidence and endurance. The open road, the fresh air, and the beautiful scenery all contribute to his positive state of mind. However, as the journey progresses and the setting becomes more challenging, his confidence may waver. But overall, the initial setting has a positive impact on his mental state, showing the strong connection between setting and mood.
905	6884	3	3	The features in the setting of the essay affected the author greatly. The hills, on a sweltering hot day, with no water source in sight or nearby town, are really rough, especially if you’ve been riding for more than 50 miles. Your body is exhausted and your energy is depleted. The environment of the hot June weather near a desert area can cause serious problems. For example, heat stroke is a real threat, and since he had no water to drink, dehydration set in quickly, causing a lot of fear in the author. He could feel his strength waning with each passing moment. The setting of the essay and the conditions the author was under were extremely dangerous and he's lucky he made it out alive, a testament to his resilience in the face of such a harsh setting.
906	6885	3	3	That the cyclist is steadily pedaling down an extremely steep and winding road when trying to get to his destination, the small town settled out yonder, are the events that took place yesterday. The condition of the road was difficult and he was in a bit of a hurry at times, and this took a toll on his body. In the end, he persevered through the tough journey to reach his goal.
907	6886	3	3	In the short story, “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the setting greatly affects the cyclist. For example, in the beginning of the story, the cyclist is highly eager to get to Yosemite National Park. He listens to the advice of old - timers who haven’t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office, and quickly realized that he shouldn’t have. The author describes the setting of the first “town” as “the traditional definition of a ghost town.” This didn’t bother the cyclist as much as his next sight. “One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn’t hold in the largest mule” was what met him there. The cyclist said that “this sight was troubling.” It is obvious that the cyclist has given up hope when he says, “It didn’t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.” This short story clearly shows how anything can get even the most seasoned travellers worried about their survival.
908	6887	3	3	I think the features of the settings affect the cyclist because the knowledge of the cyclist is limited. For example, “old - timers who haven’t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office,” meaning that now it's time for the older people to relax and watch the younger people take on new adventures. The cyclist, relying on their advice, may be led astray due to the old - timers' limited modern - day knowledge, which in turn impacts his journey.
909	6888	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because where he is riding it is very dry and hot. He can initially deal with the heat with his good water supply, but when it runs out he begins to get disoriented. For example, in the text he writes “over one long, crippling hill, a building came into view. I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn't a mirage.” That statement shows that the cyclist was extremely hot, and the images around him were making him feel even more hot than what he actually was, and his lack of water made him almost believe that he was imagining seeing a building. Another example is “A sand - blasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen. I hang my head.” This quote shows that the cyclist is in complete despair as he looks at the photo and hangs his head. This shows that the cyclist was constantly being reminded how hot and thirsty he was everywhere he would go and he couldn't get a drink. This is how the harsh features of the setting severely affected the cyclist.
910	6889	3	3	The setting in “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” greatly affected the cyclist in the story. “Not two miles into this next section of ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills” (Kurmaskie). The cyclist is travelling through hot, dry California in the middle of June without much water left. The fact that he now has to travel up and down short hills is going to make him even more tired, because going over hills requires more energy than flat riding. This energy loss, coupled with the cyclist's lack of water, causes him to become even more miserable. The unforgiving setting of this story, with its changing terrain and harsh climate, significantly affected the cyclist's journey and well - being.
911	6890	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist's mood and behavior. First, the cyclist believes that taking the shortcut will help him arrive at Yosemite faster. As he pedals along, he soon realizes it won't. Next, the harsh sun beats down on him, the rough terrain jolts his body, and the lack of water makes his throat parched. This causes the cyclist to give up hope that he will make it to Yosemite and leads him to rethink his judgment and consider taking advice from others. In the end, he understands that being more cautious in choosing routes is necessary.
912	6891	3	3	"The setting affected the cyclist in a harsh way. At first, the cyclist was fine and going strong, pedaling steadily with energy. But soon after passing the first ""ghost town"", he started getting weak, his legs becoming heavy. Then the cyclist had to face a few problems. For example, he was running low on water, and his water bottle was almost empty. Also, he faced rough roads that made his bike shake violently. Last, he encountered snakes slithering on the path and the desolate feeling of abandonment. The cyclist had to face many obstacles, but in the end, he pulled through strong, proving his perseverance."
913	6892	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist for these reasons. It says “one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn't hold in the lamest mule greeted me. The sight was troubling.” That shows how the features affected the cyclist because he says the sight was troubling. It troubled him because he was extremely thirsty and wanted water. When he saw the rusty pumps, they reminded him of water, but he knew there was no clean water or it was likely to be nasty. This made his situation seem even more hopeless, and he felt more anxious about his lack of water supply.
914	6893	3	3	The conditions of the environment as well as the road can majorly affect the cyclist. For example, if someone was riding a bike in warm weather on flat land, the gentle breeze would accompany them, and it would not take major determination to pedal. On the other hand, if it is hot and the paths are rough with hilly roads, the biker could dehydrate quickly as they sweat profusely. It takes much more effort to get up and over the hill, and their legs have to work harder with each pedal stroke. These conditions of the environment affect a cyclist greatly, highlighting the importance of suitable conditions for cycling.
915	6894	3	3	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the cyclist, on his way to Yosemite National Park, is forced to face the rough deserts of California. As is normal throughout all deserts, the sun is blazing hot, scorching his skin, and the sand is so hot that it radiates heat. There is no water anywhere in sight, and dangerous, highly venomous creatures like rattlesnakes are abundant, lurking in the sand. The lack of water almost puts him into a heat - stroke as he is determined to leave the desert, riding his bike all alone. A grape juice factory taunts him with its signs, mocks him with the thought of liquid, but he continues on, with a steady pace, though his energy is waning. The desert roads are rocky and bumpy, and his lousy 12 mph speed is getting him practically nowhere, each bump jolting his body. Until, finally, he reaches a modern area and drinks from the sink in the bathroom, feeling a great sense of relief as the cool water quenches his thirst.
916	6895	3	3	In the story, the setting plays a big role in affecting the cyclist. The terrain was very challenging at times, such as having big hills and winding turns. The steep inclines of the large hills made pedaling an arduous task, and the sharp, windy turns required great balance and control. Also, there was no one around. No houses, buildings, or people were in sight, which made him feel alone as if he was going to die. The desolate landscape added to his sense of isolation and vulnerability. The author describes the terrain in one part of the story: “Over one long, crippling hill a building came into view!” This quote shows how the hills in the setting were very big and hard to get over. It also shows the significance of a single building and how excited he was to see it. In the story, the author described many features from the setting which all greatly affected the cyclist, highlighting the power of the environment on his journey.
917	6896	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist, by putting him in unwanted places. Starting off, this man took advice from many older men, who don't even know the area anymore. These old - timers, sitting on their porches, gave advice that seemed reasonable but was actually quite off - base. So, riding through, this man seems lost. He is trying to follow their advice, but comes across many unknown, unwanted areas. The roads were unfamiliar, leading him through desolate patches and rough terrains. He starts out good, then comes to a “Rough Road” and he even says “sometimes life can feel so cruel”. The rough road was full of potholes and uneven surfaces, making it difficult for him to maintain his balance and speed. Then he comes to this large snake in the middle of the road. Scary enough, he has to slow ride past this thing taking up most of the road. The snake was coiled menacingly, its eyes fixed on him as he slowly pedaled by. Coming over these things was very strenuous and hard on this young man, testing his physical and mental limits.
918	6897	3	3	The desert environment had huge effects on the cyclist. He had been drinking his water regularly and would be running out. Not realizing, there would be no refills because the pump was only giving “tarlike substance” said the text. The thick, sticky substance that came out of the pump was completely useless for quenching his thirst. With the lack of water, dehydration was beginning to hit the poor man. An effect of dehydration is poor balance that would have been useful to pass the “ridiculously large snake” he had seen. His legs felt wobbly, and his movements were less coordinated as he tried to navigate around the snake. A final effect would be mirages that could cloud your judgement. This man double - checked his eyes, when coming in view of a building, by “[wiping] the sweat from (his) eyes to make sure it wasn't a mirage”. Through all the toughest desert obstacles, the character was able to take the short cut and survive heat, dehydration, and animals of the desert, showing his remarkable resilience.
919	6898	3	3	I think the features in the setting of the story “Do not exceed the speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie highly affect the cyclist. Some implied information would be that it is very hot out, and the people in towns didn't help him. I know that it is hot because the text says, “somewhere in the neighbourhood of @NUM1 degrees.” This implies that it is swelteringly hot outside, making the cyclist's journey even more difficult. I can tell the people in towns didn't help him because the text says, “Never accept travel advice from a collection of old - timers who haven't left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office.” This shows that the people in towns didn't offer useful guidance. Some expressed information in this text would be that there is a rough road, and a snake was in his way. I know this is expressed because it tells you right in the text. “Rough road ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit.” This comes right out and tells you there is a rough road full of bumps and unevenness. You know there is a snake because the text says, “and ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the road.” I think there are many implied and expressed information in the story “Do not exceed the speed limit” that significantly impact the cyclist's experience.
920	6899	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in a larger way, almost resulting in a very severe situation. The cyclist was in a desert - like terrain, which was not densely populated on his trail. The sparse population meant that help was hard to come by. There was a lack of fresh water supplies, and the temperatures were more extreme. The searing heat of the desert sun beat down on him relentlessly. The cyclist could easily have fainted from heatstroke, due to the lack of water and excessive heat and work that he was doing pedaling. The long hours of cycling in the intense heat with little water took a toll on his body. Had the area been more populated, he would have had more chances to stock up on water, greatly decreasing his risk of heatstroke. There was also the snakes which presented danger for him. Had he been bitten, then he would be at least @NUM1 miles from the closest help which could prove fatal. The venomous snakes lurking in the desert were a constant threat. Had the setting been, say a city park or a populated countryside, then the setting would have provided exponentially less problems and dangers for the cyclist, clearly demonstrating the impact of the harsh desert setting on his journey.
921	6900	3	3	The conditions and features of the sweltering desert setting, with its intense heat and lack of shade, caused the cyclist to be extremely tired and severely dehydrated, and he began to think that he was going to die from it. For example, it says “and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June”. Also, he thinks he is getting dehydrated when he says “I was doing a water - depleting 12 mph. sometimes life could be so cruel”. In conclusion, this cyclist started this arduous journey without enough water, which made him firmly believe that he was going to die from either heatstroke or dehydration.
922	6901	3	3	The desolate setting affects the cyclist because he’s in the middle of a vast, empty expanse with no water in sight. The cyclist had to laboriously ride his bike for over @NUM1 miles, his legs aching with each pedal stroke, trying to get to Yosemite. “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly.” This quote shows that he was just beginning to run out of water. “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.” This quote shows how he really had nothing to drink at all. Having no water in the scorching high deserts of California while riding your bike for over @NUM1 miles is not a good situation unless you have a car to provide support and supplies.
923	6902	3	3	In the essay, the setting had everything to do with the cyclist because he is riding through the parched desert with barely any water. He is pedaling through the dry, searing heat that is tough even if you had an ample supply of water. Plus, there were steep hills and deadly snakes lurking in the area. It’s dangerous enough without that stuff being there. So, I would definitely listen to the cyclist's harrowing experience and never ever heed the advice of old men without proper consideration.
924	6903	3	3	On the cyclist's ride to Yosemite National Park, he encounters a lot of hardships due to the desolate setting he is in and the potentially misguided advice given by old men. The cyclist riding his bike in the middle of June in the deserts of California is not a good situation to begin with, especially considering his already dehydrated state. He first comes across “one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn't hold in the lament mule”. By that description of his location, it seems as if he might be in a ghost town by himself, which almost could strand him. He described the terrain with “short, rolling hills” and “over one long, crippling hill”. This shows some of the obstacles that he had to go through on a bike, just to get to Yosemite National Park. He eventually realized once he encountered these features of the terrain that he was off - track and needed to find help. After his long struggle to survive his surroundings for as long as he could go, he finally gets help at a real camp. That is how the settings of the story play a crucial role in the cyclist's difficult journey.
925	6904	3	3	“Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” is an inspiring and almost humorous essay that takes the reader inside a journey in a cyclist's daily routine. In this story, the author battles dehydration as he tries to make it to a national park with shortcut directions from “old timers”. The setting of this story greatly affects the cyclist and the pity the reader feels for him. Half - way through the essay, the biker had already traveled roughly @NUM1 miles; that’s extremely crazy. The fact that he is travelling through the hot California deserts in June is even harder to believe. The first time he mentions the setting, he states he is in a ghost town, and two sentences after he states that the sun was beating down relentlessly. At that point, he wasn't really bothered, but his energy was gradually sapping. Another description of his setting that probably affected his ability to peddle was when he states “flat road was replaced by short rolling hills”. He was already dehydrated and had already traveled so far, the rocky roads and the hilly terrain probably didn't help his already difficult journey much. The setting basically made the story. If he wouldn't have been peddling in the desert, it would have just been another ordinary trip in his life. The setting makes the reader truly see what cyclists really go through in such challenging circumstances.
926	6905	3	3	The features of the setting significantly affect the cyclist. This is because the road is in a poor condition, full of potholes and uneven surfaces, and he has to travel a long distance under the bad weather, with strong winds blowing against him. This affects him as he might get dehydrated due to the extra effort required to pedal on such roads and in such weather. In conclusion, there are many elements in the setting that have a notable impact on the cyclist.
927	6907	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because if there weren't steep hills and rough, rutted roads, he would have been able to get to Yosemite Park faster. The constant uphill climbs and the bumpy terrain slow him down considerably. Also, he wouldn't have run out of water as quickly since less energy would have been consumed. The difficult setting clearly hinders his progress and resource management.
928	6908	3	3	The setting was the main factor affecting the cyclist. He mentioned that it was swelteringly hot, and he was completely lost. The cyclist had no idea where he was going, and the intense heat outside made the situation even more challenging. He seemed very stressed, and this stress only exacerbated his problems. He was thirsty from all the riding and the scorching heat, so he tried to get water from a water pump. The water that was in it was horrible. He called it a “substance” as it had a flavor of battery acid. If he were not lost and if it were cool outside, he would have had enough water and would not be so upset. The setting of a hot and unfamiliar place had a huge impact on the cyclist, making his journey extremely difficult.
929	6909	3	3	In my opinion, the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example, when he was talking about the terrain changing from long, straight roads to sharp, winding ones and the speed limit changing, he said he was doing a water - depleting, strenuous effort, like he is having a hard time, or doesn't want to go on. The sudden change in the road conditions and speed requirements adds to his physical and mental fatigue, clearly showing the negative influence of the setting on him.
930	6910	3	3	Due to the features in the setting, including the sweltering hot summer weather, the cyclist not knowing the area well, and the vast California desert, the cyclist is significantly affected. In the short story “Do not exceed posted speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist is travelling through the hot desert in June when he realizes he's running out of water. “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly and I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June” (Kurmaskie). This is affecting the cyclist because he's becoming extremely hot and has a low supply of water. Also, the cyclist realizes he should have never taken the direction from the old men and thinks to himself, “...The growing realization that I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June” (Kurmaskie). This quote proves that the searing heat of the desert is taking a heavy toll on him, making his journey a real struggle.
931	6911	3	3	The setting of this story significantly affects the cyclist. I think the setting was supposed to be most like a run - down, out - of - date town with dilapidated buildings and overgrown weeds. This kind of town didn't help him when he was lost as there were few landmarks to guide him. The town is not only out of date but also extremely hot under the blazing sun. This heat brings another problem: the cyclist was dehydrating rapidly because he didn't have enough water. As a result, he would hallucinate and see things that weren't there, like mirages of cool oases. He became very tired in the hot sun, his energy quickly draining away. So, the setting in this short story affected the cyclist in many ways, making his journey a real struggle.
932	6912	3	3	The features of the setting strongly affect the cyclist due to the harsh conditions he is in, especially without any water. The cyclist would have been fine if he had brought more water for his trip. He ran out of water not long into his journey, thanks to the intense heat of the setting he was in. The high temperatures in the high desert of California in June were unforgiving. The cyclist makes this statement: “I was hitting my water bottle pretty regularly and I was traveling through the high desert of California in June.” The cyclist is saying that since it is so hot where he is, he has to take regular drinks of water so he stays hydrated throughout his trip. It is also saying that in the mountains with less air and the sweltering heat, he is not doing as well as he thought he would on the trip. In such conditions, his lack of water severely hampers his progress.
933	6913	3	3	The cyclist had a hard trail to bike in order to get to @LOCATION1. It is easy to bike if you are on flat, smooth terrain. However, when you get to rolling hills, it makes the journey a lot tougher. The biker said, “I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills. It was also very hot.” The intense heat made him sweat profusely and he was getting dehydrated quickly. “I’d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst.” he said. He had eighteen miles to the next town without much water. The first deserted town he passed through didn't have any drinkable water, with its wells dry and taps rusted. It was very hard to bike in these conditions, with the combination of difficult terrain and lack of water. It is important to always be prepared and know where you are going to avoid such hardships.
934	6914	3	3	The cyclist has to endure rough terrain and bad road conditions, and a lack of water in the area certainly did not help the problem. There was a high probability he could have suffered from heatstroke as the sun beat down mercilessly on him. However, his hope was still up because of an abandoned Welch's fruit factory. The factory, with its large, empty buildings, stood as a potential source of shelter and maybe even water. Despite the tough situation, the thought of the factory gave him the motivation to keep going, but he still faced a long and difficult journey ahead.
935	6915	3	3	In Joe Kurmaskie’s “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed @CAPS1”, the vivid imagery is what sets the cyclist back. The scorching desert with its parched earth and sparse plant life gives him a sense of seclusion and scares him. The desolate landscape, with its vast stretches of sand and the occasional cactus, makes him feel isolated. Because the cyclist is in the desert, he keeps on worrying about his water supply and the threat of heatstroke. In contrast, if he were in a rain forest, he wouldn't worry about water or heat. I think he psyched himself out just by taking in his surroundings. If the cyclist would have pictured water all around him and arctic - like temperatures in his mind, I think he wouldn't have been so worried. What’s interesting about this story is that if he would have gotten himself prepared mentally for the conditions, he wouldn't have struggled so much at the end. “At some point tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake - it really did look like a diamondback blocking the majority of the pavement in front of me.” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). If the cyclist had concentrated more on the task at hand and less on what was going on around him, I think he would have succeeded without as much stress. In the end, his mental state was as much a hurdle as the physical environment.
936	6916	3	3	The features of the arid and challenging setting affect the cyclist significantly as it made him rapidly use up his water supply and severely tested his determination. The sweltering heat and long, tough terrain forced him to consume water at a faster rate. “Sometimes life can be so cruel” implies that he was having an extremely horrible time coping with the harsh setting he was in. The desolate landscape and difficult conditions were overwhelming. To himself he thought he was gonna die at any moment, as the lack of water and the unrelenting environment took a toll on his body and mind. This experience in the tough setting truly showed the cyclist's mettle and the power of the environment to impact one's journey.
937	6917	3	3	In the essay “Rough road ahead: do not exceed posted speed limit,” the author is continually depressed by the unappealing features of the desolate landscape he passes. At first, he passes a ghost town with dilapidated buildings and empty streets, but because he has enough water in his canteen, this forlorn sight doesn't bother him too much. However, the next thing he sees is a rundown old shed and a “rusted water pump,” and this troubles him greatly because he is running perilously low on water. Then he sees a huge snake coiled menacingly on the road, which does not help his already gloomy mood, as the snake is blocking his path. After that, he passes an abandoned Welch’s Grape Juice factory with broken windows and overgrown weeds, and despairs that he will never find water. The setting and its uninviting features serve to disappoint and depress the cyclist in his desperate quest to find water, making his journey an increasingly disheartening one.
938	6918	3	3	In the story “Rough Road ahead; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” a cyclist is faced with many daunting problems. It’s really hot out, the sun beating down relentlessly like a furnace, practically a desert and it's in June when the temperatures soar. Just knowing that makes me want some cool water. Also, this cyclist is running short of water in his bottles and still hasn’t got to the place he needs to be. The roads are full of steep hills and are bumpy, filled with potholes and uneven surfaces, which make it much harder for him to pedal. Those are the challenging problems this cyclist is faced with, making his journey a real struggle.
939	6919	3	3	At first, the narrator in “Do not Exceed Posted Speed limit” was energetic and enthusiastic about their exciting journey to Yosemite National Park. After getting some helpful advice from a friendly local about a few short cuts, the cyclist sets out full of anticipation for adventure. The first thing they encounter is a ghost town with crumbling buildings and a deserted main street. The gentlemen they took advice from had assured them it was a booming and prosperous town. This set the first wave of doubt through the cyclist's mind. Then the lack of water became a major issue. They were travelling through the high deserts of California in June, where the sun was scorching, and slowly running out of the precious liquid in their water containers. The flat road was soon replaced by short, rolling hills that seemed to go on forever, which only increased the cyclist's state of deliriousness. After a few more disappointments like a broken - down water source and a blocked path, the cyclist decides there is no hope and they are going to die. The reader is partly drawn in believing that this is the end for the cyclist. All of the disappointments set the stage for the possible end of the cyclist's journey and you can't stop reading because you have to find out what happens. If it weren't for the hopelessness of the setting you wouldn't care as much about the cyclist's fate.
940	6920	3	3	When the cyclist is going on his trip, he is riding through a barren desert. All he sees the entire journey is a flat, dusty road stretching out endlessly and nothing but dirt as far as the eye can see. He is riding on the road, hopelessly hoping for some form of life. “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” The author is trying to stay positive but it’s hard, because all this desolate scenery is doing is bringing his hopes down. How would you like it if you were riding a bike and had no water in the middle of a blistering - hot desert? Now, if the setting had been a nice, green forest with tall trees and a babbling brook, he wouldn't be that worried, as there would be water and shade. He has none of that in the desert. This whole journey was all mental. He always kept in his mind that everything would be ok, repeating positive thoughts to himself. That is what helped him survive. This is an inspiring story, to anyone who needs a push to stay optimistic in the face of adversity.
941	6921	3	3	Poor directions, intense heat, and lack of water significantly affect the cyclist in the story. At the beginning of the story, the cyclist is overly confident in the directions which he believes would, “slice away hours from my ride to Yosemite National Park.” As the story progresses, the cyclist's initial confidence fades. The sweltering “heat of the California, June day causes him to guzzle water rapidly.” He admits, “I had been hitting my water bottle pretty regularly, and I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June.” This severe lack of water becomes a huge problem for the cyclist, so much so that he was on the verge of heat stroke. “I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.” Despite the harsh conditions, he braved the elements and forced himself forward, with hopes that any source of water would reveal itself to him. His perseverance finally paid off. “Then, as easily as rounding a bend, my troubles, thirst, and fear were all behind me.” The cyclist had found a barst shop and received much - needed water, which allowed him to continue his journey.
942	6922	3	3	The features of the setting have a profound impact on the cyclist. I say this because the setting is in the scorching hot deserts of @LOCATION1, where the sun beats down relentlessly. The cyclist is drenched in sweat and extremely tired, and he has almost no water left in his bottles. This dire lack of water makes the cyclist not only desperate for a drink but also yearning for food to regain his energy. Clearly, the setting has a lot to do with how the cyclist reacts to what happens, as these harsh conditions test his physical and mental limits.
943	6923	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. First, since there was no one in sight for miles around, he couldn't ask for any help or get proper directions. Also, due to all the poor road conditions, it was an arduous task to ride a bike through all the rocky roads. He was already very tired and dehydrated, and these rough roads only made his situation worse, tiring him out even more. Another reason is the presence of poisonous snakes in the area. If he accidentally disturbed them, they could harm him severely. Also, if he were to fall off his bike, a snake could easily bite him, and then he wouldn't be able to make it anywhere because of the venomous bite. These are the features of the setting that had a detrimental impact on the cyclist.
944	6924	3	3	The features of the setting in the story affect the cyclist both physically and mentally. It affects him physically because of the numerous rolling hills he has to laboriously trudge over and the acute lack of water he endures. The continuous ascent and descent of the rolling hills make him extremely tired and weak, especially when combined with the rough and uneven terrain. The lack of water only exacerbates his situation when he's parched from climbing the hills. The features affect him mentally because the farther he goes, the more dangerous his situation becomes. With each additional mile, he keeps reassuring himself, “if I can just get there I'll be fine.” He also blames himself for heedlessly listening to the old men's advice. Along with this self - blame comes doubt. He starts doubting that he can make it alive. In the story, it says, “it didn't really matter: I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.” Mentally, the pressure and despair were becoming too much for him to bear.
945	6925	3	3	When the rider was riding his bike in such a sweltering day setting, he soon started to desperately need water as he was running out. So, his whole adventure then transformed into a desperate search for water. Being extremely thirsty was incredibly hard for him because it made him lose all motivation to keep going. He was so tired that every pedal stroke felt like a herculean effort. The thirst made the journey even more difficult on him. But at the same time, it also instilled more determination and strength within himself. He decided to keep on pushing forward, refusing to give up, and this inner resolve helped him continue his arduous journey in search of water.
946	6926	3	3	îDo not Exceed the posted speed limitî tells a compelling story of learning and determination. A single cyclist embarks on a challenging journey, biking through the vast deserts of California. Along this arduous path, the cyclist encounters various obstacles, like venomous snakes slithering across the road and a dire lack of water in the parched landscape. The descriptive features of the setting, with its endless sand and sweltering heat, greatly impact the protagonist during his journey. The essay is set in the early summer. As the cyclist prepares to rest for the day, he takes particular note of ìthe serenity of an early summer evening,î with the gentle breeze and the soft glow of the setting sun. He ends the day feeling calm, finding solace in the quiet of the desert night. The next morning, he wakes up excited and rejuvenated, his spirit ready to take on another day of biking. However, as the day progresses, the heat rises steadily. By mid - day, the cyclist starts to worry about his dwindling water supply. Undeterred, he boldly continues forth, reaching new terrain of rolling hills. Here, his energy begins to wane, and he starts to lose hope. He is deeply disappointed when the ìtownî he hoped to find turns out to be an abandoned juice factory, with broken windows and rusted machinery. The cyclist thinks he is going to die due to the blistering heat and lack of hydration. But he gathers his last bit of strength to turn the final bend and reaches a bait shop where he can stop and get water. Finally, he is relieved, and his journey continues. In conclusion, as the cyclist pedals through the California desert, the change in both weather and terrain coincide and affect the cyclistís physical and mental strength, yet he perseveres to keep traveling.
947	6927	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in numerous ways. For example, the story specifically states, ""I gathered up a few pebbles and stowed them in my mouth."" This quote clearly explains that the setting was arid and rocky, with pebbles scattered across the ground. The availability of these pebbles in the desolate setting benefits the cyclist by diverting his attention from the intense thirst. In that harsh environment, if there weren't any pebbles near the cyclist, he might not have made it through the difficult part of his journey. In conclusion, in the story ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" the cyclist was significantly benefited by the features of the unique setting, which provided a small but crucial means of relief in the face of adversity."
948	6928	3	3	The features of the setting affect any cyclist in a significant way. When a cyclist spends a great deal of time on the bicycle, they often encounter problems with their back. As they sit in the same position for long hours, the constant pressure on the spine can cause strain. When they become an older person, having spent so much time cycling, they will likely face serious back problems. These problems can be so severe that they may not be able to walk properly. The sedentary - like position on the bike, combined with the vibrations and the uneven terrain, takes a toll on the body over time. In conclusion, the setting of long - distance cycling, with its physical demands on the body, can have a lasting negative impact on a cyclist's health as they age.
949	6929	3	3	The setting in the essay ìRough Road ahead; Do not Exceed the speed limitî affected the narrator in multiple ways. The first and most prominent factor that influenced his ride was the intense heat. At the beginning of his journey, he didn't really notice the heat as much, perhaps distracted by the excitement of the ride. But as time went on, the sweltering heat began to slow him down, sapping his energy and making each pedal stroke a struggle. Then, the nature of the roads started to affect his ride. The roads transitioned from being flat and smooth like a sheet of glass to short, rolling hills. The constant up - and - down motion on the hills required more effort from the narrator, further exhausting him. The combination of the road change and the heat made him utter the words ìI could drop from heatstroke.î Moreover, because of the old and deserted towns he passed through, he faced a serious problem of getting water. The water pumps in these towns were so old and had been unused for such a long time that the water they provided was of very poor quality, making it almost undrinkable. In conclusion, the challenging setting of heat, difficult roads, and lack of clean water significantly hampered the narrator's cycling experience.
950	6930	3	3	The complex features of the setting affect the cyclist negatively throughout this story. His trip takes a turn for the worse as he progresses towards Yosemite. After seeking directions from the ìold codgers,î the author decides to take the shortcut, hoping for a quicker and easier route. However, he is deeply disappointed when he arrives at the first town. It is completely deserted, with empty buildings and overgrown weeds. He tries to brush it off though, and keeps ìthe cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite,î firmly in his mind as his motivation to keep going. He pedals on with determination, but as he continues, he begins to run out of water. When he arrives at a well, he discovers that the water is inedible, full of sediment and an unpleasant odor. Undeterred, he presses on. Just when it seems like things couldn't get any worse, his trail becomes rougher, with potholes and uneven ground, and his water supply is critically low. The cyclist is becoming dehydrated, and his hope starts to fade. His pessimism deepens when ìa ridiculously large snake - blocked the majority of the pavementÖî He has to carefully navigate around the menacing reptile. He keeps pushing forward and excitedly pedals toward a building in the distance, only to find it abandoned. In a desperate attempt to alleviate his dehydration, he even puts rocks in his mouth. Finally, when he finds the fish camp, he is filled with relief. All the obstacles he endured and overcame were worth it in the end, as he is one step closer to his destination.
951	6931	3	3	The journey of a solo cyclist is a lonely one. The cyclist in “Do not exceed posted speed limit” had a particularly hard journey, as it was made even worse by the desolate setting. His main opponent in the battle of staying alive was the blistering heat. In the vast California deserts on a sweltering day in June, it was no surprise that the sun would be beating down particularly harder than it would at another place at any other time. Also, as the terrain gradually became hillier, his journey became even more arduous. There is nothing hard about biking in a flat straight line. But constantly pedaling yourself up steep hills and around winding roads is no picnic. Just like the dilapidated buildings around him, the cyclist’s water supply deteriorated, as did his state of mind, as his trip which started out very joyful became increasingly more somber. “It didn’t really matter, I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.” This cyclist was fighting against the strong forces of nature, and the odds seemed stacked against him.
952	6932	3	3	In the short story, “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting plays an extremely important role. The story takes place in sunny California, where the cyclist was pedaling at a slow pace of around 12 mph. The scorching heat made his dehydration situation much worse. “I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.” The cyclist was losing hope, yet he was still determined to find water. This setting was very important to the story, for if it had taken place at a cooler, more populated location like a forest or a coastal town, it would not have made sense. The setting contributes to the story by raising the intensity of the situation, making the cyclist's struggle for survival all the more real and desperate.
953	6933	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because they started to mess with her mind. She didn't know where she was and on top of that, she got lost. Whether you see nothing around you or a lot around you, you're going to feel scared. They have the same effect. In the author's case, she was cycling and couldn't find any water. This is an overwhelming feeling because you can die from dehydration. She then kept cycling and saw nothing. “No one in sight; not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” That is alarming, having no water or people around, as if you are going to be just left to die. These settings would affect anyone who came across them. They definitely affected the cyclist because she was by herself, all alone on her journey. Plus, all she had was a tattered map, her trusty bike, and an empty water bottle, which made her situation even more dire.
954	6934	3	3	The features of this story tend to affect the cyclist very much. Because he took a shortcut in an attempt to save time, he had an even longer and more difficult journey than before. He found himself in the middle of nowhere, with barely any water left in his bottle. On top of all that, he was utterly exhausted from all the steep hills on the rough terrain. So, because he took a shortcut, it ended up costing him dearly in the long run, as he now faced a much greater struggle to complete his journey and stay alive.
955	6935	3	3	The features of the setting in the essay affected the cyclist because first of all, he listened to old folks that hadn't left their front porch in about ten years. He blindly followed their advice without considering other options. Then he didn't ask someone else's opinion on where to go and how to get there. His worst mistake, though, was not trusting the map he had with him the whole time. If he would have just trusted his map and not gone with what the old fella said, he wouldn't have almost died of heat stroke. In the end, his lack of judgment and trust in the wrong sources put his life in serious danger.
956	6936	3	3	In the essay, “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting affects him negatively because he was on his bicycle, pedaling under the scorching sun. He was in a hot, arid area with absolutely no water whatsoever. As seen in this quote, “I got down on my hands and knees, working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength. A tar - like substance oozed out.” In the quote, the cyclist finally thinks he has found a water pump but he really gets nothing. Also, another negative thing is that he thought he was never going to get to where he was going, feeling lost and hopeless in the vast expanse. But in the end, he persevered and got there, and he finally got some water, which was a great relief after his long - suffering. This shows how the harsh setting had a significant and initially negative impact on his journey.
957	6937	3	3	The setting in the story affects the main character greatly because of the intense heat. The main character is biking through a vast, desolate desert in the sweltering summer with only a meager supply of water. The searing heat of the setting provides a serious problem because the main character is at high risk of dehydration and heatstroke. The main character knows that if he passes out in the barren desert, where there is no one around to help, he will surely die. The main character says, “The growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke.” The main character is faced with a problem of man versus nature and the heat is winning. The blistering heat and the threat of dehydration sap the main character's energy while he is biking through the desert, pedaling desperately trying to make it to the next town. In summary, the main character's biggest problem is undoubtedly the heat of the setting, which makes his journey extremely challenging.
958	6938	3	3	The setting around the cyclist affected him in one main way. “About forty miles into the pedal, I arrived at the first ‘town’” (Kurmaskie). The cyclist put the word “town” in parentheses because it was actually a Ghost town. There was no one living there; it was completely abandoned. Around the cyclist was a vast expanse of deserts, and more empty, forlorn towns. As the cyclist got farther along, the more we realized the old men were wrong. The cyclist was running low on water and there was nowhere to stop, no place to replenish his supply. He cycled on, growing more and more anxious. Finally, he found some water and vowed to never listen to old men's directions again, having learned a hard - earned lesson from his difficult journey.
959	6939	3	3	All the features of the area have a big affect on the cyclist. It is a hot June morning, and he is on his bike, pedaling hard, covering many miles under the blazing sun. He can't find any water, because all the towns along the road are deserted, their streets empty and buildings dilapidated. He is getting dehydrated, and his strength is gradually ebbing away. It seems like he might have collapsed if he hadn't thought he was going to reach his destination and if he hadn't gotten some water at that store. The thought of reaching his goal kept him going. All in all, the setting seems to have the intention of defeating him, with its lack of resources and unforgiving heat.
960	6940	3	3	The features of the setting in “Rough Road: Do Not Exceed the Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie affects the cyclist in a very negative way. It begins slowly with the “ghost town”. The narrator “chuckled, checked my water supply and moved on”. He wasn't especially worried at that moment, but the fact he checked his water suggests that he'll need to ration it carefully for a while. The decline continues when he reaches the rock and the “ramshackle shed”. From the detailed description of the place, it clearly shows you he did not like it, and he confirms that with the words, “this sight was troubling”. He could tell right away that he would not be replenishing his water here. If this kind of situation continued, he would be in great danger, either from dehydration or from the overwhelming pessimism that the desolate setting brought. Eventually, he reached the road sign which declared that going over 55 mph was a bad idea. This is ironic, as he is only going 12 mph, struggling to move forward. As he put it in his own words, “sometimes life can be so cruel.” He quite obviously hates the setting, and it's all the fault of the harsh, unforgiving setting that made his journey so miserable.
961	6941	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because he had a very limited supply of water. He had to pedal harder to get up over the numerous hills, and he was getting severely dehydrated from the intense heat. For example, he had limited water because he had taken the directions from the old men, who perhaps underestimated the journey. As a result, he probably didn't bring as much water as he would have if he had taken a longer way. Furthermore, to get up the rolling hills, he had to pedal faster and with more force. That affected him because he would have been more exhausted from this strenuous pedaling. Moreover, it was a June day, and in June, the days are extremely hot. With the lack of a sufficient amount of water, the cyclist would have started to get dehydrated rapidly. This is how the setting affected the cyclist, significantly impacting his cycling experience.
962	6942	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For one, his body heat raised a good bit. They don't come out and say it directly, but they do mention, “The sun was beginning to beat down.” We all know that when you're outside on a hot day, your body temperature rises as well. This increase in body heat also probably added to his dehydration. As a long - distance runner, I know from personal experience what the sun can do to you during a hot day. It can make you feel fatigued and cause you to lose a large amount of water through sweating. That is how the setting affects the cyclist, clearly showing the influence of the environmental conditions on his physical state.
963	6943	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in a major way. For one, if the desert was not a deserted mountainous area in California, with its harsh and arid conditions, then the cyclist would not have the same problems. By changing any one feature of the setting, such as the terrain or the climate, you would change how the cyclist would behave in the setting. Thus changing the entire plot of the story. If the cyclist was, say, in an urban or a more developed area, then he would not face the same dangers as if he were in a mountainous region. In a developed area, he would have easier access to water and assistance. The settings features have a huge affect on the cyclist, determining the challenges and outcomes of his journey.
964	6944	3	3	In the story “Rough Road ahead: do not exceed posted speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting seem negative to the cyclist. The setting seems to start worrying the cyclist two miles after he confidently said that he could make the next @NUM1 miles easily. For example, the cyclist says, “Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.” At that point, the cyclist seems worried that things aren't going to be as easy as they seemed they were going to be. His tone becomes more cautious and concerned. From that point on, the setting seemed to get worse for the cyclist. Later on, the cyclist ends up saying, “It didn't really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.” That was when the cyclist began to notice his intense fear of dehydration. The cyclist ended up making it through the difficult journey, and he realized what a big effect nature can have on you, both physically and mentally.
965	6945	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by unexpected things happening. His water supply got drank quickly, leaving him parched. He couldn't find a town near, and he was in the desert - like California, where the sun was beating down mercilessly on him. When he did reach one town, it was more of a “ghost town,” with a desolate and abandoned look. It had rusted pumps that had a battery - oil tasting liquid, which was completely undrinkable. Every person he asked told him water was near, but due to dehydration, his movements were sluggish, and it took him longer to reach potential water sources. The roads got windy, making it difficult to maintain balance, and small hills occurred frequently. There was a large snake in the middle of the road, adding to his sense of danger, as the tumbleweed blew by. Finally, he saw a town that had a bait shop and was able to get water and cool down, ending his ordeal in the challenging setting.
966	6946	3	3	"The setting in “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not @CAPS1 Posted Speed Limit” definitely affected the author. The cyclist states, ""Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills"" (Kurmaskie @NUM1). These sudden changes in the terrain from flat stretches to hilly areas meant that the cyclist probably found it more difficult to navigate through the ""hills"" as opposed to the ""Flat roads,"" making him more quickly tired. The speaker states, “I could drop from heatstroke” (Kurmaskie @NUM2). The speaker is implying that it is so swelteringly hot outside that he could faint from a ‘heatstroke’ which could slow him down significantly. The speaker also states, ""water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees"" (Kurmaskie @NUM3). The author did not have any good water to drink, because it was so hot outside, which affected him in that he was dehydrated. Many aspects of the setting affected the cyclist, ultimately making his journey a challenging one."
967	6947	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because if the old men didn't give the boy advice then he probably wouldn't have run into all the trouble he ran into. The advice might have led him astray from his intended path. At the same time, despite the difficulties, the boy made his way to where he was going. However, the experience was terrifying for him. Next time though he will just use his map so he doesn't have to go through the scare of death again, ensuring a safer and more straightforward journey.
968	6948	3	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist by the road’s condition being rough as the cyclist rides further along the road. The rough surface of the road makes it difficult for the cyclist to maintain a steady speed and balance. Every bump and uneven patch on the road jolts the cyclist, causing discomfort and increasing the risk of an accident. This rough road condition clearly has a negative impact on the cyclist's journey, highlighting the significance of the setting on the cyclist's experience.
969	6949	3	3	The setting of this short story has a big affect on the cyclist. Since the story takes place in the desert, the temperature is extremely hot, with the sun beating down relentlessly. The cyclist only packed enough water for the intended trip. Since he made a few wrong turns, he ended up needing more water than he had planned. There were no signs of civilization so he could not stop anywhere and buy water. He came to a “run-down” rusty fauret and tried to drink water from it, but it was hot and tasted like battery acid, which was of no real help to his dehydration. If this short story had a different setting, then the story would not make much sense. For example, if the story would have taken place in @LOCATION1 he could have just stopped and bought water easily. The setting is one of the most important elements in a story as it shapes the challenges and experiences of the characters.
970	6950	3	3	The features affect the cyclist in many ways. For example the road, the rocks everything close by can pose a threat. The cyclist needs to know everything about where he's going, because if not then he can run into some problems along the way. For example like snakes hiding in the grass, rough terrain that can damage the bike, and rocks in the way that can cause him to lose balance. That's why it's important for a cyclist to never listen to anyone but themselves and rely on their own judgment. That's why when you see cyclists you often see them around a road where there are cars around, just in case they get into trouble and need immediate assistance.
971	6951	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because they give the story more life, add more meaning, and make it fun to read. This enriches the overall experience for the reader as they can better understand the cyclist's journey within the described environment.
972	6952	3	3	At times when the features of the setting are bad, it can have a great impact on the cyclist. For one, if it’s too hot, the cyclist is going to need plenty of water if he/she doesn't want to be dehydrated. There are also the dangers of heat strokes and deadly snakes, which cyclists might want to avoid. When you're a cyclist, times can be hard, so it's essential to be prepared for the long run to ensure a safe and successful journey.
973	6953	3	3	The setting in the story “Rough Road Ahead Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” really goes against the cyclist and his journey. This is because in the places he goes, there is no water, and if there is, it is really hot or bad water. For example, on page @NUM1 it says, “a tarlike substance oozed out, but the water wouldn't cool down,” which clearly explains how bad the water was when the cyclist was there. This poor water situation significantly hinders the cyclist's progress and well - being during the journey.
974	6954	3	3	During this essay, the author is talking about his journey, sharing details of the experiences, challenges, and discoveries he made along the way. Through his descriptions, the reader can get a sense of the unique aspects of this particular journey and the impact it had on the author.
975	6955	3	3	The features of the setting included nice cool pines and then a ghost town, with it being hot out, the danger of @CAPS1, poisonous snacks, and hills that were getting harder to go up. When he first started, the pines were nice and cool, but when he scanned the ghost town, he got discouraged. Then it started to get hot, and when he saw the snake, he thought that it was a deformed baby and was nervous. Then he was afraid of dehydration, and then the hills started to make it harder and harder. This combination of difficult setting features made his journey a real struggle from start to finish.
976	6956	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he has to use more energy to pedal up the steep hills and navigate through the rough, rocky terrain. As a result, his body works harder and loses more fluids. Therefore, he drank more water to stay hydrated. When he couldn't find any water sources along the way, his situation became quite desperate.
977	6957	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in several ways. The first was the terrain, which started out as a smooth, flat road, then gradually turned to a series of short, rolling hills. The cyclist was steadily growing tired from all the continuous pedaling. “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” This change in terrain tired him out faster, since going uphill is significantly harder than riding on flat terrain. The intense heat definitely affected him, because it made him extremely thirsty. He was “travelling through the high deserts of California in June.” This is a very hot time of year, and when a person gets lost without conserving water properly, which he had not done, that person gets extremely thirsty. Not to mention the “sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth,” which would constantly remind the body of its thirst. So, overall, the setting most definitely affected the cyclist in a negative way.
978	6958	3	3	In the story, the cyclist is greatly affected by the features of the setting. For example, the setting has nothing but desolate ghost towns for miles on end, which makes it absolutely impossible to find any water. Also, it’s a harsh desert - like setting, with the scorching sun beating down, adding to his intense thirst. Another example is the numerous hills that he had to pedal up, which made him even more parched. It was June in California, so it must have been pretty swelteringly hot. Moreover, the town that he arrived at had no water because it seemed completely deserted. Another example is the salt that he put under his tongue. It’s a simple yet effective trick that lets you survive a lot more effectively in such conditions. Therefore, the settings affected his journey significantly and made him wish he hadn’t taken the old man’s advice as it led him into this difficult situation.
979	6959	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. Three key features I found were the lack of water, the intense heat, and the poor conditions and limits of the road. The lack of water really affected the cyclist. When he was dead - tired, he didn't have anything to drink. The essay stated how he/she would say they would save the water until the end. But he/she was so exhausted that the lack of water really took a toll on him/her. The conditions he/she was in really affected the cyclist also. From the very beginning, he/she was given the wrong directions. That was the main reason why he/she was lost throughout the entire journey. Finally, the limits of the road affected the cyclist. The steep hills and uneven different grounds did not help the cyclist at all. In conclusion, the cyclist had many factors affecting him such as the lack of water, the limits of the road, and his/her difficult conditions, which made his journey extremely challenging.
980	6960	3	3	I think that the features of the setting affect the cyclist greatly. First, I think the harsh weather conditions affect him severely. I think this because in the passage it says, “I could drop from heatstroke.” Meaning, it's really swelteringly hot! The high temperature makes it difficult for him to keep going. Also, I think the fact that he has no water left is affecting him badly because it says in the passage, “I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.” This has a big impact on him, because he's very thirsty and his body is not functioning properly. Also, I think the fact that there is nothing around him is affecting him mentally. I think this because in the passage it says there were no cars, which means no help or signs of civilization. I think all these things combined affect him to the point where his journey becomes extremely difficult and his well - being is at risk.
981	6961	3	3	In “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the desolate and harsh setting significantly affects the cyclist. The cyclist, seeking guidance, takes advice from some old guys at a small roadside stop, and soon ends up wishing he never did. He finds himself on an empty, flat, and dry road stretching as far as the eye can see. As he pedals steadily, he consumes all of the water he has in his bottles, and soon realizes he desperately needs to stop for more. “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June,” he laments. He stops at an old rusted pump to get more water, but once, all that comes out is some tar - like stuff, leaving a foul taste in his mouth. Then, he can't find another place to refill for quite a while. The flat road gradually gives way to short, rolling hills, and he comes across a sign that says “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Speed Limit”. Along the way, he passes tumbleweeds that seem to dance in the hot wind and a large, menacing snake coiled on the side of the road. All of these things impact his journey, filling him with fear and forcing him to exercise caution. When he finally reaches a small diner with a working water tap, he is finally satisfied. Because it is swelteringly hot and the landscape is empty, he is more thirsty, clearly showing that the setting affected the cyclist and made his journey a challenging one.
982	6962	3	3	He feels utterly alone as there is no one around him to offer a push or a word of encouragement. Yet, he keeps going, gritting his teeth and trying to push himself to the very end with the sole aim of winning. The fast - paced roads are not only rough but also full of small potholes that jolt his bike with every turn. The hills he encounters are tall and steep, their slopes seemingly endless. But he is a man of determination, his resolve unwavering. Despite the physical and mental challenges, he continues his arduous journey, knowing that the finish line will bring the sweet taste of victory. In the end, his determination keeps him in the race, driving him forward until he crosses that long - awaited finish line.
983	6963	3	3	Heat, the desolation of abandoned roads, and the presence of snakes are all significant reasons that affected the cyclist's journey. The intense heat in the arid landscape made him get dehydrated at a much faster rate while he was expending energy on the bike. The long, empty, and abandoned roads seemed to stretch into infinity, further increasing his doubt about surviving the whole bike ride. With each passing mile, his anxiety grew as he realized how isolated he was. He used up all of his water in no time. So, when he finally reached an old pump, hot and dirty water with a strange, metallic smell came out. The snake in the story, a large and venomous - looking one, slithered across his path, making the journey for this guy perilous and deadly. This entire series of unfortunate events happened because he listened to the old guys at a small rest stop. When another old guy was about to tell him where to go, he arrogantly said no, sealing his fate with a difficult and dangerous journey. In conclusion, his choice to follow the advice of some and ignore others, combined with the harsh setting, made his bike ride a nightmare.
984	6964	3	3	The features and the setting affect the cyclist a great deal. One crucial reason is that he was in the vast desert. As seen in the quote “through high deserts of California,” this indicates that it was extremely hot, with the sun beating down mercilessly. In such conditions, he could easily pass out from a heat stroke, a very real and terrifying possibility. Then, to make matters worse, he could not even get any clean water. As described in the quote “of the rusted water pump,” it was a clear indication of how old and dilapidated it was. When the cyclist managed to get some water out, it tasted like old battery acid, a foul and unpleasant flavor that made him gag. The heat of the desert, the lack of clean water, and the dilapidated infrastructure all contributed to a difficult and dangerous situation for the cyclist. Therefore, the features and setting clearly affected the cyclist, turning his journey into a battle for survival.
985	6965	3	3	The features of the setting intensely affect the cyclist over a period of time. Destined to reach Yosemite National Park from Lodi, California, a determined cyclist rode strongly through the gentle evening, the cool breeze caressing his face. His initial journey was smooth, his legs pumping rhythmically as he made good progress. However, when the setting changed, so did the effect it had on the cyclist. When the man reached the first town, which was completely deserted, with boarded - up shops and empty streets, his energy began depleting rapidly because the sun began to come into the picture, its harsh rays beating down on him. Next, he came to a shed, his throat parched and his body desperate for water. Only to find rusty pumps with water that was clearly tainted and unsafe, a murky liquid that he dared not drink. When the flat terrain gradually turned to rolling hills, the man was entirely exhausted. “With what I believed to be my last burst of energy, I maneuvered down the hill,” he wrote. That quote directly describes what the man was feeling and how the hills affected him, sapping his remaining strength. When the man stumbled across a fish camp with a clean water source, he became reloaded and replenished with the confidence he had before when he “rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile”. The changing setting, with its various challenges, had a profound impact on the cyclist's journey, but his encounter with the fish camp gave him a new lease on his quest to reach Yosemite.
986	6966	3	3	The setting affected the cyclist in many ways. For example, he was riding in the vast, arid desert where all the towns he was going to were completely abandoned, with dilapidated buildings and empty streets. The month was June, a notoriously hot month, and the intense sun was beating down mercilessly on him. And he was cycling with very little water, just a meager bottle that was quickly running out. With the lack of water and the scorching heat, his journey became extremely challenging, but he still pressed on, hoping to reach a better place.
987	6967	3	3	In the essay “Do Not @CAPS1 Posted Speed Limit”, the setting affects the cyclist in many ways. When the cyclist arrived at the first town, he described it as a desolate ghost town with broken windows and overgrown weeds. This affected the cyclist because he started to have serious doubts about the directions he received, but he was eagerly looking forward to the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite, so he mustered the determination to persevere. The setting of the next landmark was similar to the last. There was a dilapidated shed, a few rusty pipes that were barely holding together, and a corral that “Couldn’t hold in the lamest mule.” This made the cyclist more wary of the path ahead because he was running critically low on water. The next place was also similar. There was an abandoned @ORGANIZATION1 with faded signs and a crumbling facade. The cyclist was running out of water and now thought he was going to die because everything was deserted. Then, finally, the setting changed. There was a store that was actually opened, with a welcoming sign and a few customers inside. The cyclist then felt a wave of happiness and relief wash over him. That is how the different settings affected the cyclist.
988	6968	3	3	The author’s setting described a difficult terrain and harsh weather for bike riding. The author said that it was early summer, which means it could be hot and sweltering weather for the cyclist. The author also mentioned that when the cyclist reached the first town, the sun began to bear down intensely. That means the temperature is going to rise significantly since the sun is getting stronger. Riding a bike in hot weather is very difficult because it takes a great deal of effort and makes your body dehydrate faster because the heat makes you sweat profusely, which lowers your water retention rapidly. Another feature of the setting that the author described was the cyclist’s location. He was traveling through the high deserts of California, where the sand was hot under the wheels and the air was dry. This gives you a sense of how much hotter it is since he’s traveling through deserts during early summer while the sun is high. After the first couple of towns, he starts to ride on short, rolling hills that seemed to go on forever. Hills take a bigger toll on a person’s body because it takes more effort to pedal up a hill, and his legs were starting to ache with each push. Overall, the setting made the cyclist's journey an arduous one.
989	6969	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist greatly. From the desolate ghost town to the small bait shop, it was all a formidable challenge for him. A misleading challenge, but a challenge nonetheless. In the desert, where the sand stretched as far as the eye could see, water grew scarce and he tried everything to push himself forward. From staring intently at the distant horizon to get from one place to another, to sucking on a smooth pebble stone to not focus on his parching thirst. And when he arrived at the bait shop, a wave of relief washed over him, like that shop was his safe haven in the vast expanse of the desert. But yet he would never get directions from any old - timer again. Luck was not a factor in this story. Rather it was his inner drive and the overall harsh climate of the story. When it was still two - hundred degrees of heat left and no water left in his bottles, he pushed himself towards the glimmer of hope. And also when he saw a building in the distance, he was determined to get to it, knowing it might be his salvation. In the end, his perseverance through the tough setting was truly remarkable.
990	6970	3	3	The cyclist was trying to make it to Yosemite National Park. The cyclist was in Lodi, California when he decided to ask for directions from old codgers sitting on a bench outside a store so that he could take a short cut. He followed their directions and little did he know that he should have stuck to his original directions. The cyclist was traveling through the high deserts of California in June, where the heat was almost unbearable. The cyclist became very hot and extremely thirsty from traveling in the desert. It says in the text “when I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid” This shows that he had no clean water left to keep him hydrated throughout his travel. His throat was dry and scratchy, and his lips were chapped. Also in the text it says “with what I believed was my last burst of energy, I maneuvered down the hill” this shows that he had no energy left, his legs were like lead, and he was barely able to keep his balance on the bike. Despite these hardships, he still held onto the hope of reaching Yosemite.
991	6971	3	3	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, he traverses all sorts of settings where the situation could either improve or deteriorate. “I noticed the terrain changing; flat roads were replaced with short rolling hills” (Kurmaskie). This clearly shows that the going is about to get a bit more arduous as he will now have to pedal uphill, and to make matters worse, he is almost out of water. “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or any kind of structure” (Kurmaskie). This indicates that the cyclist cannot obtain water or a ride from anywhere nearby because there is simply nothing in the vicinity. These are the ways in which the setting features have an impact on the cyclist, ultimately affecting his journey and his ability to continue.
992	6972	3	3	Almost all the features of the setting significantly affect the cyclist. For instance, the sweltering heat causes him to consume a large amount of water and constantly be in need of more. In the story, it elaborately describes how extremely thirsty and sweaty he is. “The water bottles contain only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of sweat circled my shirt.” These vivid descriptions strongly suggest that he is extremely hot as he is sweating profusely and has been drinking so much. Another prominent feature of the setting is the numerous rolling hills that make him feel as if he will never reach the next town. “I began breaking the ride down into distances I could make it tests for.” He is essentially dividing the long ride into a series of short rides so that he can mentally and physically endure it. In conclusion, the setting features, such as the heat and the hills, have a profound and negative impact on the cyclist's journey.
993	6973	3	3	The setting described by the author was extremely challenging for three main reasons: distance, water, and the heat. All of these factors only served to multiply the effects of one another. As time passed, the cyclist gradually grew exhausted from the scorching heat. In one particular sentence, the cyclist clearly described the severe effect of the heat. The long distance he had to cover made him more and more fatigued, and the lack of water exacerbated his situation. The heat, on top of everything, made his journey even more unbearable. In summary, the combination of these three factors in the setting made the cyclist's experience extremely difficult and challenging.
994	6974	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in numerous ways. The scenery gradually makes the cyclist turn worried, unconfident, and ultimately, in an ironic twist, hopeful. When the cyclist first came upon the so - called “town,” he described it as having only “one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral.” I firmly believe this is the moment when the cyclist realized things were not as expected and began to worry. Moreover, since he couldn't refill his water supply, the fear of dehydration also set in. Already tired from the journey, the cyclist became unconfident when he saw the sign reading, “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” Knowing that this would be a long and slow journey, the cyclist started to doubt his ability to make it. Finally, when passing the sign saying, ""Gary and Wilber's fish camp – If you want bait for the big ones, we’ve your best bet,"" the cyclist reached a hopeful stage because he knew he had finally found civilization again. This clearly shows that one's atmosphere and surroundings can indeed have a significant impact on their general mood, just as it did with the cyclist."
995	6975	3	3	The way the features of the setting affect the cyclist is by either making the ride effortless for him or extremely tough. In the essay, it mentions “No Town,” and without a town, there is no access to water. The lack of water can easily lead to dehydration, which is a serious threat to the cyclist's well - being. It also states that the flat roads gradually turned into “short, rolling hills.” This implies that the path ahead became more difficult, making it hard for the cyclist to stay focused on his ride. These are prime examples of how the setting can have a direct and substantial impact on the cyclist. In conclusion, the setting features play a crucial role in determining the ease or difficulty of the cyclist's journey.
996	6976	3	3	The setting affects the cyclist because the path is on a road with many hills. These numerous hills make the cyclist tired as he has to pedal harder to ascend them. Also, if the cyclist is in a place with extremely cold or hot weather, it would affect his body temperature and attitude. In cold conditions, he might shiver and lose dexterity, while in hot weather, he could become overly fatigued and irritable. This shows how the setting can significantly impact the cyclist's physical and mental state.
997	6977	3	3	The settings in this article affect the cyclist by forcing him to bike a long distance, perhaps 50 miles or more, to get to the next town. The cyclist has a limited amount of water, maybe just one small bottle, and it's swelteringly hot out, with the sun beating down relentlessly. There's nothing in sight for miles and miles, no shade, no signs of civilization. This desolate and harsh setting makes the cyclist's journey extremely challenging and exhausting.
998	6978	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in that he shows his frustration to other people. He shouldn't reveal to others where he has to go because it might put him in an uncomfortable situation. By sharing his destination, he could attract unwanted attention or face potential risks. In the end, keeping his route private would be a wiser choice for the cyclist.
999	6979	3	3	In the essay “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” many features of the setting affected the cyclist. And these settings could be easily identified in the middle part of the essay. These settings caused the cyclist to become exhausted on his journey. First, the cyclist noticed a road change from flat to short, rolling hills. He had to exert more energy to pedal up the hills, which gradually depleted a certain amount of his energy reserves. Then, his lack of water, perhaps having only a few sips left in his bottle, caused him to enter a dehydrated state. He could lose another large amount of energy due to this. Out of this stage, he mostly needed someone to support him or be by his side, but he was riding alone. There was no one in sight, not a single building, car, or structure of any kind. This isolation might cause his emotional state to break down, further leading to a loss of energy. Overall, the cyclist suffered a significant loss of energy on his journey and was unable to have a supporter to help him through this difficult time.
1000	6980	3	3	The setting affects the cyclist because it can provide clear landmarks and precise directions. For example, the narrator states, “They’d sounded so sure of themselves when pointing out landmarks and spouting off towns I would come to along this breezy jaunt” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). These landmarks, such as a distinctive old tree or a unique rock formation, can serve as reliable guides for the cyclist during his journey. They help him stay on track and know exactly where he is and where he's headed. This shows that the landmarks can effectively provide essential landmarks and directions along a journey, making the cyclist's travel more efficient and less confusing.
1001	6981	3	3	In the story “Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed posted speed limit”, the cyclist encounters some very rough obstacles on his arduous journey to Yosemite National Park. With his lack of water and the intense dryness, he runs into a big snake that he thinks is a diamond black. He calmly and easily passes the snake and then moves on. Being in the intense heat and having no water, he never gives up and firmly knows he can make it to the park safely. The reason why he goes this way is because of those “old - timers who haven’t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in the office”. These guys gave him wrong directions. That really affected the cyclist because all of the other troubles wouldn’t have happened if he had paid attention to his surroundings and the people around him. In the end, his determination will hopefully see him through to his destination.
1002	6982	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist on different occasions in different ways. For instance, when arriving at the first town, the author calls it an average ghost town. Despite the desolate appearance, he continues on with unwavering confidence. The next building he saw was an abandoned Welch’s Juice bottle factory. On the building was a sign with a boy drinking a cold glass of juice. This sight intimidates the reader and makes the cyclist begin to question the wisdom of the old men. Continuing on his journey, he reaches another building. To his great relief, it’s a bolt shop that was still in business. He quickly goes to the sink immediately to drink the water. At this point, he is relieved to have water and to be near civilization instead of being in the dessert without a sight of life or a building. Therefore, his surroundings throughout the story make him feel indifferent at times, confident at others, and finally relieved, which all contribute to the overall experience of his journey.
1003	6983	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the roads are rough and uneven. He has to push out more energy to pedal his bike on these rough, uneven roads than on nice, paved, even roads. Moreover, he is out of water. So, he is using all his energy without any means of refreshment. This lack of water and the difficult road conditions put a great strain on the cyclist. As a result, his progress is slower and he has to work much harder to keep going. In the end, these factors clearly show how the setting can have a significant impact on the cyclist's journey.
1004	6984	3	3	The setting's effect on a cyclist can be pretty complicated. So many things have to be prepared for you to be a successful cyclist. First up, you have to be prepared for the weather. For example, when there are serious weather conditions like rain or snow, you have to be careful of slippery roads. Also, what they have to be prepared for are long rides. Some rides might be from @NUM1 miles, so they have to bring plenty of food and water to sustain themselves. Another factor that a cyclist has to face is the condition of the bike. For instance, he/she has to make sure the bikes are in good condition and will cooperate smoothly. Also, if work needs to be done to the bike, then it can be worked on promptly. Another effect on a cyclist is whether the cyclist is in shape. For instance, if the cyclist is in good shape, he/she is able to ride for a long period of time without getting overly fatigued. Finally, another important aspect is that the cyclist has to know where he/she is going. For instance, the man in the story didn't know where to go, so that's an important keypoint. Overall, all these aspects need to be considered for a successful cycling journey.
1005	6985	3	3	The setting of where a cyclist takes their journey significantly affects the cyclist. The reason I say that is because in the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”, the cyclist came upon a conflict with the setting. The conflict was that it was very hot, and he did not utilize little things that could have helped him survive, but he still persevered. The sweltering heat made his journey extremely difficult, and his lack of proper preparation due to the setting added to his struggles. These are the reasons why I say the setting of where a cyclist takes their journey matters. In conclusion, a cyclist should always take the setting into account to better prepare for their journey.
1006	6986	3	3	The setting in the short story “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed speed Limit” greatly affects the cyclist. The rough, uneven terrain and the blazing, unforgiving sun test him and make him suffer in ways he never imagined. At one point, after the cyclist has been going for hours on end, he notes, “Over on long crippling hill, a building came into view. I wiped sweat from my stinging eyes to make sure it wasn't a mirage…” This harsh setting has caused the cyclist to become so severely dehydrated that he can't think clearly. The cyclist is well - aware of the dangers of the setting around him. As you can see, the setting has a very strong impact on the cyclist, influencing his physical and mental state throughout the journey.
1007	6987	3	3	The cyclist was affected by long hours of strenuous bike - riding into the unfamiliar areas where he had never been before. The unfamiliarity of the roads, the changing landscapes, and the lack of known landmarks all took a toll on him. As he continued, fatigue set in, and he began to question his ability to keep going. In conclusion, the long - distance ride into uncharted areas had a significant impact on the cyclist, both physically and mentally.
1008	6988	3	3	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the cyclist is affected by the setting mentally and physically. For example, the setting affected the cyclist mentally because it was all arid desert and shifting sand with no sign of water. He was filled with despair and thought he was going to die, saying, “I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.” If he had some water to quench his thirst, he would not have had such dire thoughts. Also, the cyclist was affected physically because the rough, bumpy road seemed as if it could go on forever. He was gradually losing energy and was getting extremely tired from riding up all the steep hills with little water left in his parched body. It was swelteringly hot, and the situation seemed hopeless. But if he was riding through the lush evergreen forest, with its cool shade and possible water sources, I don't think he would have felt this way. In conclusion, the cyclist was affected by the setting physically and mentally. If he had not been riding in the desert, he would not have endured such distress.
1009	6989	3	3	In the essay, “Rough Road ahead” the character sees many settings through his ride, all of which affect his mood and physical condition. For example, when the author describes one place he came to as, “one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps and a corral that couldn't hold in the lamest mute greeted me. This sight was troubling,” this was the turning point where the cyclist began to worry deeply. He was running out of water, “The sun was beginning to beat down mercilessly,” and he was probably exhausted from hours of pedaling. But, to make matters worse, he came to a series of rolling hills. This affected him because he had to exert more energy and had less water to rejuvenate himself. When he finally got to a “modernized” town with its proper amenities, his spirits were lifted, and he was able to get water to cool his overheated body down. This gave him more strength and will - power to continue his trip to Yosemite park, showing how settings can have a profound impact on his journey.
1010	6990	3	3	The setting of the story has a huge affect because it was such an empty, desolate terrain that made him rely on only himself because of the lack of other people to help. For example, if he was riding through a bustling city for hours, he could easily stop and take a well - deserved break in a store or get water from about anywhere. But being in the vast, silent desert, it really tested his inner strength to keep going and reach safety. The isolation and the harsh conditions forced him to dig deep within himself and find the determination to overcome the challenges. In conclusion, the desolate desert setting had a profound impact on the cyclist, highlighting the importance of self - reliance in difficult situations.
1011	6991	3	3	In the essay, I can conclude that there were numerous features of the land that had a significant impact on the cyclist. For example, in the text it states “ridiculously large snake…blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.” If you have an intense fear of snakes, this could completely ruin your entire trip. The cyclist was initially scared but managed to overcome the fear and continue moving forward. Also, another factor that affected the cyclist was the shortage of water. Not having an adequate supply of water can be extremely detrimental. As stated “I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June…” There are indeed many features that affected the cyclist and his journey, highlighting how the land's elements can pose challenges during travel.
1012	6992	3	3	In Joe Kurmaskie’s, “Rough Road Ahead Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” there are several notable features that impact the cyclist. “...and I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June” (Kurmaskie). Deserts in June are notoriously extremely hot and dry, which caused the cyclist to become dehydrated at a rapid pace. “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” The transition from flat lands to hilly terrain made the ride far more strenuous on the cyclist, requiring more effort and energy. These conditions directly affect the cyclist, making the journey more difficult and challenging.
1013	6993	3	3	The cyclist was attempting to reach Yosemite National Park. He was riding through the deserts in June, a time when the heat is intense. By the end of the journey on the stony path, the cyclist barely had any water left. To make matters worse, when he desperately needed water, a large number of buildings in the area were abandoned, offering no source of relief. This clearly shows how the setting, with its harsh climate and lack of resources, had a negative impact on him, demonstrating the challenges one can face due to the environment during a journey.
1014	6994	3	3	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead” the setting does have a profound effect on the cyclist. He has been pedaling for an extended period, and as a result, he is becoming severely dehydrated. “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly. I was in the @LOCATION1.” The long - distance pedaling in the particular setting is taking a toll on his water supply. Another reason the setting affects him is that he is starting to see mirages. “A sandblasted picture of a boy pouring a refreshing glass of grape juice into his mouth could still be seen.” These mirages are a sign of his deteriorating physical state due to the harsh setting, emphasizing how the environment can impact a cyclist's well - being.
1015	6995	3	3	The features such as insufficient water and a poor sense of direction have a significant impact on the cyclist. He needs water to maintain the energy required for continuous pedaling. He also needs maps to accurately determine the direction and know where he is going. Due to the lack of water, he said “I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean, leaving only some expensive outdoor gear and a lost entry in place of old men, their wisdom, and their sense of direction. I made a mental note to change that paragraph.” This statement implies that the old man’s sense of direction was outdated. They seemed to be in a large porch but had no idea where anything was located. These features clearly hinder the cyclist's progress and well - being during his journey.
1016	6996	3	3	The features of the setting are that it is extremely hot and parched. The way that it affects the cyclist is that he gets swelteringly hot and he drinks almost all of his water rapidly. He only has about @NUM1 sips left when he finally reaches the other town. It also affects him because he had a minor advantage. The advantage that he had was he left well before the sun came up. So then he had a brief time to stay cool. Another part of the setting that affects the cyclist is when he ascends some of the hills, he gets a little bit of the wind on his face. Also, when the cyclist was desperately thirsty he put pebbles into his mouth to moisten his dry throat. This challenging setting truly tested the cyclist's endurance.
1017	6997	3	3	Setting plays a crucial part in the cyclist's mood and energy. For example, on a pleasantly cool @DATE1 day, while riding gently downhill with a light breeze, the rider is visibly happy and full of energy. However, “traveling through the high deserts of California in June is not the best environment for laughs and ease.” The cyclist in the story was extremely hot, completely exhausted, and struggling to stay hydrated. He thought, “I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.” The harshness of the desert sun and the lack of comfort in such a setting clearly took a toll on him. Where the cyclist rides can have a huge effect on the cyclist himself, as these two scenarios vividly demonstrate.
1018	6998	3	3	The cyclist was riding his bike steadily, with the goal of reaching Yosemite. He was well - aware that he had a lack of water, but he decided to press on anyway. As he continued his journey, he had to go past a large snake lying in the middle of the path. The sudden sight of the snake made him jump in fear and his heart raced. Despite this scare, he managed to compose himself and kept pedaling towards his destination, showing his determination in the face of difficulties.
1019	6999	3	3	All the features of the settings, such as the uneven terrain, the strong winds, and the changing weather, affect his rhythm, determination, and will to win. It sets him off his goal a little bit when he should just try to ignore these distractions the best as he can, instead of dwelling on them. If I was him, I would just focus on riding my bike and keep thinking about the sweet taste of victory! By not letting the setting get to him, he can stay on track and increase his chances of achieving his goal.
1020	7000	3	3	To a cyclist, the surrounding setting can either cause triumph or despair. The cyclist was unfortunately given very old and inaccurate directions. He was directed to back roads that are now completely abandoned. These towns usually had no people in them, and under normal circumstances, that would not matter. But he “was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” (@NUM1). If there was shade to protect him from the scorching sun, a refreshing breeze to cool him down, and @NUM2 mild weather, he would be fine. However, he is pedaling a bike in a blistering desert during the summer. A “ghost town” with no access to good water could have easily killed him. A cyclist needs to know their surroundings thoroughly and be well - prepared for what nature throws at them to avoid such life - threatening situations.
1021	7001	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many different ways. First of all, when the cyclist came across the “ghost town,” he felt utterly alone and deeply discouraged. The desolate streets and empty buildings around him made him feel like he was in a forgotten place. He felt like he was never going to find his way and there was no one there to offer him even a shred of help. Also, the long hilly highway with nothing but arid desert on either side basically gave him the discouraging feeling that this endless road was never going to end and there was no way out of the situation he had started. The heat from the sun beating down on him made the journey even more torturous. The dry air and lack of shade made it seem like the desert was sucking the life out of him. It was so dry that there was no water in sight, and it made him feel so much thirstier than he actually was. Overall, it had really significant physical and psychological effects on him, wearing him down both physically and mentally.
1022	7002	3	3	In the story “Do not exceed posted speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist runs into a couple of tough obstacles and they affected him in many ways. In the story, the cyclist is riding a bike for miles under the scorching sun. “Tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.... in my dehydrated state.” This quote only lists a few of his problems. He had to deal with tumbleweeds constantly getting in his way, a huge snake that made him scared, and he was severely dehydrated. The heat was making him feel dizzy and weak. He had to stick pebbles in his mouth because he heard that they take away your dehydration, but it was just a small relief. All throughout the story, he ran into many problems or obstacles but overcame them very well, showing his remarkable determination and resilience.
1023	7003	3	3	The features of the setting greatly affect the cyclist. Some of these features include: the intense heat, dangerous animals, the lack of much civilization, and the challenging terrain. In the essay, each of these features was spoken of and they all affected the cyclist in a negative way. For example, when the cyclist headed into the intense heat, he desperately needed to find a town. The first “town” he found he described as a “ghost town,” with empty buildings and no signs of life. It took a while to find another town and he had been sipping from his water bottles pretty regularly. He was travelling through the high deserts of California in June, so the sun was blazing and he was getting really dehydrated and on the verge of collapse. The flat road being replaced by short, rolling hills wasn't helping either. The terrain really affected the energy he had to exert in order to keep going. Along with being dehydrated, the cyclist had to deal with dangerous animals. During his journey, “a ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the road,” which startled him and made him realize the potential danger he was in. The features of the setting definitely affected the cyclist in many significant ways, making his journey extremely difficult.
1024	7004	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. First, the intense heat made the cyclist overheated. For instance, the weather was sunny in June, with the sun shining brightly and the temperature soaring. The heat radiated from the ground, making the air around him feel like an oven. This made him sweat profusely, losing a lot of body fluids. Also, the hills made the cyclist very tired. The slopes were steep and required a great deal of effort to climb. For example, the cyclist was losing energy rapidly and had to keep pushing himself up the hills, his legs aching with each pedal stroke. Lastly, the setting had no places that could have helped the cyclist. The area was barren and desolate. For instance, the cyclist had trouble finding a place with water to drink, and his throat was parched. In conclusion, the setting affected the biker in a very negative way, making his journey a real struggle.
1025	7005	3	3	Features of the setting affect the cyclist in the way that it is so hot that he is quickly becoming dehydrated. The sun is shining brightly, and the heat is almost unbearable. The dry air is sucking the moisture out of his body, and he can feel his throat getting drier with each passing minute. Another feature is that all the buildings seem to be either abandoned or in despair. The broken windows, crumbling walls, and overgrown weeds around the buildings create a desolate and depressing atmosphere. The cyclist looks around and sees no signs of life or help. These features combined have a detrimental effect on the cyclist, both physically and mentally. The heat and lack of water are taking a toll on his body, and the desolate surroundings are weighing on his mind. Overall, the setting is making his journey extremely difficult and challenging.
1026	7006	3	3	The features of the setting strongly affect the cyclist. Now, the cyclist finds themselves in the California desert on a sweltering hot day. The intense heat in the San Diego area causes the cyclist to drink all of their water, which later leaves them severely dehydrated. The barren desert, with its lack of any distinct landmarks, causes the cyclist to become disoriented and lost, which is the main problem the cyclist faces. This difficult situation due to the setting puts the cyclist's journey at great risk.
1027	7007	3	3	"The setting of this story plays a huge part in the final outcome. The author makes a clear mention that he is travelling through the high deserts of California in June. This simple sentence alone vividly tells the reader that it is extremely hot. And not just hot by normal @LOCATION2 standards, where it might only get to @NUM1 degrees by noon. In fact, the day starts at a relatively warm @NUM2 degrees. By noon, the temperature soars past @NUM3 degrees. Also, the author comes across a sign marked ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit."" Despite this, he makes note that he’s only going 12 mph. Before he reaches any sort of civilization, he has already drunk most of his water, sipping his last ""tantalizing sips."" This is his main problem, his lack of water. He drank most of it in the beginning of his ride, naively thinking he’d be okay, but he deeply regretted it later on. Clearly, the setting significantly impacts his journey."
1028	7008	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. The cyclist was in the middle of a vast expanse that was almost nowhere, gradually dehydrating under the harsh sun. There were no visible signs for resting areas where one could find water fountains around. In a desperate attempt to forget about being thirsty, the cyclist put pebbles in their mouth. However, as her surroundings were bumpy and uneven, she accidentally swallowed one. But she just kept pushing forward, with the words “I was going to die” echoing in her mind. First, the cyclist was in great danger of dehydrating, which could end her journey. Fortunately, the cyclist made it alive as she finally saw Gary and Wilber’s Fish Camp. Her setting was a desolate and challenging one until then. The cyclist was then greatly relieved and managed to survive this difficult ordeal.
1029	7009	3	3	Because he is dehydrated, the setting makes his situation worse. He’s biking in California, specifically in the arid @LOCATION2. It’s not just a normal sunny day; the sun is probably scorching down on him relentlessly. The intense heat, combined with all the strenuous biking he’s doing, is making him even more desperately thirsty and extremely tired. This difficult setting is taking a heavy toll on his body and his ability to continue the journey.
1030	7010	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. The cyclist had been riding on the “high deserts of California in June,” where the heat was almost unbearable. The cyclist also unexpectedly saw a “ridiculously large snake,” which gave them quite a scare. There was also no sign of civilization for miles. As the cyclist looked around, there was no one in sight, not a single building, car, or structure of any kind. The cyclist went through many different obstacles while traveling, constantly trying to get to Yosemite. Clearly, the settings affected the cyclist in numerous ways, making the journey a real challenge.
1031	7011	3	3	The features of the setting, such as the sweltering heat and hilly terrain on the road, affect cyclists greatly. Weather conditions like intense heat can sap a cyclist's energy, while hilly terrains demand extra physical effort. Temperature extremes and high altitudes can also pose challenges that can either make a cyclist stronger or break their resolve. In this essay, the unrelenting heat and numerous hills on the road continuously challenge the cyclist. Despite the exhaustion and the difficulties, he just keeps pedaling through. Eventually, after much struggle, he gets to civilization. This experience clearly shows that you can't let mother nature control you; you have to persevere and overcome the challenges it presents.
1032	7012	3	3	The features of the setting, including the scorching sun and arid environment, greatly affect the cyclist. The author, who is on a cycling journey, is getting worn out due to the harsh conditions and is rapidly running out of water. He “was traveling through the high deserts of California in June,” a time when the heat is at its peak. The intense heat and lack of water sources in the desert are taking a toll on him. This shows how the setting, with its extreme heat and scarce resources, is causing him to become greatly exhausted. In the face of such challenging settings, cyclists need to be well - prepared to avoid such difficult situations.
1033	7013	3	3	The feature of the setting, specifically the change in terrain, affected the cyclist tremendously. According to the text, at the beginning, the cyclist was confident he would make the eighteen miles. He was cruising along the flat ground, enjoying a relatively easy ride. However, this changed when the flat ground was replaced by short rolling hills. These hills required more effort to climb, gradually wearing him down. He said, and I quote, “I toiled on.” His words sound like it’s hopeless, as if he was starting to doubt that he was going to make it. As you can see, the setting, with its unpredictable terrain changes, does have a significant effect on the cyclist's journey and mindset.
1034	7014	3	3	The setting of “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” was very hot deserts. In such an environment, on a bike ride, there are not many places to stop for food or water. The vast expanse of the desert means that resources are scarce. Moreover, on a bike ride, you can't bring a lot of luggage with you. You can only carry important materials and a big enough jug of water to sustain you for a while. An example from the text to show how bad it was out there is when the cyclist “got down on my hands and knees, working the handle of the rusted pump with all my strength.” He was so thirsty and tired that he didn't know how else to get some water. This shows the harsh realities of cycling in a hot desert setting.
1035	7015	3	3	In the setting, the young man is faced with some challenges, such as the blistering heat, dry air that makes breathing difficult, the constant threat of snakes, and a low supply of water. These challenges, however, make him as an individual a stronger person. For example, he was proud of himself and made himself happy by saying at the end, “yes sir! I own a very good map.” This statement shows his self - confidence and a sense of achievement. He knows that he got through the heat, dry air, snakes, and a low supply of water to get to where he was determined to be, Yosemite. His journey through these challenges has not only led him to his destination but also helped him grow and become more resilient.
1036	7016	3	3	The setting in the story “Do not exceed posted speed limit” significantly affects the cyclist because it’s a parched area in California in June. The intense heat of the Californian sun beats down relentlessly. The cyclist really needs water, which is the main thing affecting him besides the fact that he’s lost in a desolate ghost town. The arid surroundings offer no relief or source of hydration. Therefore, the lack of water and misleading directions are the main features displayed, making his journey an extremely challenging one.
1037	7017	3	3	"The feature of the cyclist was very well - depicted “it erodding to who he say in paragraph @NUM1 @CAPS1”. I would describe it as a fun and engaging portrayal. It also looks like this time was one of his best times. Here are some examples: he is happy, competitive, and his spirit is full. First, he looks happy because in the story he said “the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face”. This phrase clearly shows how happy he felt as he started his day. My second example was competitive; he seems like a competitive person because he is very healthy and eager to take a ride on the bike. His enthusiasm and physical condition suggest a competitive edge. My third example is the way he is because he said ""As easily as sounding a bond, my trouble, thirst and fears were all behind me"". This part made me feel that he had overcome his difficulties and was in a positive state of mind. Overall, these aspects paint a vivid picture of the cyclist's character."
1038	7018	3	3	In the story “Do Not Exceed posted speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting notably affect the cyclist. We can tell because the author writes “that road was replaced by short, rolling hills” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). This description tells us that it is hard for the cyclist to ride on the road as the rolling hills require more effort to pedal through. The speed limit is also a factor that affects the cyclist. When the speed - limit sign appears, the character feels “life can feel so cruel” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). It tells us that the character is restricted and cannot do what he is trying to do, perhaps freely enjoying a fast - paced ride. The bad road conditions with the hills and the speed - limit sign both have a negative effect on the cyclist's experience.
1039	7019	3	3	In the essay, the features of the setting clearly affected the cyclist. In the beginning, the setting was at the old man’s cozy place. The cyclist was happy and confident, perhaps chatting amiably with the old man and feeling ready for the journey ahead. When he reached the desolate ghost town and was out of water, he was visibly upset and frustrated. The empty, silent town offered no hope of finding water. When he saw the building, he was relieved, thinking he might find a water source. But when he found out it was abandoned, he was deeply sad. Finally, when he finally reached the store, he was extremely excited and relieved, as he could quench his thirst and replenish his energy. That is how the setting affected the cyclist during his trip, with each change in setting bringing about a corresponding emotional shift.
1040	7020	3	3	In the story, “Do not exceed posted speed limit”, there are many features of the setting that affect the cyclist. First, in the beginning of the story it says that, “The sun was beginning to beat down”. The temperature was starting to rise steadily, but it had not really affected the cyclist because he had a sufficient and well - stocked water supply. He pedaled along with relative ease, enjoying the early - morning ride. Next, the story says, “I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June”. California’s temperature is really high and June is one of the hottest months of the year. The temperature soared to uncomfortable levels and the cyclist did not have much water left. This was severely affecting the cyclist because he was tired, hot, and getting dehydrated. His energy was waning, and he struggled to keep up his pace. Finally, at the end of the story the terrains were changing and there had been more hills and a road that was not as smooth as pavement because it was a dirt road. The uneven surface and the hills were making the cyclist have to cycle harder to go past, making him very tired. Also, the temperature was still very high and he did not have barely any water left. By the end of the ride, the setting of roads, temperature, and the distance of the ride had made the cyclist exhausted and severely dehydrated, almost at the limit of his endurance.
1041	7021	3	3	In the short story “Rough road ahead. Do not exceed posted speed limit,” the cyclist faced numerous difficulties. These difficulties were a direct result of the setting. The story takes place in “the high deserts of California in June”. Since the month of June is extremely warm, and the typical climate of California is hot and dry, the cyclist ran into significant problems. Not only was the cyclist affected by the heat, but he was also travelling through the vast desert. The setting also included several abandoned towns along the arduous way, which further contributed to the problem. Soon enough, the cyclist ran out of water, and he discovered that the towns that lay before him were completely unoccupied. With no other option, he had to continue with his challenging journey. This harsh setting truly tested the cyclist's endurance and resolve.
1042	7022	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many different ways. One notable way is that the hilly terrain forces him to work much harder, gradually wearing him out. As the cyclist gets more and more worn out, he needs to drink increasing amounts of water. Now that he is consuming more water, he is running out of it at a faster pace and constantly craving more. Then, when he starts to use less water to conserve it until he reaches the next town, he begins to become dehydrated. This dehydration makes him even more tired, and he starts to feel weak. Also, because the terrain is hilly, his legs are exerting extra effort to go up the steep hills, and they quickly become fatigued. Moreover, it starts to get hotter, and he gets thirsty more frequently. All these factors combine to show how the setting severely impacts the cyclist's well - being and progress.
1043	7023	3	3	In the poem “Do not exceed speed limit” the setting is described as extremely rough and dry. The man on the bike clearly states that he was running low on water. At one point, he says “At some point tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake”. This description makes the setting sound not only dry and empty but also dangerous with a potentially harmful snake around. This man also mentioned about a sign which read “Rough road ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit”. This rough road condition made it extremely hard for the man to ride his bike smoothly. These aspects of the setting, including the arid environment, the presence of a snake, and the rough road, all had a significant impact on the biker in the story, making his journey a difficult one.
1044	7024	3	3	The features of it encompass the detailed landscape, the well - defined characters, the engaging plot, the impactful end, and the intriguing beginning. The landscape sets the backdrop, creating a certain atmosphere for the story. The characters bring life and personality to the narrative, driving the plot forward. The plot unfolds in a way that keeps the reader engaged, with twists and turns. The end provides a sense of closure, while the beginning hooks the reader from the start. All these elements work together to form a complete and cohesive whole, making the story an interesting and memorable experience.
1045	7025	3	3	The setting in “Do Not Exceed Posted speed limits” affects the mood of the cyclist in that every time the setting changes, the mood of the cyclist undergoes a transformation. In the beginning of the story, the cyclist is riding through the “cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite”. During this time, the cyclist is thoroughly enjoying his trip and is in an extremely positive mood. The beautiful and refreshing scenery around him fills him with joy and contentment. As the story progresses, “there was no one in sight, not a building, a car, or structure of any kind”. At this point in the story, the cyclist has completely exchanged his positive mood for a desperate one as his water supply begins to run out. The desolate and empty setting makes him feel isolated and worried about his survival. This shows how the setting has a profound influence on the cyclist's emotional state throughout the story.
1046	7026	3	3	The setting in the essay “Rough Road Ahead” presents the biker with a very difficult challenge that he has to overcome. When the “flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills,” the biker must exert more energy to pedal up the hills. The steep inclines of these hills made it hard on him to overcome his exhaustion and test his physical endurance. Also, he states that he was “traveling through the high desert of California in June.” This weather is extremely hot and dry, causing him to quickly run low on water. The parched air sucked the moisture from his body, and the glaring sun beat down relentlessly. And, because he was in the desert, there was no sign of towns or people or any form of salvation. These conditions made it hard on the biker because he knew if he dropped from dehydration, no one would be around to save him. In conclusion, these hard conditions challenged the biker a great deal.
1047	7027	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. The cyclist was on a very long and arduous bike ride to Yosemite National Park. However, on the way there, he had to cross through a desert - like terrain. The blistering sun had been beating on his back for many miles, its rays intense and unforgiving. All the heat built up a strong desire for him to get water. He had been very tired, his legs feeling like lead with each pedal stroke. The rough terrain had made him drenched in sweat, his clothes sticking to his body. If it wasn't so hot, then he wouldn't have had that much of a hard time. The desert contains a very high temperature, which makes it harder to endure physical activities. Even if you have a high endurance, the heat will make you very tired, and you will lose a lot of energy. Also, it didn't help anything that the elderly men had given him terrible directions, leading him astray and adding to his struggles. That is why I think the setting affected the cyclist.
1048	7028	3	3	The setting in the story “Do not exceed posted speed limit” affects the author in a big way. The features of the setting are that “there was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” The desolate expanse around him made the author lose hope and trust. After the author saw the old juice factory in the distance, he felt like something was happening in his favor, perhaps a sign of civilization. Then he saw that it was abandoned, its broken windows and rusted machinery a dismal sight, and he lost all hope. He shows his loss of hope again when he talks about how he's going to die. He shows that he's lost trust in the old men when he talks about never accepting advice from “old - timers who haven't left their porches since Carter was in office.” In conclusion, the features of the desolate setting and the unreliable directions he was given made him lose any hope of surviving.
1049	7029	3	3	At the beginning of the ride, the cyclist is feeling good and strong and the day as well as the journey is just beginning. The sun begins to beat down on the cyclist but he remains upbeat, still feeling good and barely noticing the heat as he pedals steadily. When he arrives at an old rusty water pump, he feels disappointed and tastes a liquid that resembles “battery acid.” The taste is so foul that it makes him gag. The terrain begins to feel like more of a hill, with a gradual incline that makes the struggle even worse. The cyclist is drinking water more now, and is becoming tired. His legs start to ache with each rotation of the pedals. He comes to a rough road and says, “sometimes life can feel so cruel,” which lets the reader know he is feeling the negative affects of what he presumed to be a nice bike ride. A snake blocks his path, causing him to startle, and he becomes dehydrated. The cyclist feels refreshment and relief at a sign for a fish camp, and his thirst is replenished when he takes a satisfying gulp of cool water in the restroom. The water is a feature of the setting that refreshes the cyclist, while the hot sun, rough terrain, and unknown area are features that make the cyclist feel lost and tired.
1050	7030	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example, the sand and the intense heat are two big parts of the setting, which make him extremely thirsty. The sand makes each pedal stroke more difficult, as the wheels sink slightly with every turn. “... followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.” This is a quote that explains the intense heat that the cyclist is feeling. The water's scalding temperature is a clear indication of how sweltering the environment is. The sun is another big feature that affects him. Its rays are like a furnace, baking the cyclist under its glare. This is how the setting affects the cyclist.
1051	7031	3	3	The feature affects the cyclist because he desires to go to a truly spectacular and amazing place. For instance, he mentioned that he had been yearning to reach one particular spot for a long time. Finally, he got there, only to find it was a ghost town. He let out a little chuckle and rode away as it wasn't what he had been looking for. I believe that this guy judges every place he visits solely by its appearance and not by what it has to offer. He initially didn't trust getting directions from an old man, yet he still took the directions. I think he is determined to reach his desired destination and won't let anyone or anything stand in his way. It's as if he is in search of a perfect spot, and he believes that once he finds it, he will have countless stories to tell. In the end, his journey is a pursuit of that ideal place that can fulfill his expectations and enrich his life with experiences.
1052	7032	3	3	The setting can significantly affect a cyclist in numerous ways. If the weather were hot, the cyclist would constantly feel thirsty and his body would be drenched in sweat. When there are hills along the route, apart from being thirsty, the cyclist would also become extremely tired due to the extra effort required to pedal uphill. Despite being both thirsty and tired, the cyclist remains determined to push through and find a town. The cyclist said, “I began breaking the ride down into distances I could see on the horizon, telling myself that if I could make it that far, I’d be fine.” By uttering these words, he not only has the confidence that he can cover that distance but is also resolute in his determination. The challenging terrain further adds to his troubles, making the journey even more difficult. However, he is aware that he must overcome this arduous activity. With his strong spirit, he can achieve just about anything because he has the self - encouragement he needs to keep going, and this will eventually lead him to his destination.
1053	7033	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by causing his mood to change. In the @LOCATION1, which is a pleasant place with nice shade and a cool atmosphere, he feels quite good. He is brimming with excitement and eager to embark on the adventure of a new path. His positive mood persists when he arrives at the first town. As he continues his journey and his water supply gradually runs out, his mood starts to deteriorate, and he becomes more and more frustrated. In an ironic turn of events, when he comes across a Welch’s Grape Juice Factory, he is on the verge of giving up. He is dejected and almost ready to admit defeat. But he musters the strength to force himself to continue. When he finally reaches a place with water, his relief is mingled with wariness as there is an old man sitting on the porch. After this experience, he will never take water for granted or ignore the advice from old men ever again, realizing that these small things can have a huge impact on his journey.
1054	7034	3	3	The features of the setting only serve to drain the cyclist's willpower. The sights he encounters discourage him greatly. For example, “one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps and a corral that couldn’t hold the largest mule greeted me.” This desolate sight was deeply troubling to him. The desolation in the area gradually erodes his hope of finding a building or a town. Sometimes, these things can be psychologically damaging. In an ironic twist that would amuse all sadists reading this account, “the building, abandoned years earlier, by the looks of it – had been a Welch’s Grape Juice factory and bottling plant. A sand - blasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen.” For someone who is rapidly running out of water, this irony can make one lose their resolve to continue. Moreover, the presence of a snake and the rolling hills slow him down and make him expend more energy. The scorching heat dehydrates the cyclist at an even faster rate. Clearly, the environment is extremely hostile for a cyclist, and it tests his endurance and willpower to the limit.
1055	7035	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. First and foremost, the climate had the most significant impact on him. The high temperature made him feel overly hot. As a result, he drank a large amount of water, which led to rapid dehydration. Due to this dehydration, he had no energy left to continue with ease. Another crucial factor was the condition of the road. The road was rocky, bumpy, and winding, with many hills. Coupled with his state of dehydration, the road became so daunting that it was very tempting for him to just give up and lie down. Then, the heat really got to him. There was no shade to protect him from the sun, he had no water left, and the sun was mercilessly beating down on him. In the end, these combined factors from the setting made his cycling journey an extremely tough battle, but his ability to persevere would determine whether he could overcome these challenges.
1056	7036	3	3	During the cyclist trail, there are numerous factors that turn out to be disadvantages for the cyclist. The roads are extremely rough, making each pedal a struggle. There's also a malfunctioning water pump, an abandoned battling plant that looms ominously, and the harsh reality that this wasn't even the intended path. All these elements combine to create a new experience for the cyclist. As the cyclist reaches the first town and realizes it has declined, they are initially a bit amused. Then they pedal on, only to notice that their water supply is dwindling. What initially seems like a sign of hope turns into another letdown. A water pump is found just in time, but the water is no longer usable. When they reach “rough roads,” it creates an even more painful journey. Finally, the cyclist spots a building in the distance, but it's deserted. The only glimmer of goodness for the poor cyclist is when they come across a bait “tar,” a small sign of civilization that keeps them going. Hope after hope arises, only to end in turmoil upon turmoil. These encounters would make anyone become pessimistic about even a simple task, but the cyclist perseveres. These experiences create an interesting narrative. Every time you catch a whiff of hope, you become eager to know what could happen next and then feel sorry for the cyclist after they've had hope on multiple occasions. The steadily rising plot keeps the reader engaged, always wanting more.
1057	7037	3	3	The setting significantly affected the cyclist due to the roads being in a very bad condition. The rough surface of the roads made it difficult for the cyclist to maintain a steady pace. There were also hills along the way, and these steep inclines made it even harder for the cyclists to pedal forward. The combination of the bad - condition roads and the hills put a great deal of strain on the cyclists, making their journey much more arduous. In conclusion, the challenging setting clearly had a negative impact on the cyclist's progress.
1058	7038	3	3	“There was no one in sight, not a single building, car, or any kind of structure.” This desolate emptiness makes it extremely hard for the cyclist to foster hope and figure out where to get water. “I could drop from a heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June,” he's in the desert in @LOCATION1 in June with little water around and no one in sight. This makes him very desperate since he's all alone. The scorching sun beats down relentlessly, and the lack of any signs of civilization adds to his sense of isolation and despair. In such a situation, the cyclist's struggle for survival becomes a true test of will.
1059	7039	3	3	The main features that affected the cyclist were the rough terrain and the blistering hot sun. The rough terrain, with its uneven surface and bumps, made it much harder to pedal. Every push of the pedals required extra effort, and it tired the cyclist out at a much faster rate. On top of that, the hot sun was also a major factor. It beat down on the cyclist, causing him to sweat profusely and dehydrate quickly while he was riding. So, between the difficult - to - pedal rough terrain and the dehydrating hot sun, the cyclist was severely affected to the point of exhaustion. In the end, these harsh conditions really took a toll on the cyclist's physical state.
1060	7040	3	3	The features of the setting in the essay, “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted speed limit” have a profound impact on the cyclist. As the cyclist rides towards his destination, he faces various obstacles and takes in his surroundings. The author gives the starting setting in the second paragraph as “a reservoir campground outside of Lodi, California on an early summer evening.” The reader is informed that the temperatures are typical of summers in California, which are quite high. This gives the cyclist his main conflict, the severe lack of water. With the high temperatures, it is very easy for the cyclist to become quickly dehydrated. The author stated, “The sun was beginning to beat down and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” Also, the cyclist encounters a ridiculously large snake right in the middle of the road, which adds to the sense of danger. The reader is well - aware that there are many conflicts one can face while cycling. There are finally many features of the setting that let the cyclist know where he currently is, and the place where he most wants to be, the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite. Throughout the essay, the cyclist is determined to reach Yosemite. Although he faces numerous troubles, he doesn't give up and is greatly relieved when he finally gets water, which shows his perseverance in the face of a challenging setting.
1061	7041	3	3	"The features of the desert significantly changed the way the speaker thought about his journey. As soon as the road began to transform, the speaker's determination wavered as well. ""Flat roads were replaced by short hills"", a clear indication of the changing terrain. This shift in the landscape made the speaker start to doubt the old man who had directed him towards the shortcut. He thought, ""I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because I listened to some gentleman who hadn't been off their porch in decades"". The intense heat in the desert made the speaker extremely thirsty, causing him to quickly drink all his water. With no visible source of water around, he decided to suck on a stone as he recalled, ""I'd read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst"". However, the bumpy terrain didn't allow him to do that. He hit a particularly rough bump and accidentally swallowed the stone. Panic set in as the speaker thought, ""I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean"". But fortunately, his thoughts changed after he found a supply of water. Undoubtedly, the features of the desert did affect the cyclist very much."
1062	7042	3	3	The setting of the journey affects the cyclist in a very negative way. The lack of buildings, people, and cars on his supposed “shortcut” left him in great doubt about his survival. He had a terrifying thought, “I was going to die, and the birds would pick me clean.” With nothing around him, he was convinced that he wouldn't be able to find any water. The fear of dying from dehydration or heatstroke loomed large in his mind, as he thought, “And the growing realization that I would die of heatstroke.” This desolate setting constantly gnawed at his hope, making his situation seem all the more dire.
1063	7043	3	3	The setting of the story had affected the bike rider in many ways. It was extremely hot when he was riding, which made him constantly thirsty. For example, “The sun was beginning to beat down” (pg @NUM1). The relentless sun was very exhausting and made him start to dehydrate. Another instance is “traveling through the desert of California in June” (pg @NUM2). California is a relatively hot state, and June is one of its warmer months, intensifying the heat he had to endure. The terrain also didn't favor the rider. “Flat roads had turned into short rolling hills” (pg @NUM2). Short rolling hills are much harder on a biker's body than flat terrain, requiring more energy and effort to pedal. All these factors combined show how the setting had a significant impact on the rider's journey.
1064	7044	3	3	The setting affected the cyclist because it was in June, and the temperature was starting to get hot. In the book, it specifically mentioned that he was going through the desert. The desert heat was intense, with the sun beaming down on him relentlessly. Moreover, the author did not have enough water to survive in such a harsh environment. With the scorching sun and limited water supply, the cyclist was in a precarious situation. The combination of the hot weather and the arid desert setting posed a great threat to his well - being during the journey.
1065	7045	3	3	In this paragraph, I will explain how the features of the setting affect the cyclist. The setting affects the cyclist in various ways, such as the weather, road structure, and the presence of animals. These are all things that the cyclist has no control over. The weather could bring extreme heat or sudden storms, making the ride uncomfortable or even dangerous. The road structure, like rough terrains or steep slopes, can make pedaling more difficult. And the presence of wild animals might startle the cyclist or even pose a physical threat. All these factors have a direct impact on the cyclist as he rides through the setting, making his journey a challenging one.
1066	7046	3	3	The features of the setting in this story give the cyclist determination. Since the desert, with its vast expanse and harsh conditions, presents a formidable challenge that spurs the cyclist on to persevere and reach their goal.
1067	7047	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because it is very hot and it is summertime. The intense heat of the sun beats down relentlessly. The cyclist wouldnít have gotten so tired and exhausted if he wasnít in a ìghost townî, with the, ìsun beginning to beat downî. It was in [CAPS1] for Nia during June so it was extremely hot. The water was also [NUM1] degrees! The text also states there were rolling hills and tumbleweeds, so it must have been a desert - like area. The trip was also a very long one, ìabout forty miles into the pedalî, causing him to be tired. As you can see, the setting was an area with no people, and it was very hot, which clearly took a toll on the cyclist.
1068	7048	3	3	The features of the setting are very important for cyclists. If the setting is wrong, they could be in many dangers such as poor road conditions, extreme weather, or lack of necessary facilities. It is really important to have a clear setting, one that is well - mapped, has proper signage, and is suitable for cycling to ensure the cyclists' safety and a successful journey.
1069	7049	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist horribly! For example, he ran into the worst problems and couldn't really do anything about them. Also, he started out fine, then he started to become dehydrated. He didn't have much water left and he was only [NUM1] miles up the road. A loss of water was very impactful in June traveling through a desert. Also, the damage of the road was very significant too because he's on a bike and has not too good of balance. These features could affect the cyclist in many ways because of the weather, high temperature, loss of water, road damages, and the presence of snakes. The cyclist was on a bike and couldn't really protect himself, and he was dehydrated and tired, making his situation extremely difficult.
1070	7050	3	3	Throughout his journey, the protagonist in the story encounters obstacles in the setting. First off, he is cycling in the hot, dry, desert. There is no civilization or natural water source, so he faces dehydration as his body loses water rapidly in the scorching heat. Additionally, the terrain he was riding on proved difficult. He encountered rolling hills that took a lot of energy to ride up. There were even signs for ìrough road aheadî. Another obstacle was a mental obstacle. He came across an abandoned juice factory when he needed an occupied building. These were ironic and mentally frustrating. The cyclist must have lost hope in [CAPS2] civilization after he found [NUM1] abandoned examples of civilization. This discouragement must have made his journey more mentally challenging, adding an extra layer of difficulty to his already arduous cycling trip.
1071	7051	3	3	The features in the setting would significantly affect the cyclist because they would strongly desire towns with accessible water sources so they can restock their water supply. They would want water even more after strenuously going up hills. They would also want a proper place to get something to eat and maybe take a short rest to regain their energy. This shows how the setting's features play a crucial role in the cyclist's journey.
1072	7052	3	3	The feature of the setting affects the cyclist because of the intense heat and the lack of available water. Also, the roughness of the road ahead was a major concern. Another problem was the dry air that made breathing difficult and the snakes laying out everywhere in the desert, which added to the cyclist's fear. Also, the hills were a big problem too because of the heat and the lack of water. Finally, the other problem was that he knew he was going to die and the birds would peck at him and there would be nothing left of him. This is how the harsh setting affected the cyclist and put his life at risk.
1073	7053	3	3	The hot, dry, desert setting affects the cyclist in many different ways, “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June” (@NUM1). The cyclist is extremely hot, feeling the scorching sun on his back. He was thirsty but, “A tarlike substance oozed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of 100 degrees” (@NUM2). The water was barely even drinkable, so he didn't have much to drink until the next town. “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills” (@NUM3). Flat road is much easier to bike on than hills. He was thirstier and more tired after biking on hills. “A sand - blasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice in his mouth could still be seen” (@NUM4) on an old Welch's grapefruit factory. This makes the cyclist envious of the young boy. It also discourages him. In conclusion, the water being bad, the terrain change, the picture of the young boy, and the fact that the cyclist drinks a lot makes him tired, hot, envious, and generally exhausted, making his desert cycling trip a real struggle.
1074	7054	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because when he has an ample supply of water and plenty of it, the setting seems to be smooth, easy riding. This means that he doesn't have to use much water, but he still uses some because anyone that rides @NUM1 miles on a bike will need plenty of water no matter what the terrain is like. The features of the setting affect the cyclist toward the middle and end of his trip greatly because it gets rough and hilly and so he needs more water that he doesn't have. And since he was planning on being able to get water at the first stop he didn't conserve it as well, so this left less water for him to have when he really needed it. He then became dehydrated after his first stop, and he didn't get any more water there so it caused him to dehydrate further. So it seems that the features of the setting affect the cyclist because when he has plenty of water and doesn't really need it the terrain is smooth and easy to ride but as he drinks his water the terrain gets rougher and worse. So the features of the setting affects him greatly in that they don't help him; they just get worse when he needs it to get better, ultimately making his cycling journey a challenging and potentially dangerous one.
1075	7055	3	3	There are many ways that the features affect the cyclist. One is that he is already extremely scared to go up this really big hill. Another is that as he is going up this big hill, it's swelteringly hot, there are snakes around, he's scared and completely tired. Almost all of his energy is gone. He just wants to stop, yet he is determined to go up this hill. He also knows that it can't be that bad because he can just relax all the way back down, which gives him a glimmer of hope to keep pushing forward despite the difficult situation.
1076	7056	3	3	After reading, “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Speed Limit,” I noticed that the setting of this adventure significantly affected the narrator. First of all, the intense heat in the desert environment caused the narrator to be extremely uncomfortable and thirstier by the minute. While on the move, he refers to the trip as a “water - depleting” one. This quote clearly shows that he was severely lacking water, and this water shortage was a major and pressing problem. Also, the description of the road as “rolling hills” gives the reader a sense that these hills seem to go on without end. The never - ending nature of these hills lowers the narrator’s hope of reaching his destination quickly. Moreover, the vast and desolate desert gives the author a feeling of despair and low hope of ever reaching his goal. In conclusion, the setting affects the narrator both physically, through the heat and lack of water, and mentally, by diminishing his hope and determination.
1077	7057	3	3	The setting of the story had a profound impact on the cyclist as it played a crucial role in keeping him going, mainly because he was all alone and had no external help. First, the mere fact that he was by himself on this arduous journey kept his determination at a high level. If he would have had a partner, they could have easily stopped and taken a well - deserved break or shared the limited supply of water, which might have weakened his resolve. Next, the complete absence of buildings, houses, or any signs of civilization in sight affected him deeply. He got a sudden bolt of strength just from the distant sight of a building ahead. If there had been buildings along the way, he could have stopped and asked for more water and taken a rest. The fact that he was in a desert in California in the middle of June, when the sun beats down mercilessly, really affected him. He had no determination there because there was absolutely nothing he could do to improve the dire situation. He even at one point felt that he might die due to the harsh conditions. In conclusion, the setting really affected the cyclist because it was the determining factor for his endurance and will power.
1078	7058	3	3	Features of the setting affected the cyclist in many different ways. For example, he approached the older folks who, as he described, “haven't left their porches since Carter was in the office,” to ask where the next place to get water was. This shows how desperate he was for water. Also, he was out in the middle of nowhere, surrounded by vast emptiness with no immediate help in sight. It was also in June, a month when the weather is warm and the sun shines brightly. With the warm weather, his body was losing water rapidly, and he didn't have a lot of water to begin with. All these factors combined made his journey extremely difficult. In conclusion, the setting features severely hampered the cyclist's ability to have a smooth and comfortable ride.
1079	7059	3	3	Many features of the setting affect the cyclist. First, he was in the “high desert of California in June.” This particular setting affected him in numerous ways. The scorching heat of the desert sun made him become very dehydrated. He had to be extremely careful with his limited water supply and resorted to chewing on pebbles to get any spit to collect in his dry mouth. Also, the road became very rough as he moved through the desert terrain. The new, uneven terrain made him have to push himself harder with each pedal stroke, causing him to lose energy at a much quicker rate. The last feature, the long distance he had to cover, added to his troubles. He had to travel a lot further than he had originally planned to. This unforeseen distance again affected his energy levels and spirits, filling his mind with thoughts of possible death and the fear of not being able to make it. In conclusion, these features of the setting had a detrimental impact on the cyclist's physical and mental state during his journey.
1080	7060	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. Since the cyclist was in the middle of nowhere, far from any sources of water, he was in a desperate situation. He couldn't get any water to quench his growing thirst. “I'd read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst,” he said, indicating that he was so thirsty that he had to resort to such an unusual method. The intense thirst drained him of energy, and he barely had the strength to keep going. “The growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke,” he thought. It was extremely hot out, and with no water to cool his body, this heatstroke threat severely affected his energy. The lack of water and the sweltering heat in the desolate setting made it a struggle for the cyclist to continue his journey. In conclusion, the setting features were a major obstacle for the cyclist, sapping his energy and putting his life at risk.
1081	7061	3	3	The features of setting significantly affect the cyclist. The harsh terrain, with its uneven ground and rocky patches, proved a formidable challenge, especially when his water supply was running critically low. All the towns along his route had been abandoned, leaving him with no option to refill his water bottles. The sweltering heat was also a major factor, quickly sapping his energy and making him feel weary and extremely tired. On the long bike ride, he had a glimmer of hope when he spotted an old water pump. However, his hopes were quickly dashed when he took a sip of the hot liquid, which tasted horribly of battery acid. The unforgiving setting set the stage for the conflict and effectively helped achieve the tone the author was aiming for, having a profound impact on the cyclist.
1082	7062	3	3	The settings have a notable effect on the cyclist, primarily due to the roughness of the ride. First, as they pedal along, they have to go over a large bunch of sharp and jagged rocks. This poses a real risk as the tire could easily puncture at any moment. Next, the terrain could suddenly become smooth and easy, providing a brief respite. Also, the cyclist might find themselves far away from towns, making it difficult to get back in case of an emergency. There could be a severe lack of water sources in the area, gradually making the cyclist dehydrate. In conclusion, these aspects of the setting around the cyclist can have a significant and sometimes dangerous impact on him.
1083	7063	3	3	The setting described in the story, “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Speed Limit,” would undoubtedly be a nightmare for any biker. This biker is riding in the middle of a vast and arid desert on a scorching summer’s day. The sweat is steadily dropping down his body, and this is just speeding up his dehydration at an alarming rate. This is clearly shown when the narration states, “wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke” (Kurmaskie). This vividly portrays how incredibly hot the desert was, and how he was at real risk of dropping dead from the heat. The desert is also completely deserted, with rolling tumbleweeds and giant snakes slithering around. As he rides along, he passes by numerous abandoned towns and factories. The level of dangerousness for a biker in this desolate area is very high. In the end, the biker was truly lucky to have made it out of those perilous surroundings alive.
1084	7064	3	3	The desert area of California was rapidly making him dehydrated. The trip was quite long, but he had initially thought he had enough water to get him there, only if he took the route shown on the maps. A group of old men, who “haven’t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office,” gave him advice about a shortcut. He, unfortunately, followed their advice and ended up in a life - threatening situation. He almost died due to heat stroke and severe dehydration. If the cyclist would have stuck to following the map, he could have easily stopped off at a store for more water if the setting became too harsh. In conclusion, the wrong advice in this unforgiving desert setting nearly cost him his life.
1085	7065	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many significant ways. The setting was a dry and desolate California desert. If it had been a bustling city, the events in the story would have never happened. The author, in his eagerness, asked a group of old men for directions to Yosemite National Park. And, “like a foolish youth,” he blindly followed their advice. Everything started out fine at first, with the sun shining and the road seemingly clear. However, things took a turn for the worse when he reached the second town. He was almost completely dehydrated, and “in an ironic twist,” he reached an abandoned grape juice factory. Almost all hope was lost for him as he struggled to stay conscious. But then, he rounded the bend and came across his new hope: “Gary and Wilber’s Fish camp - if you won’t bait for the big ones, we’re your best bet.” In the end, he learned a valuable lesson to stick to a map instead of relying on old people who “haven’t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office.”
1086	7066	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because first he realized that getting advice from people who no longer drive or even leave their porches would be useless. When the author says “old timers who haven’t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office,” that's what he is explaining. He then says “I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face”; he was referring back to how he's on the road alone, riding the bike, and there isn't a car in sight anywhere around. The curbs of the turns were so sharp that only a bicycle could make them as safely as he did. “He whipped the sweat from his eyes to make sure it wasn't a mirage and tried not to get too excited.” In this situation, being on a long, lonely cycle by himself would have made many people excited. This solitude and the unique challenges of the setting truly shaped the cyclist's experience.
1087	7067	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist by making his way to the Yosemite National Park a longer, more difficult, and dangerous way to go. He takes the advice of going that way from some old folks that he says “haven’t gotten off their porches since Carter was in office.” I think that there would be a reason to not listen to them, though they might have wisdom. Their limited experience of the outside world in recent times could mean their advice isn't fully applicable to the current situation. Still, the cyclist's choice to follow their advice will likely impact his journey to the park.
1088	7068	3	3	In the setting, there are no cars and no buildings, meaning there is no help readily available. The cyclist is tired and dehydrated because he ran out of water. No one was around because it was the desert. The cyclist, despite being dehydrated, kept going towards his destination. The road was straight, but almost at the end, there were many hills. Along with having to bike up the hills, he almost ran into a snake. The weather was hot, he had no water, and he could have died. However, his determination kept him going, and he managed to persevere through these tough conditions.
1089	7069	3	3	The features in the setting in the story “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” greatly affect the biker. For example, the heat is constantly drying the biker out. Also, at the first town, the old water pump proved to be a hopeless cause, with the water tasting like “battery acid.” Even after that, there were more problems. There was a sign that posted a max speed limit, and the biker was doing about one - fifth of that speed. This affects his mood, and he realizes that it will be a long ride. The pebbles that he found help him out. He remembers reading that sticking pebbles in your mouth calms your thirst. Finally, the bait store gave him the relief that he needed at the end of his trip. In conclusion, the setting makes the rider's journey a challenging one, but in the end, the bait store had just what he needed to overcome the hardships of the journey.
1090	7070	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist. For example, there were no towns close by. One reason this affected the cyclist is because if the towns were near each other, if he ran out of water, there would be stores close by. In addition, he could have a heatstroke, and there would be no one around to get help from, and he could easily die. In my point of view of the reading, I believe where he was located is what affected him mostly. The isolation due to the lack of nearby towns put the cyclist in a vulnerable position, greatly influencing his cycling experience.
1091	7071	3	3	The hot weather is steadily dehydrating the cyclist, who desperately can't find more water to quench his thirst. The hills with their rough terrain are continuously draining the energy he has left in his body. The heat is so intense that he has to break the road down into small points he wants to reach. He gets drained physically as his muscles ache and emotionally as his spirits dampen. He has a truly hard journey ahead, but he keeps pushing on, hoping to find relief soon.
1092	7072	3	3	The features of the setting, such as the intense sun and lack of water sources, significantly affect the cyclist in terms of whether he is hydrated or not. On the posts with the warning “Do not exceed posted speed limit” is placed after the description “wide rings of dried sweat clinched my thirst, and the growing realization that I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June”. This clearly shows that he is severely dehydrated from the scorching sun, which is a prominent feature of the setting. The description “a tarlike distance surged out, followed by cockish water feeling somelane in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees” further emphasizes the harshness. Cyclists can tell that there is no available water in this desolate place, which is another crucial feature of the setting that negatively affects the cyclist. In conclusion, the setting's features pose a great threat to the cyclist's well - being.
1093	7073	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. The cyclist from the essay “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” by Joe Kurmaskie, had numerous obstacles to overcome. When he first showed the old men his map, he was probably thinking to himself, “Oh my gosh, what did I get myself into?!” His face might have shown a hint of unease. Because the cyclist trusted the shortcut the old men told him about, he experienced a lot of doubt, anger, and determination later on during the day. It was extremely hot, and he was rapidly running out of water, making him worried that he was going to get dehydrated and die as he started to think he was getting lost. The steep hills also affected the cyclist by making him extremely tired. In conclusion, the cyclist, in the end, found a little store by all the determination and effort he put in, finally getting the relief he so desperately needed.
1094	7074	3	3	The setting where the cyclist is at is a vast, barren desert, and it can have a serious impact on him because he could easily get a heatstroke. The text clearly states that he is lacking water, and if one gets too dehydrated, it's extremely unhealthy and can even lead to death. However, when the gentle wind blows against his face, it can cool him down, along with the evaporation of the sweat on his skin. As long as he has some liquid left in his water bottle, it should be somewhat manageable. But he needs to find a proper water source soon to avoid the worst - case scenario.
1095	7075	3	3	The setting of this story is a dry, sweltering hot desert in the middle of June. These features of the setting, like the intense heat and arid conditions, significantly affect the author, because it shows how he starts off strong and determined with a spring in his step and his left weak and doubtful as his body gives in. In the beginning of the story, the author says, “Things began well enough. I rode into the morning with strong legs and a bright smile on my face.” This vividly shows the readers the high level of confidence he has with himself before starting his trip. Later on in the story, he describes the setting as “the high deserts of California in June,” precisely depicting the heat and what challenges he is facing. It goes on to tell how he is severely dehydrated and completely worn out. But he finally comes to a town, and “cool water drips from my head as I slumped against the wall.” Clearly, he is greatly relieved. As the setting changes from the harsh desert to the town, the author's attitude changes as well, from despair to a sense of relief.
1096	7076	3	3	Different features of the setting have a significant impact on a cyclist. For example, temperature truly changes everything. If it's extremely hot, like the sweltering heat in a desert, you're going to get tired really easily as your body has to work hard to cool down. Then again, if it's too cold, the cold air makes breathing really hard as it constricts your airways. The biker in the story was in a desert area in June, so it was really hot and tiring under the scorching sun. Also, the terrain affects a cyclist. If the road is filled with hills, getting up those steep hills requires a great deal of strength and energy. If it's all downhill, it's really easy as gravity does most of the work, but all uphill is extremely hard. Level terrain is fairly easy as it allows for a more consistent pace. The cyclist in the story was on level terrain initially, then it turned into a lot of hills which gradually tired him out. Clearly, features of the setting really affect a cyclist.
1097	7077	3	3	The setting affects the cyclist in multiple ways. He is faced with roadways that are unfamiliar and full of uncertainties. The weather is hot and dry, with the sun beating down relentlessly, sapping his energy. Moreover, there are wild animals lurking around, which adds an element of danger to his journey. The text states that these factors combined make the cyclist's situation quite challenging. In such a setting, the cyclist has to constantly be on guard and adapt to the harsh conditions, demonstrating how the setting can have a profound impact on his experience.
1098	7078	3	3	The setting has a great impact on the condition of the cyclist. First, it is very hot and dry in June, with the sun shining brightly and the air parched. The cyclist is maneuvering his way through “high deserts in @LOCATION1” where he comes across many steep hills that he must laboriously climb over and carefully maneuver his way down. These hills require a lot of physical effort and concentration. With all of these obstacles and the intense heat slowing him down, he will need water but is already low on supplies. In this difficult setting, the cyclist's condition is clearly being affected, highlighting the significant role of the setting in his journey.
1099	7079	3	3	In the story “Rough Road Ahead Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” the narrator is faced with the challenging and perilous desert he must cross. He wasn't traveling in a car; instead, he was riding a bike. Crossing a desert on foot is tiring enough, let alone on a bike. “The speed limit was @NUM1. I was doing a water - depleting @NUM2. Sometimes life can be so cruel.” In the horrible @NUM3 degree heat, which is like an oven baking the ground, the narrator gulps down his water bottles at such a rapid rate that he's at high risk of running out. Not only that but he's been pedaling for such a long time that he might pass out from exhaustion or suffer from heatstroke. “I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn't been off their porch in decades.” So, it's evident that the narrator was pretty hassled by his surroundings.
1100	7080	3	3	The setting affected the character in ways that would usually affect people. When he got into the first town, he had run out of water to drink. The town's water he was in now tasted like battery acid, with a strong and unpleasant chemical - like taste, so that's not safe to drink. As he started to head out, the scenery changed. “Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” This is hinting at the fact that maybe this town he is going to might be abandoned or not used. He saw a huge rattle snake slithering across the path and tumbleweed blowing in the wind. Which are usual signs of a desert. It was hard for him to keep his balance as he says, “trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.” He ended up getting to the point where he had to put rocks in his mouth to trick his mind into thinking that he wasn't thirsty anymore. All these show how the challenging setting took a toll on the character.
1101	7081	3	3	The feature of the setting affected the cyclist because at first he had to constantly watch out for the snakes that usually slithered across the roads. These snakes were a real hazard, as a sudden encounter could startle him and cause an accident. Then, the streets were not only crooked but also extremely bumpy. The uneven road structure jolted him around on his bike and threw him off a bit, making it difficult to maintain a steady pace. He was riding his bike in June, and the sun was blazing hot. The sweltering heat was almost unbearable, and he had a severe lack of water. As the heat took its toll, he began to feel dizzy and weak, and he thought he was going to have a heatstroke. These things significantly affected how the cyclist performed on his bike, making his journey a real struggle.
1102	7082	3	3	The cyclist is riding through the vast high deserts in California. In this desolate environment, as far as the eye can see, everything looks the same for miles. The landscape is a monotonous expanse of sand and rocks. The cyclist is already dehydrated, and the situation is getting worse because he has no protection from the scorching sun. There are no trees or shelters to provide shade. It is extremely hard for the cyclist to keep in good spirits because he is not even coming across any towns or sources of water. The cyclist says “About forty miles into the pedal, I arrived at the first ‘town.’” This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time - say before the last world war - but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town. There were dilapidated buildings and no signs of life. This made the cyclist doubt the old - timers' directions. In the wide open desert, the cyclist was only coming across something after at least twenty miles. The intense heat, lack of water, and lack of civilization made the cyclist think he was “going to die and the birds would pick [him] clean.” When the cyclist spots the abandoned Welch’s factory, the cyclist says they used what seemed to be their last bit of energy. Clearly, the harsh conditions affected the cyclist in a very negative way.
1103	7083	3	3	The setting affects the cyclist by showing that he is a little angry. He states that “don’t remember the saying don’t take candy from strangers.” This off - hand comment indicates that he is upset about something. He is particularly mad about the fact that this one older man tells him directions on how to get somewhere, and it’s completely wrong. The man only figures that out halfway through the story. He also said that “the old man hasn’t been off his porch since Carter was in office,” meaning that the old man has been out of touch with the current state of the roads and landmarks. So, he needs to get his directions up to date. All these factors contribute to the cyclist having a negative attitude at the beginning.
1104	7084	3	3	In the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” the settings affected the character because he thought he wouldn’t make it to the park because of the way things looked around him. The rolling hills were a major obstacle. They were steep and required a great deal of effort to climb, sapping his energy. And the snakes that slithered across the path added to his sense of danger. With these hazards around, he didn’t think he would make it anywhere and started to panic. He was convinced that he was going to die out there. That’s how the menacing setting affected the character, filling him with fear and despair.
1105	7085	3	3	While the cyclist was trying to get to Yosemite National Park he listened to some old men who gave him directions for a shortcut. When he began his trip, the weather was pleasant and the road seemed promising, so everything was fine. But then he found that along the “shortcut” there was not a single building in sight. The landscape was just a barren expanse. By the time he figured out that the old men were mistaken, he had almost run out of water. There was nothing around that he could drink, not even a small stream or a puddle. He was getting very thirsty, and his throat was parched. The fact that he was in the deserts of California in June didn’t make his task any easier. The sun was beating down mercilessly. About halfway through his ride he ran into rolling hills. These hills were steep and difficult to climb, which made his trip even harder. Towards the end he found a building and he used all of his remaining strength to get to it just to find that it was an abandoned juice factory. As he entered, he gazed at the picture of the boy who was drinking juice, which made going without water much harder. In the end he finally made it to a paint shop where he guzzled all the water he possibly could, relieving his intense thirst and finally getting some much - needed relief.
1106	7086	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist greatly. For instance, when he was riding on the road, he would carefully pick a specific destination and then steadily ride towards it. After reaching that destination, he would take a short break to regain his energy. If this destination was a building, he would be full of strong will and determination, pushing himself forward. However, if it looked like there was nothing ahead but a series of hills, he would just keep riding aimlessly and wait to fall over dead without a care in the world. This shows how the setting's features had a significant impact on his cycling experience.
1107	7087	3	3	One rickety, ramsackle shed, several extremely rusty pumps, and a dilapidated corral that couldn't even hold in the lamest mule greeted me. This dismal sight was truly troubled. There was not a single soul in sight, no building, no car, or any structure of any kind to be seen. With any bad luck, I'd hit a bump and lodge something in my throat. There was a rough road ahead. If he didn't take the old man's advice, he would have enjoyed his bike ride, but he definitely needed a new map to find his way better.
1108	7088	3	3	The features in the story affect the cyclist by leaving him without anything to drink. The person was embarking on a journey to a place far away, with absolutely no food or water available for miles. He was in a very precarious situation and could have easily died. There is another feature that affects the cyclist, and that is the fact that no one is around for miles. If he died out there in the desolate area, no one would know for days. I know this because in the story he said, “There was no one in sight, not a building, car or structure of any kind.” That statement says it all. The last feature is that it was extremely hot. I know this because it says, “I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June.” It is well - known that it is hot in June, and it is even hotter in the deserts of California, which made the cyclist's situation even more difficult.
1109	7089	3	3	People who travel will almost always encounter difficulties. For the main character in this story, this is very true. His first big mistake was when he took directions from the “old - timers”. By doing that, he ended up travelling extremely far out of his way. In the story, he talked to the old men sitting on the porch. He said, “What I shouldn't have done was to let them see my map”. Another problem he faced was when he began to gradually run out of water. This caused a serious problem for him because of the threat of dehydration. In the story, he said, “The water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips.” Additionally, another problem he encountered was the vast desert area that he was riding through. This caused a problem for him because there wasn't anybody around to offer help if he needed it. In the story, he says, “There was no one in sight, not a building, cars, or structure of any kind.” By reading this story, we've realized that people encounter problems everywhere, however, any problem, no matter what size, can be overcome with the right mindset and effort.
1110	7090	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because on page @NUM1 it talks about how the cyclist had to first go down a steep hill and then search for a factory to get some juice. If the cyclist didn't find any building, he would have continued going down the hill and wasted the little bit of energy he had left for no good reason. This clearly shows how the setting features can have a negative impact on the cyclist's journey and energy levels.
1111	7091	3	3	Since the cyclist was really thirsty, parched from the long ride under the scorching sun, the setting was not very appealing considering it was a vast, arid desert with nothing but sand stretching as far as the eye could see. You could tell she was stressing because she was sweating profusely, and having a tough time trying to pedal her heavy bike through the soft sand. Eventually, she hoped to find an oasis where she could quench her thirst and rest.
1112	7092	3	3	The setting affects the cyclist in a way that most people can't tell. Cycling forty miles on maybe just a single gallon of water is incredibly hard, especially in the blistering heat of California. “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, sipping small amounts to make it last, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June, where the sun beats down relentlessly.” The effect on his body would be rather devastating, potentially leading to dehydration and fatigue.
1113	7093	3	3	In the story, the features of the setting affect the cyclist in that when he is riding, he has very little water, just a few sips left in his bottle. Also, he takes advice from old men sitting under a shady tree by the roadside. Then he meets up with a venomous snake slithering across the path, which startles him. He then goes down a bumpy dirt road, and at that time, he has no water left at all. The conclusion is that he comes off the dirt road and rejoins the main road that he travels. Also, he promised to stick to it in the future. That is how you should stick to things in the future, learning from the challenges and making better choices.
1114	7094	3	3	The biker has many features in his story. For example, he uses descriptive words that vividly put pictures into my head. When he says “One long, crippling hill,” I can clearly picture a steep, never - ending incline that seems to go on forever. And when he states “There was no one in sight,” I can imagine the empty, desolate landscape around him. All of these parts of the story put detailed pictures in my head. That's a good thing, for example, you want the reader to fully understand the situation, and by having descriptive words, it helps the reader to be more immersed in the story.
1115	7095	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. One way is that the “rolling hills” in the hot month of July let the rider get more tired as he has to constantly pedal up and down. Another way is the loss of water from severe heat, as the sun evaporates the sweat from his body at an alarming rate. And finally, the path you take along the way and how many stops you make along the way can also impact the cyclist. The heat, lack of water, rolling hills, and the advice you get can result badly by affecting the outcome of the ride. A rider should make a plan, like mapping out water stops and rest points, and use determination to get to where they need to go, no matter the challenges posed by the setting.
1116	7096	3	3	The setting in the story “Do not exceed posted speed limit” reflects upon the cyclist. In the story, a cyclist is riding his trusty bike along the road and takes directions from a group of old men sitting on their porches. Later, he realizes that these old men probably had no idea that things change over time. He says, “Never accept travel advice from a collection of old - timers who haven’t left their porches since Carter was in office.” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The cyclist takes the old - timers’ so - called “shortcut,” and it seems to take an eternity to reach his destination. At the end, he finally reaches his campsite, and another person asks him for directions. This time, the cyclist says, “Yes, sir! I own a very good map,” and “I’d always stick to it in the future.” The cyclist’s message is to follow a map, something you know is right, not a person that might be lying or irresponsible. In conclusion, relying on a reliable map is a wiser choice than trusting the potentially outdated advice of others.
1117	7097	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by making him extremely dehydrated and unbearably hot. He was cycling in the vast deserts on a bicycle, and his water supply was steadily running low. The road was rough, with plenty of steep hills that made it extremely hard for a bike to navigate. He kept going, even though the heat was outrageous, and dehydration was beginning to overcome him. Despite the harsh conditions, he persevered, but it was clear that the setting was taking a heavy toll on him. In conclusion, the unforgiving desert setting severely impacted the cyclist's physical state.
1118	7098	3	3	I think the boy should ask you directions for the place where he is going. He might be able to reach the place without water, but that is definitely not a good thing to do. Traveling without water can lead to dehydration, which can cause various health problems and make the journey extremely difficult and dangerous. So, it is crucial for the boy to ask for directions and also ensure he has an adequate supply of water. In conclusion, asking for directions and having water are essential for the boy's safe journey.
1119	7099	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist’s mood throughout the essay. Joe @CAPS1 starts with being happy and confident, full of enthusiasm as he begins his journey, to determined yet feeling helpless, and then to relief. Joe writes, “Things began well enough… flat roads…” This quote suggests that in the beginning, everything was okay. He started out with a “smile on the face.” (@NUM1) However, things start to change when @CAPS1 hits the changing terrain. He writes, “…I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.” This quote states the changing terrain. He starts to lose water to keep him going, yet he pushes himself to the next “town.” Finally, when the author reaches “Gary & Wilber’s fish camp,” he is relieved when he sees an old guy sitting. The two men say, “Know The best way to get There? “Yes sir! I own a very good map.” This reveals that Joe didn't ask for more directions, which was his first mistake. In addition, changes in setting can change a person's mood and attitude. In conclusion, the ever - changing setting had a profound impact on Joe's emotional state during his journey.
1120	7100	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because it is in the desert during the scorching summer. This setting affects the cyclist because he is riding a bike under these harsh conditions. For example, in the story, he is running out of water rapidly. He is starting to get dehydrated, feeling weak and light - headed. The intense heat of the desert and the physical exertion of cycling make the lack of water a serious problem. In conclusion, the desert - summer setting has a detrimental effect on the cyclist's well - being.
1121	7101	3	3	The setting affected the cyclist because of the mood it created and how each change in the setting occurred. For instance, when the setting changed, the cyclist's emotions shifted, and it truly had an impact on him. Like if the setting was a sunny day in a charming town, with clear blue skies and friendly faces, then he would feel elated. But if he was in a dark, gloomy town with a cold, damp atmosphere, he wouldn't feel very happy. So, in conclusion, the setting really affected him in a profound way.
1122	7102	3	3	After some time into his trip, he mentioned, “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” I believe that this arid and expansive setting had spurred him on, getting him determined to keep on pedaling so he could survive. But then, as the heat intensified and the miles seemed endless, he started to think he might die. However, he wasn't sad or upset; instead, he was oddly happy. He had sort of let out a soft chuckle to himself, because of the fact that he might die simply because he listened to some old men's advice. In my opinion, I think he was having the time of his life pedaling through this desolate yet mesmerizing setting of California, experiencing a unique kind of adventure.
1123	7103	3	3	Where the cyclist was gave him more disadvantages than advantages. The advantages were that there were hills to go down, allowing him to gain some speed and rest his legs briefly. However, the disadvantages were numerous. There were hills to go up, which required a great deal of energy. His water was running out when he was in the middle of nowhere, with the blistering sun making the heat unbearable. He was very hot out and was lost in the desert, with no clear sense of direction. He didn't have much hope until he saw the factory in the distance. The biggest disadvantage is that he was on a bike, and not in a car. So he had no air - conditioning and had to pedal to keep going. But being in the desert on a bike with no water, and being last in the group, is quite dire. He is very lucky that he made it up the hill or else he would've died out there. And he thought he was seeing things; good thing he checked it out. In conclusion, for future reference, it's wiser to ride in a car and not use a bike in the desert, as it's not a smart choice.
1124	7104	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because when all the cyclist is worried about is finding a place with water, all he's doing is getting scared and panicking. In other words, when he's looking around, the setting he sees is a vast expanse of desert with no buildings in sight. The story says, “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” When he sees this desolate landscape, with the hot sand stretching as far as the eye can see, he panics and thinks he's not going to make it, which affects him mentally. This mental distress further hampers his ability to continue the journey effectively. So, the setting's features have a significant negative impact on the cyclist.
1125	7105	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in different ways. The woman who had listened to the older men to get where she was going had made a fateful decision that led her to run out of water and almost die of thirst. As she was making her way to this place, in the desolate expanse, she had an encounter with a snake. “At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake; it really did look like a diamondback” (@NUM1). The sight of the snake added to her already high - stress situation. As the dehydration set in, she started to see things that weren't there, her mind playing tricks on her due to the harsh setting. In conclusion, the unforgiving features of the setting had a detrimental effect on her journey and well - being.
1126	7106	3	3	He was affected by the acute lack of water, the steep hills, the menacing snake in the way, and the poor condition of the road. The water bottles, which were supposed to sustain him, contained only a few tantalizing sips. “This quote explains how the lack of water was a problem. The hills affected him as they were “crippling,” making each pedal - stroke an arduous task. The snake, which was lying across a long stretch of the road, left him in a fix as he didn't know how to get past it safely. Finally, the roads were rough and bumpy, and it was unwise to go over the speed limit of 55 mph. So, he was affected in a lot of different ways, not just one, and these challenges made his journey extremely difficult.
1127	7107	3	3	The features of the desolate and barren desert path make the cyclist quite nervous, but they also stoke his determination to escape them. As he pedals along, he passes “ghost towns” with their crumbling facades, “abandoned buildings” that stand as silent witnesses to a bygone era, and diamondback snakes slithering menacingly. These are images traditionally associated with being lost in the deserts, and would be enough to instill fear in most anyone travelling alone. The author even remarks that sadists are probably finding his story pleasing, perhaps relishing in his struggles. He often mentions fears of “dropping” dead from exhaustion, being eaten by vultures circling overhead, and, at one point, even wishing death upon himself via choking, albeit jokingly. And yet, he was determined to live. In spite of the odds stacked against him, he moved on, even after losing “what (he) believed to be (his) lost burst energy.” He even maintains a sense of humor throughout, writing of a diary entry that would be left behind, which remarks on the wisdom of old men. In the end, when he finally finds a place to rest, he turns it all into a lesson he’ll surely abide by: follow the map, as it is his guide through the treacherous unknown.
1128	7108	3	3	The cyclist is affected by the scorching heat, the daunting hills, and the eerie lack of people. For example, the cyclist was growing short on water, and there were “wide rings of dried sweat on his shirt,” a clear sign of his intense perspiration. He was in such a dire situation that he “could drop from heatstroke.” The hills, with their steep inclines, must have forced him to use more energy with each pedal - turn. Lastly, the desolate land was devoid of people. If the towns still had people, the cyclist wouldn't have been as affected by the setting, as he could have sought water, rest, and assistance. In conclusion, these factors combined to make his cycling experience extremely challenging.
1129	7109	3	3	Features of any setting affect what you do and how you do it. Features affect the cyclist by depriving him of water, help, and safety. “I’d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirsty by allowing what spit you have to circulate.” This quote shows his desperate need for water, as he resorts to sucking on a rock to make use of his own spit. The rough terrain and the abandoned road that the old men sent him on, which was out - of - date, made him unable to ask for directions, and he had no way to even know if he was travelling correctly. Along the road, he meets a snake, a menacing presence in this desolate landscape. Being so far away from civilization, if he was to have gotten bit, then he would have no one to help save him from dying on the side of the road. Also, if he was to have a heatstroke, he has no water and no help. Safety, help, and water are all factors which contribute to the features, and how they affect the cyclist, making his journey fraught with peril.
1130	7110	3	3	The features of the setting make the ride for the cyclist very hard. It has a lot of steep hills, which would make him exert more energy with every pedal - push. Also, it is a desert, so it is extremely hot and dry. The blistering sun beats down on him, making the author need more water than he normally would. The author said “…I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June,” a time when the heat is at its peak. The author knew that it was very dangerous to travel there without water, as he said “…I could drop from heatstroke…” If the setting had been cooler, there would not be so much danger, and his journey would have been far more bearable. In summary, the harsh setting was a major obstacle for the cyclist.
1131	7111	3	3	"The cyclist's surroundings affected him negatively. He was cycling through the sweltering high deserts of California in June, as described by Kurmaskie (@NUM1). His water bottle was gradually running out, and the only town he reached that had water had water that tasted like battery acid. Events seemed rather dire, until the speaker became elated when they spotted a @ORGANIZATION1 factory. The author was extremely thirsty, and on the side of the building, there was a sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth (Kurmaskie @NUM1). However, the building was abandoned. The speaker then states, ""Somehow I climbed away from the abandoned factory of juices and dreams, slowly gaining elevation while losing hope"" (Kurmaskie @NUM3). After that disheartening landscape, he lost hope and pretty much gave up. The landscape and features affected the author very negatively due to the severe lack of water, leaving him in a desperate situation."
1132	7112	3	3	The setting significantly affects the cyclist as there are numerous steep hills that make pedaling extremely challenging and very little available water. The hills require a great deal of energy to climb, exhausting the cyclist, and the scarcity of water leaves him constantly parched and at risk of dehydration. This combination of difficult terrain and limited water supply makes the cyclist's journey arduous and dangerous, clearly demonstrating how the setting has a detrimental impact on his experience.
1133	7113	3	3	"The cyclist in the story ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" by Joe Kurmashie is heavily affected by the features of the setting in the story. First is the ""shorecay"" route that is suggested to get to @CAPS1. This path naturally just ends up isolating him, separating him from all other people and putting him in the middle of a desolate nowhere with a limited supply of water. His water shortage is the second crucial thing that affects him because it makes him despair deeply and feel that he is on the verge of collapsing and dying. In the story, he says: ""It really didn't matter. I was going to die and the lards would pick me clean."" This vivid statement clearly shows that the features of the setting made him feel utterly hopeless, trapped in a situation with no easy way out."
1134	7114	3	3	"Many features of the setting affected the cyclist in ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" by Joe Kurmaskie. One prominent feature that affected the character was the intense heat of the sun. The narration states that ""The sun was beginning to beat down"" (@CAPS1), baking the cyclist as he rode. This intense heat made the cyclist uncomfortable, sapping his energy and increasing his need for water. The heat added to the overall difficulty of his journey, clearly demonstrating how the setting's feature had a negative impact on the cyclist."
1135	7115	3	3	"The features of the setting greatly affected the cyclist in the story ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"". In the story, it says, ""I was traveling through the high desert of California in June."" This description is clearly telling the reader that the weather was extremely hot, and one needs a large amount of water here to survive, especially if you are riding a bike or doing physical work. Later on in the story, it says, ""I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state."" This quote provides the reader with information and reveals that the cyclist is struggling to survive through the harsh features of the setting. In California deserts, as I know from prior knowledge, it is hot and dry, especially in the summer. If you are working outside, like the cyclist in this story is, and you do not have enough water to drink, you will quickly get dehydrated, which eventually leads to life - threatening situations. The author effectively shows the readers how the setting affects the cyclist by painting a vivid picture of the cyclist's difficult circumstances."
1136	7116	3	3	In the essay “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the various aspects of the setting have a profound impact on the cyclist. One notable factor is the water situation. There is only a scarce amount of water available, and it is boiling hot under the scorching sun. Out of desperation, the cyclist took a small sip of it. He exclaimed, “It tasted like battery acid.” In my opinion, if the water is that hot, it's best not to even attempt to taste it. Another significant element is the land. The terrain transitioned from flat, straight stretches to hilly areas. As he pedaled up those inclines, the change in the land started to gradually slow him down. Lastly, the issue of daytime came into play. The day started turning dark, yet he was still determinedly biking along. He was eager to cover as much distance as he could before having to stop. This shows how the setting's features combined to pose challenges for the cyclist throughout his journey.
1137	7117	3	3	The features in the setting had a significant impact on the cyclist, causing him to get tired very easily as he was biking in the desert during the sweltering month of June. In this particular desert, there are no rivers whatsoever, which means he had no natural source to replenish his water supply. The heat was so intense that he could barely see clearly because the copious amount of sweat that poured down his face kept getting into his eyes. Moreover, due to the extreme heat, there were no people around in the vast expanse of the desert. This isolation and the lack of resources made his cycling experience extremely difficult. Overall, the harsh desert setting in June presented numerous obstacles for the cyclist, making his journey a real struggle.
1138	7118	3	3	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead, Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the setting had a notable influence on the cyclist. The setting affected the cyclist both mentally and physically. When the setting was pleasant, with clear skies, smooth roads, and a gentle breeze, he had a positive outlook on his journey and was brimming with energy. He pedaled with enthusiasm, enjoying the ride. However, later in the essay, as the setting grew less appealing, with rough roads, strong headwinds, and perhaps even a threatening sky, and more treacherous, the cyclist's spirit started to wane. He grew weary from the physical exertion and distressed by the worsening conditions. This clearly demonstrates how the setting can have a direct impact on a cyclist's state of mind and physical capabilities.
1139	7119	3	3	A cyclist always has to face a multitude of problems during their rides. For instance, the weather can be a major hurdle. Rain can make the roads slippery and cold temperatures can sap their energy, while extreme heat can lead to dehydration. The condition of the road is another significant issue. Potholes, uneven surfaces, and gravel can make the ride bumpy and increase the risk of accidents. Additionally, factors like traffic and road signs also add to the challenges. Despite these difficulties, cyclists persevere, showing their determination and love for the sport.
1140	7120	3	3	The features in the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. The first way the features in the setting affected the cyclist is that the whole trail was completely deserted, leaving him all alone with no access to water. In the story, it vividly describes, “This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time – say, before the last world war – but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.” This description clearly explains that he was alone and that the first town he visited was a desolate place. The lack of human presence and water in this deserted setting made his journey even more arduous. As he continued on, the setting's features continued to shape his experience, presenting new challenges at every turn.
1141	7121	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist as the lack of available water made him extremely tired and a bit delusional. The glaring lack of shade under the scorching sun increased the rate of his dehydration. The rough, uneven road made it incredibly hard to balance on his bike. And the heavy snack he had slowed him down significantly. In his exhausted state, he thought that he was going to die, his hope slowly fading away.
1142	7122	3	3	"The setting of the story ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" is very important to the events that occurred in the story. For example, the story was set on a long, desolate highway with a speed limit of @NUM1, while the cyclist was only able to maintain a speed of @NUM2. This is significant to the events of the story because since he was doing @NUM2, which by the way is a lot for a cyclist pedaling under such conditions, it led to him almost suffering from dehydration. Plus, the highway was hilly, making his journey even more arduous. This difficult situation ultimately led to the unfortunate execution of the cyclist. So, one could clearly see that the setting is very important to the outcome of the story as it directly influenced the cyclist's fate."
1143	7123	3	3	The setting is in a part of California which isn't really the coolest of places to be. With the sun beating down relentlessly, the temperature often soars, making the air feel thick and oppressive. The heat lingers, making it uncomfortable for anyone in the area. In such a setting, it becomes quite clear why it isn't the most appealing place to spend time.
1144	7124	3	3	At the beginning of his journey, the cyclist is relaxed and appreciative of the features of his environment. He says, “I enjoyed the serenity of an early - summer evening.” The gentle breeze and the soft glow of the setting sun added to the charm. At a campground in @LOCATION1, the setting is calming and relaxing. The tall trees provided shade, and the sound of a nearby stream was soothing. At the first town, the setting is shocking, but humorous to the cyclist and he starts to get nervous. After looking around he says, “this sight was troubling.” The dilapidated buildings and the eerie silence were unsettling. The cyclist's trip gets worse when he reads about the next town. “The flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” This part of his journey affects him the most. His environment and the features of the land have made him tired and thirsty. The setting has a major role for a cyclist, dictating his mood and physical state throughout the journey.
1145	7125	3	3	"In the essay ""Rough Road Ahead; Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting is integral to how the cyclist feels and behaves. The cyclist feels a growing desperation as the setting around him gets progressively more bleak. In the beginning of the trip, the cyclist encounters a ghost town. ""I chuckled, checked my water supply, and moved on."" At this point, he is still full of hope and thinking positively. A while later, the cyclist comes across another abandoned set of buildings. He feels that this sight is ""troubling."" Although @CAPS1 the cyclist is worried, he is not yet depressive and pessimistic. Farther down the road, the terrain of the road changes, and he sees the sign that gives the essay its name. ""The speed limit was 55 mph. I was doing a water - depleting @NUM1. Sometimes life can feel so cruel."" The cyclist's surroundings get progressively worse as he rides on, with the heat intensifying and the road becoming more challenging. But eventually, he finds a place with working water. He is so overjoyed by this building that he wants to find the owners and kiss them, as it represents a glimmer of hope in his otherwise difficult journey."
1146	7126	3	3	Some features of the setting that affect the cyclist is that he is riding a bike through the desert. He says, “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” So, under the scorching sun, he was pedaling a bike, feeling the intense heat. The road became bumpy and curvy. A sign had said, “Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed posted Speed limit.” The speed limit was @NUM1 and he was going @NUM2, so it must have been quite hard for him to get over all the bumps while trying to maintain control. Lastly, he comes across a poisonous snake that blocked the majority of the pavement in front of him. So, being dehydrated and trying to get around a snake would be truly terrifying. So, on his @CAPS1 journey, the setting doesn't help him much, making his cycling experience extremely challenging.
1147	7127	3	3	The cyclist ran into many issues in his/her travel to @LOCATION1. They had to dismiss many hardships such as a severe lack of water, getting lost in the vast expanse, the immense desert heat that seemed to never end, plus minor things like encountering snakes and dealing with poor road conditions. The setting of the California desert in June was the most intense hardship. That and the lack of water were like a double - edged sword. The heat started pounding at the cyclist's brain, causing them to see mirages and feel disoriented. The heat and the entire setting made the cyclist's travel much harder, testing their endurance to the limit.
1148	7128	3	3	The setting affects the cyclist because in the sweltering heat of California in June, which is a time when nobody wants to be outside for long. First, it was the heat which took a great deal out of his body as he struggled to keep it cool, his body sweating profusely. Then came the factor that he had very little water when he reached the first town. In the story, it said, “A tar - like substance oozed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.” So now, he has no cool water to drink. When he says, “Not two miles into the next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” So the cyclist, with very little water, now has to endure the hardest part of the ride. Later on, he makes a mention of changing a paragraph if he loses consciousness. Also, he talked about the possibility of getting a heatstroke. This all hints to the fact that the setting he was in was affecting him in many different ways, both physically and mentally.
1149	7129	3	3	The setting of the essay “Do not exceed posted speed limit” is very dry, sandy, hot, and deserted. On his way to Yosemite, he takes a “short cut” so he goes through the desert. When he first leaves, it is in a hot and flat part of the desert. His mood is high and he has confidence. “Things began well enough. I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.” With this positive state, he arrives at the first “town”. But he isn't worried as he has plenty of water, so he moves on. The terrain starts working against him in his search for water. “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills. A large highway sign jumped out at him. It read: Rough Road Ahead : Do not Exceed posted speed limit.” This lowers his confidence, especially because everything is deserted and if he has a heat stroke, no one would be around to find him. He keeps up his determination when he sees the factory yet he moves on. When he sees the first camp, he is overwhelmed with relief and the terrain flattens out again. When asked if he needs directions, he says he has his own map so he can stick to the terrain he knows is restful. He can keep his hopes up for himself and follow a true set of directions to reach his destination.
1150	7130	3	3	Anyone who has ever ridden a bike knows how relaxing it can truly be, but when you are forced to ride miles and miles on @CAPS3 rough terrain without any water, relaxation feels like an unreachable oasis. @CAPS1 Cycling through beat - up roads with dryness all around you really puts a damper on your experience. @CAPS2 Moreover, it extends your need for thirst by enhancing the amount of dryness in the air and the amount of energy you are expending. The ability to block all of that out and trying to focus on something easier to handle is exactly what you want to do in these situations. @CAPS3 Such challenging terrain can really build character into a cyclist, but adding the fact of the limited amount of water he had and the dryness around him, it sounds like pure torture. I can only hope that if I ever become a cyclist, I never have to endure this kind of situation, as it would surely test my limits.
1151	7131	3	3	The cyclist, Joe Kurmaskie, had a truly rough time traveling to Yosemite National Park. Granted, he was misled by some inaccurate directions, but if the conditions of the terrain and the climate were working in his favor, it would've made his journey a whole lot easier. Not only was it extremely hot, being in the arid desert of California in June, but he only had a single small water bottle. That one water bottle might have lasted a little longer if it was a straight, flat shot through, but the reality was far from it. The roads went up steep inclines, down sharp declines, there were numerous hills to climb, and scattered along the way were towns - some of them ghost towns at that. The only water he could pump from the rusty pump was scalding hot and tasted strongly acidic. Also, he wouldnít have lost as much energy if it was a straightforward path. Itís easy to say that he literally roughed it, having to resort to putting small, smooth rocks in his mouth to try and circulate saliva. All in all, he was very determined to work through the very unfortunate conditions he had working against him, and he was very lucky to survive that grueling journey.
1152	7132	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many profound ways. For example, the fact that he is pedaling a bike slowly through the vast high deserts of California in June, with the sun beating down mercilessly, make the intensity level of the story very high. The sweltering heat adds an extra layer of difficulty to his journey. If it would have been a cooler day, say in early spring, and there was a nice, refreshing breeze gently blowing across the landscape, it would be a completely different scenario. In such a more favorable setting, the cyclist would likely face less physical strain and the overall experience would be far less challenging.
1153	7133	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist by lack of water, the presence of a poisonous snake, and the poor condition of the road. For example, the lack of water affected the cyclist severely because he couldn't make it very far without water. In the scorching heat, his body was rapidly losing fluids, and he could of passed out if he didn't have access to water. Another example of how the setting affected the cyclist would be the poisonous snake slithering around in the underbrush. If he would have gotten bitten by that venomous snake, he could have died because there would be nobody around in that desolate area to help him. And the last example of how the setting affected him would be the condition of the road. The road was full of potholes and had many steep hills and windy bends. This made it tougher for the cyclist to get to his destination as he had to constantly adjust his speed and balance. This is how I think the setting affected the cyclist, making his journey a perilous and arduous one.
1154	7134	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One way is that if itís hot and you're riding a long way under the blazing sun, you need a large amount of water so you donít get dehydrated. The heat causes you to sweat profusely, quickly depleting your body's water reserves. Also, it can affect your vision because you're constantly looking directly at the bright sun, which can cause glare and make it hard to see clearly ahead. Another way cyclists can get affected by the setting is because what if the road is all bumpy, full of cracks and potholes, and just not in good shape. Such a rough road surface can affect the way they ride their bike. It can make it difficult to maintain a steady speed and balance, and may even cause damage to the bike's tires and components. In conclusion, the setting can have a significant impact on a cyclist's journey, both physically and in terms of the ride itself.
1155	7135	3	3	The story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by the author @PERSON1 had some statements that seemed kind of pointless to put in. One of the sentences in the essay had a couple of words that donít need to be used. In the sentence, “about forty miles into the pedal, I arrive at the first ‘town’”, I donít think “into the pedal” needs to be in there because it's not really describing anything relevant to the context. It doesn't add any useful information about the distance, the journey, or the town. Removing those words would make the sentence more concise and to the point, improving the overall flow of the story.
1156	7136	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One way is the harshness of the setting. The cyclist is out in the desert, under the scorching sun in two - hundred degree weather. With very little water, he struggles to keep himself hydrated. Also, the cyclist didn't have a map and he asked someone who hasn't left their porch since Carter was in office. That person, living in isolation for so long, had no real - time knowledge of the area. ""Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn't been off their porch in decades."" This quote talks about how the setting (two - hundred degree weather, desert) can endanger him. Also, he listened to someone that didn't know what they were talking about. In conclusion, the extreme heat, lack of resources, and unreliable advice due to the setting all had a detrimental impact on the cyclist."
1157	7137	3	3	The setting of the story is very desert - like. What I mean by that is it's a vast, arid desert where the heat is intense. The cyclist really had to push himself to make it through this unforgiving environment. The condition of the road is very rough and it has a lot of sharp turns. These turns require the cyclist to be extra cautious while riding. At one part in the story, he gets a boost of energy and pedals as hard as he can down a hill. Then, he relaxes for a bit, taking advantage of the momentum. This is the setting and a summary of how the cyclist navigated through it in the story.
1158	7138	3	3	The setting affected the cyclist because the condition of his surroundings was extremely hot. The sweltering heat made him dehydrate more rapidly, so he needed more water to stay hydrated. There were a lot of hills on the route, and to get up these hills, he had to pedal harder and use more energy. The landscape was devoid of cars, buildings, and smog; there was just pure nature. It was a peaceful and relaxing ride on the bike in some aspects, but the heat and the hills added to the challenges. Overall, the combination of the hot climate and the hilly terrain, along with the serene natural setting, all had an impact on the cyclist's journey.
1159	7139	3	3	Features of the setting affect the cyclist in a great way. His journey would not be as difficult if these factors had not crossed his path. Climate, location, and population all have an effect on the cyclist. In the story, it is told that the cyclist is in the dry climate of California, in the sweltering heat of June. There is also a lack of water, so he must pace his sips carefully to make the limited supply last. There are few towns in the area, making it hard to get good advice and essential supplies. The cyclist also comes across a snake, making him affected by native wild life. The dry climate and lack of water make him have self - doubt. The cyclist is constantly worried about passing out and dying of dehydration. The cyclist also gets doubts when he sees the road signs reminding him how slow he is going. The snake also has a depressing effect as it highlights the dangers on his journey. All of these things in the setting affected the cyclist. His journey does teach you though, that through determination you will be rewarded. You have to want things bad enough and put the effort into it. The author also teaches you to always have a positive attitude to achieve success, even when facing difficult circumstances in the journey.
1160	7140	3	3	The features and settings affected the cyclist because of all the dangers associated with his journey. He took advice from old people to embark on this cycling trip. At first, it started out good, but as is often the case, almost nothing lasts forever. He's riding in the middle of summer, with little water, in the vast expanse of the desert. He runs into towns that are abandoned, and the next town is only @NUM1 miles away, with literally rough roads ahead. The desolate landscape and the lack of resources make his journey extremely challenging. But when he did reach the abandoned town, his spirits were low until he found hope in the form of seeing a man in a chair. This small glimmer of human presence gave him the motivation to continue his arduous journey.
1161	7141	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist as he is cycling outside of town. I say this because the cyclist mentions “old timers who haven't left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office.” This indicates that he is in an area where the locals are quite sedentary and perhaps out - of - touch. So, it means he doesn't know exactly where he's at, which makes his journey more challenging.
1162	7142	3	3	In the cyclist's journey to Yosemite, several factors hinder him from reaching it. The first is obviously the false information given to him by the elders. These elders, perhaps set in their old ways, provided directions that were inaccurate. The second is that because the information wasn't true, the cyclist had an insufficient amount of water. He planned his water supply based on the wrong directions, which made him dehydrated. The last is the fact that the route given to him included obstacles such as snakes, rocky roads, and old ghost towns and abandoned buildings which made the cyclist less confident. These features of the setting combined to make his journey extremely difficult and ultimately affected his ability to reach Yosemite.
1163	7143	3	3	The setting affects the cyclist because, first of all, he should have stuck to his own map. His own map was based on more reliable data, and by deviating from it, he got into trouble. He should have also packed an extra bottle of water. In an unfamiliar setting, having an extra supply of water is always a good idea. Moreover, he should not take any advice from people that haven't left the porch in years. These people may not be aware of the current conditions of the area, and their advice can lead him astray. By not following these precautions, the cyclist faced difficulties due to the setting.
1164	7144	3	3	The setting affects the cyclist's mood in the story. The cyclist takes a short - cut with many abandoned towns and buildings, as well as a bumpy terrain. This desolate and rough setting immediately sets a somber tone. When he came to a fork in his path that had a water pump, he was hopeful. He immediately began to pump it, but unfortunately, the water was not good for drinking. Despite this setback, he was determined to make it to the next town. “I could make that,” he said. Because of the ghost town and the old, non - functioning pump, he had to continue on with a heavy heart. When the cyclist came to a sign in the road warning him about the road ahead, he began to get depressed. “I was sad,” he said. Finally, when he reached @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 Fish Camp, he was thankful and wanted to show his gratitude. The setting can affect a cyclist by his mood. At first, the cyclist is determined, but as the setting gets worse with more desolation and obstacles, his mood and hopes go down the drain. At the end when the setting is bright and he reaches his destination, so is his mood.
1165	7145	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because he was thirsty and it was hot. The sweltering heat made his thirst even more unbearable, and he was almost out of water. He was in a dire situation and almost died because when he was drinking the water, he hit a bump and a bit of spit got lodged in his throat, causing him to choke. On top of that, there were tiring hills that seemed to never end. The continuous uphill climbs in the hot and dry setting sapped his energy. All these features of the setting combined to make his journey a life - threatening struggle.
1166	7146	3	3	The features of the setting significantly affect the cyclist. Right from the start, he is ill - prepared. The cyclist gets directions from an old man who hasn't left his porch in years. With such a long period of inactivity, the old man has no idea about the recent changes in the area. Then, the cyclist begins his journey with a meager supply of water. When he reaches the second town, he notices a notable change in the terrain. The previously flat road is now replaced by short rolling hills. As the quote “I notice the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.” indicates, he was completely unprepared for these hills and assumed the route would be flat all the way. Moreover, in the scorching @NUM1 - degree weather and with limited water, pedaling up and down the hills becomes an arduous task. However, going down the hills offers him a brief respite. In conclusion, these various features of the setting have a substantial impact on the cyclist's journey.
1167	7147	3	3	A lot of factors have a significant effect on the cyclist. The temperature, terrain, and directions all instill doubt in the cyclist's mind. The high temperatures in the deserts of California leave the cyclist feeling extremely hot, desperately parched, and highly irritable. Throughout the story, he is left with just a few sips of water. The realization of running low on water makes him “feel sorry for himself”. As the cyclist pedals on, the terrain starts to change from flat ground to “rolling hills”. This change can be a major challenge for someone who has never biked on different elevations before. Lastly, the feeling of hope, or rather the lack of it, might affect him the most. Doubting oneself is indeed the most difficult obstacle to overcome. Carelessly taking instructions from an old man has cost the cyclist hours of suffering. The author skillfully uses hyperbole to exaggerate the cyclist's sense of lost hope. Additionally, the detailed descriptions in the text paint a vivid picture for the reader. These literary elements effectively help the reader understand the impact that temperature, terrain, and hope have on the cyclist. In essence, they make the story more relatable and the cyclist's struggles more palpable.
1168	7148	3	3	The features of the setting truly have a profound impact on the cyclist. The immediate surroundings mislead him into having false expectations. Little does he know that this seemingly harmless situation will soon put him in serious danger. When he encounters a large rock in the road and discovers that the water pumps are in poor condition, his peril becomes evident. As the text states, “The sun was beginning to heat down, but it hardly noticed. The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them.” The idyllic setting allows the cyclist's mind to wander so much that he fails to even notice the increasing heat. In conclusion, the setting's features not only deceive the cyclist but also lead him into a precarious situation.
1169	7149	3	3	In the short story, “Do Not Exceed Posted speed limit,” by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting, such as the lack of water and the inability to find help, have a profound impact on the cyclist in the story. During his time of dire need, the cyclist despondently remarks, “It didn’t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean, leaving only some expensive outdoor gear and a diary with the last entry in praise old men their wisdom.” The lack of essential necessities in the surrounding environment makes him lose his pride and abandon hope. However, when the cyclist finally finds hope, he exclaims, “And drank deeply from the sink, I had an overwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber, kiss them, and buy some bait.” He is utterly astonished by what he has stumbled upon and is deeply grateful to be alive. The cyclist should not have taken the advice of the old people for granted. From this experience, he will now be more discerning when relying on others' sense of directions. In conclusion, the setting's features in the story have a life - changing effect on the cyclist, teaching him a valuable lesson.
1170	7150	3	3	Setting plays a crucial role in stories as it can affect many aspects. In this particular story, the setting has a significant impact on the cyclist. The sweltering heat of the setting slows him down considerably. For instance, he mentions that he was supposed to cover 55 miles, but the intense heat makes it a herculean task. The heat drains his energy, making each pedal stroke a struggle. In conclusion, the hot setting in this story has a clear and detrimental effect on the cyclist's ability to complete his journey efficiently.
1171	7151	3	3	The setting in the story was the “high deserts of California in June.” At first, the cyclist, full of energy and enthusiasm, had seemed really confident and excited about his journey. However, it was during the journey that something had changed his mind. The cyclist was running low on his water supply, so he stops and pumps water from this old - fashioned water pump. But all he gets is this unpleasant acid taste. So he is on his way to the nearest town which is @NUM1 miles away and he firmly thinks he can make it. As he is heading towards the nearest town, the terrain starts changing. It gradually changes from a flat, easy - going road to short rolling hills. During this arduous time, the cyclist starts losing hope. He vividly imagines that he is going to die of dehydration and the birds are going to pick him apart. Then, when he thought he couldn't make it, he saw a sign that said “Gary and @CAPS1 fish camp.” He rushed into the shop and took long, refreshing drinks from the sink in the bathroom. When he went out of the store, an older gentleman asked him if he needed help and he said no, “I have a really good map.” The hot temperature and rolling hills have a negative effect on the cyclist. I mean he goes from being confident to thinking he is seeing mirages and dying. It states in the story “I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn't a mirage” and “I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.” So this brought self - doubting behavior, which clearly shows how the harsh setting can shatter one's confidence.
1172	7152	3	3	The features of the setting where the cyclist is located affect them very drastically. Cyclists need a reliable water supply, and if they don't have one, they might dehydrate or even face the risk of death. Shade trees are also essential as they act as a shield, keeping the intense sun from beaming down on them so hard. They should also plan their cycling when it's not as hot outside. This way, just in case their water gets low, there is a better chance of survival. It would be great if there was someone accompanying them on the journey to offer help if they get hurt. There should be buildings nearby just in case of an emergency, such as sudden illness or mechanical problems with the bike. It might even be good to carry a cell phone to call for assistance in difficult situations. In conclusion, a well - equipped and favorable setting is crucial for the safety and success of a cyclist's journey.
1173	7153	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in more than one way. The first features were a dilapidated ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps that looked like they hadn't been used in ages, and a corral that could hardly hold in the lamest mule. These items gave the cyclist a strong feeling of doubts. They made him begin to think he had taken the wrong route when he saw these things were so outdated. Then, he struggled desperately but couldn't get any cold, clean water out of the pumps to save his life. This was the first obstacle which affected him severely. The next features of the setting which caused a problem were the tumbleweeds that rolled across his path menacingly and “a ridiculously large snake.” They made the cyclist extremely scared and caused him to go around these things cautiously. You can tell he was scared because he quoted “I eased past.” When the flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills, the cyclist's journey became exhausting, never - ending, and difficult. Two more things affected the cyclist. These two things consist of the signs. One of which read “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” and the other “GARY AND WILBER'S FISH - IF you want bait for the big ones, we're your BEST BET.” The first sign affected him in a negative way and caused him to become a little angry and frustrated because he was tired and dehydrated and the rough road ahead gave him no hope. The second sign led him to water which was the one thing that would make things better so it had a positive affect. These are features that had a significant impact on the cyclist, highlighting how the setting can shape a journey.
1174	7154	3	3	The setting affected the cyclist due to the changes in terrain. A rough spot for the cyclist was when the terrain changed from a flat, smooth stretch to rolling hills. The author wrote, “I tolled on” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The cyclist was pushing through the rough and it was not an easy stretch to get through. With each pedal stroke, he could feel the strain on his muscles. Another place in the cyclist's trip that was difficult was when he saw the abandoned juice factory. The narration states, “over one long, crippling hill, a building came into view” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The context clues that provide information that it wasn't easy are the words “long” and “crippling.” Both of those words provide feelings of being dragged on through the rough setting of the cyclist's trip. In conclusion, the changing terrain and the sight of the abandoned building in the setting added great difficulty to the cyclist's journey.
1175	7155	3	3	The cyclist had experienced some hard obstacles on his ride to Yosemite. He had gotten directions from a group of old men who hadn't gone the places they told him about in a long time. Where they said there would be a town, it turned out to be more like a desolate ghost town. The day that the cyclist was riding was extremely hot and he was riding through the desert, which made the situation worse. Because of the scorching heat, he was drinking his water regularly to stay hydrated. This meant he was running out of it fast. Since the old men had given him directions through places that were no longer open, he couldn't get more water. The cyclist also had to go over roads that were in bad condition, full of potholes and uneven surfaces, which slowed him down even more. Those features of the setting affected the cyclist a lot on his trip, making his journey to Yosemite a real struggle.
1176	7156	3	3	Many features of the setting affect the cyclist. In the beginning, as he pedals along under the scorching sun, he cannot get water and gradually becomes dehydrated. His throat feels parched and his energy starts to wane. Then, he encounters a rough stretch of road filled with potholes and uneven surfaces. The constant jolting and effort to maintain balance on this rough ride cause him to lose more energy. His legs ache and his body grows tired. Then he spots the bait, which turns out to be a small water station. He rushes over and takes a long drink, replenishing his lost fluids. All of these greatly affect the cyclist's condition, making his journey a challenging one.
1177	7157	3	3	The setting of the cyclist's journey affected him because he was in a vast desert in California. The intense heat of the desert sun beat down on him as he had to ride his bike through it. The heat took a lot out of him, making him sweat profusely and feel extremely fatigued. He didn't have a lot of water because there were no rivers or water supply due to the arid desert surrounding him. His water bottles were nearly empty, and he could feel the effects of dehydration setting in. At the end, he spots a small store in the distance. This affects him because he quickly rushes inside, gets a cool drink, and some essential supplies which helped him regain his strength. So in the end, his surroundings first destroyed his energy and well - being and then relieved him.
1178	7158	3	3	"The bicyclist was riding to Yosemite National Park, excited about the beautiful scenery that awaited him. But on the way, he ran out of water. ""The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips."" His throat was dry, and he could feel his energy draining. Then, hills came into play. As he started climbing the hills, he could feel the extra effort in his legs. The short rolling hills made him more tired and thirsty. ""Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills."" The rider's desperation grew, and he didn't think he would live. ""I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean."" But then, by chance, he found a place to get water. He rushed inside, ""drank deeply from the sink,"" and with new - found energy, he finished his ride to Yosemite."
1179	7159	3	3	"In the story ""Do not exceed Posted Speed Limit"" by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting affected the cyclist a lot. At first, when the cyclist set off in the morning, the conditions were great. A gentle breeze blew, providing a refreshing feeling, and there was shade from the tall trees lining the road. The sound of nearby rivers added to the pleasant atmosphere. Then, after a few hours of riding, the cyclist found himself in the desert with bumpy hills. In the story, the speaker states, ""Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills."" The poor condition of the roads and the lack of water really affected the cyclist. It took more energy to get up and down the hills without any shade, which meant that he needed more water, but he didn't have any. His body was struggling in the harsh conditions. The condition of the setting really affected the cyclist, and if it was easier to bike, they might not have been so dehydrated."
1180	7160	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist by disturbing them to ride on the road, limiting their speed, and making their distance longer than the original travel plan. For example, the features at the setting disturb the cyclist to ride on the road because they clearly tell them where they can go and where they can't. There are signs like ""no entering"" or ""one way"" that restrict their movement. These signs force the cyclist to change their route, which can be quite frustrating. Second, it limits their speed. If the features of the setting state that the limited speed is @NUM1, the cyclist can only ride about @NUM1 and go no further. This means they have to pedal at a slower pace, which can make the cyclist take a longer time to reach the place that they want to go and they can't travel as fast as they'd like. Third, it makes their distance longer than the original travel plan. For instance, a sign like ""Rough road ahead, do not exceed posted speed limit"" makes them slow down and take a more cautious approach. This can add extra time and distance to their journey. Therefore, the features of the setting affect the cyclist during the journey, making it more complex and time - consuming."
1181	7161	3	3	The features of the challenging setting significantly affect the cyclist as they constantly make him doubt and greatly lessen his chances for survival. However, the cyclist remains incredibly determined, and it is this unwavering determination that ultimately enables him to survive.
1182	7162	3	3	"In the essay, the various features of the desolate setting have a profound impact on the cyclist. One prominent feature that affects him severely is his acute lack of water: ""The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips."" This scarce supply of water made him extremely desperate, especially when he came across the Welch's grape juice factory. The dilapidated building, which had been abandoned years earlier, was once a bustling Welch's grape juice factory and bottling plant. This initial dispersion, after he had come to the abandoned factory, was quickly followed by intense disappointment and a vague sense of hopelessness, clearly expressed by the phrase, ""I hung my head"" after he had found the long - deserted factory. These are some of the key features of the setting that have a detrimental effect on the cyclist."
1183	7163	3	3	No water, rough terrain, and bad information - all are valid reasons why the boy isn't doing so well. I mentioned no water because he is severely dehydrated, yet he has to ration his scarce water supply carefully. Also, he is at high risk of dying from heat exhaustion due to the lack of proper hydration. I also pointed out the rough terrain because on such uneven ground, he could easily fall and get badly hurt, with no one around to offer immediate help. And to make matters even worse, he took advice from old people who clearly didn't know what they were talking about. These are all examples from the essay that support my writing.
1184	7164	3	3	In the story by Joe Kurmaskie, it vividly tells about a cyclist's arduous challenge through the sweltering deserts of California in June. The cyclist had initially started out with great confidence, which was then followed by unwavering determination, and later a brief sense of relief. The harsh setting affected the cyclist both physically and mentally. First, listening to the old men was a foolish decision, then taking the trip without being certain if he would have enough water was a major risk, and lastly, traveling through the desert in June was an extremely unwise choice. He started getting a little doubtful about himself as well, and this self - doubt won't help much in ensuring the success of the trip. Once he had made it to a fish camp, an old man even older than the men who gave him the false information told him he knew how to get to Yosemite, but the young man did the smart thing and told him he already knew how to get there. He didn't need to be out in the scorching desert heat for hours as it's simply unhealthy.
1185	7165	3	3	A cyclist is affected by numerous factors when riding, with most of them being features of the setting. One crucial feature of the setting that can have a substantial impact is the terrain. If the terrain is rough, then the cyclist could face a much more difficult time maintaining firm control of the bike, especially if he is not a professional rider. For example, the author of the essay on page @NUM1 titled: Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Speed Limit, had a tough time on the rougher roads partly because of his limited level of experience. Another important aspect of the environment that can affect a cyclist is the climate. Most people who are well - versed in cycling know how to dress appropriately to keep their body at a comfortable temperature, but sometimes the unpredictable weather plays tricks on us. The cyclist could unexpectedly get caught in a sudden heat wave or a rapid drop in temperature.
1186	7166	3	3	The features of the desolate setting significantly enhance the cyclist’s desperate spirit. Throughout the entire solitary journey, the cyclist is completely by himself, with no signs of people, cars, or buildings in sight. The utter isolation made him much more desperate because if he were to collapse from dehydration, there would be no one around to offer help, and he would simply perish alone. Also, he unexpectedly came upon things such as the “Welch’s Grape Juice factory and bottling plant,” which initially got his hopes up as he imagined finding water or assistance. However, it would soon crush his spirits when he realized it was abandoned. These events intensified his desperation as he had no support from anywhere and nothing to fall back on in this life - or - death situation, leaving him in a state of utter despair.
1187	7167	3	3	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the features of the setting affect the cyclist in numerous ways. First of all, as he was riding about @NUM1 miles up the long, winding road, he noticed that the terrain was gradually changing. The once - familiar landscape was morphing into something unknown, and that truly scared him. He says, “This sight was troubling. I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly” (Kurmaskie @NUM2). He is expressing that as the things around him began to transform, his fear grew steadily. And he kept gulping down water just to try and calm his nerves. Another example is after he had passed the sign that told him not to pass. He says, “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills” (Kurmaskie @NUM3). This is yet another instance of fear starting to overcome him when he saw even more alterations in the road. Despite the road changes and the fact that his water supply was almost depleted, he still had the inner courage to press on. The setting brought him a great deal of fear, but he managed to persevere and make it through.
1188	7168	3	3	In the story, the cyclist had completely run out of water. He had mentioned that the little water he had left at the end tasted like battery acid, a foul and unpleasant taste that only added to his misery. The surroundings had a profound impact on him. As he looked around, he saw nothing but vast stretches of empty land with no sign of human presence for miles. This isolation brought a deep sense of despair. He was in a desert where the scorching hot sun was relentlessly beating down on him. All around were the endless sand dunes and prickly cacti. Just envisioning this scene, one would immediately think of a lack of water and the absence of any shade. The desolate desert setting with its harsh conditions compounded his desperation, making his situation seem almost hopeless.
1189	7169	3	3	The features of the setting, in “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” have a profound impact on the cyclist. The setting affects him both physically and mentally. Physically, in the story, the arid setting provides no water source for the cyclist. As a result, his body becomes weak, his energy levels drop, and he struggles to pedal forward. Mentally, he is severely affected by the features of the setting. An example of this is when he comes across the abandoned Welch's factory. As he sees the picture of a boy “pour a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth,” it fills him with a sense of longing and disappointment. He hangs his head dejectedly as he continues to ride on. He is constantly thinking to himself that he might die out in this desolate place. These physical and mental effects clearly show how the features of the setting have a detrimental impact on the cyclist, leaving him in a vulnerable and desperate state.
1190	7170	3	3	I believe the first photograph closely relates to the story “As Worry” because the author’s son suffers a great deal in the narrative. The photograph vividly shows what he and his friends look like in @MONTH1, capturing their expressions and the essence of their situation. It also prominently features the surfboards, which strongly emphasize that they are surfers, aligning well with the story's context. That is my perception of the first picture. The second photograph only has a slight relation as it simply depicts a surfer surfing. It lacks the depth and connection to the main themes of the story like the first one does. So, in conclusion, the first photograph is more accurate and relevant to the story than the second photo, as it better captures the essence and details related to the events and characters in the story.
1191	7171	3	3	When the bicyclist was trying to find Yosemite, he unexpectedly stumbled into a million - dollar setting. In the beginning, as he was seeking directions, he found himself talking to a group of old men sitting on a rickety porch. After their chat, he set off into the vast expanse that seemed to be nothing but an endless desert. “One rameshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn't hold in the lamest mule greeted me.” It was just him, all alone in this desolate landscape. At some point, dry tumbleweeds lazily crossed his path, and a ridiculously large snake – it really did look like a diamondback – blocked the majority of the pavement right in front of him. Tumbleweeds usually mean desert, a clear sign of the harsh environment he was in. He also passed by the @CAPS1 grape juice factory, which stood abandoned and forlorn. Finally, he reached a bait store where he was relieved to find someone else who could give him directions.
1192	7172	3	3	In the story “Rough Road Ahead,” the cyclist is significantly affected by the setting in numerous ways. Since he was cycling through a desert in June, the sweltering heat was intense. The high temperatures made him constantly thirsty as his body lost a lot of moisture through sweating. Moreover, due to the extreme heat, he was at a high risk of dehydration or even heat strokes. The hot sun beat down on him relentlessly, sapping his energy. Lastly, because it was a desert, there were wild animals like snakes and lizards. These creatures could potentially hurt or poison him, and if that were to happen, he could die. This is how the harsh setting of the story had a profound impact on the cyclist.
1193	7173	3	3	The cyclist in “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by @PERSON1 endures some hardship while riding through the arid desert. The features of the desolate setting affected the cyclist severely as there was no water to drink. Being a desert, there was a lack of vegetation, and without vegetation, there is usually no accessible water source. As a result, he was gradually becoming dehydrated, his throat parched and his energy waning. The towns he passed through were also desolate, having no living organisms or people. So, he couldn't quench his thirst there either. In one town, there was a spigot, but when he tried to get water, it was gross and had clearly not been pumped in a long while. Then he came across the Welch's juice factory, which was completely abandoned. From there, he thought he was in a hopeless situation. But then he finally reached a shop that had bathrooms, and he was able to drink water from the sink, which brought him great relief. Additionally, the rocky roads took a toll on him. Since he barely had any water left, and rocky roads tend to require more strength and endurance to navigate, it made his journey even more difficult.
1194	7174	3	3	In the passage “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the desert's features had no positive impacts on the cyclist. The desert was filled with “rolling hills.” When a cyclist pedals over hills, according to the laws of gravity, it takes a great deal more energy. As the cyclist in the story went over these hills, he used up a large amount of his energy reserves. Eventually, he only had enough energy left to “feel sorry” for himself. The more hills he encountered, the more energy he lost, and the more exhausted he became. The desert was also extremely hot and dry. Obviously, considering he was cycling in the “deserts of California in June,” this intense heat made him incredibly thirsty. He did stop to look for water, but when he tried to get some, a “tarlike substance” came out instead, which was of no use to him. When he stopped again later for water, it was “cool” and most likely refreshing, giving him a brief respite. Riding his bike in the hilly, dry, and hot desert, the cyclist became both tired and thirsty, making his journey a real struggle.
1195	7175	3	3	The features of the settings have a notable effect on the cyclist through various obstacles present in the surroundings. An obstacle is an object that stands in the way between you and your destination. In the story “@CAPS1 Road Ahead @CAPS2 Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” there are several such obstacles. For instance, there are hills that the cyclist has to pedal up, which require a great deal of energy. Forks in the road can be confusing, making it difficult for the cyclist to choose the right path. Also, there are rough roads that can slow down the cyclist and make the ride uncomfortable. In the story, “a large highway sign jumped out at me it read: Rough road.” This sign was a clear warning of the difficult journey that lay ahead for the cyclist.
1196	7176	3	3	In the story, “Do not exceed posted speed limit”, the desolate setting significantly affects the way the cyclist rides. The setting is a vast expanse of nowhere, with no water in sight, and all that meets his eyes are long, empty roads stretching into the horizon. This desolate environment takes a toll on the cyclist as he is not only hungry and thirsty but also about to descend a really steep hill. Fear grips him as he contemplates the possibility of crashing and seriously injuring himself with no one around to offer help. Clearly, the setting of this isolated place has a profound impact on the cyclist in this story.
1197	7177	3	3	The features in the story clearly indicate that it was set in a very dry and sparsely - populated area. The text specifically mentions that there were rolling hills in the desert of California, and the air was parched. These elements strongly suggest a harsh environment. I believe those factors affected the cyclist by rapidly dehydrating him. Cycling up and down the hills can be extremely tiring, especially when he doesn't have an ample supply of water and has to ration what little he has left. The quote “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June,” reveals a great deal about the story. Venturing into a desert in California during the summer month of June is both a very brave and rather foolish thing to do, as it is twice as hot during this period, exacerbating the cyclist's struggle.
1198	7178	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by depriving him of reliable directions from the old - timers. In the text, it clearly states, “Never accept travel advice from a collection of old timers who haven’t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in the office.” This statement implies that the cyclist did not receive good directions. The road conditions might have changed over time, but the old timers are unaware of these changes because they have been sitting on their porches for so long. As a result, the cyclist is at a disadvantage, and this is precisely why I think the setting has a negative impact on the cyclist.
1199	7179	3	3	In the essay entitled “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” it tells the story of a gentleman who is riding a bike to “Yosemite” but has no clear idea of how to get there. So, he stops and asks some old folks for directions. He then remarks, “Never accept travel advice from a collection of old - timers who haven’t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office.” This means they are not well - informed about the current road conditions and changes. After leaving the old folks, he resumes his long and sweltering journey. As he progresses, he starts to run out of water, and panic begins to set in. Next, he comes across a sign that said “Rough,” which foreshadows more challenges on his arduous trip.
1200	7180	3	3	The features of the setting have a detrimental effect on the cyclist. The scorching heat forces the cyclist to constantly drink water, only to lose it rapidly through sweating. As a result, he is severely worn down by dehydration and fatigue. Moreover, the sense of insecurity in this desolate place weighs heavily on him. For instance, he spots a ridiculously large snake, which sends a shiver down his spine. And to make matters worse, the temperature just keeps rising steadily. All these factors combined make the cyclist's journey an extremely difficult and perilous one.
1201	7181	3	3	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the distinct features of the setting had a profound impact on the cyclist. The setting and its features affected him not only physically but mentally as well. The desolate expanse and harsh conditions caused him to doubt himself and the advice of the men he had encountered. Moreover, it sapped him of the energy needed to reach his destination. Where the cyclist was riding, in the arid regions of California, affected him physically. The scorching heat beat down on him relentlessly, and he had no water to quench his parched throat. This caused him to become extremely tired and increasingly frustrated. The setting affected him emotionally as well. He started off full of determination, but as he went on, and as the initially flat road slowly changed to a series of challenging hills, he began to get frustrated and angry that he had listened to the men. As he saw no buildings in sight for many miles, with only the empty, barren landscape stretching out around him, he began to lose his determination as well as hope. Lastly, when he finally saw the sign “Gary and @CAPS1 Fish Camp,” a glimmer of hope returned, and he started to regain his spirits and become less frustrated. The setting and features of the essay affected the cyclist not only physically but mentally as well. He started off determined, then as the setting changed he became doubtful and frustrated. In the end, he turned out satisfied as the setting seemed more hopeful, perhaps indicating that he was nearing the end of his trying journey.
1202	7182	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in numerous ways. The text first mentions that, “there was no one in sight, not a building, car, or a structure of any kind.” This desolate sight shows that the cyclist felt insecure, and the eerie emptiness began to upset him deeply. Another example from the text that describes the cyclist's state is, “One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn't hold in the lamest mule greeted me.” You can clearly see through the cyclist's account that he was frustrated that the water from the pumps was of such poor quality. This also could have sparked a deep - seated fear in the cyclist because he was running out of water. He was terrified that since the water tasted like, “battery acid,” with its acrid and undrinkable flavor, that he wouldn't last much longer in this harsh environment. In conclusion, the features of the setting, including the isolation and the useless water sources, affected the cyclist in many ways, making his journey a constant struggle.
1203	7183	3	3	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” many of the distinct features of the setting affect the cyclist on his arduous journey. The rusty water pump, highway sign, and abandoned juice factory all seemed to make his trip more difficult than it already was. First of all, when the author stumbles along a “ramshackle shed” surrounded by “several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn't hold in the lamest mule,” he is extremely anxious to check the pump for well - needed water. His parched throat and desperate state drive him to this hope. When he finds that he is out of luck and cannot drink the bitter - tasting water, with its unpleasant and unpalatable flavor, his hope droops a little. It is as if the blazing sun were taunting him, telling him that he can't make it through this harsh journey. Secondly, he passes a large road sign reading “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” Once again he begins to feel hopeless, but then he manages to turn his angst into determination to finish his journey. He says “sometimes life can be so cruel” as he notices the speed limit to be @NUM1, but he continues on, pedaling hard against the odds. Lastly, the author sees a lone building in the distance and almost doesn't believe his eyes. It turns out to be not only his last hope for water but an abandoned grape juice factory. He reflects on the irony of his position by saying that his situation “should please all sadists” reading about it. Therefore, the features of the setting affected the cyclist by highlighting the negativity of his situation, which in turn drives him to continue pedaling, showing his indomitable spirit.
1204	7184	3	3	In the essay “Do Not Exceed Speed Limit,” the features of the setting affected the cyclist in a few significant ways. One way it affected him was that the temperature was extremely hot, and the sweltering heat made it so that by it being hot outside, his water wouldn't stay cool. This is a major problem because you need nice, cool, refreshing water to stay hydrated during a long cycling journey. Another way was when he hit a fork in the road. He didn't know which way to go. All he saw was one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn't hold the lamest mule greeted him. The dilapidated and uninviting sight was deeply troubling. Last but not least, this water pump wasn't working very well, so he got down on his hands and knees and started pumping with great effort. Despite his efforts, the water would not cool down. He tried a drop or two and the water tasted like battery acid, with its acrid and undrinkable flavor. Those are some features of the setting, such as the heat, the confusing fork in the road, and the non - functioning water pump, that affected the cyclist on his challenging journey, making it a test of his endurance and resolve.
1205	7185	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in several notable ways. First, the rolling hills make it incredibly hard to pedal over the land. “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills,” clearly shows that the terrain was changing into a more difficult course, requiring the cyclist to exert much more energy. “One long crippling hill,” also shows how the steep and long hills had a significant effect on the cyclist, wearing him down with each pedal stroke. Another feature of the setting was the desert and the high temperatures. The searing heat in the desert caused the cyclist to become severely dehydrated. “Trying to keep balance in my dehydrated state” and “I could drop from heatstroke” vividly show how hot the cyclist was, struggling to stay upright and conscious. One final feature that had an effect on the cyclist was the old abandoned factory. The sight of the boy with a refreshing glass of juice in front of the factory makes the cyclist lose hope completely, and he doubts he will survive this harsh journey. “I hung my head” and “abandoned factory of juices and dreams” tell how the cyclist lost all hope at the sight of the building, feeling defeated by the cruel circumstances. All of these features of the setting, including the difficult terrain, extreme heat, and the demoralizing sight of the factory, have negative affects on the cyclist, making his journey a battle against the elements and his own dwindling spirit.
1206	7186	3	3	The setting of the area where the cyclist was biking significantly affects him, gradually making him weaker. Since the cyclist decides to take the long route, he finds himself in the harsh desert environment for a longer period of time. The intense, unrelenting heat in the desert can cause a person to suffer from major dehydration. We know this was the case for the cyclist because he says, “...but not before I gathered up a few pebbles and stuck them in my mouth. I’d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst...” This action clearly indicates that the cyclist put stones in his mouth to distract himself from the overwhelming feeling of thirst. I think this act precisely showcases how severely dehydrated the cyclist actually was. If he was willing to put filthy, dusty stones in his mouth just to get through his dehydration, it's evident that he was extremely thirsty. Another factor that contributed to how thirsty the cyclist got was the amount of physical exertion. This was also a feature of the setting since, during the end of his trip, he encountered rough terrain. The uneven ground and slopes forced him to exert more energy, which made him sweat even more profusely than before. This excessive sweating led to him becoming even more dehydrated. This story effectively demonstrates how the features of your environment can either make or break you, as the cyclist's experience in the challenging desert setting clearly shows the detrimental impact of the environment on his well - being.
1207	7187	3	3	There are several notable features of the setting which significantly affect the cyclist. One prominent factor is the fact that he is traveling on an extremely hot day in June. As he states, “and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June.” The sweltering heat was steadily getting to the cyclist, and he was understandably scared that he might succumb to heatstroke. The terrain was also not very ideal for a cyclist on a hot June day. “I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” The cyclist was already tired from the heat, and these hills made his situation worse. Moreover, “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.” The cyclist was running out of water at an alarming rate, and there was nowhere close by where he could replenish his supply. These unfavorable aspects of the setting affected the cyclist because it was extremely hot, he was running out of water rapidly, and there was rough terrain to contend with. In conclusion, the setting was clearly not in the cyclist's favor, posing numerous challenges to his journey.
1208	7188	3	3	According to the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the features of the setting affect the cyclist a great deal. One significant way the features of the setting affect the cyclist is that the mountains, with their steep slopes and uneven paths, make the cyclist more tired. Especially considering that he has no water, having to constantly go up and down the hills really wears the cyclist out. This strenuous physical activity causes him to lose a large amount of water through sweating, leading him into dehydration at a faster rate. The features of the setting affected him in that sense. Also, the snake that he encountered affected the cyclist. The sudden appearance of the snake caused the cyclist to be afraid, which added to the stress on his body. This stress, combined with the physical exertion, further contributed to the fact that the cyclist was dehydrating. Another way that the features of the setting affected the cyclist was the Welch's Grape Juice Factory. The sight and thought of the factory, with its association to refreshing drinks, caused the cyclist to be even more thirsty and made him think about his dehydration even more. In summary, in the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the features of the setting affect the cyclist in multiple, significant ways.
1209	7189	3	3	The features of the setting have a profound impact on the cyclist because, in the story, the character vividly portrays the weather as being horrible. For example, when he said “wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt,” this simple yet powerful description is one clear way the setting affects the cyclist. It almost makes the reader feel as if they are right there in the story, experiencing the same discomfort as the character. The description allows the reader to imagine the intense heat and the cyclist's struggle against it. The dried sweat rings are a visible sign of the cyclist's physical exertion and the harshness of the environment. This detailed portrayal of the setting effectively conveys the challenges the cyclist is facing. In conclusion, the well - described setting in the story successfully shows how it can have a negative impact on the cyclist's experience.
1210	7190	3	3	The features of the setting significantly affect the cyclist because it makes it extremely hard for him to reach “@CAPS1 National Park.” In an attempt to reach his destination more quickly, he took the advice from some old men to take a shortcut. On his ride along this supposed shortcut, he stopped at what he considered to be a “town,” but it was, in fact, a desolate ghost town. The emptiness and lack of resources in this place added to his sense of isolation and hardship. Then he came across a Welch’s Grape Juice Factory, but it had been abandoned years earlier. As he continued his journey, he was becoming increasingly weak and dehydrated due to the long ride under the scorching sun and the lack of water sources. He started to worry that he might drop from a heatstroke at any moment. At the end of his arduous ride, he finally reached a fish camp where he was relieved to find water to drink. A man at the fish camp asked him where he was going, and the cyclist told him his destination. Then the man asked him, “Know the best way to get there?” This man was much older than the other old men that gave the cyclist advice. So the cyclist firmly told the man, “yes, sir: I own a very good map.” Through this challenging journey, the cyclist realized that he would never accept advice from old - timers again, as the advice he received led him into a difficult and dangerous situation.
1211	7191	3	3	In the essay “Do Not Exceed posted Speed Limit”, the specific features of the setting significantly affected the cyclist's sense of direction. The cyclist initially had a clear idea of his destination and the route to get there. However, the old men sitting on their porches offered him what they claimed to be a “short - cut”. These “old - timers” had seemingly not left their porches since Carter was in office, and their directions were out - dated. As a result, the cyclist's own well - established sense of direction was ruined. This is precisely how the setting, with these elderly locals and their archaic advice, affected the cyclist in the essay.
1212	7192	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist a great deal. I say that because when there is a peaceful and calm setting, with gentle breezes and perhaps the soft rustling of leaves, it provides a positive and motivating environment for the cyclist. In such a serene setting, the cyclist can focus better on the ride and is more likely to feel energized. On the contrary, when there is a lot of commotion, like heavy traffic noise, honking horns, and a chaotic atmosphere around, it can be a distraction and demotivate the cyclist. Thus, the nature of the setting plays a crucial role in influencing the cyclist's experience.
1213	7193	3	3	Steep mountains that seem to touch the sky, rolling roads that wind and curve like snakes, and jagged rocks that stand menacingly on the sides of the path are all reasons why the setting has a significant impact on the cyclist. The cyclist needs to be constantly aware of what is happening around and what might happen next. For example, the warning “Rough Rough: Do not exceed posted speed limit” clearly indicates the challenging nature of the setting. This kind of setting leads to a lot of changes in the cyclist's riding style, speed, and overall approach. So, yes, the setting does reveal a lot about the challenges ahead and also describes how the cyclist might react to it. In conclusion, throughout the whole story, the settings do indeed affect the cyclist in multiple ways.
1214	7194	3	3	What I believe is that the features of the setting affect the cyclist in a notable way. In the story, the old guys remember things as they used to be in the past. But as it is said in the book, the world is a fluid place where things change all the time. For the cyclist to find his way forward, he had to carefully try and piece together the information the old guys gave him. He had to sift through their nostalgic and perhaps inaccurate recollections to make sense of the current landscape and find the right path. This shows how the setting, with these old men and their memories, influenced the cyclist's journey.
1215	7195	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in obvious ways. For instance, you wouldn't place the cyclist in a setting where it is pouring rain. In heavy rain, the roads would be slippery, visibility would be poor, and it would be extremely uncomfortable and dangerous for the cyclist to ride the bike. Another aspect is the appropriateness of the setting. You wouldn't have a setting in a city environment when the surrounding area is actually filled with only trees and rivers. The cyclist's experience is highly dependent on a setting that is suitable for cycling, and an inappropriate setting can either make the ride impossible or extremely difficult. Therefore, the features of the setting are crucial for the cyclist's journey.
1216	7196	3	3	The features of the setting that affect the cyclist are numerous. On his long - winding way, he had to deal with a multitude of challenging things. For example, he initially enjoyed relatively flat roads, but soon those were unexpectedly replaced by short, rolling hills. These hills demanded more physical effort as he had to pedal harder to ascend and control his speed while descending. Then, there was a clearly posted sign. It stated that he could not ride at his normal pace of @NUM1; instead, he had to slow down to @NUM2. This restriction really made him disappointed as it disrupted his rhythm. As if that wasn't enough, a large snake slithered onto the pavement and blocked the majority of it right in front of him. He had to come to a sudden stop to avoid it. The long - distance cycling under such conditions made him severely dehydrated. He started to feel sad and hopeless, but somehow, deep within, he still had a spark of energy that kept him somewhat aware of himself. Despite all these hardships, he persevered, slowly pedaling forward in the hope of reaching a better stretch of the road.
1217	7197	3	3	There are several features of the setting that greatly affect the cyclist. One prominent feature is the vast desert he is biking through. In June, the desert heat is extremely intense. The scorching sun beats down relentlessly, and the dry air can easily dehydrate someone. When a person is exposed to this heat for a long time, especially while exercising strenuously on a bike and running out of water, the dehydrating effect is even greater. The cyclist's body starts to feel the strain as he loses vital fluids. In addition, the change in terrain and road surface would have a significant effect on the cyclist. Traveling on a flat road requires much less physical effort compared to climbing hills. If the road is also rough, with potholes and uneven patches, the biker has to work even harder to push the bike up the hill. There is also the added mental effort of carefully balancing and not tipping the bike on the uneven surface. Finally, as the cyclist looks around, there are not any buildings in sight. When someone is dehydrated but has no water, they become desperate to find a source. However, if there is nothing familiar or promising nearby, they will start to lose hope. Once they lose hope, they won't try as hard to keep going, and they will gradually lose some of their physical strength. Considering all of the things negatively affecting the cyclist, it is truly amazing that he managed to push through his exhaustion and reach a source of water, showing great determination and resilience.
1218	7198	3	3	The setting in the short story “Rough road ahead: do not exceed posted speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie is truly troubling to the cyclist. The description “One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn't hold in the tamest mule greeted me” painted a desolate picture. This made the cyclist deeply troubled as it clearly indicated that he was in the middle of nowhere, far from any signs of a proper settlement. The isolation was overwhelming. The quote, “Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing, flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills,” further shows his distress. Going over these hills was no easy task. He had to put in extra physical effort to pedal up the inclines and control his speed while going down. As you can see, the setting, with its desolation and difficult terrain, was very influential to the cyclist, constantly challenging his physical and mental endurance.
1219	7199	3	3	In the essays, the features of the setting affect the cyclist by giving him a glimmer of hope. The cyclist, while feeling lost in an unfamiliar area, takes directions from a few old men sitting on a porch. These old men seem wise and experienced, but at first, the directions they give seem incorrect. As he follows them, the landscape around him doesn't seem to lead to any signs of civilization. The remains of a Grape Juice factory stand as a forlorn sight. The broken machinery and dilapidated buildings make it seem like he will never find civilization, as if he is trapped in a desolate area. However, despite these discouraging signs, the fact that he has these directions gives him a reason to keep going, holding onto the hope that there is a better place ahead.
1220	7200	3	3	The features of the setting around the cyclist affected him to the point of exhaustion and dehydration. The cyclist, who was already starting to feel tired and thirsty, began to really wear down as the setting underwent a significant change. It transitioned from being a simple flat stretch to a landscape full of many ups and downs. The cyclist explained the change quite vividly by saying, “flat road was replaced by short rolling hills” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). These hills in the Californian desert were like a never - ending roller coaster. As he pedaled up each hill, he had to use a great deal of energy, and the heat of the desert made it even more challenging. His water supply was steadily thinning out. The combination of the heat and the constant effort on the hills was tiring him beyond reason. All this cyclist could hope for at this desperate moment was the blessing of a water refill to quench his parched throat and the shade of a puffy cloud to provide some relief from the scorching sun. Eventually, he continued on his journey, hanging on to the hope of finding respite from the grueling conditions.
1221	7201	3	3	The setting affected the cyclist severely. Biking in the sweltering desert while following outdated directions nearly cost him his life. The intense heat and the vast, empty expanse wore him down. Along the way, he also came across several dilapidated factories and deserted towns, which filled him with more dismay. However, he eventually came across a last stop, a small oasis, that saved his life and gave him the strength to continue.
1222	7202	3	3	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the cyclist is significantly affected by his surroundings. At first, the man starts out at a quiet reservoir campground. His confidence is high, and he is eager and ready to continue his adventure. As the day went on and all he could find were abandoned buildings, he began to worry a bit. With his water running low, he came upon “one ramshackled shed, several rusty pumps” with no sign of life. He realized that his trip was going to be rough. The harsh environment and the risk of death gave him the determination he needed to push forward. Although he was fearful of death from dehydration, he knew that “travelling through the high deserts of California in June,” his only chance of survival was to keep going. The man's surroundings were what had pushed him to keep biking until he found the fish camp. If he had not been so aware of his surroundings, he might have given up, but not making it out of the desert to “the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite” would have been too devastating.
1223	7203	3	3	The setting affects the rider in multiple ways. It is extremely hot, which makes him constantly thirsty as the heat saps his body of moisture. The long, seemingly endless road affects his mental state, causing him to feel fatigued and demotivated. Lastly, the fact that there is no immediate sign of relief in sight affects his morale. All these factors combined make the ride an arduous challenge, but he perseveres, knowing that he must keep going to reach his destination.
1224	7204	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because they significantly change the cyclist's mood towards the ride. For example, in the essay “Rough Road Ahead; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” it states, ""There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. I began breaking the ride down into distances I could see on the horizon."" The cyclist had to do this because they were having great trouble riding since they were extremely thirsty and the ride was incredibly boring. This makes the ride seem much larger, so it also makes it harder to ride. Also in the essay, it states, ""One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps."" This affected the cyclist because after seeing this and later realizing he couldn't drink the water, he became even more thirsty as he was running out of water. When the cyclist notices the Welch's grape juice factory, he becomes determined to get there. In conclusion, in the essay “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist's mood towards the ride is strongly affected by the setting's features, which can either discourage or motivate the cyclist during the journey."
1225	7205	3	3	The setting affected the cyclist in many ways. When he was going up the steep hill, it was extremely hard for him to pedal as the incline required a great deal of effort. The hot summer day, with the scorching sun beating down, was gradually breaking him down. He was getting dehydrated because he only had a little bit of water left. It was evident that he was trying to keep his balance in his dehydrated state, his movements becoming more unsteady. He felt like giving up, but deep down, he knew he had to find the strength to carry on and overcome the challenges the setting presented.
1226	7206	3	3	Features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. One prominent factor was the heat. For example, in paragraph @NUM1 it says, “I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June.” Considering that California is well - known as “the sunshine state,” I can clearly infer that it was extremely hot. The sweltering heat must have sapped the cyclist's energy. Another feature that affected the cyclist was when he thought he could get some water but it was hot and tasted like battery acid. This is mentioned in paragraph @NUM2. These features of the setting had a significant impact on the cyclist, making his journey arduous and challenging.
1227	7207	3	3	The setting features affected the cyclist because it presented a conflict. It was a conflict primarily because it was hot and he was lost. It was a major issue that he was hot because he had a very limited amount of water. He couldn't obtain any more water because he was lost in the unfamiliar area. The heat naturally causes people to get thirsty, but he was restricted due to his limited water supply. Another conflict was that he was lost. This was a problem because he had a specific destination in mind and needed to be somewhere. Overall, these conflicts arising from the setting made the cyclist's situation quite difficult.
1228	7208	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he rode through the blistering, heat - scorching desert of California. He pedaled his bike over @NUM1 miles to reach the beautiful Yosemite. During this long journey, he almost ran out of water, which was a life - threatening situation in the desert. What kept him going was the thought of the cool pines and the rushing rivers of Yosemite. These natural wonders of Yosemite served as a beacon of hope, motivating him to endure the harsh desert conditions.
1229	7209	3	3	There are many ways the cyclist is affected throughout the essay by the setting. As he first enters the “short cut” that the old men give him, he is full of confidence, believing it will lead him to his destination quickly. When he arrives at the first town and sees that it is like a ghost town, with empty streets and abandoned buildings, he does not fret but continues on his journey with confidence. As he got to the second stop, his lack of water began to take a toll on him. “I got down on my hands and knees working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength.” This shows he will work hard and is desperately in need of water. As the cyclist passed another place with no hope of water, he placed stones in his mouth because he once heard it helped get your mind off thirst. When he had just about lost hope from travelling through the hot @CAPS1 desert with no water, he found a new drive in him when he saw a store with water. Though this was a hot and harsh setting, it created inspiration for him to keep going, push through the hard times, and ultimately survive.
1230	7210	3	3	The cyclist in Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed the Posted Speed Limit was greatly affected by the setting. There were no buildings or people in the town anywhere. This desolate emptiness meant that there was no one around to offer help, and he could die without anyone knowing. Also, the setting seems to be very dry and have desert - like conditions. In such an environment, without water, the cyclist would quickly become dehydrated and could suffer from a heat stroke. Moreover, the setting seems to be intensively hot. The heat not only makes the cyclist physically dehydrated but also makes him mentally consider the real possibility of a heat stroke at the time. All in all, the harsh setting put the cyclist's life at risk.
1231	7211	3	3	The features of the setting had greatly impacted the cyclist. The intense heat, wild animals, and challenging terrain had slowed him down throughout his entire journey. The sweltering heat had slowed him down because he didn't have enough water to keep his body moving normally; he felt weak and fatigued. And he said the animals had slowed him down because he had to sneak around them so they wouldn't bite him. The steep hills had affected the cyclist because it takes a lot of energy to go up them, and when he was climbing, he said he could hardly see anything in sight. In the end, these elements of the setting combined to make his journey a much more difficult and time - consuming one.
1232	7212	3	3	The arid, bare, and rough terrain of the vast desert affected the cyclist during his long - awaited journey to Yosemite in the story “Rough road ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit”. The cyclist’s expedition was severely hindered due to many unforeseen obstacles. The extreme dryness was a huge problem during his entire journey. “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). This excerpt clearly explains the hot, arid climate of the area where he was cycling. This harsh climate significantly decreased the rate of travel the cyclist intended to maintain. Since the cyclist was riding in the desolate desert, there weren't many towns present. When the cyclist did approach a town, it was completely abandoned. “One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn't hold in the lamest mule greeted me” (@NUM2). After riding through the scorching desert for hours, the cyclist would have desperately wanted a nice rest stop, but all of them were ghost towns. “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills” (@NUM1). Cycling for hours in a hot desert with limited water wasn't enough of a challenge; the flat land was suddenly replaced with hills. The cyclist was already exhausted from all the other obstacles that the desert confronted him with; the rough terrain affected his journey since his rate was further reduced. In conclusion, many factors negatively affected the cyclist's expedition to Yosemite. The dry, bland, and hilly terrain of the desert severely hindered his journey, making it a struggle from start to finish.
1233	7213	3	3	I believe the setting of an area can greatly affect the mind when put in certain situations. In the reading, the man is cycling in a desolate place. He sees no one around him, he is almost out of water, and as far as his eyes can see, he can't spot a house or a person. This desolate scenario is extremely scary and gives the feeling of utter helplessness. But if he would be in @LOCATION1, a bustling area, and go past cars zooming by, people strolling on the street, and parked cars, he would be much calmer. He could easily get water at any building along his ride. Moreover, the temperature would be cold there, so he would drink less water and could go further. This change in setting would have definitely changed his mood, making him more at ease and less anxious.
1234	7214	3	3	Well in the story Do Not Exceed Posted Speed limits by @PERSON1, the setting affects you in a profound way. If you can't see anything for miles and you are running out of water, it has a strong psychological effect on you. You can start to panic, just like he did when he stopped at the old house and all that came out of the pump was battery acid. Also, you don't exactly know where you are precisely, so that also affects you because you don't know whether to go forward, turn back, or what to do. If I was this person, the desolate features around me, like the empty expanse of land and the lack of resources, would have a great deal of effect on me. In such a situation, the uncertainty and the threat of dehydration would make the journey extremely stressful and nerve - wracking.
1235	7215	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. In the beginning of the essay, she was elated that she was getting a shortcut. ""I followed their device and launched out at first light along a “shortcut” that was to slice away hours from my ride to Yosemite National Park.” She thought she knew exactly where she was going. “I chuckled, checked my water supply, and moved on."" When she entered the first town, the dilapidated sight was troubling. ""I got down on my hands and knees, working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength,” she was beginning to get worried as she was running out of water. The next town was “only eighteen miles down the road.” She was now in a dehydrated state. “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.” Then she saw a building, but unfortunately, it was no longer open. So she got back on her bike, but her thoughts had completely changed; she was now upset and expecting the worst, even to die. Then she saw a store, “Gary and Wilbers fish camp”. She went in, drank the cool water with relief, and then decided to use her own map, rather than relying on the advice of the old guys. In the end, the setting's features had a roller - coaster effect on her journey and state of mind."
1236	7216	3	3	There were numerous features of the setting that had a notable impact on the cyclist. One prominent feature was the severe lack of water. This scarcity had led the cyclist to become dehydrated, causing their mind to be clouded and unable to think clearly. Moreover, it had sapped the cyclist's energy, making every pedal stroke a struggle. An example is, “I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.” Another significant feature is the intense heat. The sweltering heat had made the cyclist constantly thirsty and drenched in sweat. An example is “I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn’t a mirage…” Another instance is, “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” The features of the setting had affected the cyclist in many ways, making the journey an arduous one.
1237	7217	3	3	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”, there were many features of the setting that affected the cyclist. The first feature that affected the cyclist was the harsh desert terrain. It was extremely hot, and there were no trees to provide even a sliver of shade. This affected the cyclist because he got very hot and constantly thirsty. As a result, he drank more water than his normal consumption. Secondly, since he was drinking more than usual, he was running out of water quickly. So, he had to conserve his remaining water, which gradually made him become dehydrated. To make matters worse, all the towns they passed through were ghost towns with no running fresh water. This extremely disappointed him and further exacerbated his dehydration. Just when the cyclist was on the verge of losing hope, he found a small bait shop. He got into the shade and finally got water to drink. So after all those disappointments, he found hope in the small bait shop, which gave him the strength and mental boost to continue on with his journey to Yosemite National Park, showing that even in the harshest settings, there can be a glimmer of hope.
1238	7218	3	3	The features of the setting made the cyclist’s journey even longer and more strenuous. The fact that it was in such a remote area did not help at all. For example, the people who still lived in that remote area were probably as old as the cyclist's grandparents, and the directions they gave were horribly inaccurate. Also, there were no new shops or areas for the cyclist to rest. The water pump he found was old and dirty, and the only building he saw was abandoned. Another factor was the rough terrain. Since the cyclist was already very fatigued due to lack of water and tiredness, the long, bumpy, and overall horrible terrain made things even worse. Finally, the last factor was that he was bicycling in California on a sweltering summer day, and the fact that his bike had no proper cooling mechanism (but which bike does) did not help at all. These are how the features significantly affected the cyclist's journey, making it a true test of endurance.
1239	7219	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the rougher the terrain got, the more the cyclist had to strain to make progress. For example, when the terrain transformed into steep hills, the cyclist had to struggle vigorously to climb the hills, which caused him to expend a large amount of his energy reserves. Also, if the terrain was flat and smooth, the cyclist encountered fewer problems during the long journey. For instance, if the cyclist faced less strain, he would not be as tired and would not need to drink as much water. In conclusion, the nature of the terrain and other features of the setting directly influence the cyclist's physical state and energy consumption, ultimately affecting the overall experience of the journey.
1240	7220	3	3	He wouldn't know what challenges he would be facing while riding on the road. There could be something bad that might happen to his bike, like one of his bike’s wheels getting damaged or malfunctioning. Or he might accidentally fall off his bike. He could become so tired that he physically couldn't go any further and might even consider giving up on his journey. However, despite these potential difficulties, the cyclist's determination might still push him to persevere through the uncertainties of the road.
1241	7221	3	3	The setting affects the cyclist by the need and comfort of riding down with no infrastructure around or people. This situation allows the cyclist to be in the best mood, with the air being nice and cool, no cars in sight, and just him and the beautiful sky to ride with. In contrast, if there is infrastructure, he must watch for people, cars, and pay attention to street signs and act accordingly. So, that's how the features of the setting would affect the cyclist, influencing his overall experience and the way he rides.
1242	7222	3	3	"In the adventures of the cyclist, the setting is not only what develops the character but also what affects how he pushes himself to not give up, even when he feels helpless. This is one example of how the cyclist is affected. As he says, ""I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly and I was traveling through the high desert of California in June."" With that information, you can observe how this harsh setting creates problems for him physically because his body needs water. He is extremely limited in his water supply and doesn't savor it very well. These issues create the problem of dehydration, and when mentally you think you're going to die without water, you start to panic and lose control over yourself. Thus, the setting significantly impacts the cyclist's physical and mental state."
1243	7223	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist. There were rough terrains that made the cycling difficult, and perhaps a lack of proper facilities like water sources. These elements of the setting put extra strain on the cyclist, influencing his performance and overall experience. In the end, it's clear that the features of the setting had a notable impact on the cyclist's journey.
1244	7224	3	3	In ''Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted speed Limit'' by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting most of the time disappoint him. You can tell that the features of the setting disappointed him because every time he got to a town, he couldn't get water. In the text, it states, ''I got down on my hands & knees working the handle of the rusty water pump as a foul - like substance oozed out followed by @NUM1 degree brackish water that tasted like battery acid.'' You know the setting disappoints him when he sees the terrain he has to cross as well. You can tell from what he says, ''At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path along with a ridiculously large snake.'' The narrator was disappointed that he listened to the directions of the elder rather than use his map. Joe Kurmaskie does a great job of showing how the narrator faced these disappointing settings and how he felt about them, making the reader understand the negative impact of the setting on the narrator's experience.
1245	7225	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the route that the cyclist was taking had a rough road for him to travel. The cyclist took bad advice from some old men who hadn't left off their porches for decades. Also, as he got into his long journey, he began to notice that the advice the old men had given him was bad. The cyclist was headed to Yosemite and he had gotten some advice that turned out to be unhelpful. This bad advice, combined with the rough road, made his journey more challenging. In conclusion, the features of the setting, along with the poor advice, had a negative impact on the cyclist's trip.
1246	7226	3	3	When the cyclist first set off, he was doing fine as he had packed plenty of water in his backpack. As he kept going and sort of got off - course, he gradually began to come into the vast desert region. The scorching sun was beating down on him, and he was sweating profusely. He was hot, and he was quickly running out of water. This was making him severely dehydrated, his lips chapped and his throat parched. Also, seeing the tumbleweeds rolling across the desolate landscape and the lack of any green vegetation probably made him even worse mentally, because he was maybe thinking he was never going to get free from that endless expanse of sand. When he saw the fish bait shop though, he was probably relieved that he was going to be saved, and he could finally replenish his water supply and continue his journey.
1247	7227	3	3	There are many ways that a cyclist will be affected and one of these are the setting. The setting affects them because if it is a short, smooth setting like a well - paved bike path in a park, the ride will be easy. The cyclist can maintain a steady speed and enjoy the scenery without much effort. But if it is long, bumpy, and rough roads such as unpaved mountain trails, it will be harder to control the bike. The constant jolts and uneven surfaces require the cyclist to use more energy to keep the bike stable. This means that the cyclist’s job will be hardened. This is how a cyclist is affected by his or her settings, and it clearly shows the significant impact of the riding environment on the cyclist's experience.
1248	7228	3	3	The cyclist ran into rough settings on the way to @ORGANIZATION1 park. The first is the town he came to was a ghost town. The empty streets were lined with dilapidated buildings, and there was an eerie silence all around. Then he was running out of water when he ran by tambleweeds, and a large snake slithered in front of him, causing him to jolt in surprise. He had no more water and there were rough, rocky roads ahead of him. As he continued, he came across a juice factory. No one was there, the factory seemed abandoned with broken windows and rusty machinery. He was out of water and he did not know how much longer it would be until he came to another town. That is why I say that how the features of the setting affected the cyclist, as these difficult conditions made his journey extremely challenging.
1249	7229	3	3	The features of the setting have a very negative effect on the cyclist. According to the old men, the cyclist would pass by a few towns if he took the route they told him. But every town the cyclist came to was deserted. “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” The desolate streets were filled with dust, and the empty houses seemed to echo with a sense of abandonment. Because the towns were deserted, the cyclist's water supply was dwindling rapidly because there was no place where he could get more water. He became dehydrated and kept pushing himself, his legs feeling heavy with exhaustion, to find a place where there was fresh water. “Trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.” Once he found some pebble and thought about sucking on them because it helps to slow down dehydration. But he didn’t because he thought he would choke on them. The setting around him also made him have negative thoughts. “It didn’t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.” Because the setting was a hot, deserted, desert it had a very negative effect on the cyclist. If he hadn’t been running out of water I don’t think that the effect of the setting would have been as bad. But because he did run out of water it made the effects much worse, highlighting the crucial role of water in such a harsh environment.
1250	7230	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. One reason I say this is because he ran out of water in the middle of a dry, arid area. With no water source in sight, he could dehydrate, which would lead to fatigue, dizziness, and a significant decrease in his physical performance. Also, looking for water slowed him down more as he had to constantly scan the surroundings and deviate from his original path. Another reason I say this is because the man gave him the wrong directions. The incorrect instructions led him into unfamiliar and difficult terrain, which got him lost and confused. He wasted time trying to figure out where he was and how to get back on track. That is how the setting affected the cyclist, as both the lack of water and the wrong directions caused by the setting made his cycling journey a struggle.
1251	7231	3	3	"It is said that, ""experience is a good substitute for natural instinct."" This means that if someone knows how to deal with the environment they're in, they can survive even if they weren't born with the animal instincts that come with that particular territory. However, even the most experienced person can be overcome by the extreme weather conditions they live in. In the essay, ""Rough Road Ahead,"" by Joe Kurmaskie, the experienced cyclist decides to take a long, arduous, and dangerous trip. His ride will take him along the long desert paths of California with a limited water supply. This limited water supply is the major element that hinders him in the story. Because he listened to some old men, he went without water for most of his trip. Between his constant exercise, the extreme heat, and the lack of water, dehydration hit him fast. A common side effect of dehydration is hallucination, which the cyclist knew. It says in the essay, “I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn't a mirage.” This represents his knowledge and experience in the matter, and shows that he was adapting to his environment through experience. A similar story to this is Jack London's, “To Build a Fire” where the man is also pitted against the extremes of nature through the frigid cold, but the elements still overtook him. Both stories represent man's quest for adventure, and also the constant struggle for survival that people face. In the end, these tales remind us of the power of nature and the importance of being prepared."
1252	7232	3	3	The features of a setting can significantly affect a cyclist's energy. When the setting turns into a landscape filled with steep hills, it can exhaust this cyclist completely. The continuous effort required to pedal uphill against gravity drains the cyclist's energy reserves. With each ascent, the cyclist has to push harder, expending more energy than on a flat surface. As a result, the cyclist becomes fatigued, and their performance is negatively impacted. In conclusion, the hilly setting has a detrimental effect on the cyclist's energy and ability to ride effectively.
1253	7233	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist most in the fact that it strains him out of the hydrated state. The harsh conditions of the environment, such as high temperatures and long distances, cause the cyclist to sweat profusely. This excessive sweating leads to a rapid loss of fluids from his body, pushing him out of the hydrated state. As a result, it makes him unable to operate at his full power and efficiency. His muscles become fatigued more quickly, and his cognitive functions may also be impaired. It deprives him of the little energy he had in him to begin with. That is how the setting affected him, ultimately limiting his performance and making the journey much more challenging.
1254	7234	3	3	The setting affects the cyclist very strongly. The desert environment with its intense heat and the absence of water cause him to get dehydrated rapidly. Dehydration not only makes him feel weak but also impairs his physical and mental abilities. The rolling hills and rough terrain further tire him out. The constant effort of pedaling uphill and navigating the uneven ground requires a great deal of energy. In the story it says “and growing realization that I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June.” This shows that the combination of the heat and the challenging terrain could cause him to overheat and suffer a heat stroke. In summary, the setting poses a significant threat to the cyclist's well - being and ability to complete his journey.
1255	7235	3	3	The temperature of the place that the cyclist was riding through affected him very much. The high temperature caused the cyclist to sweat profusely. This sweating was a natural response of his body to cool down, but it had a significant impact on him. As he lost fluids through sweating, he would get thirsty, and his body's need for water increased. Eventually, he ran out of water. For example, in the text he says “the water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips” and then it goes on to say, “I could drop from a heat stroke.” This showed how it affected him because he was acutely aware that the lack of water due to the high temperature put him at risk of dropping from the heat. In conclusion, the high temperature had a severe and direct impact on the cyclist's physical condition and his ability to continue the ride.
1256	7236	3	3	The features of the settling that affected the cyclist were the harsh and sweltering hot climate, along with the challenging terrain. The author clearly wrote about how “the sun was beating down relentlessly on him” and how he almost died from severe dehydration, highlighting the extreme conditions the cyclist endured.
1257	7237	3	3	The features of the setting do indeed affect the cyclist. If the road is rough, you have to have the right type of bike that can handle the uneven surface. Then, if you get a flat tire, you have to know to look out for dangerous and poisonous things like snakes or thorny plants. If you were in a real bad accident, you’d have to be prepared just in case they don’t find you in time, perhaps by carrying a basic first - aid kit. You would also have to know what the nights were like. For example, if it got really cold at night, you need to have proper layers to keep yourself warm so as to avoid hypothermia.
1258	7238	3	3	The desert and the hills had a huge and challenging effect on the cyclist. The desert in June must have been extremely hot, with the scorching sun baking the ground. Going up those hills had to be incredibly hard, as the cyclist had to pedal against gravity on the rough inclines. The road was also very rough, full of potholes and uneven patches. It says, “Rough Road Ahead; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” It also says, “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” The cyclist was very thirsty because of the blistering hot weather, constantly craving for a sip of cool water. I think the setting had a huge and detrimental effect on the cyclist, making his journey a real struggle.
1259	7239	3	3	The cyclist’s condition was greatly influenced by his setting because he was lost in the high deserts of California in June. The intense heat crippled him as he traveled in search of Yosemite. He became lost and ran out of water, making his already difficult situation even worse. Being lost in seemingly the middle of nowhere in the searing hot heat, he became exhausted, dehydrated, and feared heat stroke and loss of consciousness. This is shown in the essay by, “the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke” And, “It looked like I was going to lose consciousness for the last time,” clearly depicting the dire circumstances he faced.
1260	7240	3	3	How the features of the setting affected the cyclist in the story, “Do Not Exceed Posted Limit,” were very dangerous to his life. The cyclist was traveling to the Yosemite National Park on a hot day in June. The cyclist traveled miles after miles on his bike only to pass by deserted towns. As described, “This place might have been a thriving little spot...a ghost town,” creating an eerie and desolate atmosphere. The terrain was threatening because after twenty - two miles or so, the cyclist had to overcome “short rolling hills,” which would use more energy and make his thirst for water even stronger. The cyclist was out of water and the blistering hot day was not helping at all. After a grueling journey, the cyclist used all the strength he had left to go to a local bait shop and drank from the sink after the treacherous environment he was exposed to. The features of the setting in the story, “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” were life - threatening and almost killed the cyclist, due to lack of water and the difficult terrain he overcame, emphasizing the perils of the journey.
1261	7241	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by teasing him. First, the gently rippling streams with their clear, inviting water taunted his intense thirst. Then, an old, rusty faucet stood there, seemingly mocking his dry throat. And last, the dilapidated welches grape factory, with its faint aroma of grape juice, had him almost abandon hope. The streams were the beginning stage, simply provoking his thirst. Then came the faucet, which made him acutely realize that he was severely dehydrated. The setting was clearly affecting his mood, leaving him frustrated and desperate.
1262	7242	3	3	In the story, the features of the setting significantly affect the cyclist. The text states, “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. I could drop from a heatstroke.” This clearly shows that in the area where the cyclist was riding, water was extremely scarce and hard to find. He is expressing his fear of dying if he doesn't get water soon. Another aspect is that the surroundings are desolate, with no buildings in sight and deserted roads. There are many hills and long stretches of empty roads. The story mentions, “the terrain changing, flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.” This indicates that he was mostly all by himself, with no one around to turn to for help. The harsh setting put the cyclist in a very vulnerable situation.
1263	7243	3	3	In this story, the features of the setting heavily affect the cyclist. Certain features portray that this “journey” to Yosemite National Park was both dreadful and enjoyable. “I would come to along this breeze jaunt.” The word “breezy” suggests that the cyclist can relish the bike - riding experience as there is a gentle breeze. Another feature of the setting is extremely old and dirty. The water the cyclist drinks is of such poor quality that it dries his mouth out even more. “A tar - like substance oozed out followed by a brackish water feeling.” This vividly shows the dirty nature of the water. Also, this setting demonstrates that the cyclist had to utilize all his strength and resources just to survive. It says “working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength.” Overall, the features of the setting portray the sacrifice and bravery of the cyclist as he endures the difficult journey.
1264	7244	3	3	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the setting greatly affects the cyclist. The arid setting around the cyclist made her drink a lot of water due to the dry conditions. “I was traveling the high deserts of California in June.” This indicates that she was most likely hot, sweating profusely, and there was no nearby source of water. The rough terrain also forced her to rely on her own strength to ascend and descend hills and to navigate around plants and animals. The settings in the story led the cyclist to become dehydrated and weak. She was forced to continue with a low supply of water and avoid numerous hazards, with no sign of living people nearby. “This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time, say, before the last world war.” This suggests a ghost town where no people currently reside. There was no one around to assist her. The setting led to a deterioration of her health. Her physical health was at risk because of dehydration and lack of energy. Her mind was also starting to falter. She had to shake her head to ensure what she was seeing was real in one part of the story. In conclusion, the harsh setting took a severe toll on the cyclist's well - being.
1265	7245	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. The man didn't have an adequate supply of water and he was venturing into the hot California deserts in June, where the scorching sun made the conditions extremely harsh. Another reason is that the initially flat road was transformed into rolling hills, and up ahead there was a prominent sign that said “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” The speed limit was @NUM1, which added an extra challenge to his journey. One more thing to note is that he should not blindly listen to an old gentleman who hadn't left his porch in decades as his advice might not be reliable in the current situation. These are some of the key factors in the setting that can have a significant impact on the cyclist's journey.
1266	7246	3	3	"The features of the setting significantly affect the cyclist since it is directly impacting her physical condition. In this sweltering environment, she desperately needs water to survive, yet the next town is an extremely long distance away. So, if she doesn't take a break, combined with the scorching hot temperatures, she could very possibly pass out. “When I tried a draught, it had the flavor of battery acid” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). Clearly, if she doesn't find water soon, it will severely affect her condition. Also, the features of the setting influence her determination. When she realizes that she urgently needs to find a town, she digs deeper and works harder. ""I would conserve my water, go inward for an hour or so at least, or rely on my inner spirit"" (@NUM1). She will try her utmost to make smart decisions and reach a town as quickly as possible. She works with extra effort since she knows that without water, her life is at great risk. Now, things could get even more difficult, but she remains determined to overcome these challenges."
1267	7247	3	3	During the cyclist's journey in “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaskie, he experiences notable setting changes. Initially, the road is flat, which is a relatively easy - going terrain for cycling. As he is riding, he comments that the road is flat. “Flat road was replaced” indicates that the road he was on was initially smooth and nice. However, as he continues his ride, he notices a distinct change in the land. “Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.” This change in the terrain means that the cyclist will face more difficulties, as climbing hills requires more energy and effort. In conclusion, these land changes have a direct impact on the cyclist's journey, making it more challenging than before.
1268	7248	3	3	The features of the setting significantly affect the cyclist. The sweltering heat in the setting takes a toll on him. In an attempt to find a quicker way, he takes a couple of tips on some supposed short - cuts from some old men sitting on their porch. Unfortunately, these tips turn out to be false, and the so - called short - cuts are not short at all. Now, he is riding, filled with anger for having followed their advice. Moreover, he is running out of water and becoming severely dehydrated. As he rides on, he spots an abandoned place with a water source. But to get the water, he has to pump it. He starts pumping and is horrified to see black gunk coming out. He pumps for about @NUM1 minutes in hopes of cooling the water, but it remains hot. To his dismay, the water tastes like battery acid. He resumes his ride but then encounters a snake. Fortunately, he manages to get away. At this point, he feels that he is on the verge of death and deeply regrets listening to the old men who haven't left their porch since @PERSON1 was president. What angers him even more is that they seemed so confident in their advice. As he's riding, he spots a place that he thought was a juice factory and heads there. To his surprise, it's now a fishing store, but he is relieved to drink lots and lots of water. He firmly states that he will never listen to old men again and will always rely on the map to avoid such misfortunes in the future.
1269	7249	3	3	As the author of the story embarks on her bike trip, the landscape around her gradually becomes less and less inviting. The first obstacle the cyclist encounters is a rusty pump and an old shed. When she attempts to get water from the pump, she describes the water as extremely hot, and it shows no sign of cooling down at all. As she continues her journey, tumbleweeds that resemble “diamond head snakes” cross her path, adding to the sense of unease. She rides for a long time without seeing any buildings. When she finally does come across a building, it is abandoned, which strongly suggests that people left the area because of the harsh landscape. During her journey, she meets another elderly man, but due to the bad experience she had following the advice of the last set of elderly men, she decides not to take his advice. In the end, she realizes that she needs to rely on her own judgment to navigate through this unforgiving landscape.
1270	7250	3	3	The features of the surrounding setting have a profound impact on the cyclist's performance. For example, in the essay “Rough Road Ahead. Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the landscape is full of hills that twist, rise, and descend. All these topographical features work against the cyclist's energy reserves, making the ride much more strenuous. Additionally, the scarcity of people in the towns poses a significant problem for the cyclist. It becomes extremely difficult and depriving for the cyclist to find a water supply, which is crucial to prevent dehydration. Thirdly, the weather in the essay plays a major role in affecting the cyclist. The desert of California is extremely hot, and the cyclist has to maintain a high level of hydration to continue the bike ride. In conclusion, the combination of challenging terrain, lack of water sources, and hot weather makes the cyclist's journey a very difficult one.
1271	7251	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many tangible ways, namely heat, lack of water, and hills. The scorching heat beats down on him relentlessly, sapping his energy. While on his journey, he almost gets severely dehydrated because he does not have a good supply of water. When he does take a sip from his meager reserves, he remarks that they taste “like battery acid.” And he had to laboriously pedal up the road for another @NUM1 miles so that he could finally replenish himself at a place where he hoped to find clean, cool water. After reaching his destination and quenching his thirst, he was able to continue his journey with a bit more ease, having overcome this challenging part of his ride.
1272	7253	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by significantly hurting his ability to keep going. In this story, the cyclist was faced with a series of setbacks or problems. At first, he naively took advice from a very old man who provided out - of - date directions, leading him astray. Then, the cyclist made a poor decision by thinking he could keep going on a very limited water supply. As a result, the cyclist then started getting dehydrated and his frustration turned into anger. The cyclist then spotted an old building in the distance, which raised his hopes of finding water and rest. However, his hopes were quickly dashed once he found out it was closed and rundown. Finally, he spots a store in the distance. He rushes inside, rehydrates himself, and then he is on his way again, having learned the importance of proper planning and not relying on unreliable sources.
1273	7254	3	3	I think features affect the cyclist because when you ride a bicycle, you need to consider various elements of the setting. For example, the terrain can make pedaling easier or harder. A flat road allows for a smooth and fast ride, while hilly areas require more effort. The weather also plays a role. Hot and sunny days can lead to dehydration if proper precautions aren't taken, and rainy conditions can make the road slippery and visibility poor. All these features have a direct impact on the cyclist's experience and performance. In conclusion, cyclists must be aware of these features to have a safe and enjoyable ride.
1274	7255	3	3	In the story “Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist has a very long and arduous journey that is affected by a variety of things and problems. The cyclist starts off confident with himself at the beginning, believing he can handle whatever comes his way. But after a few moments under the harsh conditions of the journey, he feels really bad, both physically and mentally, and learns a really good lesson about preparation. “I eased past trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.” This quote clearly shows that it is really hard for him to move without water. It demonstrates that he is not only thirsty but severely dehydrated, which is extremely dangerous for a human being. The cyclist also had a really bad time because he resorted to extreme measures, like tasting stones in order to make his thirst go away, one example of that is when he had been without water for hours and was desperate for any relief. Eventually, he learned that proper planning and carrying enough supplies are essential for such a journey.
1275	7256	3	3	In the essay, “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” a cyclist is confronted with a troubling setting on his journey to Yosemite. He is led away from the steady road as a result of taking mislead advice from an old group of individuals. In this essay, the setting plays a crucial and far - reaching impact on the cyclist. In the essay, the author sets up the story describing the day as, “traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” The intense heat of the desert in June is almost unbearable. Because of the amount of heat the cyclist was enduring, he became extremely weary and severely dehydrated. Along with this, the cyclist had to work much harder because the man noticed, “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” These hills required him to use more energy to pedal. This setting is a major setback to the cyclist’s journey, and required him to persevere through the pain and exhaustion. In my life, there have been numerous obstacles which I have had to persevere through. One of which had been when I was out camping, and suddenly, as in the essay, the setting changed, and a fierce storm came. The strong winds and heavy rain made our situation difficult. Though the other campers and I did what we needed to, like setting up a proper shelter, to make the best out of it. In the essay, the cyclist is affected greatly by the setting. This was the same in my experience as the setting affected myself. In both situations, perseverance led to a final satisfaction of the journey, as we overcame the challenges presented by the changing settings.
1276	7257	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the roads are extremely bumpy, filled with potholes and uneven patches. This makes it difficult for the cyclist to maintain balance and control. The other thing that is affecting the cyclist is the large amount of water on the roads, which creates slippery conditions. There are a lot of sharp - curved roads which always significantly slow down his speed. All these factors combined make the cyclist's journey a challenging one.
1277	7258	3	3	In the story, the features of the setting greatly affect the cyclist. The setting is described as a rough and uneven terrain, full of rocks and ruts, which makes it much harder for the cyclist to travel smoothly. Also, it's swelteringly hot, and there are no buildings or people around for miles. This isolation makes it hard for the cyclist because he quickly runs out of water and has no one to turn to for help. Throughout the story, the cyclist keeps persevering and ultimately ends up surviving against the odds.
1278	7259	3	3	The feature of the setting affects the cyclist because the surrounding environment is so negative. Everything around the cyclist, such as the desolate landscape, is perceived negatively. Naturally, the cyclist feels like the task of cycling is harder and more challenging than it really is. For example, nothing is surrounding the cyclist but vast stretches of sand and the scorching hot temperature. Since the setting is so empty and no one is around, every pedal - stroke seems like a huge effort. Also, the cyclist feels like he can't go on and is extremely weak because there is no living being around him. Furthermore, if the cyclist was in a park with the warm sun shining and people around in sight, his attitude would change completely, and everything would seem much easier. This shows how the setting can have a profound impact on the cyclist's experience.
1279	7260	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist by making it very hard for him to control his bike on the rough road, which was full of large stones and deep ruts. The hot weather made him extremely thirsty and caused him to run out of water quickly. Also, there wasn't a single building in sight so he had no way to get anything to drink. Moreover, he didn't know where he was going as there were no signs or landmarks. These are the features that significantly affected the cyclist and made his journey a difficult one.
1280	7261	3	3	The setting affects the cyclist in many grueling and harsh ways. First, the complete lack of civilization contributes to an overwhelming uneasy feeling and leaves him with an inability to refill his water bottle. Second, the intense heat and the numerous uphill slopes are taking a heavy toll on both the cyclist's physical and mental strength. Third, his water bottle is emptying at an alarming rate due to his extreme thirst and the relentless heat. In paragraph four, the exhausted cyclist reaches the first 'town'. This place might have been a thriving settlement in the past, but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a 'ghost town'. Finally, he came to a house with a rusty water pump, which spurted out brackish, near - boiling water. This unpalatable water did not support the parched cyclist, neither physically nor mentally, leaving him in a desperate situation.
1281	7262	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because when traveling in a desolate area like the high deserts of California in June, the harsh environment with its intense heat, long stretches of deserted land, and challenging terrain can greatly impact the cyclist's journey. The cyclist might face difficulties such as lack of proper rest stops, scarce water sources, and tough physical exertion on the hilly paths. And he should not ""never accept travel advice from"" unreliable sources as the wrong directions can lead him further into these unfavorable conditions. This all shows how the setting's features can have a profound and often negative effect on the cyclist."
1282	7263	3	3	"The setting of the story affects the cyclist in a negative way. He naively trusted that these men he had asked directions from knew what they were talking about. With the directions firmly in mind, he pedaled on his way to his destination. Only to find deserted towns with empty streets, disowned factories with dilapidated structures, and steep hills that made his progress arduous. All of this was part of the ""high deserts of California in June"", a sweltering and unforgiving environment. With all these aspects, the cyclist was completely worn out and severely dehydrated, saying ""I'd read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst"", trying to alleviate his deep pangs of thirst. After finally finding a place to get a drink, he stated ""I had an overwhelming urge to hug the person and buy some bait"", showing his deep gratitude and immense relief of finding water. This experience clearly demonstrates how the setting had a detrimental impact on the cyclist's journey."
1283	7264	3	3	"In the story ""Do not exceed posted speed limit"", the features of the setting affect the cyclist in a few ways. One way is that the harsh conditions of the desert, with its scorching heat and dry air, make him need a large amount of water resources. This is because the combination of the intense heat and the physical exercise of cycling will rapidly dehydrate him. This is evident in the story because after he drinks all his water, he becomes so desperate that he is willing to try to drink out of an old pump that had thick black sludge in it. The mere fact that he would attempt such a thing shows just how dire his need for water was due to the setting. This is how the features of the setting affected the cyclist, highlighting the significant challenges the desert environment presented to him."
1284	7265	3	3	"While trying to reach Yosemite by a shortcut, the cyclist faced many challenges and emotions. The cyclist started out his journey cheerfully with vivid thoughts of the cool pines of Yosemite dancing in his mind. ""The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it"", he was so focused on his destination. As he continued on, his spirits as well as his water supply gradually went down. The cyclist constantly encouraged himself to keep going, just to find an open building in the distance. ""…telling myself that if I could make it that far, I'd be fine."" Along the way, passing many abandoned factories with their rusty machinery and broken windows, the cyclist tried many methods to decrease his thirst including sucking on stones. ""…slowly gaining elevation while losing hope."" As he got closer to the deserted building, he lost more and more hope. When the cyclist finally found an open store with modern bathrooms, he had ""an overwhelming urge to seek out the kind - hearted staff, kiss them, and buy some bait."" At the end, the cyclist promised himself to always use his map to avoid such difficult situations in the future."
1285	7266	3	3	"In the essay, ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" by Kurmaskie, the cyclist went through hard times, trying to get to Yosemite National Park. A cyclist is someone who rides their bike mostly all the time to get somewhere, relying on the bike for transportation and adventure. First off, the cyclist asked old men for directions to get to Yosemite National Park. The cyclist knew that was a mistake in the first place, but he held onto a glimmer of hope that maybe they knew what they were talking about. Secondly, on his trip, he came across an ""Ghost town"" with nothing in sight but a strange - looking bike snake coiled near an old building. The cyclist became dehydrated and was running out of water. The only water he could find was in a dirty old well that looked unfit to drink from, but his desperation made him consider it. This shows how the challenging setting and the wrong directions led the cyclist into a difficult and dangerous situation during his attempt to reach Yosemite."
1286	7267	3	3	Well, some features of the journey might have more of an impact than others, and the cyclist, in particular, might have been affected more than others. Also, the author faced a lot of problems during the journey, such as the lack of water, which made every sip precious, the presence of poisonous snakes that added an element of danger, and the poor condition of the road that made cycling arduous. So, there were many things that affected the author and the cyclist when they were on their journey, and these factors combined to make it a challenging experience.
1287	7268	3	3	In the passage “Do not exceed posted speed limit,” there are many features from the setting that affected the cyclist. One significant feature that affected the cyclist was the snake he encountered on his way. For example, in the text it says “At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake,” and “I cased post, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.” This clearly proves that the snake was a feature that affected the cyclist by giving him a moment where he had to stay calm even in the difficult state he was in, being dehydrated and dealing with all the affects he encountered from that. Overall, this encounter with the snake was a notable aspect of how the setting influenced the cyclist's journey.
1288	7269	3	3	There are many things that could have made his bicycle ride much more enjoyable. One thing is if he wasn't in the middle of nowhere and if he actually knew where he was. For example, “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” In that desolate place, he had almost no water to get him through the day. For instance, “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.” Additionally, he did not know where he was going, so it was harder for him to plan his route and find help. In conclusion, these are some things that made his trip hard and less enjoyable.
1289	7270	3	3	The features of the setting do affect the cyclist in such ways that they make him illusionalistic and dehydrated. He had the illusion that a juice factory was working, when in reality, it was abandoned. He saw rusty pipes, and this made him even more dehydrated because he knew those pipes could never produce water. The combination of these visual elements from the setting contributed to his state of mind and physical condition, making his journey a difficult one.
1290	7271	3	3	In the short story “Do not exceed posted speed limit,” the settings of the story have a significant impact on the cyclist. They make him think he will die and overall make him worried throughout the journey. In the story, the cyclist takes the advice of two old men on the best way to get to Yosemite Mountain and, unfortunately, gets himself in the middle of nowhere. He finds himself in the California desert without water, and this situation really gets to his head. “I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.” That line from the last page of the story clearly shows his despair. The biker was taking an unfamiliar route, and he let himself believe he would die. He was well - aware that he was in the desert without water, and the setting makes him nervous because deserts are known for their harsh conditions. He would not have been nearly as nervous if he was in a forest where there are streams and more signs of life. He lets the desert and the intense heat convince him that he is going to die. By coming across ghost towns, he believes he will never see another person again, and he becomes more and more anxious because of where he is. He thinks the heat will kill him. In conclusion, the setting affects him and tricks him into believing he is going to die, highlighting the powerful influence of the story's setting on the cyclist's state of mind.
1291	7272	3	3	The feature of the setting, including the road conditions, the weather, and the available amount of water, can possibly decide the life or death of the cyclist. The road conditions such as steep hills and uneven rocky roads can decide a future for a cyclist because if the rocky roads cause you to lose balance, you could fall down a hill and give yourself a serious injury or possibly die. For example, in the short - story it says, “over one long crippling hill, a building came into view”. This shows the challenging conditions in which the cyclist had to deal with. In addition, the weather and the amount of water can also decide the future. “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke.” This shows us that if the cyclist gets dehydrated enough, he could pass out and no one would find him in the vast desert. Moreover, the intense heat isn't helping him at all, and he could die without anyone knowing. These reasons clearly show us that a cyclist needs to make sure they have enough water and that the conditions and weather are right so they don't make a life - threatening choice. In conclusion, the setting's features are crucial factors that cyclists must consider to ensure their safety.
1292	7273	3	3	When the cyclist is at his low point, he finds himself in an abandoned ghost town, desperately looking for water that unfortunately tastes like battery acid. The desolate and empty nature of this abandoned town makes the cyclist feel utterly hopeless. When he first reaches the old water pump and the dilapidated, abandoned juice building, he briefly has a glimmer of hope. However, this hope is quickly dashed. The building, once perhaps a source of refreshment, has no juice left. The water from the pump is too hot, and it's not fit for consumption. The harsh and unforgiving setting is the main reason his mood changes throughout the story. In conclusion, the setting acts as a powerful force that directly impacts the cyclist's emotional state, highlighting the significant influence of the environment on the individual.
1293	7274	3	3	I am going to write a well - structured response that explains in detail how the features of the setting affect the cyclist. In my response, I will carefully include specific examples from the essay that strongly support my conclusion. I firmly think the features in the setting affect the cyclist because different elements such as heavy snow or large rocks on the path could significantly affect the way someone rides. For instance, snow can make the ground slippery, reducing traction and making it difficult to control the bike, while rocks can cause sudden jolts and potentially lead to loss of balance. In conclusion, the features of the setting play a crucial role in determining the cyclist's riding experience and safety.
1294	7275	3	3	In the beginning of the story, a young and enthusiastic cyclist sets out on a long and arduous journey to Yosemite National Park. Along his ride, he meets some old but confident men at a small rest stop. They tell him about a new route which “was to slice away hours” from his ride. The setting at that time, on @DATE1, was exceedingly hot, with the sun beating down mercilessly on the cyclist. He was supposed to encounter a few thriving towns along the way. However, the first town he came across was a “barren ghost town” with no signs of life. The next place had water that had “the flavor of battery acid”. Then he came to an abandoned Welch's grape juice factory, its once - bustling halls now silent. The author navigated through this very trying setting until he finally reached a bait shop. The advice that he gives to his readers is to stick to your guns and don't let old - timers try and change your mind. In conclusion, the cyclist's journey was fraught with challenges due to the unexpected setting, and his advice serves as a valuable lesson for others.
1295	7276	3	3	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist had many significant changes due to the setting of what was around him. The cyclist was lost in the vast and desolate desert. This affected him a great deal because the desert is extremely hot, with the sun shining brightly all day. He could have died from either dehydration or exhaustion. Also, in the desert, some animals can be very dangerous. During his cyclist journey, he saw a venomous, poisonous snake slithering across his path. It was a good thing that he was extremely cautious around the snake because if he hadn't been, he might have gotten bitten, and there would be no one around in the deserted desert to help him. The desert he was in was also completely deserted, and there was no one around to give him directions. The worst thing would have to be that he ran out of water. Without the water, his body would become very weak, and he would get severely dehydrated. He could have even died in the unforgiving desert. The setting of where the cyclist was affected him greatly. In conclusion, the desert setting presented numerous life - threatening challenges to the cyclist, emphasizing the importance of being prepared when facing such harsh environments.
1296	7277	3	3	The features of the sweltering and desolate setting affect the cyclist significantly, making him extremely thirsty as the scorching heat saps his moisture. Moreover, the lack of familiar landmarks and the vast expanse of the area make him start thinking he is lost and going to die. The cyclist got information from an old guy who has not been off his porch for years, relying on his potentially outdated directions. Just when the cyclist was on the verge of despair, thinking he was lost, he saw “Gary and Wilber’s fish camp - if you want bait for the big ones, we're your best bet!” The cyclist eagerly went in and got water to quench his thirst. The old man inside then asked him if he wanted to know where to go, but this time he said no, perhaps having lost trust in such advice.
1297	7278	3	3	In the short story “Do not exceed the speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting has a great impact on the cyclist. In the beginning of the story, he vividly describes the scenery as “@CAPS1,” a landscape that sets a certain tone for his journey. As he continued following the old men's outdated advice, it led him through more arid and barren lands. When he came to the first “town,” he described it as a ghost town, with empty streets and dilapidated buildings. The second setting he arrived at was “One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn't hold in the lamest mule.” He continued moving to the next town, which was @NUM1 miles away. Along the way, he came to what he thought was a Welch's Grape juice factory and bottling plant, but it turned out to be something else. This took a toll on his confidence because he said “I hung my head.” He moved on and had finally arrived at an abandoned building called “@PERSON2 and Wilber’s fish camp.” This is where he drank water and became replenished. The setting had a great effect on the cyclist because, depending on the location, it decided whether he would live or die in the hot deserts of California.
1298	7279	3	3	One of the main things that affect the cyclists is the intense heat. The blistering sun beats down on him, causing him to sweat profusely. Due to the heat, he drinks all of his water in an attempt to stay hydrated. Another feature of the setting that affects the cyclist is the rough road. Since he is so exhausted from the heat and the long ride, he has a difficult time riding on the hills and other hard road conditions. The uneven surface and steep inclines make each pedal stroke a struggle, further draining his energy. In conclusion, the heat and rough road are significant factors that make the cyclist's journey extremely challenging.
1299	7280	3	3	In the story, “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” written by the @CAPS1, the setting reflects how the cyclist is feeling. For example, “Flat roads were replaced by short, rising hills @CAPS2.” As the terrain was changing, so was his attitude. When he first started the journey, he was happy and care - free, and the land had no hills and was flat, which matched his light - hearted mood. However, once he noticed that everything was not as the men said, he seemed to grow a little angry and upset, @CAPS2. Like the land seemed to reflect this change in his emotions, soon he found himself on a bumpy and unpleasant road. The setting also seemed to give the man more obstacles to overcome on his adventure. “Tumbleweeds crossed my path, and a ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the movement in front of me.” The land seemed to be teasing and tormenting him when he started to figure out that listening to the old men was a mistake. In essence, the setting throughout the story mirrors the cyclist's shifting emotional state and adds to the challenges of his journey.
1300	7281	3	3	In the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting, such as the sweltering heat and vast open spaces, affect the cyclist by draining him of energy. He is sweating so much that his clothes are soaked, and he keeps on drinking his water in a desperate attempt to cool down and stay hydrated. Slowly, he finishes the water in his bottles, and as “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips” (Kurmaskie’s), he realizes he still has a long ride ahead of him. It was a warm day, with the sun shining brightly and the temperature soaring. He needed to stay hydrated to keep going, but with his water supply dwindling, the situation became increasingly dire. In the end, the harsh setting put the cyclist's endurance and survival skills to the test.
1301	7282	3	3	In the book “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting was in Codi, California, a small and somewhat secluded town. The author went on a journey through the winding roads and unique landscapes of this area, experiencing the local charm and challenges along the way.
1302	7283	3	3	Throughout the rider's long and arduous journey, the setting greatly affected him. For example, the sweltering hot weather caused him to drink the majority of his water supply rapidly, making him severely dehydrated and extremely tired. If the weather was cool, he would have been able to conserve his water and last much longer on the journey. This shows how crucial the setting can be for a traveler.
1303	7284	3	3	"In this story, the cyclist was affected physically and emotionally in many ways. One such way was the setting around him. For example, when he rode into the first town, a small and bustling place with friendly locals, he gained a significant boost of confidence because he believed that he was on the right track to Yosemite. Then, when the cyclist rode upon that old shed and the rusty water pumps in the desolate landscape, he began to feel a little worried because he was running out of water and the old - timers never mentioned the shed. When the cyclist encountered the rolling hills with tumbleweeds and snakes, a rather menacing and desolate scene, I believe he began to feel dismayed because he was lost. I believe this because in the text he says ""I was going to die and the birds would pick me dead."" This shows how hopeless the man felt. When he reached ""Gary and @CAPS1 fish camp"", a welcoming and safe - looking place, he was relieved and thankful because he no longer had death blazing towards him in the form of a yellow sun, empty spaces, and an empty water bottle. This was how the features and setting affected him in many ways."
1304	7285	3	3	"Riding through beastly mountains with steep slopes and jagged rocks, hot and burning deserts with scorching sand under the blazing sun and no water in sight, a cyclist was riding through a town and asked for directions. The two old men, perhaps a bit confused or misinformed, gave him the wrong directions and sent him on a trip through hell that only a determined person could get through. First, he had to go miles without water which resulted in him losing faith, becoming severely dehydrated, and almost giving up on his plans. The terrain he had to go through was unbearable and could almost kill him without water. Luckily, he had faith and determination so he got through it and learned a lesson. Maps are made for people to use so if you have a map you should trust it, and in the ending it shows that the cyclist learned that because he said ""And I promised myself right then that I'd always stick to it in the future."
1305	7286	3	3	In the short story “Rough Road Ahead Do not exceed posted speed limit.” A lot of things affected the cyclist. Such as the rocky road, which made his ride bumpy and difficult, and the lack of water. For example, where the author says “when I tried a drop or two, It had the flavor of battery acid.” This shows how he was losing hope, and he seems a little scared as he realizes the dire situation he is in. Also, the abandoned towns, with their empty buildings and eerie silence, didn’t help his state of mind. All these factors combined made his journey extremely challenging.
1306	7287	3	3	All the features of the environment through which the cyclist is riding affect him greatly. First, since he is riding through the vast desert in the scorching month of June, that means that it is extremely hot out and he will need plenty of water for his long and arduous bike ride. Also, the rough terrain over which he is riding is full of bumps and dips, which causes him to lose a significant amount of energy. The sun was also beginning to beat down on him relentlessly, which means that he was going to have a sweltering ride to the town and which later caused his struggle for water. Overall, the hot, desert setting affects the cyclist severely. It causes him to dehydrate rapidly and have an urgent need for water. In the story it says, “The water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips” and that he could drop from a heatstroke on a beautiful yet blisteringly hot day in June. This is basically showing that the hot environment caused him to drink a lot of water, and now he has run low which could cause him to have a heat stroke, putting his entire journey at risk.
1307	7288	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by depleting his water supply rapidly, and almost giving him heat exhaustion. In the hot and arid environment described in the text, he says: “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.” Due to this intense heat, he has very little water left for survival. As he continues his journey under the scorching sun, his water will gradually run out, leaving him in a life - threatening situation. Eventually, if he doesn't find a water source soon, the lack of water will further exacerbate his condition, and the risk of heat exhaustion and other heat - related illnesses will increase significantly. This clearly shows how the setting's features have a detrimental impact on the cyclist.
1308	7289	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist greatly. At first, it was a nice, flat road which the speaker was happy with and he had “a smile on.” He could pedal smoothly and enjoy the relatively easy ride on this stretch of the journey. Then came large rolling hills which created a considerable challenge. The cyclist needed to muster up enough physical and mental energy to continue pushing forward against the incline. The rough terrain was next, with its uneven surface full of rocks and ruts, causing the cyclist to work even harder to cycle. As if the rough terrain wasn't energy - soaking enough, a snake suddenly blocked a majority of the pavement and large elevations came into play. The harder the terrain became, the more difficult it was for the cyclist to maintain his speed and progress, truly testing his endurance and cycling skills.
1309	7290	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because depending on how the setting is, is how much skill they need. Like if they're going down a long, gentle hill then they really only need to know how to control the bike's speed and direction carefully. However, if they're going up a steep mountain with lots of bumps and sharp turns, they need to have a good amount of strength, balance, and technical skill. Usually, if they're riding in a shady area with a cool breeze, then they wear clothes to keep them cool and comfortable. But if they're going to be in the direct sun for a long time, then they need to wear light - colored, breathable clothes to protect themselves from the heat. The setting, whether it's the terrain or the climate, affects the rider very much in terms of both the skills required and the appropriate clothing choices.
1310	7291	3	3	The setting in “Do not exceed posted speed limit” affects the cyclist in many ways. The old men told the cyclist there were flat roads on the path he was to take. When the cyclist got there, instead of flat roads, there were challenging hills. The cyclist traveled through the vast and unforgiving desert to get to his destination. The searing heat and high humidity in the desert made the situation worse. He started to run out of water because it was so hot and humid. He started to get dehydrated and could barely keep his balance on the bike. In this story, the cyclist had to pass a large snake. “A ridiculously large” snake – it really didn't look like a diamondback – blocked a majority of the pavement in front of him (Kurmaskie). The snake was big and intimidating, and the cyclist, already wobbling from dehydration, had to work his best to pass it safely. The settings in this story, including the false information about the terrain, the desert environment, and the unexpected snake encounter, had a significant and diverse effect on the cyclist, making his journey extremely difficult.
1311	7292	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist for many readers after another. Here are some examples why the cyclist was bike riding down a windy road. He is in a hot place similar to a desert. The scorching sun beats down on him constantly, and it is very hot there, which is affecting him during his travels. ""I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state."" Another thing that affected him because of the setting was that the desert had rocky roads and windy paths since he followed the old man's direction. ""Rough Road Ahead"". A final example is that he was in the desert so he saw a snake come out of the tumbleweeds. ""A large snake, it really did look like a diamond back."" These are three examples of how the cyclist had been affected due to the setting of the story, clearly showing the significant impact of the setting on his journey."
1312	7293	3	3	The features in the settings, like steep hills, make the cyclist use more energy. As he pedals hard up these hills, his muscles strain, and the more energy that he uses, the more water he will want to drink. This is difficult because he states “The water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips”. With the limited water supply and the high energy expenditure on the hilly terrain, he is in a tough situation, and therefore, he was in trouble as his body requires more hydration to keep going.
1313	7294	3	3	In the story, the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example, he is in the desert, and the sweltering heat outside is almost unbearable. The sun's rays bake the ground, and the dry air sucks the moisture from his body. Also, he is running out of water. This is bad because he could become dehydrated, which would lead to fatigue, dizziness, and other health issues. Another example is when he comes upon the building, he thinks it is a mirage at first because he’s pretty much dehydrated. His vision is blurred, and his mind is playing tricks on him. The rough terrain, with its uneven ground and loose sand, also makes it hard for him to pedal, and he is already weak from lack of water. In conclusion, all these elements of the desert, including the heat, water shortage, and rough terrain, affect the cyclist in some way, making his journey extremely challenging.
1314	7295	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist’s mood towards the journey. At first, he is confident that the old men’s knowledge of the land is accurate, and he is excited about what lies ahead for him. He imagines new adventures and beautiful sights on this unknown path. However, as his journey drags on, his excitement soon turns into dismay and slight doubt. The intense heat of the weather and the lack of water make the cyclist develop an uncaring attitude. “I’d read once that sucking on stones helps… with any luck I’d hit a bump and lodge one in my throat.” The verbal irony in this passage delivers a negative feeling to the reader, and it is here that it is clear that the cyclist doesn't care what happens to him. When he finally reaches a sign of civilization, the cyclist becomes himself again, regaining his sense of self - assurance, and decides that his own knowledge is best, learning from the difficult experience on this journey.
1315	7296	3	3	In the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” while riding his bike, the author Joe Kurmaskie has a long ride. Where he is riding, there are up and down hills, and the road surface is very rough, making each pedal a struggle. He is running out of water in the desert. “I stopped at a rusted water pump to get water and a tar - like substance oozed out.” Now that he is off his bike, he least worries about the poisonous snakes of the desert. He found Welch’s grape juice factory, but unfortunately, it was abandoned. Finally, the author found a bait shop and got water, which relieved his desperate situation and allowed him to continue his journey with a bit more ease.
1316	7297	3	3	In the short story “Do not @CAPS1 the Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the detailed setting of the story significantly affects the cyclist in numerous ways. Throughout the story, the cyclist endures frequent and substantial changes in temperature and climate. These rapid shifts not only make him uncomfortable but also drain his energy. He also encounters significant changes in land structure, such as steep inclines and uneven terrains, which make it extremely arduous to pedal and reach his intended destination. Based on this, it's clear that the setting in @MONTH1 has a profound impact on the cyclist.
1317	7298	3	3	The intense heat of the hot sun and the desolate desert features in the setting are having a severe impact on the cyclist, potentially preventing him from reaching his destination. The sun beats down relentlessly on him, sapping his energy and making each pedal stroke a struggle. As described, “The sun was beginning to beat down... wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt.” The sweltering heat and his exhaustion from the sun make him fear that he will die from dehydration. This real danger would very likely halt his progress towards his destination, Yosemite. His limited water supply exacerbates the situation; he can only travel @NUM1 as his water is depleting at a rate of @NUM2. With such conditions, it becomes increasingly difficult for him to continue his journey, highlighting how the setting is a major obstacle.
1318	7299	3	3	The various features of the setting have a notable impact on the cyclist. For example, when the outside temperature is hot, his body loses more fluids through sweating, so he requires more water than he would under normal conditions. This increased need for water can be a challenge if he doesn't have an adequate supply. Also, if it is raining, the wet surface of the road reduces traction, making it slippery. As a result, he has to drive more carefully to avoid accidents and maintain control of his bike. These examples clearly show that the setting, with its different weather and environmental conditions, can significantly affect the cyclist's journey and safety.
1319	7300	3	3	The environment around people in specific situations can have diverse and notable effects on them. For instance, when you are feeling hot, a large tree nearby can provide welcome shade, offering relief from the scorching sun. Or, if you are thirsty, a river in the vicinity can quench your thirst. However, if you are both hungry and hot and there are no resources nearby, the situation can become even more uncomfortable. In the case of this cyclist, the environment had a multifaceted impact on him. He faced bumpy roads that jolted him, “ghost towns” that were eerily empty, and trees that could either offer shade or pose an obstacle. As he said, “The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed,” which was due to the “cool pines” around him, as he elaborated in the next paragraph. The text also mentions that the terrain changed, and he even came across a snake, which not only startled him but also increased his stress and thirst. All these factors made it more difficult for him to continue his journey. From reading the text, it's evident that the environmental features can have significant and varied effects on a person.
1320	7301	3	3	The features of the setting have a strong and distinct effect on the cyclist's arduous journey to Yosemite. The characteristics of the land, including its mountains and hills, the fact that it is a desert, and the setting being in the middle of June, all play crucial roles in this story. The dry and hilly landscape is a major hurdle for the main character. Since the land is hilly, he has to exert twice as much effort to pedal uphill, quickly exhausting his energy. Moreover, the dryness of the land leaves him constantly thirsty, and there are no readily available sources of water. As it is a desert, there are no settlements or places where he can seek help, obtain food or water, or find any signs of civilization. He begins to lose hope and believes that he won't be able to make it to his destination. The text in paragraph!! explains, “the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn't been off their porch in decades, caused me to laugh.” This shows his desperation. Clearly, the setting, being hot, dry, and deserted, has a detrimental effect on the main character and his journey.
1321	7302	3	3	The cyclist in the essay Rough Road Ahead: do not exceed posted speed limit feels deeply discouraged and suffers from dehydration because of the desolate setting. Near the beginning, after viewing the first stop which consisted of a few broken - down buildings and some rusted pumps, he states, “This sight was troubling.” The dilapidated appearance of the place immediately dampened his spirits. He also feels severe dehydration when he reaches the pumps and finds that “A tar - like substance oozed out, followed by blackish water,” which was clearly unfit for consumption. Also, as he is pedaling along the arid road, he sees a sign that says do not exceed 55 miles per hour. This sign seems like an added burden in his already difficult journey, highlighting the long and arduous road ahead. In conclusion, the harsh setting takes a significant toll on the cyclist, both physically and mentally.
1322	7303	3	3	In this quick passage by Joe Kurmaskie, the many conditions of the road and the desolate area around it greatly determine how he acts and what he feels. “The sun was beginning to beat down,” (Kurmaskie). As the sun rises higher in the sky, its intense rays start to take a toll on him. He is starting to get extremely tired because it is becoming swelteringly hot and sunny, so he is feeling less confident about continuing his journey. He was traveling through the high deserts of California in June, a time when the heat is at its peak. (Kurmaskie). Not only is he very tired and hot, but the place where he is riding is barren and open, and there is no one around him to give him help or to find water. Through the passage, you can clearly tell that the temperature and weather around the cyclist can significantly change his state of mind and his ability to keep going. In conclusion, the harsh environmental conditions have a profound impact on the cyclist's experience.
1323	7304	3	3	That clearly explains how the features of the setting affect the cyclist. In the essay, the evidence that supports the conclusion is that the cyclist's actions and emotions are closely tied to the features of the setting. The cyclist is affected by the desolate landscape, the lack of resources, and the extreme weather conditions. For example, the broken - down buildings and rusty pumps at the first stop made him feel discouraged, and the unfit water from the pumps led to his dehydration. All these elements in the setting have a direct impact on the cyclist's well - being and journey. In conclusion, the features of the setting play a crucial role in shaping the cyclist's experience.
1324	7305	3	3	The beautiful scenery makes the cyclist extremely happy. He's so overjoyed that he can't contain his excitement! As he pedals along, he is surrounded by a panorama of lush green meadows, clear blue skies, and colorful wildflowers. The gentle breeze carries the sweet scent of the flowers, and the soft chirping of birds fills the air. He lets out a loud “Woohoo!” in pure elation. Every moment spent in this idyllic setting brings a wide smile to his face. In conclusion, the enchanting scenery has a magical effect on the cyclist, filling him with happiness and a sense of peace.
1325	7306	3	3	In this story, the setting has a significant affect on the cyclist's trip and his well - being. It is extremely hot, with the temperature soaring over @NUM1 degrees, and the road is going down hill with a lot of sharp turns. The cyclist is getting so hot that his water, which was once cold, is now warm and unrefreshing. Being in this scorching desert is like being in an oven, slowly sapping his energy. The intense heat and the challenging terrain are taking a heavy toll on him, and he is on the verge of having a heart - stroke. All the harsh elements in the desert, such as the high temperature, the lack of shade, and the difficult road conditions, are having a profound effect on the cyclist. In conclusion, the desert setting poses a great challenge to the cyclist's physical and mental endurance.
1326	7307	3	3	The setting of a situation can significantly affect a person both mentally and physically. This is clearly evident in @PERSON1 “Do not Exceed Posted speed Limit.” The cyclist remains, for the most part, unaffected until the directions he receives from “a collection of old - timers who haven’t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office” lead him over terrain that is highly unsuitable for biking. Prior to following the men’s directions, the setting is quite enjoyable and makes for an easy ride. A reader can know this because the cyclist exudes confidence. For example, he says “The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it. The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them.” However, this confidence begins to deplete as the cycling becomes more difficult. For instance, after hitting rolling hills and coming across a sign warning of a rough road and not exceeding the speed limit, the cyclist remarks “sometimes life can feel so cruel.” He becomes disappointed and wants to give up because he can't even reach that speed limit. Nevertheless, he is determined and pushes through to reach a shop. This achievement gives him a strong sense of satisfaction and restores his confidence. So, in conclusion, the setting can have a powerful impact on a person's mood or motivation.
1327	7308	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in various ways, making his journey a challenging one, just like when he rode through that desolate ghost town. The setting is a major part of this story, and much of the narrative focuses on it. For example, details such as when he stops to get water or how the tumbleweeds are lazily crossing the road are described. He is constantly thirsty as he pedals his bike for long distances. The harsh environment takes a toll on him, yet he perseveres. In conclusion, the setting plays a crucial role in shaping the cyclist's experience during his journey.
1328	7309	3	3	How the setting changes the mood of the cyclist is that what he sees pretty much describes how he feels. Initially, he starts off with strong legs and a bright smile on his face, full of enthusiasm for the journey. Then he arrives at the first town, which turns out to be a ghost town. This sight doesn't really dampen his spirits because when he sees it, he lets out a laugh. Also, as the setting changes, so does his confidence in the old men's direction - giving. At the first town, he still has full confidence in what they told him. Then he notices that the temperature is starting to rise, but that doesn't change his mood significantly. @NUM1 miles later, he comes to a fork in the road with rusty water pumps and a dilapidated, run - down car. All these elements make him less confident about his water level. Then he realizes that the next town is a long way away, so he loses more confidence and becomes more worried about running out of water. Subsequently, the flat road is replaced with a rough, bumpy one, and his mood deteriorates further. Finally, he reaches a fishing store where he gets water, and his spirits soar. This is how the setting affected his mood throughout the journey.
1329	7310	3	3	The features and setting in the story affected the cyclist because they made his arduous journey to Yosemite even more difficult. In the story, it vividly describes that the heat was so intense that he could potentially drop dead from heatstroke at any moment. Also, his limited supply of water made him extremely fatigued as he pedaled his bike. Moreover, the sun was beating down relentlessly. Not only was he tired due to his lack of water, but he was also losing water and energy rapidly through his sweat because of the sweltering heat outside. These factors combined are why the features and setting made his journey to Yosemite a truly challenging and strenuous endeavor.
1330	7311	3	3	In the short story, “Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the cyclist experiences some tough times during his journey. When he starts the journey, he has very little water with him. Given that the weather is hot and dry, his water supply depletes quickly, leaving him with hardly any water for the rest of the trip. Additionally, the rough, uneven roads make him extremely tired. The constant jolting and effort required to navigate these roads make it even harder for him to continue the journey. In conclusion, the lack of water and the poor road conditions set the stage for a difficult and trying journey for the cyclist.
1331	7312	3	3	Features of the setting that affect the cyclist are “the cool pines and rushing rivers”. These natural elements affect the cyclist by keeping him cool through the shade of the pines and the refreshing air near the rivers. The scenic beauty of the pines and the sound of the rushing rivers also energize him. Another notable feature is the juice factory, which was old and shut - down. Its dilapidated state gives an eerie feeling, suggesting that he would die alone. The ghost town, which was completely and utterly deserted, with empty streets and abandoned buildings, shows that the place is barren and unlivable. These are some of the features that affect the biker, making his journey a mix of beauty and desolation.
1332	7313	3	3	The cyclist is very discouraged by the dry and hot settings around him. A feature is something specific about some thing else. In “Rough Road Ahead. Do not exceed posted speed limit”, the cyclist takes the advice of a few old men that seems to be somewhat outdated. Following their advice, he gets lost as he is running out of water and energy. The cyclist says “Over one long, crippling hill, a building came into view. I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn't a mirage” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). He is greatly affected by the heat, and the exhaustion from cycling in such conditions makes him so tired that he wants to make sure the building is not an illusion. Also, the changed terrain, with its steep slopes and uneven ground, affected how much water he drank and how hard he had worked just to get up that one long hill. The dry climate and tough terrain greatly affected the cyclist, making his journey a real struggle.
1333	7314	3	3	Heat, desert, humidity – all are things that affect the cyclist as on his journey. First, heat because the intense heat is making him extremely thirsty for water that he is running low on. For example, the narrator describes, “… water bottles only had a few tantalizing sips.” This means that the day is hot, and the cyclist is in a critical situation of running out of water. Second, desert because the narrator is the only one around, and deserts are usually deserted. The vast expanse of sand and lack of any signs of life are evident. For example, the narrator exclaims “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, structure of any kind.” This clearly states that he could be in a desert where no one wants to be. Lastly, humidity, because it can be hot but then the humidity comes into play and makes the sky more dry - looking and the heat seem hotter than it usually is. This is why heat, desert, and humidity all are things that affect the cyclist as he is on a journey, making it a challenging one.
1334	7315	3	3	The features of the setting greatly affect this cyclist. At first, he is fine riding along the old - timers “shortcut” as he states that “things began well enough. I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.” But what he didn't know was this was the beginning of a very rough day. He arrived at the first “town” which was a ghost town. The empty streets and silent buildings gave an eerie feeling, but he wasn't overly worried yet. At about sixty miles in on his journey, he came to a ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a broken - down corral. The cyclist explains how he had drank a lot of his water and was in desperate need of some. He tried the pumps but he explains how “a tar - like substance oozed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.” A couple of miles later, he came to a highway sign that read ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT. The cyclist continued on, his throat parched and desperate for water. He even came across a snake, which added to his unease. He was now fearing a heat stroke. He came to an abandoned grape juice factory and hung his head in despair. The cyclist then was almost completely dehydrated from the long, tiring bike ride. The cyclist was sure he was going to die from dehydration or a heatstroke that this terrible ride had caused. He finally came to a shop and drank from the sink, feeling a wave of relief. So this ride was torturous due to the setting, which tested his limits.
1335	7316	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in positive and negative ways. At first, there were the two old men who gave the cyclist the out - of - date information. They affected him negatively because if it wasn't for them, the cyclist would have never gotten lost and found himself in a difficult situation. When the cyclist arrived at the first town, the water pump affected him. The cyclist was running out of water, and when he tried the water from the water pump, it tasted like battery acid and was about @NUM1°F. The unpleasant taste and high temperature made it undrinkable, and the cyclist was becoming more and more dehydrated. The small, rolling hills didn't help his dehydration either; he also used a lot of energy in order to go over the hills, further depleting his resources. Finally, he found Gary and Wilber’s fish camp where he was able to get water. This whole experience in a way, affected the cyclist positively even though, at the time, he was affected negatively. The cyclist learned to not take advice from really old people who “haven't left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office.” The cyclist was affected positively and negatively by the features of the setting, and this experience will likely make him more cautious in future travels.
1336	7317	3	3	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit”, the cyclist is on an adventurous journey to Yosemite National Park. Along the way, he stops at a small roadside spot to seek advice on a quicker route. When he approaches a group of old men sitting on their porches, he remarks, “Never accept travel advice from a collection of old - timers who haven’t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office.” Despite his initial skepticism, he decides to follow their advice. As he progresses, he encounters abandoned ghost towns that the old men had described as thriving spots. The cyclist has to overcome the challenges of the rolling hills of the terrain, the mirages that play tricks on his eyes, and the intense heat of a June day in the California deserts. Finally, he spots a bait and tack shop. When he sees that the men who own the place are even older than the previous group, he just stares at them in disbelief. Based on the quote, it's clear that the cyclist will likely ignore their advice about having the best map, as he's learned his lesson from the earlier misinformation.
1337	7318	3	3	The features in the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One significant aspect is that the cyclist can only carry a limited amount of equipment that might be needed during the journey. For example, when it comes to water, you can only take so much with you on the bike. Once you run out, and there are no buildings or water sources around, you're in a tough spot and out of luck. Similarly, food is also restricted in quantity. You can only pack a certain amount of food that can fit on your bike. Finally, when it's time to rest, you can't just pull over anywhere. You have to keep riding until you find a hotel or make it back home. I know that I would not make it under such challenging conditions. So those are just a few reasons on why the setting has a notable impact on cyclists.
1338	7319	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by making him dehydrated, troubled, and relieved. The cyclist is dehydrated because of the horrible, sweltering heat. He says “the growing realie at von that l would drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June.” This clearly indicates that the intense heat is a great threat to him and would cause him to become dehydrated and potentially suffer from heatstroke. The cyclist is troubled by the scarce surroundings. He describes “a corral that couldn’t hold the lamest mule.” This shows that he is getting worried because there is no one around and his directions are starting to sound wrong, leaving him feeling lost and anxious. The cyclist is relieved by the water from the sink. He had the “overwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber, kiss them.” This means that he is so relieved that he has finally found water and he wants to thank the owners of the bait shop for providing it. In conclusion, the setting's features have a profound and diverse impact on the cyclist's physical and mental state.
1339	7320	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in the story “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaskie. The downhill land format helps him in a way because when cycling downhill, he doesn't have to use as much strength and pedal as hard, especially when he doesn't have as much water in his body. This allows him to conserve his energy. When he comes to a pump, it is in a sorry state. It is rusty, with tar oozing out, and the water that comes out is hot and brackish, flavored like battery acid, which is completely unfit for consumption. The dryness of the desert has a bad effect on the cyclist because he isn't able to get to the Yosemite water until the end of his journey, leaving him constantly at risk of dehydration. On the positive side, the breeze of the wind has a beneficial impact as it helps to cool him down during the scorching ride. Overall, the features of the setting in the story “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaskie have a significant and varied impact on the cyclist.
1340	7321	3	3	Many things that involve settings can affect other things. In the “Do not exceed the posted speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, a cyclist is affected by the setting as he travels to Yosemite National Park. “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from a heatstroke on a gorgeous day….” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The setting of the day, with its intense heat, is affecting him greatly. He is very tired, his body is struggling to cope with the heat, and he's almost sick from it. The arid and hot setting of this place is taking a toll on the cyclist. He is so uncomfortable that he wants to go home and get away from the heat. The setting of this place has a profound and negative effect on the cyclist, making his journey extremely challenging and unpleasant.
1341	7322	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. One way that the features affect the cyclist is that it is summer time, and it is harder for the cyclist because the high temperatures increase the risk of heat exhaustion and make pedaling more strenuous as the body has to work harder to cool itself down. This makes the cycling experience more challenging and fatiguing for the cyclist.
1342	7323	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One way could be if the setting was in, like, a place with a lot of water sources nearby, then the cyclist wouldn't have to worry about dehydration as they could easily replenish their fluids. Another reason would be if the old men were never outside in the first place, then none of the interactions or events related to them would have also happened. This shows how various elements of the setting can significantly impact the cyclist's journey.
1343	7324	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist physically. The heat of the California desert causes the cyclist to become tired and dehydrated. For example, the text states “I raced past, trying to keep my balance, dehydrated and starved,” The setting is the main factor which causes the cyclist to become dehydrated as the arid conditions and intense sun rapidly deplete the body's water reserves. This clearly demonstrates the powerful influence of the setting on the cyclist's physical state.
1344	7325	3	3	One part of the setting that is affecting him is the sun, which is mercilessly overheating the biker. The intense rays of the sun beat down on the biker, raising his body temperature to uncomfortable levels. Another problem is the terrain he is on, which consists of a number of small hills that are wearing him out. Climbing these hills requires extra effort and energy. There are also apparently no trees for shade and no clouds or wind to cool him off, leaving the biker exposed to the full force of the heat. All these factors combined make the cycling experience extremely difficult for the biker.
1345	7326	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because as the terrain got rougher, things for the cyclist got harder. In paragraph @NUM1, there is a sentence that says, “It read: Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” In the next paragraph, the cyclist comments, “sometimes life can feel so cruel.” This is because as the road ahead got rough, to the cyclist, life seemed cruel. All the features like encountering a snake, the lack of water, and the rolling hills are all obstacles in life that people have to experience. We might not like it, but the reward at the end, such as a sense of accomplishment and the beautiful scenery at the destination, is wonderful.
1346	7327	3	3	The features of the setting that affect the cyclist are the conditions of the road and weather. As he was riding, he hit some bad and nasty water that was pooled on the road. Along with other hazardous things, he also tried to ride through a desert where he had already drank all his bottles of water and had nothing left to drink. He was very dehydrated and had to drink Nestle water he found. It was hard for him to keep going, being dehydrated so badly but he had to. At one point, a big snake almost took up the entire road and he had to just ease his way on by it. His riding conditions were so bad, he thought he was going to die, and he said the birds were going to eat him. The weather was so hot it was hard to go on. He finally found a bathroom, went inside it, drank water from the sink, and yelled to a man who then told him the direction he wanted. In the end, despite these harsh conditions, he persevered and continued his journey.
1347	7328	3	3	The features of the setting do indeed affect the cyclist. First in the story when describing the setting it says “there was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” This description is basically giving a hint or foreshadow that something bad is going to happen because he's alone on an empty stretch of land. Another description of the setting when it affects the cyclist is when it says “Rough Road Ahead; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” This sign is pretty much saying danger ahead, something bad will happen as the cyclist approaches this rough - road area. Overall, the setting's descriptions clearly indicate potential troubles for the cyclist.
1348	7329	3	3	The setting affects the cyclist in many ways. How? Because there was not a posted speed limit up there, which caused the cyclist to go right through and over, going faster than he was supposed to. Without the clear indication of a speed limit, the cyclist had no proper guidance on how fast he should be riding. This lack of a speed - limit sign in the setting led to the cyclist taking risks and potentially endangering himself. In conclusion, the missing speed - limit sign in the setting had a direct impact on the cyclist's behavior.
1349	7330	3	3	Poisonous snakes, mirages, rolling hills, and dry dead tumbleweed - these features in the setting that the cyclist was going through have the greatest effect of all. They showed the treacherous path he took, the obstacles he had to surpass to prevail. The purpose of including some features of the setting like the poisonous snakes, mirages, rolling hills, no signs of life, and no water all show and impact how bad the conditions were. If it left out these specifics, the audience could say/think he was traveling through any old trail. For all they know, the cyclist could be traveling along a windy river passing through nice developed towns. So, you see, the features in the setting help set the mood and also reveal the context of the story. In essence, these setting features are crucial for understanding the cyclist's difficult journey.
1350	7331	3	3	When you do something really too often you get used to it. Well, I think it's the same thing with how sitting affects the cyclist's features. It might make their butt flat or their back have a different shape. With different shape, I don't mean that they are deformed but every person is different. So their back can either have a “C” shape or an “I” shape or a “D” shape. Prolonged sitting on a bicycle can gradually change the physical form of a cyclist's body parts. In conclusion, the act of sitting while cycling over time can have notable effects on a cyclist's physical features.
1351	7332	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in these ways. The cyclist was extremely hot under the blazing sun. Wide rings of dried sweat circled his shirt, and he had the growing realization that he could drop from a heart - stroke on this otherwise gorgeous day in June. The towns that he passed through, which were supposed to be bustling with people, were in fact completely deserted. There were no signs of life, not even a single soul on the streets. His ride ended up being even harder than it would have been under normal circumstances. This is how the features of the setting, including the sweltering heat and the desolate towns, affect the cyclist.
1352	7333	3	3	There are many features of the setting that would affect the pedalists. “Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills” (kurmaskie @NUM1) clearly shows the change of terrain. These hills, with their gradual inclines and declines, must be traveled up to get to the other side, and that takes a significant amount of time and energy, especially for bike riders who have to pedal vigorously against gravity. “High deserts of California in June” (kurmaskie @NUM1) indicates the intense heat. The scorching sun beats down on the cyclists, and this heat makes it harder for most people to concentrate. It also causes people to become overheated when exerting much force at once, leaving them exhausted and drained. These two factors, the hilly terrain and the summer heat, significantly impact the pedalists' journey.
1353	7334	3	3	The different settings of the cyclist affected him by how he felt when he rode the bike on the road. He was well - excited and happy as he set off on the ride, looking forward to the adventure. He truly felt a sense of exhilaration as he rode the bike real fast through the short cut, the wind in his face. When he came over a long, crippling hill, he was still riding real fast, driven by his enthusiasm. Unfortunately, he was riding fast non - stop, and as he came through the whole road, he felt a great sense of relief. He felt so free, especially when he came over hills that were tall and large, like conquering small mountains. But he mostly believed he could find his way at the end. He said it himself that he always looked towards the future. So he's keeping his future and his wisdom to himself. He thought he was gonna die at one point, but all he had to do was ask for a little push. Different things did affect the cyclist, yet he managed to overcome challenges and look forward to his very bright future.
1354	7335	3	3	One of the biggest problems that the author faced in his essay was his surroundings. The setting of the story in Yosemite provided many obstacles such as the vastness of the park, the intense summer heat, and the fact that many places had been abandoned. The summer heat was the most significant problem for the cyclist. He had to bike many miles under the blazing sun, but he only had a limited supply of water. As the miles passed, his water supply began to run low. The lack of water made his mouth dry and his body weak, which increased his determination to find the next town before he collapsed from dehydration. It is this unwavering determination which moves him from ghost town to ghost town and keeps the story moving forward. Another big problem was the vastness of Yosemite National Park, which he was biking through. The park was so large that any wrong turns (which he took, thanks to the inaccurate directions he was given) could get him lost and thrown off track for a very long time. It was his confusion as to where the next town was that kept him biking, with great difficulty, and made for an interesting story. An example of the vastness of the park was when he quoted, “About forty miles into the pedal, I arrived at the first ‘town.’ This place might have been a thriving spot at one time - say, before the last world war - but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.” This quote shows that even after pedaling many miles, he hadn't seen a sign of anyone living, which would have increased his desperation to keep looking for civilization. In the end, it is these challenges that make his journey both difficult and compelling.
1355	7336	3	3	"In ""Do Not Exceed Speed Limit,"" by Joe Kurmaskie, the author depicts the vivid details of the setting and how they contribute to the cyclist’s condition. For example, the author wrote “Over one long, crippling hill, a building come into view. I wiped the sweat from my eye.” The way the author described the hill as “crippling” clearly shows how much energy it was taking away from the cyclist. The cyclist had to struggle uphill, his legs aching with each pedal stroke. Another quote that contributed to the cyclist’s journey was, “that smoky blues tune ‘Summer time’ rattled around in the dry honeycombs of my deteriorating brain.” This expressed how dehydrated the summer heat was making him. His mind was foggy, and he was in a state of discomfort. I believe the author used modifying details to support the description of the cyclist’s condition. These details, such as the description of the hill and the mention of dehydration, enhanced the reader’s perception of the cyclist’s challenging journey."
1356	7337	3	3	The terrain the cyclist faces doesn't help very much considering he is almost out of water. As he pedaled on, he came across a series of steep hills that tired him out a great deal and made him even more thirsty. Each upward slope seemed to sap his remaining energy. Also, when he came across the juice factory, his excitement spurred him on, but he used a lot of energy to get there, which made him even more parched. Therefore, if he didn't have any energy left after all of that strenuous effort, he wouldn't have been able to get to the bait shop and find the relief he desperately needed.
1357	7338	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. First of all, he is in the middle of nowhere, surrounded by an unfamiliar expanse. He doesn't know the direction of where he is going, wandering aimlessly on the open road. Moreover, he also doesn't know the people who live in this desolate area, so there's no one readily available to offer him assistance. The other thing is that he doesn't have any food or a drink. Without eating or drinking, his body can't get the necessary energy, and as a result, he can't ride the bike effectively, leaving him stuck in this unforgiving setting.
1358	7339	3	3	The features in the setting in the story affect the cyclist in many ways. For example, in the story it said, “At same point, tumbleweed crossed my path.” This clearly indicates that he is in the desert or somewhere very hot because, as common knowledge goes, you usually only see tumbleweeds in extremely hot and arid places. Thus, being in the desert affects the cyclist significantly. He is already low on water, and being in a place as hot as the desert makes him even more dehydrated, his throat parched and his body weak. Another feature in the setting in this story that affected the cyclist is the hills he had to climb. These hills were no easy feat. He was already dehydrated, and climbing the hills made him have to work harder, causing him to lose more sweat and become even more dehydrated. Those are two examples of how the features in the setting of this story affected the cyclist, highlighting the harsh challenges he faced.
1359	7340	3	3	The setting in this story is very hard for the cyclist. His main problem is the lack of water. If you deprive the body of water, all of your major organs will struggle under the blistering heat of the hot sun. Without an adequate supply of water, his body functions start to deteriorate, and he becomes increasingly fatigued. Another problem was the condition of the terrain. The ground was bumpy and dry, making it very hard to cycle on. Every jolt and uneven surface required extra effort from the cyclist. These are just a few problems the cyclist encountered, which collectively made his journey an extremely difficult one.
1360	7341	3	3	The feature in the setting affected the cyclist a lot. It was a sweltering hot summer day, and the sun beat down relentlessly. He was running out of water, his water bottle nearly empty. With all the heat, he was at high risk of having a heat stroke, his body struggling to cope with the extreme temperature. Another problem was the hills. He didn't have a lot of energy to begin with, and the intense heat of the sun was sapping it from him. Climbing the hills became an almost insurmountable task, further draining his already depleted energy reserves. In such a harsh setting, the cyclist faced a difficult battle to continue his journey.
1361	7342	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cycles because it was extremely hot, with the sun beating down relentlessly, and it was a rough terrain like a bumpy and uneven train track. This harsh environment made it difficult for the cycles to maintain a steady rhythm and progress smoothly.
1362	7343	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because as he gets closer to the nearest town, the ground gradually becomes rougher to ride on. The once - smooth path now has numerous small rocks and potholes. Like when he sees the sign saying not to exceed the limit, it's a clear indication of the upcoming difficult terrain. That shows that the ground is going to be rough, which will slow down the cyclist and make the ride more strenuous.
1363	7344	3	3	The features of the setting in, “Rough Road Ahead” negatively affect the cyclist. In the vast California desert, where the sun beats down mercilessly, water is everything. If you run out of water then you might as well have run out of life. Without water, dehydration kicks in quickly and it affects not only your body, making you weak and fatigued, but your mind too, causing confusion and disorientation. The cyclist only had a limited amount of water with him when he started. “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” Through the deserted towns he came across, he searched diligently for a source of water but found none that were useable. “When I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid.” Another feature was the heat. The scorching heat began to mess with his mind and take a toll on his body quickly. “I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn't a mirage.” He worried about heatstroke and his body's desperate need for water throughout the entire trip. Finally, in the deserts of California, wildlife can affect you. The cyclist was using a path that nature had claimed and was not traveled often by people. “A ridiculously large snake crossed my path and blocked the majority of the pavement.” As you can see, the cyclist was negatively affected by the features of the setting in, “Rough Road Ahead”.
1364	7345	3	3	The feature of the setting affected the cyclist because if there is a rough road ahead, you're just going to have to be able and ready to handle the up - and - downs, the sharp bumps that can jolt you out of your seat. The uneven surface makes it hard to keep balance and control. The author was so scared that he was gonna die and that the birds were gonna pick his bones clean, imagining a tragic end in this harsh environment.
1365	7346	3	3	In the story the cyclist faces many issues that could stop him from finishing his journey. First, his water supply, which is limited, could cause him to become severely dehydrated and he could pass out due to lack of fluids in his body. Another issue is the hot weather in June, when the sun is at its peak, which could cause him to suffer from a heat stroke and literally die. The rough terrain, filled with large rocks and deep ruts, could stop him from finishing the trip because he could pop a bike tire. If that happens, he would have to walk the rest of the way, which would be extremely difficult in the desert. The cyclist faces many problems that could end his trip and maybe even his life, but he pushes through with determination and survives, showing his strong will and resilience.
1366	7347	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One way is that the tall, cool pines with their thick foliage keep the scorching sun from directly beating down on him, protecting him from the risk of getting heatstroke. Another way is that the small, remote towns he went to had either water of extremely bad quality or no available water at all, and as a result, he was gradually becoming dehydrated. The intense heat from the relentless sun was making him feel light - headed and strange, and he was fervently hoping he wasn't seeing mirages. The harsh setting clearly posed multiple challenges to the cyclist's journey.
1367	7348	3	3	The cyclist really does not like the setting of the road. The rough, uneven surface and the arid, desolate surroundings are messing up his cycling experience big time. The lack of proper landmarks and the constant gusts of hot, dusty wind are making his journey not only difficult but also quite unpleasant. It is evident that this unfavorable setting is having a significant negative impact on his overall cycling adventure.
1368	7349	3	3	The setting is a vast, barren desert in California in June. This severely affects the cyclist because it is extremely hot, with the sun shining mercilessly. He only has a couple of sips of water left in his bottle. There is absolutely no place for the cyclist to stop and replenish his water supply. He says, “There is no one in sight, not a single building, car, or any structure of any kind as far as the eye can see.” As you can see, such a desolate and hot setting would definitely take a toll on the cyclist's well - being and his ability to continue the journey.
1369	7350	3	3	Some features of the setting in @MONTH1 that have affected the cyclist was the fact that he was rapidly running out of water. When he came across a well and tried to pump water, he said he pumped with all his might at first. A thick, tar - like substance oozed out slowly, followed by brackish water. He described that the water tasted horribly of battery acid, making it undrinkable. Also, in this setting, the cyclist noticed a significant terrain change. The flat road suddenly turned into short, steep hills, and then, to his horror, he encountered a snake that looked like a diamondback, adding more danger to his journey. All these features of the setting have made the cyclist's experience extremely challenging.
1370	7351	3	3	In the essay “Rough Road ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” By Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affect the cyclist because he was on a bike and the sweltering heat was almost unbearable. He ran into bumpy, rutted roads and numerous hills. For example, he says, “Not even a few June miles into the next section of the road, he noticed the terrains changing. The once - flat land was gradually replaced by short, rolling hills that demanded extra effort to climb.” Another example is “Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that he could die from heatstroke was constantly gnawing at his mind.” These examples clearly show that it was not an easy journey and how the features of the setting affected the cyclist. In conclusion, this story shows that you should never blindly take directions from an old person, especially if it's swelteringly hot and you are riding a bike, as it can lead to a very difficult and potentially dangerous situation.
1371	7352	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many different ways. To start with, the terrain of the road turned from flat to bumpy, which made the cyclist's initially easy trip become more challenging. In the story it said, ""Rough Road ahead do not exceed posted speed limit."" Since the cyclist had to use a lot more energy on the bumpy roads and his water supply was limited, he became very thirsty. When he finally saw an old town ahead, he stopped. It looked like it was abandoned. He began to pump water out of the water pump, but no matter how long he pumped, the water that came out looked like battery acid. The quote from the story said, ""when I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid."" These are some features of the setting that affected the cyclist throughout his journey, making his ride much more arduous."
1372	7353	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in this story greatly. The cyclist is cycling in a desert, as the story states, ""I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June."" It was extremely hot and the scorching sun was beating down relentlessly on the cyclist, as described by ""the sun was beginning to beat down..."". The area is remote and there is no one around to offer help or assistance, as it ""fit the traditional definition of ghost town."" There are no natural water sources for the cyclist to refill his bottles of water. He was in great danger of dying from dehydration, as shown when ""I got down on my hands and knees and worked the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength, but only a tarlike substance oozed out."" There was also a poisonous snake on the road which could have easily bitten the cyclist. Moreover, there were hills that required more energy to get up. Since the cyclist had to use more energy to ascend the hills, he got more tired and thirsty, which further affected his journey in this harsh setting."
1373	7354	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist's attitude towards the old men. Since the cyclist listened to the old men's directions, he was furious with himself. Seeing that the last attempt of following the directions had caused the cyclist to become nearly dehydrated, the setting had severely added to the problem. The blistering sun and the high deserts of California in the middle of June made the cyclist dehydrated and extremely tired. When he came to a rusted water pump and ""black tar oozed out"", you can picture the cyclist as furious, anxious, and of course, extremely thirsty. The rough terrain and tumble - weeds along the way had caused the cyclist to feel skeptical of his decision to follow the old men's directions. In this difficult setting, his trust in the old men's advice had been completely shattered."
1374	7355	3	3	"The cyclist in ""Rough Road; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" starts off in the ""serenity of an early summer evening"" taking road advice from old - timers. At first, when the sun was beating down on him, he didn't mind; the thoughts of the beautiful Yosemite with its majestic scenery kept him determined. Later however, his determination was fading as he realized that his ""short cut"" was not so short after all. The ""high deserts of California in June"" with the intense heat and the changing terrain furthered his dehydration and his desperate need to find water. The emptiness of his surroundings with ""no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind"" made him focus intently on the horizon and tell himself that if he made it there, then he'd be alright. Finally, a building came into view. The hope he got from this gave him a burst of strength to move on. Ironically it was an abandoned building. The cyclist describes it as a ""Welchís Grape Juice factory and bottling plant."" After this, he had lost hope and hung his head in despair. Believing he was going to die, the cyclist got back on his bike. Driving away from the factory, he saw the sight of a fish camp and immediately regained hope. Going there, he regained his strength and learned his lesson well, that he should never take road advice from other people without careful consideration."
1375	7356	3	3	The setting in the reading affected the cyclist because it was hot, dry, and there was nothing around. The intense heat was one part of the setting that affected him because he had to drink water a lot to stay hydrated. The dryness was everywhere around him, so he couldn't stop anywhere to cool off and get some relief from the heat. Also, when things got hard and he needed support or resources, there was nothing around but ghost towns and abandoned buildings. These desolate places offered no help or comfort. This harsh setting made his cycling journey extremely difficult and affected him physically and mentally, making his experience a very tough one.
1376	7357	3	3	The features mentioned in the sweltering summer settings of the story made it notably harder for the cyclist. The severe lack of water during a blistering summer in California made it extremely uncomfortable for the cyclist to traverse the desolate deserts. The worst part was when he desperately tried to suck the pebbles to cycle his saliva in his dry mouth, he unexpectedly ended up swallowing one, which only added to his distress. In the end, these challenging conditions truly tested the cyclist's endurance.
1377	7358	3	3	The features of the setting significantly affect the cyclist because his body has a very hard time adjusting to this life - threatening situation. The hot and arid desert atmosphere is continuously draining his body of water, yet he still needs to keep pedaling on steadily. Also, the parched terrain is completely stripped of water sources, so he doesn't have anything readily available to refuel with. This lack of water in such a harsh setting severely hampers his ability to complete the journey.
1378	7359	3	3	I think that if we were to enforce strict punishments on those who speed on the roads, there would be a noticeable decrease in the number of car crashes. Really, those drivers who have bad road rage should be required to attend anger management classes. By taking these measures, we can make the roads safer for everyone.
1379	7360	3	3	There were many features that affected the cyclist. One feature included the first ghost town that he came by. “But on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.” This desolate sight had to affect him a little because he knows now that the people who told him the shortcut haven't been out for quite a while, which made him question the reliability of the route. Another feature that affected the cyclist was the lack of water in a “desert in California in June.” The cyclist now knows that it might be a long while before he gets any more water, which added to his anxiety. The hills also had an effect on the cyclist because he knew now he was going to have to work really hard to get into the next town, all the while without drinking much water. The Welch’s building also had an effect on him since it was abandoned and no drinks were left inside. In conclusion, the cyclist had to battle many challenging features on his way to the National Park, which tested his physical and mental strength.
1380	7361	3	3	The cyclist sees his journey affected by a succession of events that will make his journey more and more difficult with each passing moment. One of the first errors he makes is taking advice from people that have no clue of where they are at. (I shouldn't have done was let them have a peek at my map.) This unwise decision sets a wrong course for his journey. The high temperature of the desert also strongly influences him as he is travelling through the high desert of California. The cyclist also finds himself with a combination of emotions; at times he thinks he is going to pass away due to the harsh conditions, and at other times he believes he will be fine. As I stumbled into a rather modern bathroom and drank deeply from the sink, I thought I had an overwhelming urge to seek Gary. In the end, these events and emotions make his journey an extremely arduous one.
1381	7362	3	3	In the story, the man has a very arduous time trying to reach some water. He confronts numerous obstacles throughout the narrative. For instance, he has trekked about @NUM1 miles without a drop of water. Moreover, there are a great many hills and sharp turns within the story, which significantly slow him down. He is struggling to get to water because of these many hindrances. In the end, these obstacles really made his quest for water a herculean task.
1382	7363	3	3	In the story, the cyclist is on an exciting bike ride to @LOCATION1. He has a brand - new map and is making excellent progress, until he asks a group of old men for the best way to get there in less time, hoping for a shortcut. He follows their directions and initially feels confident about it. But soon enough, the situation changes. He encounters new and challenging terrain, which makes the journey much tougher. The kind of setting he faces includes steep, unforgiving hills, strict speed limits that he can't exceed, a dry and sweltering temperature, and to make matters worse, he has no water. All these elements combine to exacerbate the situation. While going through these hardships, he feels as if he is on the verge of death and is tempted to give up. But eventually, he spots someone and decides not to ask for directions. So, the lesson is clear: don't take directions from a stranger unless you're prepared to face the unexpected. This experience will surely make him more cautious in future travels.
1383	7364	3	3	"The features affected the cyclist because of the extremely rough roads. This had a significant impact on him as it considerably slowed him down. I know this because in the story, it clearly stated, ""Rough Road Ahead Do not Exceed Posted speed Limit"". This warning implies that he had to slow down to avoid the risk of having an accident. Another challenging feature was the scorching heat. The high temperature meant that he was rapidly losing water, either through evaporation or because he was constantly drinking to quench his thirst. I know this because it said, ""The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips"", which indicates that there was very little water left. These features combined made his cycling experience extremely difficult."
1384	7365	3	3	"The settings affect the cyclist in multiple ways on his journey to Yosemite. Well, for one thing, when he took the shortcut, the fact that it was June and he was out in the harsh desert environment already made the trip difficult. Also, it is mentioned that he passed through a couple of deserted towns, so there was no opportunity to replenish his water supply. It says, ""I pumped that handle for several minutes, but the water wouldn't cool down. When I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid."" One notable thing about his setting that changed was the presence of hilly terrains. But once he came across a bait shop, an old man asked him if he knew the best way to get to Yosemite, and he replied, ""yes - sir: I own a very good map."" By this response, he has realized that the best way to travel anywhere is the path or road he is familiar with because he will know what to anticipate. This is how the setting influenced his journey and his perspective on travel."
1385	7366	3	3	The features of the start affected the cyclist as he was going on his cycling journey. The rough start made him listless, and those who had not left the town seemed to pour in all around him. Instead of following his original plan, he got caught up in the chaos and found himself in the middle of the situation, just like the start sites on the search page that lead to the wrong place. He then realized right then that he had always asked for trouble. Trying to find the right way on the last stretch was truly bitter. It's said that he did not like the sight around him and felt that his walking pace was not right. He almost fell on the ground and got dust stuck on him. Did he really want this to happen again? So, he decided to always look at the map carefully. This experience taught him the importance of being more cautious and following his own plan.
1386	7367	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One of the ways it is affecting him is that the description of it makes it seem hotter than what it really is. He says “neighborhood of two hundred degrees.” He is emphasizing that it is extremely hot. The features of the setting affected him because it made it seem even hotter, and he was perhaps exaggerating the discomfort due to the perceived high temperature. In conclusion, the setting's portrayal of heat had a notable impact on the cyclist's perception and experience.
1387	7368	3	3	In the essay, the features of the setting significantly affected the cyclist. The cyclist used words to describe the setting like “flat road” and “short, rolling hills,” and there were also other examples such as perhaps mentioning the color of the surrounding landscape or the presence of certain plants. The way the cyclist described the setting vividly gave the reader a clear visual picture, almost as if the reader was right there on the journey. I think the cyclist was affected by the setting as it influenced his physical exertion and overall mood during the ride. In conclusion, the setting played an important role in both the cyclist's experience and the reader's understanding.
1388	7369	3	3	In the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, depending on how the main character feels, that’s what the setting is like. When he reached the next town and left, he was feeling well because nothing was going wrong. The setting was very tranquil, with perhaps a gentle breeze and the soft rustling of leaves. The narrator says, “The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them” (Kurmaskie). This setting was very happy and pleasant, just like the narrator's mood, creating a harmonious connection between the character's state of mind and the environment. In conclusion, the story effectively shows how the setting mirrors the character's feelings.
1389	7370	3	3	Some things that affected the cyclist were the terrain changing into a flat road that was then replaced by short, rolling hills. The flat road allowed for a relatively easy and steady pace, but the transition to the rolling hills required more effort. Then he came to a rough road, which made the ride bumpy and challenging. Another obstacle for the cyclist was the tar - like substance that came out of the rusted water pump, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere around @NUM1 hundred degrees. Every time he pumped, the water wouldn't cool down, and it tasted like battery acid. He was hitting his water bottle regularly because he was sweating a lot, so he needed new water. The cyclist was travelling through the high deserts of California, and the sun was starting to beat down, causing him to become dehydrated. The snake that blocked the pavement in front of him, which looked like a diamondback, added to his stress. In conclusion, the cyclist faced multiple challenges from the terrain, water issues, and unexpected encounters during his journey.
1390	7371	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in the short story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” The beginning of the story is set at “a reservoir campground outside of @CAPS1, California” during the early summer. Being the early summer in southern California, the temperatures are going to be hot, with the sun shining brightly and the air dry. And the main character, who is a cyclist and is doing a lot of physical activity, is going to sweat a great deal. The temperature and excessive sweating cause the cyclist to drink a lot of water. As the water runs out, we are now in our conflict. The setting also leads the main character to his resolution of the conflict. Being by a reservoir, fishing is going to be a popular activity. A bait and tackle shop would be the perfect business to have, since there are likely many fishermen around. When the cyclist is at the bait and tackle shop, he could go inside and quench his thirst. Therefore, the setting of the story affects both the conflict and the solution, demonstrating the important role of the setting in the story's development.
1391	7372	3	3	The cyclist decided to ride to Yosemite National Park on a sweltering hot summer day in California. His initial thought was to rely on a perfectly good and up - to - date map. Then he struck up a conversation with some old men who, out of goodwill, decided to tell him a shortcut they had taken back in the day. The cyclist, perhaps a bit too trusting, decided to take the old men's shortcut through the arid desert with just one messy bottle of water. It was extremely hot outside, and the scorching sun was beating down on his back as he pedaled his bike. This made him even hotter than he had anticipated, and there was no shade or place for him to stop and get some water. This situation made the trip much harder for him because now his mind was solely focused on finding water rather than enjoying the ride. The settings of the course affected the cyclist in many ways he was not prepared for. The route he took was not biker - friendly. If he would have taken the route that was on the map, then he would have known exactly where he was, and his ride would not have been affected by thoughts of slowing down to put rocks in his mouth to reserve water or constantly thinking about finding water. In the end, he learned a valuable lesson about the importance of sticking to reliable routes.
1392	7373	3	3	"The cyclist had a truly rough time. The elements were completely against him. It was extremely dry and swelteringly hot, and he had almost no water. In the text, it clearly says, ""The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips."" This shows that he had hardly any water at all, and what little he did have would only make his thirst even more unbearable. ""Thorny weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake."" This quote not only makes the situation seem perilous but also gives you a vivid picture of a desolate desert or perhaps a place like Colorado. There was no one in sight, no building, car, or any structure of any kind. He was desperately saving up his energy and his meager supply of water. The harsh conditions were starting to take a toll on his mental state, and he was starting to go a little crazy. The hills were an absolute killer for him. In the text, it says ""over one long, crippling hill."" This shows just how rough the conditions were, especially considering that he had mentioned at the beginning that he was an experienced cyclist. Clearly, the biker had a very rough time, and the setting definitely had a major impact on his journey."
1393	7374	3	3	The weather can significantly change the course of action a cyclist will take. If it is cold outside, then the cyclist will surely bring warmer clothes to protect himself from the chill. On the other hand, if it is hotter outside, he would most likely bring lighter, breathable clothes to stay cool. If he was planning to ride a long distance, he'd bring more supplies like an ample amount of water and some energy - boosting food. However, if he was going on a short ride, then he wouldn't need to bring so much stuff. The way the weather is plays a crucial role in how a person will prepare for a cycling trip. In essence, cyclists must always take the weather into account to ensure a comfortable and safe ride.
1394	7375	3	3	"In the story “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the different aspects of the setting have a profound effect on the cyclist in several ways. When he first starts his journey, he is so caught up in the excitement that he doesn't even notice how hot it is. He says, ""The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it."" However, his mood starts to change very rapidly. Soon, he drinks most of his limited supply of water and becomes increasingly tired. He then comes across a water pump, but his hopes are quickly dashed when he realizes the water tastes like ""battery acid."" As he continues his arduous journey, he spots a snake that he could swear was a dangerous diamondback, so he slowly pedals by it, his heart pounding. When he notices a factory in the distance, he uses his last bit of energy to reach it, only to be deeply discouraged when he finds it abandoned. His spirits finally start to rise when he stumbles upon a store and is able to drink a good amount of refreshing water, which gives him the much - needed boost to continue his ride."
1395	7376	3	3	"Multiple parts of the setting have a significant impact on the cyclist. When he arrives in a small town that has a water pump, he has high hopes of quenching his thirst. However, this pump does not have good water. As Kurmaskie writes, ""when I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid"" (Kurmaskie @NUM1). This part of the terrain clearly shows its negative effect on the cyclist. When he becomes severely dehydrated, as described in the text, ""in my dehydrated state"" (Kurmaskie @NUM1), his situation becomes even more dire. Another part of the setting that affected the cyclist was when he arrived at the juice factory. He was probably looking forward to getting some refreshment there, but it was closed, which deeply depressed him. These various elements of the setting combined to make the cyclist's journey a very difficult one, highlighting the importance of favorable settings for a smooth cycling experience."
1396	7377	3	3	The cyclist in this short story was greatly affected by the desolate setting. He was riding in a sweltering desert, where the searing heat beat down relentlessly, with hardly any signs of civilization to offer him assistance. Also, the rough and uneven road that he was cycling on was far from smooth, which constantly gave him troubles as his bike jolted over every bump. The wildlife also had an impact on him. He once came across a big, menacing snake that slithered across his path, and he had to cautiously ride around it, his heart pounding with fear. Also, in his despair, he thought he was going to die out there and that the vultures circling above were waiting to pick him off. The desert itself was what really got to him. Deserts don't have much water, which was his most urgent need, and he couldn't find a town to stop at, at least one with some people anyway. So the harsh setting in which the main character was riding had a huge and overwhelming effect on him.
1397	7378	3	3	The cyclist was utterly exhausted as he struggled to pedal his bike up the steep hill. The setting of the story affects the cyclist a great deal. This is because in California, the climate is generally warm and the conditions are really good for cycling. The weather is just right, not too hot and not too cold, making it perfect for a long - distance ride. As he rode along, a dilapidated town with one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps that looked like they hadn't worked in years, and a rickety coral that couldn't even hold in the lamest mule greeted him. Besides that, after riding twenty miles ahead, there was a significant terrain changing. The flat, easy - going road was gradually replaced by short, rolling hills. After he crested the first few of these, a large highway sign suddenly jumped out at him, startling him a bit. The rough road was the time where he had to be really careful and not to exceed the speed limit to avoid losing control of his bike. In conclusion, the changing setting in this story had a profound impact on the cyclist's journey.
1398	7379	3	3	The setting of the essay greatly affected the cyclist. These desolate settings constantly discouraged him, although he valiantly tried to keep hope alive within him. As he cycled on, he was surrounded by a dry desert landscape where the hills seemed to heighten with each passing mile, and there was nothing man - made in sight. The vast expanse of arid land and the looming hills subconsciously affected the cyclist and exacerbated his growing thirst. The heat of the sun beating down on him made his throat parched and his body weak. To one point, the cyclist's original objective became invalidated because of his intense thirst pangs and the overwhelming exhaustion that had seeped into his every muscle. In the end, the harsh setting took a heavy toll on the cyclist's physical and mental state.
1399	7380	3	3	Being a cyclist is not as easy as it sounds. Sure, casually riding a bike around the neighborhood might be easy, but being a serious cyclist is so much more difficult. Cyclists have many obstacles to overcome while riding. One major obstacle would be a rough terrain. Cyclists are typically used to riding on smooth, well - paved roads where they can glide along effortlessly. However, going off - road or riding on a bumpy dirt road might be a real challenge as it requires more strength and balance. In the short story “Do Exceed posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, there is another example for an obstacle cyclists have to be careful of, and that is running out of water. The cyclist went on in telling how he needed to try to keep his balance but it was extremely hard because he was severely dehydrated, and maintaining balance is crucial when riding a bike. A dehydrated cyclist can easily lose control and end up in an accident. In conclusion, when it comes to the seemingly simple act of riding a bike, you need to take precaution in what might lie ahead on your journey.
1400	7381	3	3	The setting affects the cyclist in many profound ways. It makes him feel a roller - coaster of emotions, including hopeful, determined, alone, and completely exhausted. The desert - like terrain, with its scorching sun and dry air, leaves him feeling very tired and desperately thirsty. His throat is parched, and every pedal stroke becomes a struggle. The bumpy road is hard to pedal over, as his bike rattles and shakes with each movement. The endless stretches of desolate land make him feel as if the next town is years away, and his isolation deepens. While travelling, the cyclist recalls “At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me” (Kurmaskie, @NUM1). The tumbleweeds are a symbol of dry desert death. They roll across his path, reminding the cyclist that he is completely alone in a vast stretch of sand and rocks. Were the snake in the path to poison him, he'd be left there under the beating sun until some other unfortunate cyclist found him. However, later on when he sees the sign for Gary and Wilber’s fish camp in the distance, the hope is restored back to him. His eyes light up, and he straightens his back. He is yet again determined because waiting somewhere near is the water he needs so desperately to keep him alive. In the end, the setting, despite its hardships, helped him to safely feel the hope deep inside of him, giving him the strength to continue his journey.
1401	7382	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example, “not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. The previously flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills with a gentle slope.” This affected the cyclist because he had to pedal harder to go up the hills, and as a result, he got short of breath and his legs started to ache. Another example is, “At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake—it really did look like a diamondback—blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.” This affected the cyclist because he had to wait nervously for the snake to move so it didn't bite him while he crossed it. One last example is, “As I stumbled into a rather modern bathroom and drank deeply from the sink, I had an overwhelming urge to seek out @PERSON1 and Wilber.” This had an effect on the cyclist because he was now happy to have water to quench his thirst and have finally reached his destination, feeling a sense of relief.
1402	7383	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because he saw “short, rolling hills” that seemed to go on endlessly, “tumbleweeds” that blew across his path unexpectedly, and “a ridiculously large snake” coiled menacingly on the road. These sights made him feel that he was not getting anywhere, as the hills slowed his progress, the tumbleweeds were a distraction, and the snake made him pause in fear. All these elements of the setting combined to give the cyclist a sense of being stuck in a difficult and unyielding environment.
1403	7384	3	3	Each area the author entered changed what he felt and experienced. At first, he is lent courage by his surroundings. When he passes through the first town, which is completely abandoned and empty with dilapidated buildings and overgrown weeds, he is still confident he can go on, spurred by the lush green trees that provided patches of shade and the cool rivers that flowed gently around him, which belied the hot sun overhead. They are basically the reason he continued to go on, giving him a sense of calm and determination. Later on during his trek through the desolate, empty desert with its vast stretches of sand and a scorching heat, his bleak surroundings make him feel a deep sense of hopelessness as well as despair. Even in the small details, such as the ghost town with its silent streets or the rusty, useless pump, this is proven. The ghost town brings him the first vestige of despair as it represents a place of lost life, and the useless pump only amplifies it as it symbolizes his lack of resources. The scenario and scenery reflect and alter the author's mood throughout the story, showing how closely his emotions are tied to the environment he is in.
1404	7385	3	3	The rider was affected by two men giving him wrong directions. The rider, trusting their advice, followed their words instead of taking the right way. As a result, he ended up taking the long way through a desolate area. He was getting very thirsty under the hot sun, his throat parched and his lips chapped. He also came face to face with a snake slithering across the path, which made his heart skip a beat. Then he finally found the nearest town, where he got help from the locals, who provided him with water and a place to rest, and he was able to recover from his ordeal.
1405	7386	3	3	Some features of the setting that affect the cyclist are the hills that the cyclist has to go over and the intense heat. The heat, which seems to radiate from the ground and the sky alike, is making the cyclist sweat a lot so he is losing fluids rapidly and he starts to get dehydrated. His body feels weak and his head begins to ache. The hills, with their uneven slopes and rough surfaces, are making him have to work harder with each pedal stroke, and he is getting more tired, his muscles feeling sore and fatigued. These elements of the setting significantly impact the cyclist's physical condition and ability to continue the ride.
1406	7387	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. They significantly affected his confidence, his physical energy, and his mental determination. In the beginning of the essay, the cyclist is extremely confident. This is clearly shown when he boldly says, “The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite have my name written all over them.” This statement shows confidence because he firmly believes he can make it to Yosemite. When he runs out of water under the scorching sun, he begins to rapidly lose confidence and even starts to think he might die. Since he ran out of water because of the intense heat, his energy also drops drastically. You can tell he’s running out of water when he despairingly says, “The water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips.” However, after the loss of water and confidence, he actually shows higher determination to make it to Yosemite. This is human nature because our bodies go into survival mode and become determined to survive. As you can see, the cyclist was affected in many ways by the features of the setting, which ultimately tested his mettle during the journey.
1407	7388	3	3	Many things that the author talks about in the story affect him. One notable example is the old men that give him advice. They tell him that they know a great shortcut, which unfortunately turns into the author's hardest ride ever. Another set of factors that impact him are the heat, the location, the time of day, and the time of the year. In California, specifically in the desert during @DATE1, the environment will subject him to intense heat. In order to beat this sweltering heat, he needs an ample supply of water, which becomes one of his biggest problems as he runs out of it. Another hindering thing he discovers is the abandoned Welch's grape juice building where he sees a vivid picture of a boy drinking a refreshing glass of grape juice, further taunting his thirst. All these combined gave the author a hard time, but in the end, he found a bait and tackle shop where he was finally saved, bringing an end to his arduous journey.
1408	7389	3	3	In the story “Rough Road Ahead Do not exceed posted speed limit,” the cyclist is affected by features of the setting. In the story, it clearly says, “The sun was beginning to beat down.” This quote means that it was getting hotter, and this increasing heat was going to make it much harder for the cyclist to ride. Another quote that states that the features of the setting affects the cyclist is “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” This means that the cyclist is not only going to have to deal with the blistering heat but is also going to have to struggle over hill after hill. Even though they may be small, rolling hills, it still takes a great deal of energy out of you to ride up and down hills repeatedly. A third quote that shows the setting affecting the cyclist is “I got down on my hands and knees, working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength. A tar - like substance oozed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.” This quote means the cyclist is so desperate to get water that he uses his small amount of remaining strength to try and get some. When he finally does get some water, it first comes out as an ooey substance, and then the water comes out extremely hot. In conclusion, these have been clear examples of how the cyclist was affected by features of the setting, which posed numerous challenges during his ride.
1409	7390	3	3	I think that the features of the setting affected the cyclist because of the sharp turns on the road and the overwhelming loneliness of the journey. It is stated in the text, “About forty miles into the pedal, I arrived at the first town.” This long stretch without any sign of civilization clearly shows the isolation the cyclist faced. The sharp turns on the road added to the difficulty of his ride, forcing him to be extra cautious and consume more energy. The combination of these sharp turns and the long - standing loneliness made the journey a tough one for the cyclist. Overall, the features of the setting had a significant impact on the cyclist's experience during his ride.
1410	7391	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist greatly because there was tough and uneven terrain. The blistering heat had affected him greatly as well. He seemed to find that everywhere he went, he could not find any signs of civilization, no buildings or people until he finally reached that one town. In the story, “Rough Road Ahead; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the cyclist quotes, “At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake.” Imagine being on your bike in the middle of the vast desert, not knowing which way to go and only seeing harsher and harsher conditions. This can only fill you with a sense of hopelessness. His situation soon worsened as he almost ran out of water. The sun relentlessly beating down on him and his mind playing tricks on him due to exhaustion also took a toll. So, for the cyclist, the settings had a huge impact on his entire journey, making it a battle of survival and perseverance.
1411	7392	3	3	The features the cyclist experienced during his ride significantly affect his body and mind. At first, the cyclist was on flat ground, where the terrain was smooth and unchallenging. He was calmly drinking plenty of water and felt completely without fear, enjoying the ease of the journey. But when he came to his second town, he became low on water. This unexpected shortage troubled him, but he remained optimistic, firmly telling himself “the next town was only eighteen miles.” After this, the flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills. This change in the landscape started to trouble him. Dehydration began to set in, making every muscle in his body ache, and every hill became a daunting challenge. Once out of water, he sucked on pebbles, hoping it would “take your mind off of thirst.” When he finally made it to his destination, he was so relieved. Everything from dehydration, which severely affects the body, to losing hope mentally affected the cyclist on his ride, highlighting the toll such a journey can take.
1412	7393	3	3	The conditions in the California desert were truly horrible for a cyclist. The temperature was extremely high, soaring well above the normal comfort range, and the humidity was very dry, sucking the moisture out of the air and the cyclist's body. The roads also had a lot of hills, with steep inclines and declines that made the ride arduous. When a cyclist has to use his energy in the scorching heat to go up and down hill after hill, it can be incredibly hard on both the body and the mind. There were also no stops to refill his water along the way. This is extremely bad because the heat, lack of water, and all of his energy expenditure leads to major dehydration, which can cause dizziness, fatigue, and even more serious health issues. The conditions along this trip are not good for a cyclist and can be very dangerous, potentially putting the cyclist's life at risk.
1413	7394	3	3	The setting of the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed posted speed limit” affected the cyclist greatly. He was riding through a desert in June, a time when the sun beats down relentlessly. This meant that the temperature was very high, creating an almost unbearable environment. The narrator even states “I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June,” emphasizing the extreme heat. One prominent feature of the setting that affected him were the hills. These hills were not just small bumps but large, challenging slopes that required a great deal of effort to climb. He even calls them... (It seems the original text was incomplete here, but overall, the combination of the heat and the hills made the cyclist's journey extremely difficult.
1414	7395	3	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist because he knows he’s in the wrong area. As he pedals along, the desolate and unfamiliar surroundings make his unease grow. The cyclist understands that he should have never taken that advice from those old men. He realizes now that their suggestions led him astray. So he was upset and knew he should have taken his own advice. The cyclist had a nagging feeling that he wasn’t supposed to take it that way. He even said he shouldn’t have let them take a peek at his map. Their interference likely caused him to deviate from the right path. So the features of the setting, with its wrong - headedness and the consequences of bad advice, really affect him, making his journey a frustrating and regretful one.
1415	7396	3	3	In ‘Rough Road Ahead’ by Joe Kurmaskie the main character faces a lot of trouble. First, people give him the wrong directions, sending him off on a detour that he didn't anticipate. But, worst of all, he has to travel a lot of miles on a bike through extreme temperatures. The heat beats down on him as he goes up and down hills, pedaling really hard against the inclines and trying to control his speed on the declines. He doesn't even have any cool water. As the character says, “...followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees (kurmaskie @NUM1). That kind of water didn’t help him either. It was so hot that it didn't quench his thirst at all, and he said it tasted like battery acid, making the situation even more miserable. But, finally, he worked up his confidence, pushing through the pain and discomfort, and kept pedaling till he found a fish camp that had a bathroom with a sink that had cool water. The refreshing water gave him new energy. Then he headed off to Yosemite and didn't take anyone's advice, determined to rely on his own judgment from then on.
1416	7397	3	3	The features of the setting significantly affected the cyclist. The setting was a vast desert in California, which made it extremely hot outside, with the scorching sun beating down relentlessly. The hills were not only hard to climb but also steep, testing the cyclist's physical strength. There were dangers all around, such as venomous poisonous snakes lurking in the dry bushes. Not only was the terrain difficult to move around on, with loose sand and rocks, but the path was also thick with overgrown weeds. “@CAPS1 weeds crossed my path, and I even encountered a ridiculously large snake,” the cyclist noted. This made it much harder for the cyclist to reach his destination, as every pedal stroke required extra effort.
1417	7398	3	3	In the towns that the cyclist arrived at, all of them were desolate ghost towns. In the text, the author precisely said, “it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town,” with empty streets, dilapidated buildings, and an eerie silence. It affected the cyclist because, with the towns being completely deserted, there were no shops or people around. As a result, the cyclist couldn't refill his water, which was crucial for his journey in the hot desert. This lack of water supply posed a serious threat to his ability to continue the ride.
1418	7399	3	3	The cyclist was highly motivated to get the job done. When they casually said only “eighteen miles down the road,” he initially thought it was going to take forever. However, he made it because he carefully “conserved his water,” taking only small sips at a time. He also last kept on going, even when the road gradually turned into a rough, rocky gravel road. The uneven surface jolted his body with every turn of the pedals, and it was harder on his legs and water supply. But his determination never wavered, and he finally reached his destination.
1419	7400	3	3	The condition the cyclist is in calls for a great deal of careful preparation. The cyclist was in a sweltering hot desert area with winding roads that seemed to go on forever and steep hills that demanded extra energy. The cyclist needs to have plenty of water to make it to where he is going. As read in the story, the harsh conditions almost caused severe harm to the man who was trying to ride through. The extreme heat and lack of proper resources could easily lead to dehydration and other health issues, highlighting the importance of preparation.
1420	7401	3	3	Setting in “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” really determines how the story turns out. The setting was in deserted areas, the vast desert, and even busy roadways. In the desert, there is an absolute lack of water, making the cyclist quickly become dehydrated. Without water, he felt his strength fading, and he thought he was going to die. In the road areas, the speed limits were extremely high, reaching fifty - five miles per hour. This would not be good since he is doing “a water - depleting @NUM1,” constantly expending energy. When he finds areas that are abandoned, there are water pumps, but the liquid that comes out @MONTH1 be water, but it tastes like “battery acid,” making it undrinkable. Setting can affect a lot in the story. Without this specific setting, the story would be a lot different than it is now, as the challenges and struggles faced by the cyclist are directly related to the unique setting.
1421	7402	3	3	In the story “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist encountered a couple of problems during his journey. There was a little amount of water available, and the roads were tough, with potholes and uneven surfaces. Moreover, there were no cars on the road either, which meant no chance of getting help easily. All these factors caused a great deal of difficulty for the cyclist. As stated on page @NUM1, paragraph one, the first sentence “It didn’t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me down” shows how desperate the situation was. The elements were so harsh on the cyclist that he was on the verge of giving up hope. But luckily, in the end, the cyclist found a small, dilapidated place to stop. There, he got water and also received directions to continue his journey.
1422	7403	3	3	The features of the setting significantly affect the cyclist. He is desperately trying to get water to quench his thirst. When he tried the pump, “a tarlike substance oozed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees”. This kind of water was completely undrinkable. The cyclist doesn't have any water left, so it becomes extremely difficult for him to go on. He is at a high risk of suffering from heat exhaustion due to the lack of water and the scorching heat. As he came to the next town, he found that “the building - abandoned years earlier, had been a Welch’s Grape Juice Factory and bottling plant”. The place was deserted, and there was still no sign of water. He is still determinedly thinking of getting to the next town to get something to drink. That is how the features of the setting, including the lack of drinkable water and the desolate towns, affect the cyclist.
1423	7404	3	3	In the story, there were many features of the setting that affected the cyclist. One that had the greatest impact was that it was dry and hot, and the terrain in the desert was very rough. The dry and hot conditions made his ride extremely hard. For example, the intense heat caused him to lose a large amount of water through sweating on his journey. As a result, he began to feel signs of heatstroke, such as dizziness and weakness. The rough terrain caused an even bigger dilemma. Riding through the rocky and uneven ground made him exert more energy. In the story, his struggle through that terrain causes him to get tired quickly and become even more dehydrated than he already is. These harsh setting features clearly had a significant negative impact on the cyclist's journey.
1424	7405	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist a great deal. First is the emptiness. He has this overwhelming feeling that he is all alone in the vast expanse. There is not a single car, person, or building in sight. The fact that if something were to happen, like a mechanical failure or an injury, then there would be no way of telling anyone. It would be a long while before anyone would be able to find him. This sense of isolation might seem daunting, but I think it actually spurred him on even more. It gave him that extra boost of energy that seems to have come out of nowhere. Then there is the type of environment. The desert environment is very unforgiving. The sun beats down relentlessly, as if he were the only person on the planet. There is a lack of water, and it seems like it hasn't rained in decades. The food sources are scarce. There is a never - ending, @CAPS1 road stretching ahead. The road has many ups and downs, and there are all kinds of animals that await him. The fact that if he stops at all, even for a moment, then a snake could easily bite him and that would be the end of it. These extreme conditions and the harsh environment that is explained in the text have a lot to do with the cyclist and affect him a great deal, constantly testing his will and endurance.
1425	7406	3	3	The setting of this short story has a profound impact on the cyclist. It makes him dehydrated, and unfortunately, he dies as a result. In the setting, he found an abandoned factory. The sight of the desolate and empty factory made him feel hopeless, as if there was no way out of his dire situation. If the setting was elsewhere, rather than this desolate and harsh place, he would have felt different. Since he didn't meet the people of the reserve, he was stuck on the old, rough roads instead of being on better, more passable roads. This shows that the specific setting of the story, with its lack of resources and poor infrastructure, directly led to the cyclist's tragic fate.
1426	7407	3	3	The countries of the setting that had the most effect on the cyclist were the deserts and hills. The author tells us first of his depleting water supply as he journeys through the high deserts of California in June. The scorching sun beats down relentlessly, causing the water in his bottles to warm up quickly. “The hills had a major effect on him because of the intense heat that any desert contains. With this heat, his limited water, and the fact that it was June, it was an extremely challenging situation. I’m sure the author was not a very happy person traveling within his intensive journey. Another misfortune that the author explains is the terrain changing. That road was replaced by a host of rolling hills. “With my own experience, I know these cannot be a worse kind. Tall steep hills are a difficult climb, but at least you can cool off a bit. In his mind too, with the author’s “Short, rolling hills,” the climb gets more miserable with every hill, and the coast down the other side barely cools your bare skin, leaving your parched soul to continue in this deep pain. I’m sure the cyclist was experiencing a burned-out spirit after just a few of those deadly hills. In the end, the combination of deserts and hills truly tested the cyclist's endurance and resolve.
1427	7408	3	3	The features of the setting have affected the cyclist in “Do not exceed posted speed limit” greatly. First, he starts off happy because he’s going to Yosemite national park and he’d gotten shortcut advice that would make his trip shorter. “He rode into the morning with strong legs,” full of excitement and anticipation. Then he got to the first stop. It looked like a buzzing town at one time, but now it was a ghost town. The empty streets and abandoned buildings gave an eerie feeling. So he kept on with plenty of water and thought he could make it to the next stop. The next stop was an old abandoned gas station where the only water was @NUM1. The water was probably not very clean, but he had no choice. He was hitting the water pretty regularly and the hot sun was beating down on him, making him sweat profusely. The next terrain changed and he thought he would die & have the vultures pick his bones because he took advice from old - timers. Then he came to his next stop which seemed to be an old Welch’s grape juice factory. He thought he would die of thirst but he kept on with little water and a hot sun. Next, the hills came and he paced himself for a little time. Then he finally came to a modern - looking place with cool running water with an old man who gave him directions that he gladly took. After that, having assured himself he would die, he was relieved to see the old man there. He would forever on listen to their advice because he made it through the arduous journey, realizing the wisdom in the advice of those with more experience.
1428	7409	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because someone travelling a good distance in California during June will be hot. The June sun in California is extremely intense, shining brightly and radiating a lot of heat. If the cyclist doesn’t have enough water to supply himself in case he gets lost, then the features of the setting are very crucial. Not having enough water can cause someone to dehydrate, which does happen to the cyclist in the essay. “I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.” This statement proves that the cyclist was not in a good state to be lost when the sun is blazing down on him. Also, when you are dehydrated and tired, you might start to see things that aren’t there, but you want to see those things. “I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn’t a mirage, and tried not to get too excited.” It was a good decision that the cyclist didn’t get his hopes up about a building that might not be there. Overall, features of a setting for a cyclist can cause anything to happen, so it is essential to be well - prepared and cautious.
1429	7410	3	3	The features of the setting extremely affect the cyclist in the ride to the meet town. It was bad enough that the cyclist ran out of water, but on top of that, he faced rolling hills and poor road conditions. All of these setting factors played a huge role in the cyclist's performance. “It noted the terrain changing. That way was replaced by those rolling hills.” He also says “tumbleweed around my matt and an incredibly strange snake. It really did look like bad luck blocked the majority of the movement in front of me.” These setting elements made it difficult for the cyclist to perform well because the hills, snakes, and tumbleweed disturbed the cyclist's progress in the ride. He ran out of water and it was hard to gather the energy to continue. The sight of a deadly snake made the cyclist nervous and added to the difficulty of performance. In the end, the challenging setting truly hindered the cyclist's journey, but his perseverance kept him going.
1430	7411	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist was like saying you are old and that you know nothing at all. But it is not true. It means you are older and that your information might not be correct. For example, in the essay when he was on his way to the town, he learned to use his map instead of relying solely on a guy's opinion because the guy was wrong. The setting, with its various terrains and conditions, can mislead even those with experience. The cyclist realized that he needed to trust his own judgment and the reliable tool of the map. By doing so, he was able to navigate through the challenging journey more effectively. In conclusion, the features of the setting taught the cyclist the importance of being self - reliant and not blindly following others' advice.
1431	7412	3	3	The first town the cyclist came to was a desolate ghost town, as if all its inhabitants had suddenly vanished, and there was absolutely nobody to be seen. The next town was no better, lying a full @NUM1 miles down the bumpy road. During the journey, the cyclist faced a series of problems. Some of these included encountering snakes on the path, the alarming fact that he was rapidly running out of water, the steep and arduous hill he had to climb, and the poor condition of the road, which made pedaling a real struggle. Despite these difficulties, he persevered, determined to reach his destination.
1432	7413	3	3	The features of the setting in “DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT” have a notably negative impact on the cyclist. The terrain gradually shifts from being relatively mild and flat to rough and rolling, with uneven surfaces and unexpected slopes. Since the author is not well - acquainted with the layout of this unfamiliar terrain, he starts to have a tough time. He becomes extremely unsure of the correct route and begins to come across various obstacles such as tumbleweed that suddenly roll across his path, snakes slithering nearby, and a severe lack of water. The fact that his water supply is dwindling makes continuing the journey an extremely stressful experience. He is constantly worried that he might die of dehydration before he ever manages to reach the beautiful Yosemite National Park. Finally, through sheer strength and unwavering determination, he reaches a fish camp. There, he is able to refill his water bottles and regain his much - needed strength before he presses on with his journey.
1433	7414	3	3	The features of the setting have a significant impact on the cyclist as he finds himself in a sweltering and bone - dry place with no water at all. He is laboriously pedaling up steep hills, and the strenuous effort makes him even more fatigued. The dude is likely suffering from dehydration, and his physical condition is steadily deteriorating. With each pedal stroke, his exhaustion deepens, and the lack of water exacerbates his discomfort. However, he keeps going, hoping to find a source of relief soon.
1434	7415	3	3	The features of the settings have a profound effect on the cyclist in the passage called “Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”. Cyclists generally are in very good physical shape and can cycle for a long time. Nevertheless, the weather can greatly influence a cyclist's performance, and this is exactly what happened in the passage. The cyclist was initially determined and confident that he could complete this challenging journey. He thought, “I would conserve my water and go inward for an hour or so - a test of my inner spirit.” Even though he had this self - assurance, the features of the setting took their toll. Tumbleweeds frequently crossed his path, and he even encountered a ridiculously large snake. Also, his water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips, leaving him parched. The cyclist became tired and exhausted as the weather and the difficult terrain wore him down. Just like how the weather can change one's ability, for example, when playing basketball outside on a hot and humid day, one can't play as long. Clearly, the features of a setting can have a substantial impact on people.
1435	7416	3	3	During this biker's adventure, the heat and lack of water pose serious threats to him. In this short story, when the cyclist feels lost, he remarks, “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” This clearly suggests that the rider was confronted with the intense and unforgiving heat of the desert during his bike ride. He also states, “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.” This quote shows that not only was he dealing with the scorching heat but also with a severe shortage of water. These facts and quotes vividly illustrate the clear and present threats that this biker faced on his long and arduous bike - ride. Despite these challenges, his spirit remained unbroken as he continued to push forward.
1436	7417	3	3	The settings affect the cyclist in more than one way. These ways include that he is rapidly running out of water, which puts him at a high risk of becoming dehydrated, and he is also unsure of the path he is on. As he is running out of water, he is truly in real trouble. Due to the lack of water, not only might he die, but he also begins to see mirages. His lack of water eventually leads to dehydration, and he becomes extremely uneasy about things. For example, in the text, it clearly says that he staggered into the store. Because he is unsure of the path he is on, he starts to panic a little. Panicking isn't good, especially considering that he is running low on water and is becoming dehydrated. Panic can't help to solve anything. The setting is in a desert, so he needs large amounts of water, which he is running low on. Deserts are extremely hot, which causes a person to become dehydrated or even die. Deserts have little to no shade, and they have rough weather as well as a rough landscape. For instance, their landscape is mostly all hot sand. Therefore, the setting does indeed affect the cyclist, highlighting the crucial impact of the environment on his journey.
1437	7418	3	3	The setting, which is a desert in the sweltering summer, significantly affects the cyclist. For example, she couldn't go as fast. As the text states, “The speed limit was 55 mph. I was doing a water - depleting 12 mph.” This slow speed affected his ability to find water in a timely manner. The setting was also really hot, making it extremely difficult for the cyclist to get the water he needed to keep going. For instance, “I pumped that handle for several minutes, but the water wouldn't cool down.” This shows how the harsh setting has taken a toll on him, and he needs water badly. The desert setting also affects the cyclist's mind. He believed he was seeing mirages and was afraid he was going to swallow a stone because he might hit a bump. The desert setting clearly affects the cyclist's ability to function properly, making his journey in the desert a real struggle.
1438	7419	3	3	In the story “Rough Road Ahead” the features of the setting affect the cyclist. At points, the setting made the author feel deeply depressed and sad, and at other times, happy and joyful. For example, the cyclist was pedaling and pedaling for a long time with nothing in sight. After pedaling for twenty miles, he saw a camp. He was thirsty and his bike had holes. When he tried to pump the water, no water came out. These parts of the setting had a bad effect on the cyclist. The cyclist said “teaches life can be so cruel,” which clearly shows that he had a bad experience if he thought life was being cruel. At some point in the story, the setting had a good effect on the cyclist. He was on the verge of dying of thirst when he saw a bait shop. This put the cyclist in a good mood because he said “my troubles of thirst and all feel behind me.” Different settings in the story gave the cyclist different feelings, demonstrating the diverse impact of the setting on his emotional state.
1439	7420	3	3	The setting affected the cyclist because the terrain you ride on can determine how you ride. For instance, when there are hills and dry weather, as described in the text “flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” The once - easy terrain was now made more difficult and only added to his frustration and his dehydration from having no water. Also, the heat contributed significantly and it was there throughout the whole journey. Sometimes he didn't seem to notice or feel it, but it was constantly sapping his energy. Like when it said, “The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it.” He didn't realize that the heat was taking energy from him, so he drank more water. This affected his ability to carry enough water to complete the ride, showing the detrimental influence of the setting on his cycling experience.
1440	7421	3	3	The cyclist was riding in the hot, arid desert. The intense heat of the desert made him extremely thirsty and less active. As the story vividly describes, “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt.” This shows the harsh conditions the cyclist was facing. The lack of water and the high temperature in the desert severely restricted his physical capabilities and made his journey a challenging one. The desert setting clearly had a significant and negative impact on the cyclist, making it difficult for him to continue his ride comfortably.
1441	7422	3	3	My point of view is that the habit of people to recycle can significantly affect a cyclist. Sometimes, people carelessly throw away trash cans that still have soda inside. Nowadays, cyclists often face such situations. They need to advocate for a change in this behavior. In conclusion, people should save recyclable materials to create new items, which will contribute to a better world for cyclists and everyone else.
1442	7423	3	3	The cyclist attentively listens to the advice of the old - timers. After cycling for a while under the scorching sun, he starts to feel the fatigue seeping into his muscles. After the scenery of the vast desert changes, with no signs of relief in sight, he starts to get mad. He severely criticizes himself for blindly accepting advice from those “old - timers” who haven't left the area and don't truly understand the challenges of this journey. In the end, he realizes he must rely more on his own judgment.
1443	7424	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. With a positive attitude, he always kept his head up high and was firmly determined to make it to his destination. The first problem arose when he came to the “fork of sorts” as he put it. He was desperately in need of water, but when he reached the pumps, he found they were extremely rusty. All he could get out of them was a thick, tarlike substance, followed by blackish water. He cautiously tested it, hoping against hope that it was better than it looked, but unfortunately, it was not. It tasted exactly like battery acid. Even though he was very thirsty, he had no choice but to move on, still searching for another water supply. Another problem that occurred was that, as he was becoming more and more dehydrated by the minute and his balance on the bike was getting unsteady, a huge snake unexpectedly lay across the road. He had to carefully and slowly maneuver around it. Although it was a difficult task, he was successful and continued down the road. The third “obstacle” he ran into was that he was so parched and finally had what seemed like a chance for a drink. To his great disappointment, he found an old, abandoned Welch's grape juice factory. As nerve - wracking and upsetting as it was, he continued to move forward, still determined to reach his destination. He finally came up to a fishing supply store where he was able to take a well - deserved break and have a nice, refreshing drink! Even though the setting was tough, full of teasing challenges, and ironic in many ways, the man made it through and still had a smile on his face, showing his indomitable spirit.
1444	7425	3	3	Features of the setting affect the cyclist because of his endurance. The amount of time he can continuously ride without taking a break, whether it's a short rest or a longer halt, is influenced by the setting. Also, how long he can pedal uphill, struggling against gravity and the terrain, is a test of his endurance. Moreover, the number of bumps he rides over on a rough road can wear him out. And, of course, how long he can ride without a drink of water in a hot and dry setting is crucial. In the end, his ability to endure these challenges determines whether he can complete his journey.
1445	7426	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by the changes that occur while he is riding his bike. At the start, the cyclist began his journey with a big, smiley face, full of enthusiasm. But then, things started to change. The condition of the road became rough, filled with potholes and uneven surfaces, making it difficult to pedal smoothly. The weather was extremely hot, with the sun beating down on him, sapping his energy. Also, there were no clear signals to show him where he was going, and he was constantly unsure if the way he was taking was the correct one. To make matters worse, his bike's flat tire needed to be replaced immediately. Despite all these difficulties, he persevered, learning that he had to adapt to the ever - changing setting to reach his destination.
1446	7427	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist as the rough roads and scorching heat took a toll on him. He was cycling through a desert in June, and the intense heat made the journey extremely arduous. Moreover, the road was bumpy, which meant he had to pedal harder with every stroke. The cyclist had to put in extra effort because the roads were long, but he had the spirit and determination to reach Yosemite. Along the way, he ran into a snake, which was a clear sign that he was getting deeper into the desert. This encounter added to the challenges he faced, but his resolve to reach his destination remained unshaken.
1447	7428	3	3	The setting of the cyclist clearly influences his mood. From the very start to the end, the outside world mirrors the turmoil in his head. This is evident right from the beginning with the reservoir, the empty desert, the hills, the Welch factory, and finally the fish camp. The reservoir is like a haven, a safe ground that contains everything the cyclist needs. He is feeling optimistic, fully ready and eager to follow the advice of the old men. As he first hits a ghost - town, it acts as a foreshadowing of a dangerous future. However, he passes through it with a level head. Then he comes to a water pump that, to his dismay, gives him battery acid. This is where the mood takes a sharp turn. He suddenly describes his setting as “the high deserts of California.” The sun is beating down mercilessly, and his water supply is running low. His hopes start to plummet. When the “flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills,” it perfectly reflects the turmoil in his head. The terrain becomes harder, and the chances of his survival diminish. When he crosses a snake, it suggests even more despair. It finally reaches a climax at the Welch factory. How ironic it is, an abandoned juice factory. This represents lost hope. When he finally arrives at the fish camp, he is deeply relieved to be alive and his spirits are uplifted. The cyclist has made it. It is clear that the setting has had a profound impact on the cyclist.
1448	7429	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. He is riding his bike steadily along the road when he encounters a dilemma. “Wild weeds crossed my path, and a ridiculously large snake blocked the entire pavement in front of me.” He had to come to a sudden stop and was startled by the snake, which not only slowed him down but also freaked him out completely. He was already struggling with thirst and now had to deal with a snake that “really did look like a diamondback.” After this encounter, he sees a building up ahead and discovers that it’s a walrus Grape Juice factory. He thought that it might have some water, but to his disappointment, he realized it was abandoned. Relating to his thirst, before he left the area, he grabbed some pebbles. “I’d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you have left to circulate.” Eventually, he came across a fishing camp and received instructions on how to proceed. This affected him because he finally got to a secure place, got proper directions, and will learn from his mistake of blindly listening to the older men at the beginning. The features of the setting have significantly influenced the cyclist's journey.
1449	7430	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by giving him a glimmer of hope that the finishing line is not far away. As he pedals along, there is nothing in sight - no cars passing by, no buildings in the distance, and no structure of any kind. The vast expanse of empty space around him makes the hope of reaching the end seem both close and yet so far. Despite the desolate surroundings, this hope keeps him going, pushing him forward on his arduous journey. The setting, in its emptiness, both challenges and encourages the cyclist, and it continues to play a crucial role in his cycling experience.
1450	7431	3	3	The author was affected in many ways by the conclusion of his journey. He was completely exhausted from the blazing heat that seemed to sap all his energy. He didn't have much water left, and to make matters worse, he got lost. Water was simply scarce, and as he went farther and farther, it seemed like things would only get worse for him. A man had given him the wrong directions, and as the author said, that man probably hadn't been off his porch in decades. This misinformation led the author into more difficulties, but through it all, he learned valuable lessons about relying on others and the importance of being self - sufficient in challenging situations.
1451	7432	3	3	In the story, the cyclist explains how the road conditions change from good to bad. For example, there's a sign that warns, “Rough road ahead: Do not exceed Posted Speed limit.” Also, the road surface becomes dry and uneven, which makes the cycling experience quite challenging.
1452	7433	3	3	In the story, there are many elements that affected the cyclist in his journey. The first notable feature of the setting that affected him is the old water pump. This dilapidated water pump hardly worked at all, and when it did manage to sputter out some water, the water had a truly horrible, unpalatable taste. The next significant obstacles on his journey were the rough terrain. “Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills,” was how he described it. These hills made pedaling much more strenuous. When the narrator finally finds a building, it turns out to be an abandoned, desolate structure. Eventually, he finds a town and takes a well - deserved rest after his long and arduous journey. He then learns his lesson from before, realizing not to take advice from people he doesn't know.
1453	7434	3	3	Well, the features were rough desert - like features with sandy stretches and rocky patches. For a cyclist, this kind of terrain is extremely difficult. For example, there is a severe lack of water sources, and when he did manage to find some water, it had a battery - acid flavor. These factors affected the cyclist in a major way, making his ride extremely challenging and uncomfortable.
1454	7435	3	3	'Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. The previously flat road was gradually replaced by short, rolling hills' (Kurmaskie @NUM1). When the cyclist realized the terrain was becoming more difficult, he became more ignorant and hopeless. 'Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt; and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn't been off their porch in decades caused me to laugh. It was a sad, hopeless laugh' (@NUM1). He wasn't going to die, but even though he was struggling, he made a big deal out of it. He kept muttering to himself in frustration. Unfortunately, the man lived. He would live on, telling people not to listen to old men. 'Never accept travel advice from a collection of old timers who haven't left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office' (@NUM3). He was on a long, hot road, and he started taking stabs at the old men. 'I made a mental note to change that paragraph' (@NUM4). The man was not forced to take direction from the old man. In his selfishness to cut back on the trip and avoid only a few miles of rough terrain, heat, and dehydration caused him to be hopeless, angry, and he felt sorry for himself.
1455	7436	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One way is that the cyclist is traveling through the high deserts of California in June, where the sun beats down mercilessly and the heat is intense. Another effect said in the story was that the cyclist made it to a town where the water pump was all rusted. With all his strength, he worked the handle, and first, a tarlike substance came out, followed by brackish water which he couldn't drink as it was foul - tasting and likely unhygienic. Also, the cyclist had been hitting his water bottles regularly to combat the heat, but his water supply was dwindling fast. Lastly, the old - timers said the towns would be close when really they were far apart, which left the cyclist exhausted and in a difficult situation.
1456	7437	3	3	There are many things that can affect a cyclist's journey. This cyclist seemed to have bad luck. He starts off mentioning that he is planning a trip to Yosemite and the men sitting on the porch that hear this give him a tip. The cyclist is pretty confident in what they tell him, so he follows their suggestions. He ends up getting lost in the vast expanse of the desert. The cyclist is also travelling in the “high deserts of California in June.” That means that he is travelling in summer with dry, scorching air. When he gets to the first “town” he sees, he can't get the water he needs to rehydrate his body as the place seems deserted. He also runs into a venomous snake while travelling through the desert, which makes him extremely cautious and slows him down. Because it’s hot, and he’s tired, he begins to see mirages that mess with his mind and affect his judgment. All of these features cause the cyclist to take one long, tiring journey through the desert. These features also taught him the lesson to not take advice from old men who have not left their porch because their information might be out of date.
1457	7438	3	3	Well the setting was that the little boy was on his shiny bike, pedaling along the road. He meets this old man sitting on a rickety bench by the roadside and the man tells him about a short cut. So he took this road, which seemed narrow and overgrown at first. I guess something went wrong as the path soon became rough and full of potholes, and he ended up getting stuck in a muddy patch and couldn't find his way back to the main road easily. This experience taught him to be more cautious when taking shortcuts suggested by strangers.
1458	7439	3	3	In the “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affect the main characters, the cyclist. After he first journeyed from the house where he met the old men, he rode over much flat desert terrain, where the intense sun beat down relentlessly and dehydrated him quickly. The dry, arid air made every breath a struggle. Soon, though the terrain changed. “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” These hills were not only a physical challenge but also a mental one as he has to maneuver down the hills while dehydrated and ready to collapse from exhaustion. The uneven surface of the hills made it difficult to maintain balance and control, further testing his cycling skills and endurance.
1459	7440	3	3	Hot, dry, desolate - all are the features of the setting that affect the cyclist. First, the hot days with not a lot of water to drink. The sun beats down mercilessly, and he will get dehydrated rapidly. Also, there is no one around to help him if he gets lost. Joe Kurmaskie explains “there was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” The vast emptiness of the place makes him feel extremely isolated. Finally, a large, menacing snake came along on the road. So he had to move around it carefully, which made him even more nervous and wasted his precious energy. All these factors combined made his journey a real ordeal.
1460	7441	3	3	Setting is one of the most important needs for a cyclist. If the terrain or weather are bad, it can pose significant challenges. For example, the hotter it is for a cyclist, the more quickly he will get dehydrated. A rough terrain with lots of bumps and slopes can make it difficult to pedal and control the bike. Bad weather like strong winds or heavy rain can also make the journey extremely uncomfortable and dangerous. In such conditions, a cyclist needs to be well - prepared and cautious to ensure a safe and successful ride.
1461	7442	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the cyclist faces a challenging problem, which is also the problem faced by the author. For example, I notice the terrain changing. The initially flat road was gradually replaced by short, rolling hills. After I had pedaled over the first few inclines, there loomed a large highway. That shows when he arrived at this point, the road conditions were not good, and the large highway presented a significant hurdle, like a high jump to overcome. This difficult setting made the cyclist's journey much more arduous.
1462	7443	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in a severe way. It is so incredibly hot outside that he could have easily passed out and died due to heat exhaustion. Also, he suddenly saw a snake slithering across the path, which scared him to death. However, he managed to muster his courage and passed the snake. Then, he spotted a building that could probably help him. But upon closer inspection, he found it was abandoned. It turned out to be an old Welch factory. As he continued to cycle further down the road, he saw a fish - related place. He went to the bathroom there to get some water. Then, somebody asked him where he was going and tried to mislead him. But he still had his map in hand, so he decided that he was going to use it instead of listening to other people, relying on it to guide him to safety.
1463	7444	3	3	In the story “Rough Road Ahead,” a cyclist takes some outdated information from a couple of old guys. As he went along, following their directions, he soon found out that their directions were outdated and, at certain points, dangerous. Also, the setting didn't help him at all. He was in a vast desert filled with ghost towns, and the scorching heat made the situation worse. It didn't help him believe that he was going to make it out alive. For example, in the story when he reaches the fork in the road, it describes that he found “several rusty pumps,” and “one ramshackle shed.” This probably didn't help him because he didn't have a lot of water left, and it was really hot. He was losing confidence in himself that he would get out. Moreover, the rusty pumps meant he couldn't get any good - quality water. Also, in the story, it says that “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” This setting affected him deeply because at this part of the story, he has cycled for a long while, has no water left, and is getting very exhausted and almost has no energy. It also decreased his hopes because it was described as an almost empty desert that he was stuck in, and he thought he wouldn't get out of the desert alive. In conclusion, in the story “Rough road ahead,” the setting in the story didn't help the cyclist in his hope or confidence of getting out because the setting was very abandoned, and it was extremely hot. The desolate desert environment was a major obstacle to his journey.
1464	7445	3	3	Well, since the cyclist is in a vast and arid desert and is out of water, he is probably extremely unhappy. The so - called “ghost towns” he encounters are just empty, dilapidated places that aren't really a boost of confidence either. The sight of these abandoned towns only adds to his sense of desolation. The rugged hills along the way made him angry too. Each steep incline and rough descent required a great deal of effort from him. However, the heat affected him the most. The sweltering desert heat was like a relentless enemy, sapping his energy and making every pedal stroke a struggle. All these factors combined made his cycling journey in the desert a truly miserable experience.
1465	7447	3	3	The features of the land affect the cyclist in many ways. For example, the first two buildings that he came to were completely abandoned. When he approached them with hope of finding food or water, he was deeply disappointed. He couldn't get any food or water from these desolate structures. Also, he noticed that the terrain was gradually changing from a flat expanse to rolling hills. This change in terrain put more strain on his legs. With each uphill climb, his leg muscles ached, and his energy was rapidly depleted. Finally, the land was hot and dry. The scorching sun beat down on him, and the lack of moisture in the air made him dehydrate quickly. His throat was parched, and his body was weakening. This is how the features of the land affected the cyclist, making his journey a difficult and challenging one.
1466	7448	3	3	In this story, the setting significantly affects the cyclist in numerous ways. He attempts to get directions, but the people he asks seem really confused and clearly don't know what they're talking about. This shows that you must be cautious about whom you seek directions from. Then, he desperately needs a drink, but his attempt doesn't go well at all because the water he finds ends up tasting horribly like battery acid. After that, the cyclist starts on his way again and encounters the same difficulty on the road. The road is in such a bad condition that he has to ride slower than the speed limit. At this point, he feels like he's on the verge of death. Fortunately, he finds a bathroom and drinks water from the sink, which gives him a bit of relief and allows him to continue his journey, albeit with caution due to the harsh setting.
1467	7449	3	3	The features of the setting have a notable impact on the cyclist in a few distinct ways. Early in the essay, the cyclist states that he “enjoyed the serenity of an early - summer evening and some lively conversation with these old codgers.” He was truly relishing the moment and the pleasant atmosphere around him. However, the mood changes rapidly to doubt when he disregards the advice of the “collection of old - timers who haven't left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office.” Moreover, his depleting water source quickly becomes a major cause for concern. This doubt is soon followed by relief when he sees the sign for Gary and Wilber’s Fish camp and is able to get a drink from the bathroom faucets. After that, relief is succeeded by satisfaction as he “promises himself right then that he'd always stick to [the very good map] in the future,” realizing the importance of reliable guidance in such a challenging setting.
1468	7450	3	3	The setting had a detrimental effect on the author in many ways. One significant reason is that the intense heat of the setting causes the author to become severely dehydrated. Dehydration occurs when your body begins to shut down gradually due to a lack of sufficient water. The setting also affects him by draining his confidence and compelling him to search desperately for water. When he says, “I hung my head,” it clearly indicates that he was deeply depressed. This incident proves that no matter who or what guidance you follow, there is always a possibility of facing life - threatening circumstances such as death. Therefore, this is how the author was affected by the harsh setting he was biking in, highlighting the vulnerability one can experience in an unforgiving environment.
1469	7451	3	3	I think the settings made it a little more challenging to not give up. The difficult conditions presented by the settings constantly tested the cyclist's willpower. For example, the rough terrain and extreme weather made each pedal stroke a struggle. However, this also shows that you do better in life when faced with challenges. Overcoming the difficulties posed by the settings can lead to personal growth and a stronger sense of self - confidence. Just like the cyclist, when we persevere through tough situations, we learn valuable lessons and become more resilient. In the end, the experience in these challenging settings can be a stepping - stone to achieving greater things in life.
1470	7452	3	3	The setting significantly affects the cyclist because it is in a warm and dry climate. This causes him to sweat profusely, and as a result, he needs to drink a large amount of water to stay hydrated. When no one else is around, it becomes even more difficult for him to continue his journey. There is a constant nagging thought that he might be on the wrong path, and with no one available to tell him otherwise, he has to rely solely on his own judgment. With only abandoned buildings in sight, if there are any at all, water is nowhere to be found. This makes the journey extremely tiring and physically straining on his body. If the setting were different, say a cooler and more populated area, this story would not have been as traumatic. The harsh setting truly adds a layer of difficulty and danger to the cyclist's journey, making it a memorable and arduous experience.
1471	7453	3	3	THERE ARE VAST FEATURES IN THE SETTING THAT AFFECTS THE CYCLIST. IN SEVERAL WAYS, ONE PROMINENT FEATURE WOULD BE THE “SUN BEGINNING TO HEAT DOWN”. AS THE SUN POURED ITS INTENSE HEAT, IT MADE THE CYCLIST SWEAT PROFUSELY, BECOMING HOT AND THIRSTY. THE OVERWHELMING THIRSTINESS FORCED HIM TO USE HIS LIMITED SUPPLY OF WATER, GRADUALLY DRAINING HIS RESOURCES. SO THE SUN WAS ABLE TO AFFECT HIM IN A COUPLE OF WAYS. ANOTHER FEATURE THAT CAUSED SOME PROBLEMS FOR THE CYCLIST WERE THE RUN - DOWN “GHOST TOWNS” THAT CONSISTED OF “RAM - SHACKLE SHEDS” AND “SEVERAL RUSTY PUMPS”. THESE DESERTED AND DILAPIDATED FEATURES LED THE CYCLIST TO FEEL A DEEP SENSE OF HOPELESSNESS. AS WELL AS THE PROBLEM THAT THEY DIDN'T HAVE ANY USABLE WATER FOR HIM TO REFILL WITH AS HE BECAME DEHYDRATED. OBSTACLES SUCH AS “TUMBLEWEEDS” AND “PAVEMENT BLOCKING SNAKES” ALSO PLAYED A ROLE IN AFFECTING THE CYCLISTS AS HE MOVED ON THE “@NUM1 ROAD” ONLY DOING “12 MPH”. ONE FINAL, AND LAST OBSTACLE WAS THE TERRAIN HE RODE ON. THE OBSTACLE BEING A “LONG CROPPING HILL”. THIS MADE THE CYCLIST EXHAUSTED, AS HE USED MUCH ENERGY TO CLIMB THE HILL, STRUGGLING WITH EVERY PEDAL STROKE. ALL THESE SETTING FEATURES TOGETHER POSED A FORMIDABLE CHALLENGE TO THE CYCLIST'S JOURNEY.
1472	7454	3	3	Topic: The features of the setting affect the cyclist. The features of the setting that affect a cyclist or the major problems that a cyclist encounters are some rough roads, the inspection of the bike to ensure it's in proper working condition, putting on necessary safety equipment like a helmet and knee - pads, and not exceeding the posted speed limit. For a cyclist to be doing all this, I don't think there won't be any features of the setting that affect a cyclist. For a cyclist to maintain the speed limit of @NUM1 or deal with a water - depleting @NUM2: sometimes life can feel so cruel. At some point, tumbleweeds are caused by too much of speed, but if they are using the necessary equipment, they won't get seriously injured. Forget that old saying about never taking candy from strangers. No, a better piece of advice for the solo cyclist would be “Never accept a ride from a stranger without proper caution”. Overall, the cyclist has to be vigilant against both the setting features and external risks.
1473	7455	3	3	The features of the setting really affected the cyclist. The author wrote of rough terrain and isolation. “Flat roads were replaced by short, rolling hills; tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake”. After reading this information and the detailed descriptions, I inferred that the author was alone in the vast desert with awful conditions. The lack of any human presence and the harsh natural elements added to the sense of isolation. I could also infer a tone of resentment. He seemed to wish he hadn't taken the “shortcut” that landed him in the desert. The hot weather was another factor that affected the author. Trying to keep his balance in a dehydrated state was extremely difficult. He seems to have not really planned how long the ride would be and how to conserve water properly. The rough terrain, desolation, and hot temperatures all combined seemed to have a significant and negative impact on the cyclist / author, making his journey a real struggle.
1474	7456	3	3	The features of the setting that most affected the cyclist were the water pump, the Welch’s Factory, and the fish camp. The pump affected him because he was very thirsty, and at first, he thought he would have a chance to get water. He was excited and he pumped the water out, as he wrote, “with all my strength”. Unfortunately, he had to go on thirsty, (a very risky thing to do while cycling) because “it had the flavor of battery acid”. Next, the Welch’s Factory affected him by killing his spirits. He was already feeling bad from the lack of water, but seeing the mocking, ironic image of “a sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice”, made him feel even worse. It vividly reflected his own desperate situation, all the refreshments in the past, and now there was nothing left. I had a similar experience once. I am allergic to peanuts. One time, on a long car trip, I had slept through lunch, so I was starving, and we were on a long stretch of highway with no buildings to be seen. After two hours, we finally saw a sign for a nearby restaurant: @CAPS2’s peanut shade. I nearly cried. The last thing that affected the cyclist was the fish camp. It saved his life. He arrived and “drank deeply from the sink”. He was so happy that he wanted to kiss the owners of the camp. This also relates to the car trip I mentioned, because after hours of hunger, we found a very good sushi bar, and sushi is my favorite food. These setting features had a profound and diverse impact on the cyclist's journey, from despair to relief.
1475	7457	3	3	The story that I am going to talk about the most was about what happened in the story. I wasn't sure at first, but the name of the story sounded pretty good. If I was in the story, I wouldn't be in a good situation because the story is really crazy. It would be really challenging to start and write about it. However, the story seems to have a lot of interesting elements that could potentially draw readers in. Even though it's a bit wild, it might have a unique charm. Overall, despite the initial uncertainty, I'm looking forward to exploring and sharing more about this story.
1476	7458	3	3	In the setting they are in Lodi, California, which is a part of the arid desert. The harsh desert environment affects the cyclist really badly. For one, the intense heat beats down relentlessly. Second, the sweltering heat is making him extremely thirsty and he is quickly running out of his limited supply of water. Then, to make matters worse, he is in an area with no nearby towns, so he can't get any more water. Clearly, the setting has a significant and detrimental impact on the cyclist.
1477	7459	3	3	The cyclist is most severely affected by the intense heat. He is pushing himself, exerting all his energy and willpower to reach Yosemite. The blazing hot sun and the lack of water make him incredibly tired and cause him to use his energy in an inefficient way. At one point, he has to carefully determine whether the building he sees is a mirage. It is so swelteringly hot that his mind could easily be playing tricks on him, which further hampers his progress and morale.
1478	7460	3	3	The conditions that the cyclist was in were very horrible. As he continued on his ride, the heat became more and more oppressive, and he got hotter and hotter. He was desperately hoping to find water after finishing off his last bit. Taking advice from an old man was the last decision he made, perhaps in the hope that it would lead him to some relief from the harsh conditions.
1479	7461	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because sometimes, it made him lose some courage and optimism. “and the growing realization that I could drop from a heatstroke on a gorgeous day” This is a clear example of how he lost courage. He initially wanted to be brave and be strong. But the scorching hot day and all the sweat pouring from his body made the author feel physically and mentally weak. “I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean, leaving only some expensive outdoor gear” This is an example of how the author lost some optimism. He didn't want to die, but he kept telling himself that he was going to. He should have thought to himself that he was going to make it, but the setting was just too rough. There were bumps along his ride, and the sun beating down increased his thirst. As a result, he became less courageous and less optimistic, which made the journey even more challenging.
1480	7462	3	3	The features of his journey are cruel. “Rolling hills” make him work much harder to get over them. The more effort he expends, the more he sweats, and therefore he needs an adequate supply of fluids. However, the lack of water he has does not help at all. Poisonous plants don't really bother him if he leaves them alone. The condition of the roads adds to the difficulty presented by the hills. The rough roads force him to work hard to get through and then over the hills. So, this cyclist is really having a tough time on his journey.
1481	7463	3	3	Some of the features of the setting that affected the cyclist were the rough terrain and the hills. As described in the reading, “a flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.” These hills would gradually wear a person out, especially without a good supply of water. Moreover, the cyclist was also unsure in what direction he was travelling, which added to the challenge. And another factor that affected him was the hot June weather in California, which made the already strenuous ride even more difficult. All these elements combined to make the cyclist's journey a tough one.
1482	7464	3	3	Throughout “Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the features of the setting significantly affect the cyclist. The cyclist was traveling through a very dry area in the deserts of California in June, where it was extremely hot, dry, and dangerous. There was no water to be found, and the terrain was rough and bumpy, filled with uneven ground and small rocks. The speaker stated, “At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake...” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The cyclist faced land blockings and dangerous animals, which caused him to slow down a little bit. It was extremely hot out in the setting he was in. The speaker also stated, “Rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, the growing realization that I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June...” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The cyclist was experiencing the high temperatures of the setting and witnessed the intense features of the harsh desert environment. In conclusion, the setting's features had a profound impact on the cyclist's journey.
1483	7465	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. He becomes delusional, as evidenced when he said that if he were lucky, one of the stones would be lodged in his throat. This shows the extreme mental stress he is under. Also, he is dehydrated because he has used all of his water and is having to push hard to make it to the next town. The lack of water and the physical exertion are taking a toll on his body and mind, making his situation increasingly dire. In conclusion, the setting's features are severely hampering the cyclist's well - being and progress.
1484	7466	3	3	The features of the setting started out easy, like a flat road with cool lines to keep him cool and not hot. The flat surface allowed the cyclist to ride smoothly, and the cool lines, perhaps in the form of shade or a gentle breeze, provided a comfortable environment. Then it got harder. There was a lack of water, the road was no longer flat, and snakes appeared. The cool pines that might have offered some shade and a sense of calm were gone. This change in the setting made the cyclist's journey much more challenging and dangerous. In conclusion, the shift in the setting's features had a significant negative impact on the cyclist's ride.
1485	7467	3	3	"In the story ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Limit,"" the features of the setting greatly affected the cyclist. As he was riding, he was passing through a desert during June, an extremely hot month. There is not much water present in a desert (which is part of the very definition of a desert), and so, particularly in the even - hotter - than - normal June sun, he was at high risk of running out of water. Had he been driving through, say, a forest with its lush vegetation and natural water sources or perhaps rolling grasslands with small streams, he might not have been in such danger. In those areas, he could have merely looked for a river or creek for water if he was desperate. Another thing that might have affected the cyclist would have been the psychological impact of the desert on his mind. When people think of deserts, they often think of dry, barren wastelands, complete with buzzards circling in the sky and maybe a dead cowskull, as commonly depicted in movies. Deserts are intimidating and have a bad reputation. So, as he was riding through and was low on water, thoughts of death, like how he was “going to die and the birds would pick (him) clean,” ran through his now - terrified head. Had he been in a city with its infrastructure and people or in rolling farmland with its human settlements, he might not have been as terrified. There are people in those places, and places to be safe there, but in his desert, he had neither, allowing him to give way to despair. Setting does a lot to influence stories, so it is important to keep that in mind when reading, as it can greatly shape the experiences and emotions of the characters."
1486	7468	3	3	"The features of the setting affected the cyclist as he found himself out of water in a desolate, desert - like environment. For most of his journey, there was no one around, leaving him entirely on his own. In the story, the cyclist described his struggle when he said, ""I got down on my hands and knees, working the water handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength. A tar - like substance oozed out followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees."" This incident affected him deeply because before reaching this point in his trip, he had been drinking a lot of water to stay hydrated. As he was almost out of water, he desperately needed to refill but had no proper place to get more. This challenging aspect of the setting clearly had a significant impact on the cyclist's journey."
1487	7469	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in multiple ways, such as getting dehydrated, getting tired, and getting lost. After the cyclist had been on the road for a considerable while, he had drank almost all of his water. However, he still had a long way to go before reaching his destination. He intended to find a place to stop and pick up more water, but unfortunately, there was nothing around for miles. He also got tired as he was constantly exposed to the harsh sun, had barely any water to keep his energy up, and didn't know where he was going. Another problem was that he was lost. There were no cars passing by, no buildings in sight, and no people around. So, if he were to get hurt or sick, no one would have been able to come to his aid. In conclusion, being dehydrated, tired, and getting lost were the features of the setting that affected the cyclist.
1488	7470	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he runs out of water while trying to traverse the challenging terrain. In the setting, there is a desert in California that he is attempting to cross on a bike. As he mentions, ""I was travelling through the high deserts of California."" The word ""high"" here indicates that there were hills, which would make the journey even more arduous. Later in the story, the cyclist said, ""Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills."" When the speaker uses the word ""replaced,"" he is clearly showing a change of terrain. Another feature of the setting is the tumbleweed that he encounters as he crosses other hills. He stated, ""Tumbleweeds crossed in path."" The presence of tumbleweeds made him vividly remember that he was in the desert, as tumbleweeds are strongly associated with deserts. This brought up disturbing thoughts of dying and being picked apart by birds. Overall, these features of the setting significantly impacted the cyclist's journey."
1489	7471	3	3	Well, if the setting relates to the theme, then the story will make perfect sense. For instance, if it's a sad story and the day is an ugly, rainy one, then the mood of the setting matches the story's tone very nicely. The dreary weather can enhance the sense of sadness in the story, making the emotions more palpable to the reader. This is how the setting makes the story better, by creating a harmonious connection between the backdrop and the underlying message.
1490	7472	3	3	If it is hot out, you can dehydrate quickly. Moreover, if the terrain is long and hilly, you use a great deal of energy. This kind of environment can be rough on your equipment, body, and mind. So, make sure you dress appropriately and carry lots of water to stay hydrated. Next, ensure that your tires are properly inflated and all your equipment is working in good condition. Then, plan a good route where you can stop at places to catch your breath and refill your water supply. Also, make sure you eat well because food provides a lot of energy to keep you going. By taking these precautions, you can better handle the challenges posed by such a setting.
1491	7473	3	3	"In the setting of the essay; ""Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit."" had a profound impact on the cyclist. It made him even more resolute to finish because the terrain was extremely difficult to ride through. For instance, ""At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake - it really did look like a diamondback - blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me. I carefully eased past, struggling to keep my balance in my dehydrated state."" The author fully elaborates on how no matter how severe the obstacles he encounters, he keeps trying to move forward. The challenging terrain affects the character by sustaining his determination. This phenomenon occurs to many people in their sports. For example, in football, players take any problems they face and use them as motivations to push themselves harder to complete the game. This shows that difficult situations can inspire individuals to persevere and achieve their goals."
1492	7474	3	3	"In the story, the cyclist was significantly affected. The cyclist was influenced by the directions given by the old man. It was stated that the old man provided the directions to assist him, claiming it was a shortcut. I believe the cyclist thinks the directions are outdated. The reason I think this is that in the second sentence of the story, it says, ""never accept travel advice from a collection of old - timers who haven't left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office."" The features of the setting also affected him because he had to ride up and down through what he regarded as rough, uneven terrain. This rough terrain made his journey more arduous and tiring. That is what I think affected the cyclist, and it clearly shows how external factors can have a major impact on a person's experience."
1493	7475	3	3	"In Joe Kurmaskie’s “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”, the features of the setting affect the cyclist a great deal. The terrain and the heat play significant roles. First, the terrain affects the cyclist. It has a major impact because there are numerous hills. The text says, ""With what I believed was my last burst of energy, I maneuvered down the hill."" In order to go down a hill, one must have first gone up a hill. So, having to expend the energy to pedal up these steep hills affected the cyclist greatly, leaving him exhausted. Next, the heat affected the cyclist. I know this because the text says “and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke.” This clearly proves that it is extremely hot outside. The heat would affect the cyclist because it prevents a person from functioning at their peak ability, quickly draining their energy. That is how the features of the setting in ‘Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit’ affect the cyclist. The terrain affects the cyclist due to the challenging hills, and the heat because it rapidly depletes your energy."
1494	7476	3	3	In “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not exceed posted speed limit,” the features of the setting affect the cyclist in numerous ways. One way it impacts him is that the towns were old and deserted. In the story, he said, “This place might have been a thriving little spot… but at that moment, it was a ghost town.” As a result, he could not obtain any water or get any directions, which made his journey even more difficult. The features of the setting also affected the cyclist because the roads were bumpy and there were many hills. “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” Consequently, the cyclist had to exert all his strength to maneuver over the hills, which was physically demanding. The third reason why the setting affected the cyclist was the weather and the fact that it was a desert. “I was traveling through the deserts of California in June.” He was hot, sweaty, and extremely thirsty. He was also tired and desperately seeking water and a town that was not deserted. The features of the setting affected the cyclist in “Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed Posted Speed Limit,” through the rough roads, deserted towns, and the lack of water, all of which combined to make his cycling journey a real struggle.
1495	7477	3	3	In the story “Rough road ahead do not exceed posted speed limits,” the setting is a long, desolate road with “no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” The cyclist could be severely affected by the rough, uneven road that he has to ride down. The rough surface of the road makes it difficult for him to maintain a steady speed and balance. Every bump and pothole on the road jolts him, causing discomfort and potentially slowing him down. This challenging road condition can also put extra strain on his body and the bicycle, increasing the risk of fatigue and mechanical problems. Overall, the rough road in this desolate setting has a significant impact on the cyclist's journey.
1496	7478	3	3	In the essay by Joe Kurmaskie, he vividly describes his experience of bike riding in the vast desert. The unique setting affects the cyclist in numerous ways throughout the writing. At first, Kurmaskie is full of confidence as he listens intently to a group of old codgers sharing their advice with him. The setting is calm and happy, with a gentle breeze blowing. Kurmaskie writes that he “enjoyed the serenity of an early - summer evening”, where the soft glow of the setting sun painted the desert in warm hues. The word “serenity” truly gives the effect of calm and peace. However, as Kurmaskie proceeds further into his journey, the setting undergoes a significant change. He is troubled by the dilapidated “ramshackle shed, several rutsy pumps, and a corral that couldn't hold the lamest mule” in a desolate ghost town that he encounters in the desert. Even later, the terrain becomes more challenging, and he sees a sign stating “Rough Road Ahead”. Kurmaskie’s confidence gradually turns into even deeper doubt and worry as his water supply steadily runs low. Finally, Kurmaskie sees a sign for a fish camp. Here, his hope returns as he finds a “rather modern bathroom” where he can stop to get a much - needed drink. As the setting changes, Kurmaskie’s confidence is first followed by determination and then finally relief, showing how greatly the desert setting influenced his emotional state during the ride.
1497	7479	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in a negative way because he is in a desert - like place during the scorching summer. With a scarce water supply and few places to refill, he could easily become extremely tired. The arid environment saps his energy rapidly. I would never have asked old people for directions. He should have asked someone who was in charge of a store because those people are often asked for directions and are more likely to give accurate and useful information. Also, he was in great danger as there were snakes in the area. He could have died if that snake had bitten him or, as he said, from “heatstroke”. The harsh desert setting with its lack of resources and potential hazards clearly had a detrimental impact on the cyclist's journey.
1498	7480	3	3	The story begins as the author, an enthusiastic cyclist, has taken directions from several very old men to reach his bike - ridden destination of Yosemite National Park. He starts out confident enough, with a spring in his step and a gleam in his eye. Then he reaches the first town the gentlemen described. It is a ghost town, a place filled with empty buildings and a sense of abandonment. It amuses the author, and still believing he’s perfectly fine, he sets out again. This time, he arrives at a place with “One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps and a corral that couldn't hold in the lamest mule”. The dilapidated state of this place is a clear sign of trouble. It is at this point that the author starts to worry as his water supply is alarmingly low. He proceeds past rolling hills that seem to go on forever, slithering snakes that send shivers down his spine, tumbleweeds that roll aimlessly across the road, and different land - marks. Each one rips his confidence and excitement to shreds. Especially the juice factory, as the author is currently very dehydrated and losing all hope. The sight of the factory, which could have been a source of refreshment, only serves to remind him of his desperate situation. Finally, he arrives at the water he seeks in the form of “Gary Wilber’s fish camp”. He refreshes himself and his dried - out hope. Each time the author passed a land - mark, his confidence took a beating. And even though he was in dire physical health, not having any hope for his sunny breezy vacation can drain a person even more from the inside out, highlighting the powerful impact of the journey on his mental and physical well - being.
1499	7481	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist negatively because he was in the desert in the sweltering summer. With little water and no accessible places, like stores or water fountains, to get a drink, he was in a precarious situation. For example, he says “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind”. This statement clearly explains how his setting affected him because he had nowhere to go or get a drink. The vast expanse of the desert with its barren landscape left him isolated and vulnerable. The lack of resources in the setting made his journey extremely difficult and dangerous. That is my reason why the cyclist's settings were negative, as they severely hampered his ability to complete his ride safely and comfortably.
1500	7482	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in bad ways. The rocky road, full of uneven stones and bumps, and the steep hills made him pedal harder with every turn. His legs ached as he struggled to make his way up the inclines. The old people, perhaps not fully aware of the current conditions, made him go through the rocky way. The blistering temperature from the desert made him incredibly thirsty, and he ran out of water fast. He said “When I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid”, indicating the poor quality of the little water he had left. The heat was so intense that it could have killed him at any time. For example, “Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from the heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June”. This shows the extreme physical stress he was under. This ride this man took to Yosemite was a very dangerous ride, with the unforgiving desert setting posing numerous threats to his well - being and making the journey a true test of his endurance.
1501	7483	3	3	"The setting can greatly affect the cyclist. The specific place can change what happens and how it happens. For example, if the story had taken place in Alaska, the cyclist would not have had, ""Wide rings of sweat circling my shirt."" Instead, they would have been constantly fighting off hypothermia. The setting is very important because it affects all of the details in the writing, making the story's atmosphere and events unique to that particular place."
1502	7484	3	3	At first, the terrain was fine and he felt confident. But when he reached the first town, it looked exactly like one of those ghost towns in the movies, with dilapidated buildings and an eerie silence. The next town didn't come up when he was told it would. The terrain was that of a harsh desert, with no water for miles in any direction. But he stayed determined. And he finally made it to some water though, a small oasis that provided him with the much - needed relief.
1503	7485	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” For example, he spots a “ramshackle shed” in the desolate area and immediately tries to find water there. It affected him significantly, because it says, “I got down on my hands and knees, working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength. A tarlike substance oozed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.” The quote shows that he was so determined to find water and perhaps anything that could quench his thirst or help him in his difficult situation.
1504	7486	3	3	The setting affected the cyclist by depriving him of hydration and gradually weakening him. The large, steep hills and rough, bumpy roads ebbed away every bit of his strength and wore him down. The narration states, “Over one long, crippling hill” (kurmaskie @NUM1). This word choice reflects the writer’s feeling about his adventure. Words like “long” and “crippling” clearly show that the trip was a truly horrible experience for the cyclist.
1505	7487	3	3	Pride, determination, relief – all are things that the cyclist felt during his long bike ride. First, the cyclist started off riding on fresh legs and with good directions. But after a while down the road, he started to doubt the old men. As he thought, “a diary with my last entry in place of old men, their wisdom, and their sense of direction, I made a mental move to change it.” After feeling that the direction might be rough, he rode out of pride to reach his destination. Next, the rider had great determination to get to his destination and did many things. For instance, “I gathered a few pebbles and stocked them in my mouth to take my mind off of thirst.” This quote shows that he would do almost anything to keep going. Finally, the cyclist was fatigued when he arrived at the @CAPS1 shop. He then knew the old men were right and that he would reach his destination. As the text says, “As I stumbled into a rather modern bathroom and drank deeply from the sink.” This quote shows he was not only polite naturally to get water but also relieved to know the men were right, and his long - awaited journey had finally come to an end.
1506	7488	3	3	"The features of the setting significantly affect the cyclist when he was thirsty. As he pedaled along, ""A sand - blasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice in his mouth could be seen."" This vivid image clearly proves that the rider was thirsty. In the paragraph before this, it details him having a last burst of energy going down a hill. During this effort, he was also sweating a great deal, constantly wiping sweat from his eyes, which further indicates his physical state and the impact of the setting on his thirst. In conclusion, the setting's features effectively conveyed the cyclist's thirst through these details."
1507	7489	3	3	I work better when I can fully feel the environment around me. I think the same principle applies to cycling in the mountains. When there is fresh air and no worries on your mind, cycling can truly become a fun activity. The pleasant climate makes the ride easier, and the fresh air, the fine trees, and the overall environment make the cyclist feel better. For cyclists, the environment plays a vital and undeniable role in enhancing their experience. In conclusion, a favorable environment is key to making cycling an enjoyable and fulfilling activity.
1508	7490	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in a major way. The setting has a profound impact on the cyclist's performance. For example, the harsh temperature, which was extremely high, started to make his pedaling sluggish as his energy was quickly sapped. The settings also made the cyclist a little frightened. For instance, while cycling on a narrow path, the cyclist came across a snake that he was terrified of, causing his heart to race. Again, the settings affected the cyclist by tempting him. The clear, cool river tempted the cyclist to stop riding and go get a drink of water to quench his thirst. In conclusion, the setting had a major and multi - faceted affect on the cyclist's journey.
1509	7491	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For one, a lot of the settings discouraged the cyclist. ""This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time - say, before the last world war - but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town."" As soon as the cyclist hit this ""town"", he realized that the old men's advice might not have been so great. The dry desert affects the cyclist the most. This hot climate, with the sun beating down mercilessly, makes the cyclist extremely thirsty, hot, and sweaty. ""Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from a heatstroke..."" The cyclist's tune here is sarcastic but he is still deeply concerned about his health because of the heat and lack of water. The fact that there is nothing living around the cyclist also affects him. Since he talked to the old men for directions, he hasn't seen a glimpse of life, or buildings or anything. This definitely discourages the cyclist and makes him lose his will to continue his journey. In conclusion, the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many and often demoralizing ways."
1510	7492	3	3	"The cyclist tracked through a barren land trying desperately to get to a land of rivers and valleys. While tracking through the first town, the cyclist saw a ramshackle shed, rusty pumps, and a corral located in the desolate desert of California. The cyclist was very angry that the old men led him into this barren town. However, he kept a glimmer of hope and traveled to the next town. There, he found an abandoned fruit juice factory and bottling plant. This sight so discouraged the cyclist that he started to give up. ""I was going to die,"" he claimed with all hope lost. The man feels like there is nothing left and it's the old men who caused this unfortunate situation. Then finally, he came across a bait shop on his own, which gave him a huge relief. The features of the setting affect his attitude because in a barren land, one easily loses hope, as did the cyclist. Therefore, what's around us affects us in various aspects such as education, friendship, and survival. In conclusion, the surrounding environment can have a powerful impact on our mindset and our ability to persevere."
1511	7493	3	3	In the essay, ìRough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,'' the cyclist is deeply affected both emotionally and physically by the features of the desolate setting. At the start of his journey, when he came across a deserted shed with rusty, dilapidated pumps, an overwhelming sense of discouragement began to seep into his mind. ì[The] sight was troubling,î(page @NUM1) As the ride progressed, the terrain gradually changed from flat land to short, rolling hills, and tumbleweeds started to pass by in the dry wind. The cyclist is definitely affected by this change in terrain. He is now completely exhausted but continues to doggedly pump his legs and ride on. Before the end of his arduous ride, the cyclist reaches an abandoned @ORGANIZATION1. The setting now includes a large picture of a young boy drinking a refreshing glass of juice. The author seems almost defeated by this sight. ìI hung my head'' (page @NUM2) he confessed. In the end, once he spots an old fisherman's store in the distance, he is relieved. The sight of the store from afar excited the author, because he could finally have a long - awaited drink. The author's mood and body were greatly affected by the features of the setting, which made his journey a real test of will.
1512	7494	3	3	The features of the desolate setting in ìDo Not Exceed Posted Speed Limitî by Joe Kurmaskie clearly show that as the long day goes on under the scorching sun, the cyclist becomes extremely tired and worn - out from his long and arduous ride through rough and unforgiving terrain as he tries to find his way back home. Then, he catches a glimpse of some buildings down a hill and said ìWith what I believed was my last burst of energy, I maneuvered down the hillî (kurmakie @NUM1). After the rider finally gets home, despite the hardships, he says he is going to do it again, showing his love for cycling and the challenge it presents.
1513	7495	3	3	The main and most pressing affect on the cyclist is the lack of water. It is in the sweltering month of June, while he is riding his bike in the arid expanse of California. Therefore, itís going to be extremely hot, and heíll need a large amount of water to stay hydrated. When he sees that Welchís Grape Juice factory, with its enticing images of cool beverages, it just makes him acutely aware of his thirst even more. Also, the terrain he is riding on is far from easy. He starts out riding on flat ground, but then he has to tackle hilly and not - so - flat terrain. This strenuous riding on uneven ground only exacerbates his dehydration. Thatís why you should always carry an ample supply of water with you if youíre riding a bike during the hot summer months to avoid such discomfort.
1514	7496	3	3	The affects of the settings on the cyclist were mainly how blisteringly hot it was and the poor condition of the cyclist road he was on. The rider said it was June in the peak of the summer time, and the sun was beating down mercilessly, making it very hot. And the roads were not smooth at all; they were very old and ragged, full of potholes and cracks that made the ride bumpy and difficult. These factors combined made the cyclist's journey a real struggle, highlighting the importance of proper conditions for cycling.
1515	7497	3	3	In the short story ìDo Not Exceed Posted Speed Limitî a cyclist is bravely going against the intense heat of the summer sun, the severe lack of water in the arid environment, and the challenging rough hills as he tries to skillfully maneuver around them. His journey is fraught with difficulties, but it also showcases his determination and resilience in the face of adversity. Despite these challenges, his cycling adventure is a testament to his love for the sport and his will to overcome obstacles.
1516	7498	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he is trying to bike up steep hills and down equally challenging hills, which can be extremely tiring. The continuous effort required to pedal uphill and control the speed downhill takes a toll on his energy. Also, the sweltering hot air can rapidly dehydrate him, which can cause him to pass out. Along with the dry air, the arid land means there is no readily available place to stop for water or take a short rest. The rough, uneven terrain makes the biking more difficult because it involves more energy than biking on a smooth path. Finally, the snake lying in the middle of the road made it hard for the cyclist to go around. If the snake would have bitten him, he could have died from the poison. In such a challenging setting, the cyclist has to constantly be on high - alert and conserve his energy to make it through.
1517	7499	3	3	"The setting in the essay ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" was extremely hot and dry, with very little shade or moisture available. At some points along the journey, there was perhaps not a single spot of shade or a drop of moisture in sight. This harsh weather affected the author severely because he had no water at all. As he continued to move forward, he was getting more and more dehydrated. The lack of water combined with the intense heat made his situation quite perilous. Eventually, this challenging setting highlighted the importance of proper preparation when venturing into such environments."
1518	7500	3	3	How the features of the setting affected the cyclist. The feature was that one should never take advice from old people who never get out of the house. For instance, in the story it says, “Never accept travel advice from a collection of old - timers who haven’t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office.” This advice affected the setting because if it weren't for his map and he let those old people take a peek at it, that would have saved him a great deal of trouble. By relying on his own map and not the unhelpful advice, he could have avoided the difficulties that came with following their suggestions. This shows that in unfamiliar settings, it's crucial to trust reliable sources of information.
1519	7501	3	3	In “Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting of the terrain was hot and water - draining. In the text it says “Followed by blackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two - hundred degrees.” This clearly proves that the cyclist is exaggerating about the very hot temperature of the high deserts of California. The intense heat made the journey extremely challenging. The setting is also water - draining, and the cyclist had to stop in the desert town to refill his water bottle. As in the text says “I got down on my hands and knees, working the handle of a rusted water pump with all my strength.” This proves that the cyclist had to stop for water and use a great deal of power to pump it out. In conclusion, always prepare for the worst but hope for the best, especially when venturing into harsh terrains like the high deserts.
1520	7502	3	3	In the story, there are many features of the setting that affect the cyclist. One setting feature is the rolling of steep hills. The long and steep hills make the cyclist completely exhausted and even more desperate for water. For example, in the story it says, “Over one long crippling hill, a building came into view.” This shows that the hill was very hard and strenuous to get over. By using the word crippling, it informs us that the hill was brutal and extremely difficult to conquer. Another setting feature that affects the cyclist is the complete absence of any civilization on his cycling path. While he was riding, he notices that there is not a single person around to help him if he gets in trouble or needs water. The lack of people makes him feel highly stressed and worried about his journey. It shows this in the story when he says, “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” Also, it says in the story “I was going to die and the bird would pick me clean, leaving only some expensive outdoor gear and a diary with the last entry on the parse of old men.” This shows that there was nobody around to help him and he was fully aware of it. He thought he would die alone and that birds would eat him. He was obviously extremely worried about the absence of people. In such a desolate setting, the cyclist's situation becomes increasingly precarious, emphasizing the importance of preparedness for solo adventures.
1521	7503	3	3	Usually, the features of the setting have a major impact on the cyclist. The features of the setting relate to and describe the harsh, and eventually the relief, conditions of the cyclist. The setting is connected to the person and plays a role that the cyclist can observe. One reason how the features of the setting affect the cyclist is that it shows the various problems the cyclist is facing. For example, surrounded by cool pines with no one in sight, I am all alone. This situation conveys a clear meaning: as the cyclist, I need help to get home, and during the journey, I need water to quench my thirst. Prior to this, the features show the weakness of the cyclist. For instance, I believed it was my last burst of energy as I constantly maneuvered down the hill. The features and settings affect the cyclist by showing how he was dealing with his troubles, thirst and fear, which were all left behind in the end. These features and settings develop a clear understanding for the cyclist and what is to be expected by him.
1522	7504	3	3	The features of the setting had a big impact on the cyclist. When he started that ride, he was confident that the “old timers” were right about which directions and roads he had to take to get to Yosemite National Park. Even though the scorching sun was bearing down relentlessly, he refused to give up, just as he says “The sun was beginning to beat down, but I hardly noticed.” He came across places that were worn - down and completely deserted, so he knew that he was all alone if anything happened. The intense desert heat had made him consume his water pretty regularly, so he tried to get more. As described in the text, “I got on my hands and knees. When I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid” (paragraph @NUM1). He was so extremely thirsty that he would even drink hot water. Then he thought he only had @NUM2 miles to go, so he kept pushing forward. He was weakening as he pedaled along the ever - changing terrain while “trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.” With what little energy he had left, he passed an abandoned Well be Grape Juice factory, which probably severely tested his patience and sanity. He had resorted to “gathering up a few pebbles and sticking them in my mouth” just to take his mind off his thirst. He was losing hope when he came upon “Gary and Wilber’s fish camp best bet,” and then he felt relieved after he was able to get cool water. By then, he had learned his lesson: to stick to his map and not rely solely on others' advice.
1523	7505	3	3	In the author's recollection of his long and tiresome bike ride, he talked about the numerous struggles he had to face. When he set out that morning, he asked some old guys sitting on a porch for directions to @CAPS1. They told him that they knew the way and that they knew a shortcut. He chose to take their advice but later regretted it. When he reached the places they mentioned, all he found were dilapidated and deserted ghost towns. He realized he was all alone if any trouble occurred. As the author said, “The sun was beginning to beat down, but I hardly noticed,” showing his initial determination. The desert heat was intense, and he had to drink water regularly. He tried to get more water, as described when he “got on his hands and knees” and found that the water “had the flavor of battery acid.” He was so thirsty that he would have drunk hot water. He thought he only had @NUM2 miles to go, so he kept going. He was weakening as he pedaled along the changing terrain, “trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.” With his last bit of energy, he passed an abandoned Well be Grape Juice factory, which surely tested his patience. He resorted to “gathering up a few pebbles and sticking them in my mouth” to distract himself from the thirst. He was losing hope when he finally came upon “Gary and Wilber’s fish camp best bet.” After getting cool water there, he felt relieved. By then, he had learned his lesson: he should have stuck to his map instead of relying on the advice of those old - timers.
1524	7506	3	3	A cyclist can only travel as fast or as slow as he pedals. If the setting is a humid sunny day, he can't go too fast due to his limited lung capacity. The thick, humid air makes it difficult for him to breathe deeply, thus restricting his speed. If it is a warm but windy day, he has to watch his speed carefully to keep from getting hurt. Strong gusts of wind can easily unbalance him, especially when taking turns or going downhill. Basically, unless the weather is nice and safe enough, he won't go fast. But safety comes first, so it mostly depends on the weather, but also the time of the day. If it is night (dark), reflectors must be put on the bike to keep from getting into an accident. The lack of visibility at night makes it crucial for the cyclist to be visible to other road users, and reflectors are an essential safety measure.
1525	7507	3	3	The features in the setting affect the cyclist because of the heat and the terrain. I say this because in the story it describes all the steep hills that he has to laboriously go up and down while the horrendous heat beats down on him mercilessly. The heat also makes the situation difficult because it makes the cyclist drink more water. Throughout the story, he was constantly trying to find some water. The water he did find was about “two hundred degrees and tasted like battery acid.” If you have no water, it becomes extremely hard to bicycle such a long distance in that much heat. The combination of the challenging terrain and the sweltering heat drains the cyclist's energy and makes the journey an arduous one. Without an adequate supply of water, the cyclist's physical condition deteriorates rapidly, making it almost impossible to continue the ride. In conclusion, the heat and terrain in the setting have a significant and negative impact on the cyclist's ability to complete the journey.
1526	7508	3	3	The cyclist is affected by numerous features in the surrounding setting. The long, arduous hill is one prominent example. The slithering snake that crosses his path and the bumpy dirt road he traverses are two more. The intense heat of the desert, which beats down relentlessly, is another factor. Also, his gradually depleting water supply, which becomes a constant concern, are all examples of features that affected him. These elements combined made his cycling journey a challenging one.
1527	7509	3	3	"There were many features of the setting that affected the cyclist. On one page @NUM1, in paragraph @NUM2, there is a clear sign that states ""rough road ahead"". This warning indicates the difficult terrain he is about to face. On the same page @NUM1, paragraph @NUM4, it says ""over the long on - piling hill"". This shows the physical challenge of the uphill ride. He also has to deal with the temperature as described starting on page @NUM5. At the top of page @NUM1, paragraph @NUM7, it says ""I was traveling in the high desert of California in June"". These conditions of the setting all have an impact on the cyclist, making his journey more arduous."
1528	7510	3	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in this story. First of all, in the story it says ""…and the growing realization that I could drop from a heatstroke…"" (@NUM1). This quote clearly shows that it is extremely hot, and this sweltering heat is directly affecting his ability to ride. The narrator also says, ""I eased past trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state"" (@CAPS1 @NUM2). This quote is indicating that he is dehydrated and, as a result, is having significant trouble keeping balance on the rough terrain. In conclusion, the setting, with its heat and rough ground, affected the cyclist in this story by posing physical challenges to his cycling."
1529	7511	3	3	The setting affects the cyclist by motivating him to go longer and keep riding the bike. His curiosity drives him to see what is up ahead. However, riding a bike in the intense heat can lead to serious consequences. You can have a heat stroke and die from dehydration and the searing heat. That's why it is crucial to have a sufficient amount of water with you when you are riding a bike in such conditions. Failing to do so can turn an exciting ride into a dangerous situation.
1530	7512	3	3	"THE CYCLIST'S SETTINGS HINDER HIM IN THE ESSAY ""ROUGH ROAD AHEAD."" THE CYCLIST IS IN THE DESERT DURING THE SUMMER TIME, WITH HARDLY ANY WATER TO QUENCH HIS THIRST. HE IS ON A QUEST TO FIND HIS WAY TO YOSEMITE, BUT HE ENCOUNTERS TROUBLE. SOME OLD MEN GAVE HIM BAD DIRECTIONS, AND HE GETS LOST ALONG THE WAY. DURING THIS TIME, HE IS RIDING HIS BICYCLE FOR MILES AND MILES IN THE SCORCHING HEAT OF THE SUMMER. HIS CONSTANT THOUGHTS OF THIRST GET IN THE WAY OF HIS CONCENTRATION, MAKING IT DIFFICULT FOR HIM TO CONTINUE ON TO FIND YOSEMITE. I BELIEVE THAT IF THE CYCLIST WAS IN A COOLER ENVIRONMENT THEN THINGS WOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT BECAUSE HIS SETTINGS WERE SORT OF A DISTRACTION TO HIM, IMPEDING HIS PROGRESS ON THE JOURNEY."
1531	7513	3	3	The cyclist became extremely tired, and the area he found himself in was of no help whatsoever. He was in the vast desert in June, on a swelteringly hot day. Every town he reached was completely abandoned, with not a drop of water to be found. Moreover, the terrain was very hilly, which made his cycling work even more arduous. In such harsh conditions, his journey became an uphill battle, and he struggled to keep going.
1532	7514	3	3	"The features in the setting of ""Rough Road Ahead, Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" significantly affect the cyclist because they determine how easy or hard his ride is. For example, the land being extremely hot would put him at risk of dying or suffering from heatstroke without an adequate water supply. The dry land means he doesn't have a convenient place to refill his water bottle. And the barren land implies that if he doesn't succumb to heatstroke, there's a high chance he won't be found and won't survive. Another instance of how the features of the setting impact the cyclist is in the story when the road turns rough and he sees the speed limit sign. His thoughts are about how he's going at a water - depleting 12 mph. This clearly shows that the features of the setting, namely the contour of the land and the roughness of the road, make the journey a great deal harder on the cyclist. The features of a setting could possibly be the biggest hindrance to a cyclist, and whether they have a long, hard journey where they have to push themselves to the limit, like in this story, or a nice, leisurely ride depends largely on these features."
1533	7515	3	3	"The cyclist in ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" was definitely affected by the setting. He was cycling in California, which is known to be a hot place right from the start, and it was June. This made the weather even hotter as he was approaching a searing hot desert. When you're engaged in a physical activity like cycling, the last thing you desire is to be in such intense heat. The narrator only brought one small bottle of water, and at first, he was sipping from it regularly. Then, as the heat intensified, he quickly ran out of water. This affected his body, making him extremely tired, and his mind as well, as he started to doubt his ability to continue. Then there was the abandoned juice building where they used to make juice. He said, ""In an ironic twist, the building abandoned years earlier had been a Welch’s grape juice factory and bottling plant."" He was on the verge of dying of thirst when he found the bottling plant. The cyclist was definitely affected by his surroundings both mentally, by constantly thinking ""I'm going to die,"" and physically by becoming severely dehydrated. In the end, the harsh setting took a heavy toll on his well - being."
1534	7516	3	3	"The cyclist was riding in some extremely rough, dry, and desolate abandoned terrain that made his journey perilously close to being fatal. He described it as, ""In the high deserts of California in June."" The environment was bone - dry, completely lifeless, and swelteringly hot. The scorching sun was relentlessly beating down on him, and he needed to drink water frequently, but his supply was rapidly running out. The empty towns were what he was desperately hoping to find fresh water in, but they had been long - abandoned. This made his journey extremely dangerous. He could've toppled off his bike at any moment because of heatstroke and would've perished right there in the desert. His sweat was evaporating instantly in the intense heat, and there was no way for him to cool off in the desolate, dry, and lifeless desert. He had to endure these extreme and ironic conditions for miles on end, just to search for some water. It was the epitome of what a desert is and what a cyclist should never have to go through. In such circumstances, his survival became a real challenge."
1535	7517	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in numerous ways. The hills are uncommonly long, making each climb a strenuous task. Every town he passes through appears to be completely deserted, leaving him with no hope of finding essential supplies. The roads are extremely rough, filled with potholes and uneven surfaces that jolt his body with every pedal stroke. The blistering heat also takes a heavy toll on him. He is affected health - wise, as the heat makes him dizzy and weak, and the lack of proper rest and water due to the unforgiving setting puts his overall well - being at risk. In conclusion, the adverse features of the setting make his cycling journey a real struggle and pose a significant threat to his health.
1536	7518	3	3	"When you're doing any sport or any activity where you sweat, your setting is everything. If you're sweating in an unfavorable setting, you can easily get sick. In the story ""Rough road ahead"", the cyclist was in a situation where there was no water and the setting was extremely hot. That's precisely why the cyclist became tired and sick because he was sweating profusely and had no water to replenish himself. This clearly shows how the setting can significantly affect the cyclist."
1537	7519	3	3	The features of the setting, such as old abandoned towns, hot temperatures, and abandoned buildings, affect the cyclist greatly. These elements make the cyclist think that all hope is lost. As described in the essay, “Over one long crippling hill, a building came into view [...] I hung my head as that smoky blues tune 'Summertime' rattled around.” This shows the cyclist's despair. Then, in an ironic twist that should please all sadists reading this, the building, which by the looks of it had been a Welch’s grape juice factory and bottling plant, changed the cyclist's mood. As stated, “As I stumbled into a rather modern bathroom and drank deeply from the sink, I had an overwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber, kiss them.” This demonstrates how the setting can have a profound impact on the cyclist's emotions, from despair to a glimmer of hope.
1538	7520	3	3	With no one around, a rough road stretching ahead, and not to mention the onset of dehydration, the cyclist began to feel that he was going to die. Due to this dire situation, he started to doubt himself. However, each time he caught sight of something in the distance, he summoned the will to try and reach it. Despite his growing sense of hopelessness, the cyclist found a small spark of determination within himself, pushing forward in the face of adversity.
1539	7521	3	3	The features of the setting greatly affected the cyclist. For one, he was biking through the high deserts of California in June, a time when the sun beats down mercilessly. This intense heat caused the cyclist to become overheated and sweaty. As a result, he drank from his water bottles frequently to cool down and stay hydrated. Unfortunately, since there was, “no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind,” he had nowhere to refill his bottles and soon became dehydrated. To make matters even worse, the terrain changed from a flat road to “short, rolling hills.” Normally, this type of terrain would not cause too much struggle, but since he was dehydrated and overheated, each hill seemed “crippling.” My thoughts are that if the setting had been a bit cooler and perhaps in a time period similar to when the old men had lived, the cyclist would have had a much more enjoyable experience, free from the physical and mental toll of the harsh conditions.
1540	7522	3	3	Excitement, desperation, and self - pity are all feelings the cyclist had because of the setting. He was really excited to get to Yosemite Park because of its well - known peacefulness. He vividly said, “the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite are calling my name.” The intense heat of his current setting made his desire to reach Yosemite even stronger. As he continued his journey, he started getting desperate for water. In his desperation, he even tried to drink from a hot water hole. He remarked, “I tried a drop or two, tasted like battery acid.” With his water supply running out, his desperation for some clean water grew. Moreover, he started to have self - pity. He lamented, “sometimes life can be so cruel,” feeling sorry for himself because he still had such a long way to go. These are all feelings the cyclist had because of the setting, which had a profound impact on his emotional state throughout the journey.
1541	7523	3	3	Features of the setting affect the cyclist’s moods in many ways. The story says, “About forty miles into the pedal, I arrived at the first ‘town.’” The cyclist is probably already tired from pedaling for forty miles on the long, arduous journey. Then he finds out that the town is deserted, with empty streets and silent buildings, which makes him a little frustrated. The next few stops are also deserted and he is almost out of water, feeling his throat parched and his energy waning. He is becoming desperate. The road becomes bumpy, jolting him roughly on the bike, and there is a large snake blocking the way, its menacing presence sending shivers down his spine. He is terrified. Finally, he reaches a bait shop with cool water, and he is relieved as the refreshing liquid quenches his thirst. As you can see, the cyclist goes through many moods caused by the setting of the story.
1542	7524	3	3	The way the feature of the setting affected the cyclist is that it’s in June in the middle of the desert. The intense heat of the desert sun beats down relentlessly, baking the sand beneath his wheels. Also, he was given wrong directions, leaving him lost and disoriented in this vast, unforgiving expanse. This combination of the harsh climate and incorrect guidance made his cycling journey extremely difficult and perilous.
1543	7525	3	3	The cyclist was affected by the climate, the people, and the surrounding. The climate was the desert in June which was very hot with little water. The scorching sun beat down on him all day, causing him to sweat profusely and quickly deplete his water supply. This made him dehydrated and miserable, with a pounding headache and a dry, cracked throat. The old men that “helped” him accused him of being in the guiding situation he was in, adding to his frustration and confusion. There were no surrounding shops or buildings that were inhabited. The desolate landscape stretched as far as the eye could see, with no signs of civilization or a place to get help. This way there was no place for him to get any water nourishment, leaving him in a desperate situation. All these factors combined made his cycling experience in this setting extremely challenging and unpleasant.
1544	7526	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by when the story says “Twenty miles up the road. I came to a fork of sorts.” This statement from the story affected the cyclist because he didn’t know which way to go. Standing at the fork, he looked down both paths, each disappearing into the distance, with no clear indication of which was the right one. Another feature that affected the setting is when the story says “I got on my hand and knees, working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength.” That statement shows that the cyclist was dying for water and he didn’t think any was going to come out. He pumped with all his might, his muscles straining, as he watched the dry pump with growing despair. Last feature that affected the cyclist was when the story says “Rough road ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit.” This shows that the rider had to go under a speed limit but he was earlier tired and he was going way under it and that he could make it up the rough road. The rough road loomed ahead, full of potholes and bumps, and his tired body struggled to keep the bike moving forward. In conclusion, these various features of the setting significantly impacted the cyclist's journey.
1545	7527	3	3	The dry, deserted area the cyclist is in has many cautions and dangers. The parched landscape is filled with loose sand that can easily cause the bike to skid and lose control. There are also hidden rocks and uneven terrain that pose a threat to his safety. The lack of water sources means he is at risk of dehydration, and the extreme heat can quickly lead to heatstroke. With no signs of human habitation, he is isolated and alone, with no one to turn to in case of an emergency. All these factors make his journey through this area a challenging and perilous one.
1546	7528	3	3	In the text, the author was cycling to Yosemite Park through a vast, arid desert which rapidly dehydrated him and significantly changed his mood. As he pedaled through this seemingly endless desert, he soon ran out of water and had to stop. Some of the small towns he had been told about turned out to be completely deserted. Since he couldn't find water there, he quickly became dehydrated. This is the obvious effect the desolate setting had on him. Another effect was that it made him doubt the advice of old people and transformed his mood from confident to desperate. As he was cycling through the desert, desperately clinging to life in hopes he could find water, he realized that old people know more about the past than the future as they don't get out into the ever - changing world as much as they used to. In contrast, at the beginning, he was fully confident in the directions and wisdom of the old men. The harsh setting he was in ultimately made him a little more wise, teaching him the importance of self - reliance and critical thinking.
1547	7529	3	3	Because the setting of the cyclist's ride is a parched, dry desert, it makes the cyclist seem even more determined. He is going against all the odds, as if he is pushing himself to the absolute limit. Against the scorching heat and the seemingly never - ending long road he's on, and with no water in sight, all seems lost for the cyclist. Every pedal stroke is a struggle, his body is being tested to its extremes. But in the end, he manages to pull himself together. With sheer willpower, he makes it happen for himself and triumphs over the adversity of the desert, proving that determination can overcome even the harshest of conditions.
1548	7530	3	3	From reading the story, I believe the setting of the desert he was cycling through affected him immensely. I believe it affected him in the way the attitude of the cyclist changed for the worse. At first, he was very motivated, determined, and well - hydrated. As time passed and he covered more miles, the scenery remained monotonously the same. That can be really challenging, especially when you're in the heat and need to be as hydrated as possible, particularly when engaging in an enduring physical activity like cycling. As time went on, he was getting low on water and had nothing else to think about other than how thirsty he was and whether this whole journey was worth it. It's a lot harder to stay motivated when there's nothing interesting to look at to keep your mind off the discomfort. The attitude of the cyclist changed for the worse. In my point of view, I strongly believe that it could have been from cycling in the same sandy desert for a long period of time. I have experienced the same when exercising while in a dull environment. It's hard to stay focused on the task at hand. My attitude will quickly shift from “I'm so determined” to “I'm bored” to “what's the point”. But I thought it was great how he never gave up even when things got really bad. It opened my eyes to see how great it is to reach your own goals, no matter the difficulties faced along the way.
1549	7531	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by dehydrating him severely. The cyclist said, “I toiled on. At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake slithered by.” The cyclist was in the vast expanse of the desert, and with each mile he rode, he became more and more dehydrated. The intense desert sun was like a relentless oven, drying out his body with every passing moment. He said with each passing landmark, “I eased past trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.” It was evident that the more he went on, the more the unforgiving desert affected him and sapped the moisture from his body, making each pedal stroke a herculean effort. In the end, the desert's dehydrating effect was a constant and powerful force against his journey.
1550	7532	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. One way is that the cyclist deviated from sticking to his map. Instead of following the planned route on his map, he decided to ask a couple of old people for directions. The old people who gave the cyclist directions also suggested a short - cut to take. That's where the second effect came in, as the cyclist started to use this shortcut instead of staying on the main road. This shortcut, likely due to the unique features of the desert setting such as less traffic and a different terrain, led him into unforeseen situations. Overall, these actions, influenced by the setting and the advice he received, changed the course of his journey, demonstrating how the features of the setting can have a significant impact on a traveler's choices and experiences.
1551	7533	3	3	Some features of the setting that affected the cyclist were the poor road conditions and the significant road changes with the steep hills. So far, the cyclist had a great and smooth ride for about two miles into his journey. After that, the situation started to change. This is supported when the author states, “Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing” (kurmaskie). Even though the author started this journey in a nice and comfortable way, it did not take long for things to turn against him. Although the hills became steeper and the road conditions deteriorated, the character in the story still managed to get through his problems without much worry. With all of the problems in the setting, the cyclist still persevered to end his journey successfully.
1552	7534	3	3	The features of the setting cause the cyclist two main problems: doubt and dehydration. From the essay, you can clearly infer that the cyclist doubts he will ever make it to Yosemite because of the numerous constant features in the essay that cause him to lose his hope and confidence. For example, near the end of the essay, the cyclist is already extremely exhausted and completely hopeless. But then he sees a building over a hill. He hurries to the building with high hopes, only to find out that it is an abandoned, run - down @ORGANIZATION1 factory. After getting his hopes up, he is forced to get back on his bike and carry on. This feature of the setting causes further disappointment to the cyclist and installs more doubt into his mind. Despite losing his confidence and hopes to make it to Yosemite, the features of the setting also cause him a serious, literal problem: dehydration. The weather is hot and dry, and he has to carry on over steep hills and on rough roads. He is running low on water, and at the one town he finds, the water from the pump is undrinkable. The features of the setting are causing him these problems and are the reason his health is at significant risk. In the end, these challenges severely test the cyclist's physical and mental endurance.
1553	7535	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One way is the poor condition of the roads, which are full of potholes and uneven surfaces. Another is the intense heat that makes the air feel like a furnace. Another is the presence of snakes slithering around, posing a real threat. Another is the fact that there is no town in sight for miles. The final one is the lack of information about the route ahead. Maybe the guy made it safely to his destination. Maybe he got hurt on the ride. Maybe a snake bit him while he was cycling. Either way, the setting affected the cyclist in many ways, making his journey a challenging one.
1554	7536	3	3	In the essay, the description of the setting was dry, with the parched ground cracking underfoot, hot, as if the sun was directly baking the land, very open with vast stretches of empty space, and deserted with no signs of human habitation. The description could suggest loneliness, obviously. Even though the man was all alone in this desolate setting and didn't know where he was going, he still persisted. While he thought about “the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite,” this vivid mental image kept him strong, so he kept trying, determined to reach his destination.
1555	7537	3	3	There were many land features that affected the cyclist and his trip. First of all, it is a desert, a vast expanse of arid land which greatly affects him as there is no readily available water in deserts. There was also a venomous snake, coiled menacingly on the side of the road, which could have bit and killed him. As the roads were not very well paved and had obviously been abandoned for years, with large cracks and loose gravel, it made cycling much harder for him. And the dilapidated juice factory just taunted him, making him remember his desperate need for water, as did the well that did not pump cold, refreshing water, but instead pumped hot, gross - smelling water. All these land features combined to make the cyclist's trip extremely difficult and challenging.
1556	7538	3	3	When the cyclist first starts his journey, he is full of self - assurance, brimming with confidence as if he can conquer any challenge. He sees everything exactly as the old men told him, believing every word they said. As he travels on, he begins to notice that the entire area is desolate, with everything looking abandoned and empty. “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” The man starts to become extremely unsure of himself. You can clearly tell from his actions. He says, “I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn’t a mirage, and tried not to get excited.” He was very doubtful he’d get to where he was going. In the end, he was immensely relieved when he found a fishing spot with a bathroom and fresh water, which was like a haven in this desolate landscape.
1557	7539	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in this story a great deal. Having unreliable directions, which were vague and inaccurate, barely enough water for the long - distance journey, poor road conditions full of potholes and uneven surfaces, and other hazards like the scorching heat and wild animals made this a very difficult journey for the cyclist. Starting the journey, the cyclist received bad information on how to get to his destination. This misinformation led him on a long and arduous journey with not much water to sustain him. He says in the story, “The speed limit was @NUM1. I was doing a water - depleting @NUM2.” This means he was running out of water too fast for the amount of land he was covering. Another feature of the setting that affected him was that the road conditions got worse and worse until he reached a highway late in his journey. He said, “flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.” This means the faster, easy - to - ride terrain was replaced by slower, harder - to - ride - on terrain. These features of the setting could have been very dangerous and maybe even fatal, and they affected the cyclist a great deal throughout this story.
1558	7540	3	3	The feature of the setting affected the cyclist, because as his surroundings gradually changed, he lost hope of making it to Yosemite National Park. Such as when he was riding through his first town and it looked completely abandoned, with broken windows and overgrown weeds, he wasn’t so sure if he should keep going. He hesitated, looking around at the desolate scene. As well as when he didn’t see anyone or any buildings for a long time, just miles and miles of empty land, he got worried and was on the verge of losing hope. His heart sank with each passing mile. But as a second road sign appeared, clearly indicating the direction to his destination, he was relieved, as if a heavy burden had been lifted from his shoulders.
1559	7541	3	3	The setting in this short story causes the cyclist to doubt his survival. The main problem is water, or rather the lack of it. The cyclist has no water left in his bottles, and the parched throat and dry lips make him think it’s only a matter of time before he dies. His mouth is so dry that it’s hard to even swallow. Another big problem is the rough terrain. The rough terrain, with its rocky paths and steep slopes, is hard for the cyclist to overcome. His legs ache with each pedal stroke. Also, there is no sign of buildings, people, or cars in sight to save him. The vast expanse of emptiness stretches all around. Until he finds the bait shop, if anything would have happened to him, there would’ve been no one there to help, leaving him completely at the mercy of the harsh environment.
1560	7542	3	3	The features of the setting of “Do not exceed posted speed limit” greatly impact the cyclist, in a negative way. For example, when the road changes from being smooth and easy to ride on to being rolling and full of hills. The sudden change in the road surface makes it difficult for him to bike. He has to shift gears constantly and use more energy to get over the hills. His breathing becomes heavy as he struggles to pedal uphill. Another example is when it says, “tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.” The connection with seeing a tumbleweed is that of being deserted and alone, so this increased his feelings of despair. He feels isolated in this desolate world. Lastly, he sees the Welch’s Grape Juice Factory, which is deserted and has broken windows and rusty machinery. This desolate sight serves to only make him thirstier. All of these things affect the cyclist. The fact that he sees the grape juice factory is also ironic, because he is extremely dehydrated and the factory, which should be a source of refreshment, is abandoned.
1561	7543	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in a few ways. The first of these is the blazing heat. He is basically in a vast, arid desert where the sun beats down relentlessly, and he is running low on water. As he starts to run out of water, he starts conserving it, but this is dehydrating him, so he is becoming weaker. “I would conserve my water and go inward for an hour or so - a test of my inner spirit.” Next up is the rough terrain. When you hit the bumpy, uneven rough terrain on a bike, it can get extremely hard to keep going, and the cyclist was already short on water. “A large highway sign jumped out at me. I read: rough road ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit. Sometimes life can be so cruel.” Finally is the structure. First there was the Ghost town with the “battery acid” tasting water that was undrinkable. Also there was the Welch’s grape Juice factory and bottling plant which were both probably dilapidated. “A sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen. I hung my head.” As you can see, the features of the settings generally affected the cyclist, making his journey a difficult one.
1562	7544	3	3	The author finds the desolate and harsh settings to be not discouraging. Rather, they stand out as a cause of amusement and fun, like quest - like tests. The author writes that after arriving at his first ghost - town, he chuckles, amused by the funny “old codgers” sitting on their porches and their crazy, out - of - date ideas. When he arrives at the second establishment, and realizes it isn’t the least bit established anymore, just a crumbling building in the middle of nowhere, he’s slightly disappointed, but sees it as “a test of [his] inner spirit.” At the third building, an abandoned factory with rusted machinery and broken windows, he still appreciates the irony of the situation. While biking across the vast desert, he refuses to be discouraged by the empty horizon that stretches as far as the eye can see. Instead, he uses it as a point of reference to measure his progress and as a way to push himself forward. Though the author is faced with empty, disappointing views, he keeps his spirits up and keeps pushing, showing great resilience in the face of desolation.
1563	7545	3	3	In the story “Rough Road Ahead: do not exceed speed limit”, the reader sees the scenery and terrain get rougher, and lonelier. As the cyclist travels and his limits are being pushed, his outlook is somewhat grim as he only expects the worst. The rough road starts out after a water pump he finds. The water from the pump is piping hot, brackish, and tastes like battery acid. Water in a sense in this story is a metaphor to his life, and is the source for him living. In the beginning, he drank it regularly, quenching his thirst easily. But when he gets to the pump and finds the bad water, it’s just like when things start to turn sour in the story itself. The cyclist in this story is very aware of how his body is and acknowledges his dehydration. At one point he says “and the growing realization that I could drop from a heat stroke simply because I had listened to some gentlemen who hadn’t been off their porches in a decade”. He later said it caused him to laugh sadly, hopelessly. The lack of humans and their technology, like proper water sources, really broke him down, making his journey a struggle.
1564	7546	3	3	The desert is the cruelest of nature’s environments. Its lack of water, dry air that sucks the moisture out of everything, and punishing heat that can sear the skin are enough to kill even the hardiest creature. When traveling through a desert, one must maintain a constant water supply and know their path with respect to the power of nature. In “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”, cycler Joe Kurmaskie must overcome the desert’s intense heat and lack of water to survive. As the author observes in paragraph @NUM1, “wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, I could drop from heatstroke.” If the human body overheats, it becomes sick and unable to properly function. When in the desert, one must keep cool or perish. In @NUM2, Kurmaskie begins to realize the danger of running out of water in the desert. “I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June.” As this water starts to run out, Joe suffers from dehydration, despair that clouds his mind, and a loss of balance that makes it hard to stay on his bike. Water is essential in a desert environment. Without it, as Joe observes, “the birds would pick (you) clean, leaving only some expensive outdoor gear”. In the end, Joe's ability to overcome these challenges will determine whether he can make it out of the desert alive.
1565	7547	3	3	The features in the setting of the essay “Rough Road Ahead Do not exceed the Posted Speed limit” affect the cyclist in a cruel manner. The old man says that the towns are going to be there, but they are just non - functioning towns, mere shells of what they once were. To make the cyclist feel hopeless, the setting puts him in a sweltering California day in June which is extremely hot, and throws in all these unexpected twists. A cruel thing to add in the essay was when it read “The Speed limit was 55 mph. I was doing a water - depleting 12 mph.” This lowers the cyclist's confidence, making him seem more worried about his slow progress and the fact that he's using up water so quickly. Another cruel thing is the author adding a Welch’s Grape Juice factory that had been abandoned. There was “A sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring @NUM1 refreshing glass of juice into his mouth”, totally causing him to lose the last bit of hope he had. These features in the setting are cruel, making the cyclist's journey a demoralizing one.
1566	7548	3	3	The features in the desolate setting, such as the desolate ghost - town desert stretching as far as the eye can see, and the dilapidated Juice factory standing alone, give the cyclist a profound sense of hopelessness. He is running critically low on water when he arrives at the ghost town. He initially thought it was a relief because the next town was only a short distance down the road. However, when he reached the next “town” and tried to use the rusty water pump, instead of the clear, cool water he craved, a rather hot, foul - smelling liquid came up. He was starting to lose all hope when he came across the Welch’s factory, completely abandoned with broken windows and overgrown weeds. All hope from him at that point was lost, and he desolately claimed, “the birds will pick me clean.” To the cyclist's fortune, then he was “saved” by a small, unassuming bait shop. These features in the setting gradually drained his hope little by little, until he came to the Bait shop after which his hope, but certainly not his faith in old men, was restored.
1567	7549	3	3	In the setting of the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the harsh environment had a great impact on the cyclist. It made him even more resolute to finish the journey because the terrain was extremely difficult to ride through. For example, “At some point, tumbleweeds, large and dry, crossed his path, and a ridiculously large snake - it really did look like a diamondback - blocked the majority of the cracked pavement in front of him. He carefully eased past, struggling to keep his balance in his severely dehydrated state.” The author fully explains how no matter how daunting the obstacles are that he comes across, he keeps trying to carefully make his way by. The challenging terrain affects the character by keeping him determined. This is a common phenomenon in sports. For instance, in football, players take any problems they face on the field and use them as motivations to push themselves harder to finish the game, just like the cyclist persevering through the tough terrain.
1568	7550	3	3	This essay takes place on a vast, barren desert landscape. The setting, with its sweltering heat, causes the cyclist to get dehydrated at a much faster rate. Also, phone signals are scarce in this desolate place. As he mentions sometime in the essay, “the next town was only @NUM1 down the road.” The extreme heat and isolation in this place also cause him to question what he sees, thinking that the distant shapes might be just a mirage. In this harsh desert environment, the lack of reliable resources and the intense heat play tricks on his mind and body, making his journey even more arduous.
1569	7551	3	3	The many features of the setting affected the cyclist in various distinct ways. The breathtaking beauty of the nature around him, with the clear blue sky and the gentle sway of wildflowers in the breeze, affected him by making him burst into laughter. In the essay, it says, “On a gorgeous day in June with the warm sun shining and the soft wind blowing, it caused him to laugh.” This shows that despite all the hardships he faced, being out on such a nice day outside gave him an optimistic attitude. Also, the relentless beating sun, shining directly overhead without a cloud in sight, affected him in a different, more dangerous way. It caused him to sweat profusely and brought him close to death from dehydration. “The growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke” clearly shows that he was acutely aware that he could die from the sun's intense heat. So, the settings around the cyclist affected him in different and significant ways.
1570	7552	3	3	In the unforgiving setting, the conditions were truly brutal. The author endured searing heat that seemed to bake him from all sides, dehydration that left his throat parched and his body weak, and the misfortune of getting wrong directions from a well - meaning but misinformed old man. He experienced deep - seated depression and came perilously close to death. He had a terrifying encounter with a big old snake coiled menacingly on the path. Finally, after all the hardships, he reached his destination. This arduous journey affected him deeply, and he learned the valuable lessons of always bringing a map and not blindly taking directions from old people, as these precautions could have saved him from a great deal of suffering.
1571	7553	3	3	The setting affected the cyclist significantly as it made his ride notably harder. For example, the weather was extremely hot. “The sun was beginning to beat down,” he noted. He claims it didn't affect him, yet he was visibly very thirsty and dehydrated, so internally, it clearly had an impact on him. Also, the presence of weeds and snakes frightened him. “Tumbleweeds crossed my path, and a ridiculously large snake” appeared, which surely couldn't have made his ride any easier. Next, the hills and roads presented challenges. “Over one long, crippling hill,” he had to pedal, proving how intense his ride truly was. That's how the setting affected the cyclist in “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, making his journey a difficult and arduous one.
1572	7554	3	3	The features of the nearby setting affect the cyclist in a bad way. The four main things that affect him are the heat, lack of water, lack of nearby buildings, and natural obstacles. For this cyclist, one of the biggest problems is the heat. He says “I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June,” which clearly shows that it is quite hot outside based on the month stated. June is quite a hot month, especially in California's deserts. The second problem is the cyclist's lack of water. He repeatedly mentions throughout the story how thirsty he is and how much he desperately needs to drink some water. When he reaches the end, however, he finally finds water. The third problem is that when he needs water, he can't find anywhere to get it due to the lack of buildings. He pedals great distances trying to find “towns” nearby. Once he finds them, they are either “ghost towns” or are not useful at all. The final problem he faces is the natural obstacles. He says “At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake … blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.” These natural obstacles are getting in his way and not helping him to reach his destination at all. Truly, the features of the nearby setting are affecting him in a traumatizing way because so many things like heat, lack of water, buildings, and natural obstacles are constantly hindering his progress.
1573	7555	3	3	The setting affects the cyclist because in California, the weather can be really hot at times. During a long - distance cycling trip, the cyclist is at high risk of dehydrating. As the heat intensifies, the cyclist loses a significant amount of water through sweating. If not properly hydrated, the cyclist could pass out and really get hurt, which would put an end to the journey and potentially cause serious harm. Also, there are a lot of hills in the area. Climbing these hills requires the cyclist to exert a great deal of physical effort. The steep inclines make it difficult for the cyclist to maintain a steady speed and can quickly tire them out. In conclusion, the hot weather and numerous hills in California's setting pose significant challenges to the cyclist's journey.
1574	7556	3	3	In the essay, the author added many features that could be picked out all about the cyclist's journey. One feature was that his water supply was running short. As he cycled under the scorching sun, he had to keep sipping water, which shows exactly how hot it was and how much he was drinking to stay hydrated. Another feature would be the rusty old pipe with the bad water. The rust on the pipe and the poor quality of the water indicate that that town had been abandoned for years and the water supply wasn't suitable for drinking. The essay in all shows how hard it is in hot weather with a lack of supplies and no sense of direction. The cyclist is left struggling to find clean water and a proper path, making his journey a difficult and disorienting one.
1575	7557	3	3	The cyclist in “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.” had to go through a hard time in the California desert. It was hard for him because it was very hot in the desert in June. The sweltering heat made the air feel like an oven, and he was almost out of water. At first, his ride was easy on flat ground as he could pedal smoothly with relatively less effort. But when he came to rolling terrain, he had to use more energy to climb the small rises and control his speed on the descents. The combination of the heat, lack of water, and the challenging rolling terrain made his journey in the California desert a truly difficult experience.
1576	7558	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because he was extremely thirsty. As he pedaled on, the dry, arid air with no town in the vicinity made his condition even more unbearable. Moreover, the bumpy roads and the numerous hills he had to climb were not only tiring but also made the cyclist even thirstier. Finally, there was an old - looking factory that he passed by. The sight of it made him think about cold, refreshing juice, which in turn made him thirstier yet. All these elements of the setting combined to make his cycling experience quite challenging.
1577	7559	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in a rather peculiar way. Old people, with their traditional values, tend to change the common - sense rule of “don’t talk to strangers”. This has an impact on the main character, who as a cyclist might have to interact with different people during the journey. The change in this social norm due to the setting can either open up new opportunities for the cyclist or create some awkward situations. Overall, the setting, through the influence of old people on social rules, has a notable effect on the cyclist's experience.
1578	7560	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because real cyclists are well - aware of the appropriate speed for a bike. They have a natural sense of it, so there's no need for anyone to tell them. If a cyclist ever needed some directions, they'd instinctively head to a gas station rather than an old person's house. A true cyclist has great endurance and can keep going for as long as they wish before stopping due to fatigue. They know how to perform tricks on a bike and don't have to repeat them countless times to master them. When it comes to entering a tournament, a real cyclist doesn't just rely on training. They must practice consistently to have a chance of winning. In essence, the setting doesn't change these inherent qualities of a cyclist but can present challenges or opportunities related to these skills.
1579	7561	3	3	"The setting in the story had a substantial effect on the cyclist. The hot, deserted surroundings gradually made the cyclist feel tired and discouraged. For instance, the cyclist observes, ""One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn't hold in the lamest mule greeted me. This sight was trouble."" This quote clearly shows that the old, dilapidated environment filled him with worry. Also, the author states, ""There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind."" In this quote, the cyclist becomes acutely aware of his isolation. This realization initially makes him more discouraged but then spurs him to become more determined to reach his destination. Just think, if you've ever been lost, you know how disheartening it can be when there's no sign of life around. All you can do is keep going and hope to find your way. This very feeling is vividly shown through the cyclist, and it's evident that the setting around him significantly affects his journey."
1580	7562	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One of them is that it was broad daylight, and the intense sunlight bothered the cyclist. The glaring sun made his eyes strain and added to his physical discomfort. Another aspect is that since there was absolutely nothing around him, he felt extremely frustrated. As the cyclist remarks, “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” If there were some signs of civilization, like a small hut or a passing car, he wouldn't feel so frustrated. He would at least have a glimmer of hope to find something useful. In conclusion, the setting's lack of visual landmarks and the harsh sunlight have a negative impact on the cyclist's state of mind and his journey.
1581	7563	3	3	"In the narrative ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist was severely and fatally affected in a negative way by the setting. The cyclist is travelling through “The high deserts of California in June.” The heat was intense, so much so that, in fact, the author realized he could “drop from heatstroke” at any moment. This unbearable heat, combined with the “crippling” hilly terrain, was sufficient to reduce the cyclist to a state of severe dehydration. Clearly, it was not having a positive effect. The sweltering heat and merciless hills of the setting would not have been quite so awful if there had been places to stop, rest, and replenish the cyclist's dwindling water supply. However, “There was no one in sight, not a building, or a structure of any kind.” The cyclist was in complete isolation for over @NUM1 miles of arid desert, the blazing sun bearing down upon him as he struggled up steep, unyielding hills. Clearly, the setting was affecting the cyclist in a horribly negative way, endangering his well - being and making the journey a life - threatening ordeal."
1582	7564	3	3	When riding a bike for a very long time without water is bad, but it becomes even worse when your surroundings offer no relief. For example, when the cyclist has no water, it's a day where there's nothing around him to provide assistance. Without water, he risks passing out and getting severely dehydrated. When he finds no one to help and nothing around him, he resorts to sucking on a pebble to keep his mouth slightly hydrated. This desperate measure shows just how dire his situation is. Therefore, you should always thoroughly check your destination before setting off on a bike ride to avoid such life - threatening situations.
1583	7565	3	3	It is extremely difficult to be outside in intense heat, especially when you're also trying to follow the advice from old folks and riding a bike. If it feels like it is @NUM1 degrees outside, you simply don't need to be out there. It doesn't matter how short or long you are outside for; a heatstroke can strike anyone faster than they can count to @NUM2. Heatstroke is a serious and potentially life - threatening condition, and the risk is heightened when the outside temperature is so high. So, it's best to stay indoors and avoid unnecessary exposure to such extreme heat.
1584	7566	3	3	On the way to @CAPS1, the cyclist was riding through dry, hot weather in rough terrain. The scorching sun and the uneven ground were taking a toll on him, making him extremely tired and dehydrated. Halfway through his journey, as far as his eyes could see, there was nothing for miles. That must have been incredibly discouraging, sapping his remaining energy and willpower. All the way there, he suffered from dehydration. When he finally found water, it was @NUM1 degrees @CAPS2 because of the blistering heat. This warm water was far from ideal but was his only option to try and quench his thirst and prevent further dehydration, highlighting the harshness of his journey.
1585	7567	3	3	Hot, bumpy roads with no shade—all are factors that significantly affect the cyclist on his journey. He was riding along and then the sun started beating down on him relentlessly. He said it felt like the desert, considering the searing heat. At first, the road seemed manageable, but as he went a while down the path, it really started getting rough and became hard to ride on. The lack of shade was particularly miserable because the sun was constantly beating down on him, increasing his discomfort and fatigue. All these reasons clearly show why the cyclist should not have taken those directions in the first place, as they led him into a difficult and unpleasant journey.
1586	7568	3	3	The setting of “Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed the Speed Limit” affects the cyclist in many ways. The words “high deserts of California in June,” from the story clearly show that it is extremely hot and dry. The cyclist gets very tired as the scorching heat drains their energy. In the desert, there aren't big ponds to get water out of, so if you don’t have water, you don’t have anything to quench your thirst and keep your body hydrated. Also, the cyclist suffers the pain and difficulty of having to drive on, over, and down rough terrain. In the story, it is said there was a sign that said “Rough Road Ahead.” There were also obstacles such as tumbleweeds and snakes he had to get around carefully to avoid any harm. The dry, rough, dangerous setting put the cyclist's life in danger, but because of dedication, he got through it, proving his resilience.
1587	7569	3	3	"The features of the setting in “Do Not @CAPS1 Posted Speed Limit” affected the cyclist. The text states, ""Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills,"" (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The initially flat road that was easy to bike on had gradually changed to a series of many hills. These hills made the cyclist's job a lot harder as they had to exert more energy to pedal uphill and control their speed downhill. The biker was negatively affected by this setting because it contributed to his rough times, causing his legs to ache and his breathing to become labored. It also caused him to lose hope as the continuous uphill climbs seemed never - ending. In the end, the challenging terrain took a toll on the cyclist's physical and mental state."
1588	7570	3	3	In the story “Rough Road Ahead” the cyclist is affected by the features of the setting in many ways. One way the cyclist is affected is when they have to cross the hills and plains. The hills make it very hard to pedal when going up hill as the cyclist has to push against gravity, using a great deal of strength in their legs. The steep inclines slow them down significantly. Another way the cyclist is challenged is when he is almost out of water. They need water to survive especially during their long bike ride, as the physical exertion causes them to sweat and lose fluids rapidly. Lastly, the heat the cyclist must endure also affects them. The intense heat makes it hard to stay focused on making the long journey as it can cause dizziness and fatigue. Despite these challenges, the cyclist's determination keeps them going.
1589	7571	3	3	The features effect the setting of the story in a big way. At the beginning of his ride, there are people around and he has no troubles. He pedals along with ease, enjoying the company and the sense of security. After he talks to the old men and starts on his ride to the @NUM1 town, there is no one around. There are no buildings in sight at all and no source of water. The vast emptiness makes the cyclist feel isolated. Since there was no one around, his confidence of actually completing the trip began to go down. Once he arrived at the first town, he noticed that it was an old town and no one was there anymore. This desolate sight made him mad and his confidence dropped a lot. Once he reached the next building, he noticed that there was no one there either and then thought he'd never make it and that he'd die. Once he reached the final place, it was a more occupied setting. There were people around. He then began to feel relieved that he could get water. The setting with no one around made him lose a lot of confidence, but the presence of people at the end gave him a glimmer of hope.
1590	7572	3	3	The features of a setting, such as terrain and weather greatly affect the cyclist who is biking in it. The features of a setting can make the cyclist's trip either easier or harder. Weather can make them use up their water faster or slower. For example, in hot weather, they will sweat more and thus need more water. Rain and bad road conditions could force a cyclist to go slower as they need to be cautious of slippery surfaces. In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the cyclist is slowed down and more fatigued because of the features of the setting he was in. The lack of water and settlements in the area meant he had to ration his water and search for sources, which wasted time. Rough roads did as well, as the uneven surface made it difficult to maintain a steady speed. Hills and animals on the road slowed down the cyclist even more. The hills required extra effort to climb, and the presence of animals made him stop or detour. The features of a setting can help or hinder a cyclist, and in the case of the one in “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the features seriously impaired his bike ride, making it a much more arduous journey than expected.
1591	7573	3	3	The features of the setting in a cycling journey can have a wide - ranging impact on the cyclist. A straight road offers a relatively easy ride, allowing for smooth progress with less effort as the cyclist can maintain a steady pace. In contrast, a bumpy road makes the ride more challenging, causing the cyclist to jump up and down slightly, which can be tiring and may also affect the control of the bike. When cycling in the woods, the environment is cool and a bit dark. The shade from the trees provides relief from the sun, but the dim light might require extra caution. On the other hand, cycling in the desert means facing extremely hot and bright conditions. The heat can be exhausting, and the intense sunlight can be blinding. All these different settings significantly influence the cyclist's experience and performance during the ride.
1592	7574	3	3	The features of the setting in “Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit” greatly affect the cyclist. The sweltering heat in the California desert in the middle of June is a major challenge. It makes the cyclist more thirsty, and the high temperatures can drain energy extremely fast. Cycling under such harsh conditions is far from an enjoyable experience. As the cyclist gets tired and exhausted from the lack of water, riding past the vast empty land has a negative impact on his attitude. When he sees a building, he gets excited, hoping for a water source or a place to rest. But when he discovers it's an abandoned building, his spirits drop significantly. With all the buildings he encounters being empty or abandoned, he probably feels that he can't continue for much longer. However, when he finally reaches the bait store, he likely feels much better and is very relieved to have gotten there before a heat stroke, marking the end of this difficult part of his journey.
1593	7575	3	3	When the cyclist passed through the old towns the old man told him to, the setting played a big part in making his situation harder to overcome. When he passed through the first abandoned town, he was desperate for water. He found a well, but unfortunately, the water source was dry and empty. As described in the text, he “pumped the handle for several minutes but the water would not cool it tasted like battery acid.” This not only left him without the much - needed water but also added to his disappointment. The second drink source he passed was at an abandoned @PERSON1’s Juice factory. There was a sand - blasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth. These two objects made his situation mentally harder to get through because he was so close to what he needed numerous times, only to have it snatched away, leaving him in a more desperate state as he continued his journey.
1594	7576	3	3	The cyclist is affected by multiple factors during his journey. The change in terrain from flat to hilly makes pedaling more strenuous, requiring more energy. The elderly men’s directions also play a role. He tries to save what little water he has left for times when he really needs it, constantly rationing this precious resource. In his search for relief, he looks for a place to cool off and get water. He’s a little bit angry and disappointed with the old men’s directions. According to the directions, he should have covered a certain distance, but in reality, he's going a lot more miles. This makes him start to wonder if the old men have lost their sense of direction. Finally, after a long and arduous journey, he manages to find a place where he can cool off and get water, bringing an end to his difficult situation.
1595	7577	3	3	There are many different features that can influence a cyclist's journey, such as the weather, road condition, and how the person is feeling. The weather can have a significant impact. If it's raining, the roads can become slippery, increasing the risk of accidents. Also, if the roads are already in a bad condition due to the weather, the cyclist could get a flat tire, which would halt his journey. The way the person is feeling is also a big factor. If the cyclist is in a positive and determined mood, they will try hard to overcome the challenges. Conversely, if they are feeling low or unmotivated, they may not worry about the difficulties too much, which could affect the overall quality and progress of their ride. All these features interact to shape the cyclist's experience.
1596	7578	3	3	According to the essay, the features of the setting significantly affect the cyclist. If the cyclist is in the middle of a scorching hot desert in June with no water supply, the cyclist will become excessively thirsty as the journey progresses. For example, the author states, “I had been hitting my bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high desert of California in June.” As the terrain changes from flat land to short, rolling hills, it forces the cyclist to push herself harder to reach the next town to get water. For instance, she states, “Over one long, crippling hill, a building came into view.” This makes the cyclist use what they thought was their last burst of energy to get down there, but unfortunately, the building was abandoned, which leaves the cyclist feeling let down. As the cyclist continues on, a setting of a bait store appears, and the cyclist feels a sense of relief because now she can finally get water. These examples clearly show the change of setting on the cyclist’s trip and how it had a direct impact on her.
1597	7579	3	3	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” a cyclist was on a mission to reach Yosemite National Park. He decided to follow the “shortcut” that some old men gave him, instead of taking the longer, more reliable route. These old men, however, had no real idea what they were talking about, so the cyclist ended up taking a path filled with more obstacles. When the cyclist was in desperate need of more water, he came across “several rusty pumps.” Despite his efforts, no water would come out of these pumps, so he had no choice but to keep going in search of water. As he moved forward in his travels, he noted that “Flat roads were replaced by short, rolling hills.” Without any water, he did not have much strength left to face these rolling hills, but he had no alternative. The cyclist had to go on for miles without seeing anyone or anything. He described, “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” His troubles finally came to an end after getting directions from another man at a fish camp, which allowed him to get back on track.
1598	7580	3	3	The setting adds a strong sense of urgency. The cyclist is running out of water and is right in the middle of the desolate desert. If he had been in a forest or the suburbs, the situation would not be so grave. He starts to talk about the possibility of passing out and dying. He exclaims, “It didn’t really matter. I was going to die and the birds were going to pick me clean.” This shows how the harsh desert setting has put him in a life - threatening situation and emphasizes the importance of the setting in determining his fate.
1599	7581	3	3	In the story “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist was greatly affected by the road ahead. He took advice that he believed was right at the time, thinking it would lead him to his destination more quickly. However, it turned out to be wrong advice. As a result, it took him off track from the goal he was trying to reach. This shows that blindly following advice without proper verification can have negative consequences for the cyclist's journey.
1600	7582	3	3	The way the settings affect the cyclist is extremely cruel. First, the cyclist made the mistake of taking directions from someone who has not left their porch in decades. Once he accepted and used these directions, a series of problems occurred. One of the main problems is that the cyclist faced a severe lack of water supply. Additionally, the cyclist had unexpected encounters with snakes, which added to his distress. Moreover, the directions were way off, so he had to travel a much longer distance than he initially thought. Also, when he finally arrived at his supposed destination after a long journey, he found a deserted town. All these negative experiences due to the settings and bad directions teach the cyclist a valuable lesson. So, in conclusion, the cyclist decides to use his own judgment and directions from now on to avoid similar misfortunes.
1601	7583	3	3	As the setting changes in the story, so does the cyclist’s narrator’s mood. His mood changes from happy and confident to indifferent and scared. At first, the cyclist is extremely happy about his journey to Yosemite. He is completely care - free, with no worries at all. He says that, “I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face,” feeling full of energy and enthusiasm. Even at his first “ghost town,” he just casually “chuckled, checked my water supply, and moved on,” not bothered by the desolate sight. After this point, he could not remain so care - free. After this town, he came across “One ramshackle shed, several thirsty pumps, and men.” He said, “this was troubling.” The sun was blazing, and it was very hot. He had been drinking his water pretty often to combat the heat. He said that, “He failed on.” He started to get sort of scared as he realized that he could “drop from a heatstroke.” He was scared that because of his decision to believe the old men, he might possibly die in this desolate place. He finally got happy when he reached the bait shop and was able to get his much - needed drink. From then on, he stuck to his map. His attitude changed greatly throughout the story, a clear reflection of how the setting influenced his emotions.
1602	7584	3	3	In “Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit,” the cyclist is significantly affected by his surroundings. He is leaving the old water pump, eagerly heading towards Yosemite. As he pedals on, “Not two miles flat road was replaced by short rolling hills. The speed limit was 55. I was doing a water - depleting @NUM1.” This clearly shows that as the terrain gets rougher and more challenging, it becomes much harder for the cyclist to continue. The hills require more physical effort, making him sweat more and thus deplete his water supply at a faster rate. Also, since he is already approaching the point of dehydration, it is extremely difficult for the already tired cyclist to go on any further, let alone make it all the way to Yosemite. That is how the terrain, with its changing nature, has a substantial impact on the cyclist's journey.
1603	7585	3	3	The setting affected the cyclist by making him very hot. The scorching sun bore down on him relentlessly. He said he started sucking on stones because he heard that if you suck on stones it makes you not thirsty. He was desperate to relieve his parched throat. He also said he might hit a bump and accidentally swallow one of the rocks, yet he even admitted that he wanted to swallow the rocks. The reason for that was that he was so hot and his mind was addled by the heat. He didn’t even know where he was going, lost in the heat - induced haze, a clear indication of how severely the setting had affected him.
1604	7586	3	3	The features of the setting did not help the cyclist on his trip. First of all, he was in the desert on a bike! The arid desert environment with its intense heat and lack of humidity made him dehydrate faster. His body was constantly losing water through sweating as he pedaled under the blazing sun. Secondly, the “towns” around the way had been abandoned. These once - inhabited places now stood as desolate ruins, leaving no place to get more water and no place to ask for directions. He was left wandering in the vast expanse of the desert, with no guidance. Lastly, there were no other people around. In a situation like this, if the cyclist was to get into trouble, such as a bike breakdown or a medical emergency, he wouldn't be able to find help. Overall, the setting presented numerous obstacles that hindered his journey.
1605	7587	3	3	The features of the settings affect the cyclist for many reasons such as dehydration and the road potentially causing the bike to stop working. Since there is a severe lack of water in the desert, as far as the cyclist can tell, he could get dehydrated easily. The intense heat of the desert sun beats down on him, causing him to sweat profusely and lose a large amount of water. The high temperatures can also lead to heat exhaustion and other heat - related illnesses. The road that he is riding on is rough and full of debris. The sharp rocks and uneven surface might cause the tires to pop. A flat tire would leave him stranded in the middle of the desert, making it even more difficult for him to continue his journey. These features of the setting pose significant challenges to the cyclist's trip.
1606	7588	3	3	The cyclist was extremely eager to get to Yosemite park. He listened intently to the “old timers who haven’t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office”. He followed the way the old men told him to take. He went swiftly down a hill into a town which was completely empty, onto a hard road with snakes slithering in his way. Then he pedaled up a hill and then went down the hill, where he saw an abandoned “Welch’s Grape Juice Factory”. Then he spotted a sign that said “Gary And Wilber’s FISH CAMP - IF YOU WANT BAIT FOR THE BIG ONES, WE’RE YOUR BEST BET!” So then he rushed into the bathroom and drank from the sink. Before he got there, he was getting increasingly thirsty and tired. When he saw the abandoned building, he saw a young boy drinking a juice. He rubbed his eyes hard to see if he wasn't seeing a mirage. So then he stuck a few pebbles into his mouth. It read that sucking on stones help take your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you have left to circulate. Then he left, and suddenly a stone went down his throat. His troubles, thirst, and fear were all left behind him when he saw that sign, and he felt a glimmer of hope for the rest of his journey.
1607	7589	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many significant ways. One prominent feature of the setting was the intense heat. It affected him severely by quickly getting him dehydrated. For example, the text clearly states, “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips; I could drop from a heat - stroke.” This meant that the scorching heat was really getting to him, making his journey extremely difficult and potentially dangerous. As a result, his physical and mental state was deteriorating due to the lack of proper hydration in such high - temperature conditions.
1608	7590	3	3	The author made the setting seem long and unbearable, filled with an undesirable heat and a lack of water at hand. Specially in the way he kept describing the road with all these challenges that kept appearing. For instance, after @NUM1 miles to a town and then @NUM2 miles passed that, he wrote, “I came to a park of … One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn't hold in the tamest mule greeted me. This sight was truly troubling.” Then he went into a tirade, “I was traveling straight through the high deserts of California in June. @CAPS1 … imagine, the blistering heat, and the unbearable nature of the … journey still I face. @CAPS1 that bike has seen endless miles. Then with a thrust gaining on him, for example, “I was doing a water - depleting 12 mph; it's clear life can be cruel.” @CAPS1 made him feel his constraint and regret on the journey. It also made me feel his constraint and sorrow for his endless journey he had to go through. Another example is, “I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure I wasn't seeing a mirage.” Then, reaching this, the building abandoned years ago. @CAPS1 made his journey seem hopeless and long, filled with endless problems as the first wave of issues got stronger. @CAPS1 made his journey seem to be harder and filled with little hope as his strength left to finish his goals, leaving him in a seemingly never - ending struggle.
1609	7591	3	3	In the story, “Do not exceed postal speed limit,” many features of the setting have a profound impact on the cyclist. First and most importantly, he is significantly affected by the people who live there. “Never accept travel advice from a group of old - timers who haven’t left the confines of their porch since Carter was in office.” This quote vividly describes the feelings the cyclist has towards the old men. Because he listened to their directions, he ended up traveling through ghost towns and was on the verge of dying from dehydration constantly. Also, the lack of people and civilization in the area affected the author greatly. There was no one around that he could ask for help from. “… but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.” Here, the author is trying to stop for water, but since no one lives in the town anymore, he gets none. Finally, the lack of water has a huge and detrimental effect on the cyclist. “That smoky blues tune ‘Summer time’ rattled around in the dry honeycombs of my deteriorating brain.” This describes how the author is really dehydrated and he feels like his brain is drying up. However, his desperate need for water makes him more determined than ever to keep going until he reaches another town or his goal destination of reaching Yosemite National Park, pushing through all the hardships.
1610	7592	3	3	The features of the setting affect the man in many ways. One way is that when the man notices the terrain starting to change gradually, he becomes more and more distraught. He sees the sign that says “Rough road ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit.” It is almost as if he thinks the sign is deliberately mocking him. Also, when the rider says “In an @CAPS1 twist that should please all sadists …” he is clearly telling the reader that this situation is very ironic and that he was expecting nothing good to come from this change in the terrain. The combination of the changing terrain and this ironic situation is really taking a toll on his mental state, making his journey even more difficult to endure.
1611	7593	3	3	In the story I read, the setting is a significant factor affecting the cyclist. For instance, it describes how the cyclist spots a sign that clearly states, “Rough road ahead! Do not exceed posted speed limit.” This warning forces the cyclist to be extremely cautious while riding. As a result, the cyclist has to adjust their pace and riding style to navigate the rough road safely. Thus, the setting plays a crucial role in influencing the cyclist's actions.
1612	7594	3	3	The cyclist was in a truly horrible and nasty environment for cycling. The terrain was rough, and the heat was intense. However, the thing that really threw the cyclist off was running out of water. There were no houses nearby to refill his bottle, and there was no one around to give him updated directions. The sweltering heat made him drink more water rapidly and also made it harder for him to breathe in the extreme conditions. Without these unfortunate faults, the cyclist would have been able to continue his journey smoothly.
1613	7595	3	3	I think that the features of the setting affected the cyclist in numerous ways. For example, he talks about various challenges he had to endure while he was riding. He was severely parched as he had no water. There was a huge snake that took up half of the road, leaving him with limited space to pass. Moreover, there wasn't a building in sight. The desolate setting filled him with doubt, but he maintained the confidence of reaching his destination. When he finally got there, it was a clear sign of relief. That's how the setting affected him.
1614	7596	3	3	The setting in the story affected the cyclist physically and mentally. Physically, it took a toll on him due to the rough terrain and the intense heat as he was in a desert and in the mountains. Also, because he didn't follow his plan on the map, he had no clue where he was. The anxiety of being lost and facing such harsh conditions undoubtedly took a toll on his physical well - being. Mentally, every town he passed through or every building he passed was deserted. Not knowing where any people were stressed him out greatly. This mental stress messed him up, and he even thought he was going to die, which is extremely detrimental to anyone. I really think he should just do what he believes is right and not listen to crazy old men anymore. Maps are reliable as they don't go crazy, don't really get outdated quickly, and don't lie to you. So, he has obviously learned his lesson from this experience.
1615	7597	3	3	Some of the features, like the change in landscape, significantly affected the cyclist. Transitioning from flat land to miniature hills and then to highways is quite difficult to cope with. This is especially true considering he was dehydrated and had no water. The varying landscapes required different levels of effort and riding techniques. The lack of water further exacerbated his struggle, making it even more challenging for him to adapt to these changes. Overall, the combination of the changing landscape and his dehydration had a substantial impact on the cyclist's journey.
1616	7598	3	3	The features of the setting in the essay “Rough Road Ahead” affected the speaker by presenting a series of challenges. In the arid environment, dehydration became a real threat as the sun beat down relentlessly. The presence of dangerous animals, like venomous snakes, added an element of peril, and the rough terrain made every step a struggle. All these were designed to teach him a valuable lesson about following the travelling advice from old men. In the essay, he started out confidently on his journey after following “their advice,” reasoning that the men seemed to have “no sense of themselves when pointing out landmarks and spouting off town.” As he progressed, the setting changed from a relatively cool and pleasant area to a dry and barren expanse, with the mention of tumbleweeds indicating the harshness of the new environment. It even turned dangerous when a diamondback snake blocked his path. In the end, the setting changed back to a more comfortable state, allowing him to learn his lesson through the hardship of the setting's features and follow his own map from then on.
1617	7599	3	3	The features of the environmental setting are significantly affecting the cyclist. A setting encompasses a specific time and place where an event occurs, and along with the setting, there are features which serve as background descriptions, essentially providing additional information about the subject or idea. The features, combined with the setting, are interfering with the cyclist in multiple ways. The hot temperature in Lodi, California, is making the cyclist, or biker, feel hotter than usual as he heads in the wrong direction, ever closer to the hot, blazing, scorching desert. In addition to this, he is running out of water rapidly and is beginning to get increasingly exhausted from the intense heat. He is starting to lose consciousness and is becoming dehydrated. This is a major problem for the character because he is losing his sense of direction, and as a result, he is getting more panicked as his supply of water is running extremely low. An instance of the environmental setting affecting the cyclist is “I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. The water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of dried sweat circled my skirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June” (Joe Kurmaskie, @NUM1). Another example is “This sight was troubling. I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly and I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June” (Joe Kurmaskie, @NUM2). The hotness and heat had also increased the character's panic while decreasing his confidence in himself. An instance of this is “I began breaking the ride down into distances I could see on the horizon, telling myself that if I could make it this far, I'd be fine” (Joe Kurmaskie, @NUM1). In conclusion, the hot setting in California had affected the cyclist in a number of ways. It had exhausted his water supply, causing him to become exhausted, dehydrated, and lose his logical sense to make decisions. However, his desperate situation also propelled him to strive towards the roads and a nearby town that was about twenty miles away in order to get water so that he could survive.
1618	7600	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in the essay “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaskie in many notable ways. One significant way the setting affected the cyclist was when the temperature soared and the rider started running out of water. The sweltering heat in the area made the cyclist's situation increasingly dire. Another way the cyclist was affected by the setting was when he mentioned that “he could die of heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because he listened to some gentlemen who hadn't been off their porch in decades,” a statement that caused him to reflect on his choices. A third way the cyclist was affected was when he went inside the bait shop and was able to cool down, providing a brief respite from the harsh conditions. Lastly, when he rehydrated himself, it was a crucial moment that alleviated some of the immediate threats. Clearly, the setting was a main factor influencing the cyclist in the essay “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaskie on his way to Yosemite National Park.
1619	7601	3	3	The cyclist made the choice to ride through the worst terrain one can encounter on a bike. He bravely rode through deserts and deserted towns. At the beginning of his journey, he wasn't tired or thirsty because in the morning, he was riding past cool trees and alongside rushing water, which provided a refreshing and pleasant environment. However, once he reached the desert part of his route, where there was no water source in sight, he started to feel thirsty and began to drink his water. Unfortunately, his water supply depleted fast due to the high temperatures and the physical exertion. The lack of a water source in the dry desert can make anyone thirsty on its own, but after riding for a while, the situation became even worse. The setting had everything to do with the cyclist's predicament of having no water and fearing that he was going to die from heatstroke. That's precisely how the setting affected the cyclist, highlighting the importance of a suitable environment for a long - distance bike ride.
1620	7602	3	3	The setting had a profound impact on the cyclist's mood in the story. The cyclist was riding through rough terrain and over rolling hills, which made the journey seem extremely difficult. This made the cyclist feel like his journey was hopeless, as each pedal stroke was a struggle. When the cyclist arrived at the abandoned @CAPS1 Grape Factory, he experienced a twist of fate. He was extremely thirsty, and since there used to be a @ORGANIZATION1 building there, he had hoped to find some water when he reached the fork in the road. However, when this attempt failed, the cyclist became even less determined. He felt as if the world was against him, with the unforgiving setting constantly challenging his resolve and making his journey an uphill battle in every sense.
1621	7603	3	3	The settings affected the cyclist significantly, because wherever he went, it seemed as if the journey would never end. Like when he was riding along the path the old men told him to take. He went through a ghost - town, just as they had said he would pass through a town. The desolate streets and empty buildings added to the sense of endlessness. Then he kept on going, but the road seemed to stretch on forever, and the intense summer heat started to take its toll on him. As he began to dehydrate, he spotted an old juice factory. In his delirium, he started imagining that he was drinking cool, refreshing juice. So, he started seeing things, and his mind wandered in the heat - induced haze. Eventually, his senses returned, and he pressed on, hoping to reach his destination.
1622	7604	3	3	As the author cycles through this shortcut, he finds himself in a perilously dangerous setting. As stated in the poem, he is in the high deserts of California in June. A desert environment makes the heat almost unbearable for the cyclist. It's just the blazing sun, the endless expanse of sand, and him all alone. The mention of the month being summer, of course, means that the temperatures for the cyclist soar to around @NUM1 degrees, and it could even be hotter. This extreme heat could cause him to drink plenty of water at a rapid pace, and he almost loses all of his water supply. As the text says, “The water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips.” Then there is the long distance of his ride. The author is constantly saying “About @NUM2 miles” or “Twenty miles up the road.” All of this strenuous work in the searing heat can cause heatstroke and potentially kill him if he doesn't find help soon.
1623	7605	3	3	The features of the setting, like the desert, the sun, and abandoned towns, affect the cyclist a great deal. The dry desert makes him feel as if he were pedaling on an endless loop. He probably often wonders if he is ever going to make it to a town. The relentless sun beats down on him, making him even hotter than he already is. It makes him sweat profusely and leaves him even more parched. The abandoned towns, with their empty streets and dilapidated buildings, make him lose hope in finding water or even reaching Yosemite. The mood of this story shifts from content to sad to happy. He is content after riding to the first town, enjoying the brief respite. But then, as the rest of the towns he encounters are also abandoned and he starts to run out of water, he thinks he is going to die, which makes the mood sad. Then, his spirits lift and he becomes happy when he finds the bait shop and discovers a much - needed supply of water.
1624	7606	3	3	In “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affect the cyclist negatively. The story takes place in June in California. This is a particularly hot time of the year in such a desert location. The sweltering heat adds to the speed at which the cyclist becomes dehydrated. It also impairs his ability to think as coherently as he could had he not been in a desert in June. The cyclist is also travelling through desolate, uninhabited land. The author says, “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” This description emphasizes the character's total lack of resources. There is nowhere within his line of sight that he can turn to for help, water, food, or shelter. The road was also rough, being plagued with many rolling, crippling hills. Such challenging terrain is much harder to maneuver, especially when the cyclist is in such a desperate state of despair. Overall, the setting of the story, “Rough Road Ahead,” greatly impacts the cyclist's journey and well - being.
1625	7607	3	3	There are a lot of things that affect the cyclist, such as the blistering heat, the lack of water, the rough roads, and the long trip. The cyclist is out in a desert, so it is extremely hot. The narration says, “and the growing realization that I could die drop from heatstroke” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). This clearly means that he or she was very hot and severely dehydrated. The roads were very rough; for example, a sign read “ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The roads became bumpy, and there were numerous hills the cyclist had to laboriously go over. There was no water available either. So, he/she was rapidly running out of energy, and it made the journey even more difficult. In the end, after enduring all these hardships, the cyclist survived and drank a large amount of water to replenish their depleted body.
1626	7608	3	3	The features of the desolate setting affect the cyclist in a very harmful way. The sweltering hot temperature and the boiling sun beating down made the author feel extremely hot and rapidly took his energy away. The vast emptiness of the setting can easily make a person lose hope of finding any sign of civilization. The narrator said, “It was a sad, hopeless laugh, mind you...” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). That is not the last of the harmful aspects of the setting; the dry desert air has the biggest impact on his life. The parched air makes him more desperately thirsty for water he doesn't have, causing him to dehydrate at a faster rate. The narrator said, “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The lonely and dreadful features of the setting the cyclist was in made the situation so much worse as he had no water, which put his life at great risk.
1627	7609	3	3	In ‘Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,’ a cyclist follows some ill - advised guidance, which leads him on a grueling ride through the arid desert with a meager supply of water. The setting has a large effect on the cyclist because it causes him to become severely dehydrated, which presents the main conflict of the story. “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips,” the author states when his fresh water supply begins to dwindle. Another factor the setting presents to the cyclist is the searing heat of the California desert. This intense heat exacerbates the cyclist's thirst and speeds up his dehydration. The reader can tell it is unpleasantly hot when reading, “wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt… that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June…” The rough, uneven roads and the challenging, hilly terrain also present a significant challenge to the cyclist, slowing his advance to Yosemite and making his journey even more arduous.
1628	7610	3	3	The cyclist is significantly affected by the features of the desolate setting. The cyclist has been steadily pedaling his bike in the direction that the old men told him to go in order to reach Yosemite. As he continues, soon he runs out of water and becomes extremely tired. He starts to believe that he will die soon as the harsh conditions take a toll on him. But then, to his great relief, he stumbles upon a fish camp. He rushes into the bathroom to revive himself with some water and a moment of rest. When he comes out, a man is sitting on the porch. The author gets clear directions from him and is overjoyed to know that he is on the right track again, giving him new hope for his journey.
1629	7611	3	3	There are many effects of the setting in this essay that can be either good or bad. The setting is a solitary, empty mountain road, with no houses in sight, no passing cars, and no other people around. Now, I'm going to detail some good and bad effects. One good effect is that you are by yourself, so while you exercise, you can fully relax and enjoy the natural energy of the surroundings. One bad thing is that what if you pop a tire or encounter some other problem and need help. You'll be stuck because there's no one around to assist you. Another good thing is that being by yourself, you won't encounter any cars. You don't have to worry about getting hit, so you'll be able to just unwind and enjoy the ride. Another bad thing is that there is no readily available water source, so you might want to bring plenty of it with you. So, whatever you decide to do, just be careful and thoroughly think your idea through before embarking on this journey.
1630	7612	3	3	The setting or environment the cyclist was in made him feel completely isolated from the rest of the world. He was well - aware that there was no turning back once he started his adventurous journey. There was no one there to offer him any assistance. The desolate environment made him acutely realize the many risks involved in this adventure. The knowledge that there was no immediate help available served as his driving force to continue on his long and challenging journey, as he knew he had to rely on his own strength and determination to reach his destination.
1631	7613	3	3	In the essay “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”, the features of the setting significantly affect the cyclist as he has to cross different types of landmarks. First, he sought information from the old people. When he showed the map to the old folks, they were only familiar with the old short - cuts and not the new ones, which made his navigation more difficult. Second, when he ran out of water, the situation worsened. As the cyclist ran out of water, he still had to climb the steep hills, and this physical exertion tired him out. Moreover, when he tried to get water from a certain source, only hot water came out, which was of no use to him. Last, when he finally reached a store, the old guy had his own map. When he asked the old guy about the place he was going to, the old man simply said “I have my own map”. From this, he knew he was in trouble. In conclusion, these are the ways in which the features of the setting affected the cyclist.
1632	7614	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. The setting was extremely hot, and there were numerous hills. The cyclist had been laboriously riding up and down these hills all day, and it consumed a great deal of his energy. When he saw the building that he thought could offer him help, he said, “... last burst of energy, I maneuvered down the hill.” By making this statement, it clearly showed that the hilly terrain of the area where he was located took up all his energy. That is how the setting had a significant impact on the cyclist.
1633	7615	3	3	In the short story Rough Road ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Limit, by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting have a notable effect on the cyclist. When at the old codgers' house, he is full of confidence as they tell him about a shortcut to Yosemite. This gives him the self - assurance he needs. As he leaves, he still retains that confidence. However, as the setting changes, so does the mood of the cyclist. After “about @NUM1 miles into the pedal”, the cyclist arrives at the first town. He is filled with despair because it is a ghost town. Despite still having a bit of confidence, the lack of water forces him to continue on. After a couple more miles, he comes to a small fork with a pump. Thinking it would provide cool water, he goes to pump it. To his dismay, he finds out it is @NUM2∞@CAPS1 and tastes like “battery acid”. Now, he is desperate, with no water, dehydrated, and no towns in sight. He begins to pedal and pedal, hoping to find a town around. When he does find a town with water, the setting becomes relieving and better for him as he finally finds water. In the end, the setting causes the cyclist to swing from confident, to desperate as his water supply runs out, and then to relieved when water is found.
1634	7616	3	3	This would be a hard risk to begin with, but the cyclist is taking it in the desert. As we all are well - aware, the desert can reach boiling temperatures, so what could have been an enjoyable bike ride quickly turns into a strenuous ordeal. Also, when the only things you see for miles are the long, desolate road, the endless sand, and an empty factory, your morale can easily drain away. It's just an overall desolate setting that makes one feel lost and hopeless. In such a setting, the cyclist's journey becomes fraught with challenges and a constant battle against the harsh environment.
1635	7617	3	3	The features of the setting make the cyclist feel utterly hopeless after realizing he is not on a short - cut. As the cyclist rides along under the scorching sun, he has the “growing realization that [he] could drop from heatstroke”. Also, the only building he sees for miles “had been @NUM1 Welch's Grape Juice Factory”. When he spots this building, he is driven deeper into despair and feels that all hope is lost. As he continues to ride, the song “'@ORGANIZATION2' rattled around in the dry honeycombs of (his) deteriorating brain.” At this point, the cyclist firmly believes his own death to be inevitable. When talking about the pebbles he placed in his mouth, he says “with any luck Iíd hit a bump and lodge one in my throat”. Finally, the cyclist reaches a small bait shop, and all hope is restored as he “drank deeply from the sink.” The desert setting, with its lack of water, shelter, and people, was the root cause of this man's concern and later panic about his own life. The hopelessness of this cyclist is much like the hopelessness of those in the @ORGANIZATION1, who, trapped in a blizzard far from civilization, resorted to eating their dead just to survive. While the @PERSON1 @ORGANIZATION1 went to extreme lengths for their survival, their setting caused them to experience the same overwhelming hopelessness as the cyclist.
1636	7618	3	3	The effect of cycling is very challenging and trending because a lot of things can go wrong. For instance, you can feel extremely hot, and even drinking water wouldn't cool you down; it simply didn't matter. When you took a drop of water into your mouth, it had the unpleasant flavor of battery acid. On a gorgeous day in June, he or anyone could just drop from a heatstroke. It was so hot that you started seeing things. Even the thought of a townsperson pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still leave you parched and suffering in the sweltering heat.
1637	7619	3	3	The features of the setting dramatically affected the cyclist. He set out on his journey in a highly confident mood, full of enthusiasm for the adventure ahead. However, his spirits started to dampen when he arrived at a town that was completely deserted. There were no signs of life, just empty streets and abandoned buildings. His confidence was still relatively high at this point, but it was not as unwavering as it was prior to coming upon the ghost town. Twenty miles up the road after that, he came to a fork in the road. There, he found a ramshackle shed with rusty, unclean pumps, and a small corral that looked like it hadn't been used in ages. The desert was swelteringly hot, and his lack of water was quickly dehydrating him. Paragraph @NUM1 states, “This sight was troubling… I had been hitting my water bottles regularly, and was traveling through the high deserts in California.” With little water left and a short energy supply, he was getting tired and dehydrated at an alarming rate. The land then started turning into rolling hills, which required more effort to pedal through, causing him to become even more exhausted. His mood had completely shifted from confident to hopeless. He even contemplated changing a diary entry in case he died of heatstroke. Clearly, the features of the setting greatly affected the mood of the cyclist. Sometimes disappointment can come from taking the so - called “easy way out,” as this cyclist might have thought this route would be simple, but the harsh setting proved otherwise.
1638	7620	3	3	In the story, the setting affected the cyclist all through the story until he arrived at Body and Wilbers Fish Camp. As the man rides his bike for a while, he starts out in high spirits. But as he pedals into the first town, it seems to be a ghost town. There are no people around, and the buildings look abandoned. As he continues to pedal on, “The sun was beginning to beat down but I barely noticed it.” At that time, the weather is affecting him a great deal. The scorching sun is making the air thick and hot, but he keeps the thought of Yosemite's cool pines and rushing rivers in his head, using it as motivation to keep going. He also only has a few tantalizing sips left in his water bottle while going up a big hill. The steep incline of the hill makes his legs burn, and the lack of water makes his throat dry and parched. Despite these hardships, he presses on, driven by the hope of reaching his destination.
1639	7621	3	3	The setting of this essay serves the purpose of guiding cyclists on where to go without getting them lost. It provides clear directions and descriptions of the routes to ensure that cyclists can navigate safely. Additionally, it emphasizes the importance of not blindly taking advice from old people. Sometimes, the advice they give might be based on outdated information or personal experiences that don't necessarily apply to the current situation. By following the guidance in this essay, cyclists can have a more enjoyable and stress - free journey. In conclusion, this essay plays a crucial role in helping cyclists plan their trips and avoid potential pitfalls.
1640	7622	3	3	The features in the setting greatly affect the cyclist. The setting was extremely hot, with the sun beating down relentlessly, and the terrain was rough, filled with uneven ground and rocky patches. The cyclist was not only tired from the strenuous pedaling but also desperately thirsty. The cyclist said, “Over one long, crippling hill, a building came into view.” This indicates that he needed water so much that the sight of a building gave him a glimmer of hope. The hill was so big and demanding that it sapped his energy, and his thirst only added to his misery. Also, he says, “Summertime ‘rattled around in the dry honeycombs of my deteriorating brain’.” It is summer time where he is riding, and to keep his mind off of his intense thirst, he hums the song “Summertime.” He wants to show that despite the overwhelming heat, he has the mental strength to not let it overtake his body. Moreover, he says, “At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake.” He is highlighting that the terrain is not only physically challenging but also potentially deadly because of the snake that slithered by him. Despite all these obstacles and objections, he is determined to show that he could overcome anything. As you can see, the setting greatly affected the cyclist, testing his physical and mental limits throughout his journey.
1641	7623	3	3	Many things can affect a cyclist. But in the story, three main features of the sweltering setting affected the cyclist the most. While the cyclist was vigorously riding, the scorching sun was beating down, and it was extremely hot. We know this by carefully looking back at the text. It gives us this vivid quote, “That I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June.” Because it was so hot, the cyclist's body was quickly losing moisture, and this could make the cyclist desperately thirsty. Another prominent feature of the setting was the multitude of steep hills. These hills, with their varying gradients, would create intense exhaustion for the cyclist. We know there were many hills because in the text it clearly says, “Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.” Going over all those arduous hills can really tire someone out. A third significant feature of the setting would be nature. Nature can affect us in many ways, by weather, by terrain, and as in this case, by animals. In the story, the cyclist unexpectedly comes upon a large, menacing snake lying across the path. This encounter makes the situation extremely dangerous. The setting can affect anything. It would have been a totally different story if the cyclist had been in the summer during @DATE1, not June. The setting's influence on the cyclist's journey is a crucial element that shapes the entire experience.
1642	7624	3	3	In the essay “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed @CAPS1,” the setting is artfully used to subtly alter the cyclist's mood and as a clear reflection of his challenging situation. For example, the evocative statement “the cool pines and rushing river of Yosemite had my name written all over them” helps precisely describe the cyclist's desperate situation. The vivid idea of lush, cool water vegetation gives the @CAPS4 a glimmer of much - needed hope during his increasingly hellish trip. The breathtaking beauty of that idyllic setting also reflects on the comforting relief that would come from finally reaching Yosemite; the good setting equals a promising outcome. Later on, the cyclist comes across “one ramshackle shed, several rusted pumps, and a corral that couldn't hold in the lamest male.” This is a dismal, depressing setting symbolizing a complete loss of hope. And indeed at this point, the cyclist becomes deeply troubled by his dire situation. While laboriously pedaling through the vast desert, the cyclist becomes even more frustrated when tumbleweeds, which are always a classic symbol of a deserted area, come blowing by. The use of setting to affect and mirror mood is nothing new. There are many well - known examples of this literary technique throughout history. For example, in his story “The @CAPS2 of @CAPS3 @PERSON1.” @CAPS4 @PERSON1 was a desolate land filled with wild beasts to symbolize and cause @PERSON2 to change his personality, surrounded by uncivilized people and creating a situation where @PERSON2 tears his clothes and hunts like a dog. The setting of a desert in the uncultured part of colonial times simultaneously causes and reflects on this change. The setting in the essay “Do Not Exceed posted Speed Limit” is used as an important tool for character development, effectively showing how the environment can shape a character's emotions and experiences.
1643	7625	3	3	The features of the essay clearly explain how the features of the setting affect the cyclist for many compelling reasons. When the author writes “tumbleweeds crossed my path,” it vividly shows that he is most likely in the middle of a desolate nowhere. This is true because tumbleweeds are commonly known as signs in movies and TV shows that the place is deserted. Also, when the author writes “the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke” and when he writes “a ridiculously large snake,” it shows the increasing danger that he is getting himself into. This is true because the snakes could strike at any time, or he could just collapse from the severe lack of water and die. Lastly, the name of the store is relevant because it is a fish bait store, and he is extremely thirsty. This is relevant because fish live in water, and seeing the sign briefly relieves him completely. Therefore, the features of this essay explain how the features of the setting affect the cyclist, highlighting the strong connection between the environment and the cyclist's well - being.
1644	7626	3	3	The cyclist is faced with numerous daunting challenges on his long and arduous journey to Yosemite, one of which is the grueling task of travelling through the vast California deserts. This was quite a formidable challenge because a desert is extremely hot and dry, and the relentless sun beats down on the cyclist. Plus, the author was strenuously riding his bike, causing himself to become more and more thirsty and hot as the journey progressed. He also unexpectedly encountered a big snake that appeared to be a venomous diamondback. The snake was so large that it almost covered the narrow road, but the cyclist managed to avoid it with quick reflexes. The author also had to deal with the unforgiving rough terrain when he rode his bike through the hilly areas. The steep inclines and uneven ground made the ride even more difficult. The biker met the challenges and progressed through them with remarkable bravery, showing his determination to reach his destination.
1645	7627	3	3	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed Speed limit,” the many different settings took a significant toll on the cyclist. For example, in the beginning, he started out with a seemingly nice and smooth ride. But the sweltering heat was already making the journey uncomfortable. Then he began to encounter short rolling hills which were gradually taking their toll on his tired legs. Each pedal up the incline required more and more effort. Then he entered into a rough area filled with potholes and uneven ground where he had to be extremely careful. The roughness probably wore him out from all the constant bumps and bounces. He went through a lot on that bike trip. Who knows, he @MONTH1 might have never made it back to where he was staying. The various settings throughout the journey played a crucial role in shaping the cyclist's experience and highlighting the challenges he faced.
1646	7628	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by making it notably harder for him to pedal and complete his ride. For example, the initially “flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” This change in terrain should make his trip considerably harder because instead of being able to pedal at one consistent rate throughout the journey, he would have to start pedaling harder when going uphill and then ease off when going downhill, repeating this cycle over and over again, thus using more energy. Another example is, “through the high deserts of California in June.” This makes it extremely difficult for him because he has to do all his cycling work in a scorching summer heat. Finally, the first three stops he made had nowhere to fill his water bottles, take a refreshing drink, or cool off. This would make it hard because he is gradually becoming dehydrated during his whole trip. These are some prominent features of the setting that affect the cyclist by making his trip more arduous.
1647	7629	3	3	One feature that affected the cyclist was the rolling hills. The text states “two miles into the section... I noticed the terrain changing gradually. As the flat ground started to give way to gentle slopes, I could feel the extra effort required with each pedal stroke. The rolling hills presented an unexpected challenge, forcing the cyclist to adjust his rhythm and exert more energy to keep moving forward. This change in the terrain clearly had an impact on the cyclist's journey, making it more difficult than he initially anticipated.
1648	7630	3	3	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” the setting affects the story significantly for many reasons. First, it is in the summer, so the sun beats down relentlessly, making it very hot. Also, it is in the desert in the west, where there is already a very warm climate due to the arid conditions. Third, there is not any sign of civilization on the “shortcut” he follows. The desolate landscape means there is no way for the author to get any water to replenish his body with. This lack of access to water in the sweltering heat is a major hindrance to the cyclist. This is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist in the story, making his journey a challenging one.
1649	7631	3	3	The setting affects the cyclist a great deal. If it was windy too, it would be hard for the cyclist to control the bike steadily. The strong gusts of wind could push the bike off - course, making the ride precarious. Also, if there were a lot of buildings and people outside, there would be a great deal of traffic. In such a situation, the cyclist would not be allowed to pass through easily, and they would have to turn back. On the other hand, if it was a clear road with no people around and no buildings or houses in sight, then it would be a smooth and easy ride for the cyclist. So as you can see, the setting affects the cyclist in numerous ways, either making the journey difficult or straightforward.
1650	7632	3	3	The cyclist was affected majorly by a few dreadful parts of the setting. In the beginning, when the sun was not at its peak and he had plenty of cool water in his bottles, the cyclist was absolutely fine, enjoying the ride with a light - hearted spirit. As the day went on, the sun climbed higher in the sky, and he felt the intense heat bearing down on him. He drank all his water quickly, and now he felt desperate, his throat parched and his energy waning. His mood changed with the setting, and he was extremely happy once he reached Gary and @ORGANIZATION1, where he could finally find some relief. Also, this cyclist decided to blame the old men for giving him bad directions when he was in trouble, frustrated by his difficult situation. But he thanked them once he realized they were correct, showing how his judgment was clouded by the harsh conditions of the setting. The setting clearly had a profound impact on the cyclist's experience throughout the journey.
1651	7633	3	3	If itís a sunny and pleasant day with clear skies and gentle breezes, the cyclist will eagerly want to ride. If it is a rainy, cold, or stormy bad day then they will not want to ride but probably will due to a pre - planned schedule or a strong commitment. This shows that external conditions can influence a cyclist's motivation, yet dedication can sometimes override discomfort.
1652	7634	3	3	"In the essay, ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting significantly affect the cyclist. There are old people in the setting who have been around for a long time. You canít ask for advice from them because theyíre too old to give relevant information and wouldnít know what theyíre talking about. As the essay states, ìA better piece of advice for the solo cyclist would be, ìNever accept travel advice from a collection of old - timers who havenít left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office.î These details clearly illustrate how the setting and its inhabitants can have an impact on the cyclist's experience."
1653	7635	3	3	"The features for the cyclist in ""Rough Road Ahead"" are not the kind I'd prefer to be in at all. I initially thought it was going to be a scenic story, but it turns out he wasn't well - prepared. He took directions from some old guys who havenít left their house since Carter was in office. He was pedaling his bike through the vast California desert, carrying only what he could on his bike. He ran out of water and could have easily got heatstroke or collapsed in the middle of nowhere with no one around to save him. So, the intense heat can drive you insane, make you extremely thirsty, and might even lead to a bite from some desert critter. The conditions this biker is in are harsh, and I don't think he was prepared. Always trust your gut feeling."
1654	7636	3	3	In the story, the fact that there was no one around, no buildings in sight, the cyclist had no water, and was completely lost had a negative impact on him. He was constantly doubting himself throughout the entire ordeal. However, despite these difficult circumstances, he did persevere and managed to make it through the tough situation he was in. This shows that even in the face of extreme adversity, one can find the strength to overcome challenges.
1655	7637	3	3	In the story ìRough Road Aheadî, the setting and the features have a profound impact on the cyclist. For example, in the story, he says ìIíd read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you had left to circulateî. This clearly shows that the features are rough because he would most likely not be that desperately thirsty unless it was very hot out. The setting of this story takes place in California, on a sweltering hot day. Another quote that could support this is when the author says, ìI wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasnít a mirage.î This shows that it is extremely hot because he is sweating profusely. It also indicates that it is hot as he thinks itís a mirage, and people usually see them in the desert, where it is hot. These details highlight how the setting and its features affect the cyclist's experience.
1656	7638	3	3	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. To begin, as the cyclist rode on for the initial few miles, he found that there was nothing in sight as far as his eyes could reach. The empty expanse of the road made him feel isolated and less determined to reach his goal. Then, in paragraph @NUM1, the cyclist caught a glimpse of a building in the distance. This sight of the building, standing alone in the otherwise barren landscape, helped him to gain the much - needed strength to reach his goal. As he continued riding, the cyclist’s determination gradually went down. The long, tiring journey was taking its toll. But then at last, he came to the building. Its presence gave him relief and instilled more confidence in himself, suggesting that he was perhaps on the right track after all.
1657	7639	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by causing him to suffer from dehydration and run out of time and energy. “I eased past trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.” This quote clearly proves the severe dehydration the rider is experiencing. The lack of proper moisture in his body makes it difficult for him to maintain his balance while cycling. “The glowing realization that I could die from a heat stroke,” this quote shows that the rider’s time and energy are rapidly running out. The intense heat from the setting is taking a huge toll on his physical condition. These ideas and quotes effectively show how the features of the setting have a detrimental impact on the cyclist, highlighting the harshness of the environment he is in.
1658	7640	3	3	In the story “Rough Road Ahead,” the author takes a trail he had previously heard about. After the ride didn’t turn out to be what he expected it to be, the setting began to “set in.” The aridity of the climate, with the hot, dry air constantly sapping his energy, would cause the author to have to struggle against himself and the conditions around him. Also, his lack of water was a problem from the start. With only a small amount of water to begin with, the scorching sun beating down on him would make him become dangerously dehydrated. The combination of the dry climate and the lack of water made the journey extremely challenging for the author, highlighting how the setting can significantly affect one’s experience on a trail.
1659	7641	3	3	The cyclist runs into some pretty tough challenges. The real aspects of the setting affected him, because there were so many obstacles that he had to overcome. For example, he got directions from some old men who, it seemed, didn’t really know what they were talking about. Their vague and perhaps inaccurate directions led him astray. Then he ran out of water, so he had nothing to drink under the blistering sun. The road started to get bumpy, making it difficult to maintain his balance on the bike. He also saw snakes slithering along the side of the road, which added to his fear. There were no buildings nor cars around, so he had no way of asking anybody for help if needed. He came up on an old factory, that was thought to be the Welch’s Grape juice factory, but it was abandoned and looked like it had been for a while. The dilapidated state of the factory was a disheartening sight. Towards the end, he found a fish camp where he finally got water and was around people. These different obstacles affected his mood and how determined he was, making his journey a real test of his willpower.
1660	7642	3	3	The setting in “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Speed Limit” has a great effect on the main character in the story. In the beginning of the story, he passes the first ‘town’ and continues riding his bike, following the directions some old folks gave him. “The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over it.” His mood at this point was already confident, but this description adds to it, with words like “rushing” being encouraging to him. The thought of reaching the beautiful Yosemite with its natural wonders filled him with excitement. Then, he continues moving on the road. “Not two miles into this section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing.” At this point, he is becoming unsure of how good the directions he obtained really were. Once he is already tired from the initial part of the ride, the unexpected rolling hills aren’t what he wanted to find, so this adds to his doubt. Further along, he said, “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” This adds to the despair he was feeling, because he feels he is going to die in this desolate place before reaching Yosemite. Not seeing anyone was probably extremely discouraging, so the setting really affected him. Then he said “over the long crippling hill, a building came into view.” It is at this point that he uses the word “crippling” because he is just about exhausted and can’t go any further. The sight of the building, however, gives him a glimmer of hope, showing how the setting can both bring despair and a chance of relief to the main character.
1661	7643	3	3	The features in the desolate setting greatly affect the fatigued cyclist. He is laboriously riding through this deserted and dilapidated town, with crumbling buildings and overgrown weeds, that makes an eerie feeling creep over him. After that, he starts to pedal through the vast, arid desert under the scorching sun when a huge, menacing snake suddenly slithers across his path and scares him even more. When he finally arrives at the decrepit, abandoned juice factory, he is almost completely out of energy and his legs can barely turn the pedals. He almost can't go on any further in his arduous journey until he finally stumbles upon the small, shabby bait shop. Most of the features in the setting scare the cyclist but they all undeniably affect him, leaving a lasting mark on his cycling experience.
1662	7644	3	3	The cyclist was desperately begging to feel that death was slowly coming his way as he continued pedaling without a single building in sight across the barren expanse. This dire situation made him grow hysterical over his plight, and yet he still had enough energy left to wallow in self - pity. Then, when he finally did catch a faint glimpse of a building on the hazy horizon, his exhausted mind thought it was just a cruel mirage. In his weakened state, it was hard to tell what was real and what his desperate brain was conjuring up.
1663	7645	3	3	The location of a cyclist's ride significantly affects the person's attitude and strength. If the road is full of steep, challenging hills, it takes a little more physical and mental strength to maintain a steady speed. When put in this strenuous situation, Kurmaskie writes “It was a sad, hopeless laugh, mind you, but at least I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself.” This poignant quote shows how one gets gradually drained by the unrelenting hills. Also, being in a parched desert situation can severely weaken a cyclist due to intense thirst. The cyclist in the reading was so desperate for water that he was willing to try pumping water that looked “brackish” and unappetizing. So, it is clear that the setting can break a cyclist both physically and mentally.
1664	7646	3	3	The setting in the passage is working against the struggling cycler. He's running extremely low on water; he's almost on the verge of dehydration. The weather where he is at is swelteringly hot, with the sun beating down mercilessly on him. He squints his eyes as he looks around, but he can't see a town for miles. There is no sign of relief in this desolate landscape, and the heat and lack of water are taking a heavy toll on his body and spirit.
1665	7647	3	3	The features of the setting significantly affect the cyclist because it was extremely hot out, with the sun blazing like a furnace. He had a very small amount of water, just a few sips left in his bottle, and a long, arduous way to go. The temperature was so sweltering that the cyclist said he felt completely dehydrated, his throat dry and parched. He also had to laboriously go over a lot of steep hills and traverse through vast deserts to get where he needed to go. In a misguided attempt to save time, he took a “shortcut” but it ended up being a nightmare. The path was rough and unforgiving, and he got even more dehydrated. This is how the unforgiving setting affected him, testing his limits and determination.
1666	7648	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in a good way. For example, since cycling is a physically - demanding sport, regular cycling in this setting helps him stay in excellent physical shape. Also, due to his consistent training in this conducive setting, he has a high chance of winning cycling contests, which could lead to financial rewards and make him rich. This shows how the setting positively impacts the cyclist's physical and financial aspects.
1667	7649	3	3	In the essay by Joe Kurmaskie, many obstacles are caused by the different settings. For instance, the scorching hot temperature in the setting caused the character to rapidly lose fluids and get dehydrated. He recalled, “I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.” This dehydration led to a loss of determination as he struggled to continue. Eventually, this loss of determination and the physical toll of dehydration caused him to lose consciousness. The hills he had to cycle on also had a significant effect on him. The steep inclines made him exert a great deal of energy, causing him to become extremely tired and weak. Just like the temperature problem, this physical exhaustion led to a loss of determination, which could eventually make him lose consciousness. He said, “if it looked like I was going to lose consciousness for the last time.” Overall, the various settings in the story presented multiple challenges that severely affected the character.
1668	7650	3	3	The setting of the story had affected the cyclist because if it were in the suburbs, he could have stopped anywhere to get water. However, the plot was set in the middle of a vast desert. In this desolate place, all he could do was keep rolling his bicycle wheels, constantly hoping to find some water. For example, he had to cycle a long @NUM1 miles to reach the next town to get water. If he were not in the desert with its challenging hills, he could have covered that distance in no time at all. This shows how the specific setting of the desert greatly hindered the cyclist's journey.
1669	7651	3	3	The cyclist was affected by many features of the setting. Initially, he was enjoying a relatively easy ride on a flat road. But soon, the terrain changed, and the flat road transformed into bumpy hills. Cycling on these hills became even more difficult because of the lack of water. The cyclist was parched, and his energy levels were low, making each pedal - stroke a struggle. The hot desert sun beat down relentlessly on him, causing him to sweat profusely and further dehydrate. Moreover, the lack of towns and people in the area meant there was no one to offer help or a place to rest and replenish supplies. All these factors combined made the journey extremely difficult for the cyclist.
1670	7652	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because it is extremely hot. The heat is so intense that the water in his bottle tastes like battery acid, making it almost undrinkable. Then he has to deal with difficult trails and the advice of some old - timers. He said, “old - timers who haven’t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office.” This indicates that the old - timers gave him outdated and perhaps inaccurate directions, adding to his troubles. What made the setting even hotter was that he had been cycling non - stop, continuously expending energy under the blazing sun. Then, when he was riding, he said, “The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over it.” By thinking about this idyllic place, he was able to temporarily forget about the sweltering heat. This shows how the harsh setting, with its heat, difficult trails, and unhelpful advice, was affecting the cyclist both physically and mentally.
1671	7653	3	3	There are many reasons as to why the features of the setting affects the cyclist. One reason is because it is extremely hot. I know this because it was summertime in the parched California desert, where the sun beats down relentlessly. Another reason is because the road was very rough. I know this because of the prominent sign that he saw clearly stating “Rough Road Ahead; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed @NUM1). This clearly tells you that the road is very rough. And being that he is on a bike, rough roads are not very good for him as it makes the ride bumpy and difficult. Another reason as to why the setting affects the cyclist is that there is no one to get directions from. There is no one around to give him a much - needed drink of water. These are few of the many reasons why the setting affects the cyclist, making his journey a challenging one.
1672	7654	3	3	The setting of this story is outside. Yosemite is outside riding her bike in a rather harsh environment. She is around hills, with no access to good water, and on very hot land. You know that she is around hills because she audibly says to herself, “… I maneuvered down the hill.” You also know that she starts off around no good water. “When I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid…” that shows the water was extremely bad. Also, the land is very hot because it says “…in the sweltering heat of two hundred degrees.” Yosemite starts off bad then ends up learning to stick to it and never give up. Yosemite’s biggest problem is her lack of water due to the fact that it is hot outside and the water she had was bad, tasting like battery acid, which made her situation quite dire during the bike ride.
1673	7655	3	3	There are many things that could affect the cyclist. Like when they vividly described, “Tumbleweeds crossed my path, and there was a ridiculously large snake.” Another example would be when they clearly stated, “Not two miles into this next section of the ride I noticed the terrain changing. The previously flat road was gradually replaced by short, rolling hills.” These elements show how the features of the setting, such as unexpected obstacles and changing terrain, affect the cyclist, making the ride more challenging.
1674	7656	3	3	The story of the cyclist shows how the features of the setting affect the cyclist. The cyclist had to go through a lot. “The speed limit was @NUM1. The cyclist was doing a water - depleting @NUM2. Sometimes life can feel so cruel.” Despite these hardships, the cyclist loves to ride their bike. They truly enjoyed the peaceful serenity of an early summer evening while cycling. Even though the setting presented difficulties, the cyclist's passion for cycling kept them going through the tough conditions.
1675	7657	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. First, the beautiful river and the tall pine trees. “The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them”. Just thinking about that idyllic scenery helped the cyclist keep going, providing motivation during the arduous journey. Second, the road was getting harder to travel. “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills” and a well - visible sign on another road said “rough road ahead”. The bumpy and uneven roads made the cyclist work much harder to get to Yosemite National Park. Finally, the cyclist's water supply was running critically low. “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.” Not having a lot of water is really bad when you're outside in the scorching heat and the cyclist had no idea where to find more. The towns the cyclist ran into were abandoned or “ghost towns”. The cyclist had nowhere to go to get help. This cyclist faced many problems during his bike ride to Yosemite national park, but his determination to reach the destination kept him persevering.
1676	7658	3	3	The older men gave him directions that were actually really bad, full of misinformation and inaccuracies. Nature wasn't on his side, that's for sure. First of all, he ran out of water because of the scorching heat that seemed to suck the moisture right out of his bottles. Secondly, a venomous snake blocked his path and he didn't want to tempt it and risk getting bitten. Thirdly, he became so overheated that it was highly possible for him to suffer a heat stroke in the middle of nowhere with no one around to help. Also, he kept going to abandoned buildings that offered no shelter or resources. It was so bad that the stone he relied on for his thirst got stuck in his throat, causing him a moment of panic. He was then led to a bait shop that was absolutely in the middle of nowhere and he had no way of getting home, leaving him feeling helpless and stranded.
1677	7659	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in numerous ways. The dry desert, with its arid expanse, affected the cyclist because there was no water available and the cyclist quickly became dehydrated, his throat parched and his energy waning. The strong heat, relentless and oppressive, was a major factor because the cyclist could barely withstand it and was at high risk of having a heat stroke. The presence of animals was also a concern because the snake could have killed the cyclist and there was no one in miles to help. In the story it says, “There was no one in sight, not a building, car or structure of any kind.” If the cyclist had needed help then, the cyclist could most likely have died. If I was the cyclist, I probably would have given up by then but I'm glad the cyclist didn't. The features of the setting affected the cyclist because of the many dangerous things that could have happened to him, highlighting the harshness of the environment.
1678	7660	3	3	The features of the setting that affected the cyclist was the intense heat because he was getting lost and he was slowly running out of water, his water supply dwindling with each passing mile. The cyclist said, “That you should never accept travel advice from old timers that haven't left their porches since Carter was in office.” This means that because the cyclist followed their advice, he got lost in the vast desert and was running very low on water. He was so thirsty that he put stones in his mouth to keep him from thinking about water, a desperate measure to ease his parched throat. In the end, the cyclist learned to trust the map and the signs instead of listening to really old people who haven't left their homes in years, a valuable lesson for future travels.
1679	7661	3	3	The setting of the desert is a hard setting to be in with no water or help. If the author would have been on a populated trail with water fountains and shade, he would have been fine, enjoying a comfortable and safe journey. But, he was in the desert with no one around, the sun beating down hot and dry, no water to quench his thirst, and no shade to escape the searing heat. “Tumbleweeds crossed my path” (@CAPS1 @NUM1). This described his loneliness because no one was in the desert to help him, making him feel isolated and vulnerable. The setting could have killed him if it was not for the fish camp that provided a glimmer of hope. The setting had a huge impact on the author, leaving him with a deep - seated respect for the harshness of the desert environment.
1680	7662	3	3	The features in the short story affect the cyclist because with no towns around there is no water. In the story it says, “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.” This means the cyclist was extremely short on water and needed to find a town soon to replenish his supply. Cycling in the desert and up and down the steep hills made it harder and hotter, sapping his energy and increasing his body temperature. The heat could cause dehydration or a heatstroke because it says, “and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke.” The buildings the cyclist did see were not any help to him because they had no water, leaving him in a desperate situation. Eventually he came to a fishing camp and found water in the sink of the bathroom. The story says, “I stumbled into a rather modern bathroom and drank deeply from the sink.” This is where the setting changes because the cyclist found cool water finally, bringing relief and a new lease on his journey.
1681	7663	3	3	In “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”, the author faces numerous obstacles due to the diverse terrain changes during his arduous journey to Yosemite National Park. After taking advice from a group of old men, he set off towards his first stop. The old men had assured him that he would come across a town, but when he finally approached it, what he saw was a desolate, ruined “ghost” town. Subsequently, he reached a fork in the road and found himself running alarmingly low on water. He had been cycling on a relatively flat road when suddenly, the terrain underwent a dramatic transformation. It became hilly and highly inconsistent, with steep inclines and unexpected dips. This sudden change in terrain made him more tired, extremely thirsty, and uncomfortably hot. The cyclist then encountered a huge hill and, summoning his last bit of energy, managed to ride down. He was completely exhausted. All these terrain changes not only affected the cyclist's physical state but also took a toll on his mood and determination. Despite the challenges, his perseverance kept him going, as he knew his destination awaited at the end of this rough road.
1682	7664	3	3	The setting affects the cyclist in numerous ways. “The journey has made a snake” this quote implies that he is in the middle of nowhere and has no clear path ahead. The man on the porch said the next place wouldn't be far, which gave the cyclist a glimmer of hope. However, when he finally saw the first town, he was initially excited to reach it. But as he got closer, he realized that the town had been abandoned for a long time. The empty streets, dilapidated buildings, and lack of any signs of life made him feel a sense of desolation. This forced him to keep going, and the emptiness of the town left him feeling almost hopeless. In his persistent attempts to make it to the next town, the desolate setting had a profound impact on the cyclist, influencing his emotions and making his journey even more challenging. Nevertheless, he continued to push forward, driven by the hope of finding a better place ahead.
1683	7665	3	3	The setting of the road affected the cyclist in many distinct ways. Since there were no towns along the long stretch of the road, it became extremely difficult for him to find water. This shortage of water gradually led him into a dehydrated state, making his journey even more strenuous. “The old guys had sworn the next town was only eighteen miles down the road. I would conserve my water and go inward for an hour or so.” The rolling hills of the road added to his difficulties, as they made him use more energy with each pedal stroke. Moreover, because there were no buildings in sight for miles, he had to break the ride into short, manageable distances. This way, he could pace himself and avoid complete exhaustion. In the end, the harsh setting of the road tested his physical and mental limits, but his determination kept him on track towards his destination.
1684	7666	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in a multitude of ways. One of the most significant problems he faced was the lack of water. The group of old guys who gave him directions were of little help. These men provided directions based on what they remembered from when they were younger. The cyclist was initially skeptical about taking directions from the old men, but they seemed so confident in what they were saying that he decided to trust them. At the start, the cyclist had a strong determination to reach his destination. However, as he continued his journey, he got hotter and more thirstier, and the thought of giving up started to creep in. Just when he was on the verge of surrendering to his troubles, thirst, and fear, he stumbled across a source of water. This unexpected find gave him a new lease on life, rekindling his determination and allowing him to continue his journey with renewed vigor.
1685	7667	3	3	The features in the setting affect the cyclist in a variety of different ways. One major issue is that he is left with only a tiny amount of water. “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.” (Kurmaskie) This scarcity of water made his situation extremely precarious. Additionally, the cyclist was lost because of the directions given by the old men. These directions were completely out of date, leading him nowhere. “Never accept travel advice from a collection of old - timers who haven't left the confine of their porches since Carter was in office,” (Kurmaskie @NUM1) The cyclist was understandably not pleased with the bad directions he received. As a result, he went through some tough times during his journey. Despite these setbacks, he refused to be defeated. His resilience allowed him to keep moving forward, hoping that he would eventually overcome the challenges posed by the unforgiving setting.
1686	7668	3	3	Different features of the settings significantly affect the cyclist. The setting of the story, which is firmly based in the vast and arid desert, has a profoundly negative impact on the character. The desert land is barren, desolate, leaving him solely with his meager and small supply of water. During his long and arduous journey, he runs out of water, causing him to gradually lose contact with reality. The extreme, blistering heat in the desert causes him to begin to hallucinate. The cyclist begins to see a grape juice factory in the distance, which interrupts his otherwise monotonous trip. To his great dismay, it turns out to be no more than a deceptive mirage. The lengthy, winding road also affected the trip. The great length and rough, uneven surface of the road had thoroughly worn the cyclist down, making his journey an extremely challenging one. In conclusion, the harsh desert setting with its lack of resources, extreme heat, and difficult terrain took a heavy toll on the cyclist, making his experience a truly arduous and miserable one.
1687	7669	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he thinks that after spending a nice, relaxing afternoon in a beautiful and peaceful campground, taking a shortcut to his next destination would be very nice and efficient. He believes the shortcut will be a pleasant and stress - free way to relax rather than taking the original longer and more mundane way to Yosemite. But the trip he makes completely changes his mind. In the essay, the narrator is talking about what the old guys had told him. He says, “The old guys had sworn the next town was only eighteen miles down the road. I could make that. I would conserve my water…” He did indeed conserve his water, but when he reached the town, he found that it was very old and dilapidated, and it didn't have any water for him to drink. So throughout the essay, the narrator went without water for a long time until he finally got to a factory, where he managed to get some water to drink and also got new directions. The trip was very different from what he had expected. It was far more depressing, filled with disappointment and hardship. In conclusion, the unforeseen challenges presented by the setting turned what was supposed to be a relaxing shortcut into a distressing journey.
1688	7670	3	3	A response that explains how the feature of the setting affected the cyclist would be that in the setting, the various elements of the setting affected the cyclist because, for one, the features of the setting were based on a particular environment that was distinct from what the cyclist might have anticipated. So that would be a reason how it would be affected. Because there are significant differences in the stories' settings, such as the terrain, climate, and availability of resources. These differences can have a direct impact on the cyclist's physical and mental state. For example, a harsh and arid setting might lead to dehydration and fatigue, while a setting with difficult terrain could slow down the cyclist's progress. In conclusion, the unique features of the setting play a crucial role in shaping the cyclist's experience and can have both positive and negative effects on their journey.
1689	7671	3	3	You can always choose your features because your initial idea might change over time. As you gain more experience or encounter new circumstances, your perspective on what features are important can shift. For instance, you might start with a certain set of features in mind for a project or a plan, but as you go along, you realize that other features are more relevant or beneficial. This change in mindset can be due to various factors, such as new information, feedback from others, or personal growth. In conclusion, being open to changing your choice of features based on evolving circumstances is a wise approach that can lead to better outcomes.
1690	7672	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist mentally, physically, positively and negatively. For instance, “There had been @CAPS1's Grape Juice Factory and bottling plant. A sand - blasted picture of a young boy by pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen.” This affected the author mentally, vividly making him remember that he had no water. Which in turn affected him physically by gradually becoming dehydrated as moments passed. So overall, that setting feature had a strongly negative directional affect on the cyclist. Another example, “One ramshackled shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn't hold in the lamest mule greeted me. This sight was troubling.” This affected the cyclist mentally by making him feel hopeless and think he was never going to see civilization again. It also affected him physically because the water he found there tasted like “battery acid,” which put him deeper into his dehydration state as his body rejected the unpalatable and harmful water. This setting feature had a clearly negative affect on the cyclist. The setting features and how they affected the cyclist is like an environment a person is placed in and how it makes them who they are, influencing their thoughts, emotions, and physical well - being. In conclusion, the various features of the setting in this cyclist's journey had predominantly negative impacts on him, both mentally and physically, highlighting the powerful influence of the environment on an individual's experience.
1691	7673	3	3	He is going on an adventurous journey on his sturdy bike. Along the way, he has to deftly go down steep hills and also deal with the troublesome fact that he has no water. That’s basically what the challenging setting of his journey is about.
1692	7674	3	3	When riding a bike, the various features around you can significantly affect the cyclist. Some prominent things that can have an impact on the cyclist are the weather and the scenery. If the weather is cold and rainy, with raindrops pelting down and the cold seeping into the bones, the cyclist would not want to be riding. The dangers of riding when the weather conditions are bad, such as slippery roads and poor visibility, will make the cyclist second - guess whether to keep riding or not. If the weather is extremely hot, the scorching sun beats down, causing the cyclist to get dehydrated quicker and even more exhausted. The scenery can also affect the cyclist. When a cyclist is riding and all he/she sees is a vast, desolate desert stretching as far as the eye can see, then they might have doubts on where they're going. If there are abandoned buildings everywhere, with broken windows and overgrown weeds, the cyclist may become frightened and want to head back or lose hope, as shown in the story “Do not exceed the speed limit” when he gets over a hill and begins to think that he will never make it to Yosemite. Many things can affect the cyclist and make the journey a complex experience.
1693	7675	3	3	The features of the setting vividly exhuberate the cyclist. The June weather, being the beginning of summer with its sweltering heat, added to the water depletion. When the cyclist “arrived at the first ‘town’”, it was completely deserted. The water there had a disgusting odor and a murky appearance. The author uses verbal irony when calling it a “town” as it was not really a town anymore, just a collection of dilapidated buildings. The large snake slithering across the path presented an air of danger, and another abandoned Grape Juice Factory, with its rusted machinery and broken walls, added to the hopeless, lost tone of the setting. All these elements combined to create a challenging and disheartening environment for the cyclist.
1694	7676	3	3	Many things in the setting affect the cyclist. The first thing that affects him is the intense heat. The blistering heat is actually what causes the conflict in the story of the cyclist needing water. If the heat was not present in the story, with its sweltering rays and high temperatures, then the cyclist would not have such a desperate need for water and he would be able to continue on his ride without fear of dehydration. Another aspect of the setting that affects the cyclist are the rolling hills. These hills, with their uneven slopes and long ascents, also exhaust the cyclist and cause him to need more water. If these hills were gone, the cyclist would have tired less quickly, making his journey easier. The setting in this story greatly affects the cyclist, shaping his experiences and challenges along the way.
1695	7677	3	3	"The features of the setting in, ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,” affect the cyclist in many ways. After following the old men's advice, he sets off on his long - awaited journey. After the first town appears on the horizon, the sun really starts to beat down with full force, which really affects the cyclist. In the essay it says “The sun was beginning to heat beat down, but I barely noticed it.” He may have not noticed it yet, but then later on the long, winding road on the new flat terrain, he runs out of water, and that is really dangerous in weather that hot. The text says, “The speed limit was @NUM1. I was doing a water - depleting @NUM2.” In this part of the story, it clearly proves that the cyclist is out of water. In this kind of setting, you can run into dangerous creatures. In the story it says, “I toiled on. At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake. It really did look like a diamondback - blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.” This entry proves to the reader that there are snakes in this sort of setting. The features of the setting in “Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” affect the cyclist greatly, making his journey a perilous one."
1696	7678	3	3	The terrain setting affects the cyclist in many ways. The fact that he was cycling in a vast desert under the blazing sun made him extremely thirsty. There were no towns and not even a single sign of water to quench his parched throat. The hills he had to cycle up just made him more tired as he struggled to pedal. These are what the harsh setting did to the cyclist, testing his endurance to the limit.
1697	7679	3	3	In the story “Do not exceed posted speed” by @PERSON1, the cyclist faces problems caused by the setting. The biker was riding on a sweltering day, and the heat was absolutely scorching. As a result, the biker was really getting dehydrated and tired, and he was rapidly running out of water. Because it was so hot, the biker had to drink more water to replenish his body of all the sweat he was losing while biking. The hills of the rough terrain were making it harder on the biker by making him use more energy and liquid to keep going. If it had been cool and breezy, he would have had no problem making that distance. If the surrounding area was full of people and not abandoned towns, then he would have had water to drink, and his journey would have been much easier.
1698	7680	3	3	Everybody experiences physical and emotional pain, but most probably wouldn't have survived what the cyclist in this story went through. The man started a bike ride in Yosemite National Park, but when some elderly men told him a shortcut, his arduous adventure had just begun. First of all, every “town” and “building” the men told him he would come to wound up being completely deserted. At first, this wasn't a big deal to the cyclist. In the fourth paragraph, when he came to his first deserted town, he “chuckled, checked his water supply, and moved on.” However, as his journey progressed, his water decreased. He was then in desperation for a town with water. On top of that, in the story he wrote, “the last road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” This made his biking harder, and he was then becoming dehydrated. He finally found a town with water, but he learned his lesson from taking advice from strangers and old men, realizing that shortcuts aren't always reliable.
1699	7681	3	3	The features of the setting would have affected the cyclist a lot. There is a man who takes the advice of old men and takes a “shortcut” to Yosemite Park. The shortcut only leads him to thirst and no sign of the park. The narration states, “A sand - blasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen (Kurmaskie @NUM1).” This feature could affect the cyclist by discouraging him deeply. When the cyclist comes to the first “town,” he only finds yet again no water and a picture of something that makes him even more thirsty. It could also make him be more angry at the old men because they led him on this pointless journey. Another feature that would affect the cyclist is the lack of trees or shade. The only thing he could feel was the intense sun beating down on his back. The narration states, “Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt. (Kurmaskie @NUM1).” This also makes the cyclist firmly believe that old men do not know what they are talking about, and he realizes he should have trusted his own judgment.
1700	7682	3	3	There are many features of the setting that affected the cyclist in “Do not exceed the posted speed limit.” The time of year affected the cyclist because it’s mid - June. Moreover, the region affected the cyclist because mid - June in Arizona is extremely hot and dry. If it was in a more northern state in spring or fall, it wouldn't be as bad, and you wouldn't have the danger of heat - related struggles. Additionally, when the terrain changed from flat to hilly, this affected him because it made it significantly harder for him to ride. These are some features of the settings that affected the cyclist in “Do not exceed the posted speed limit,” highlighting how the environment can greatly impact a journey.
1701	7683	3	3	In “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting significantly affected the cyclist. Since he was cycling in the sweltering desert of California in June, his water supply was quickly depleted. With the scorching sun beating down, he came across a desolate ghost town. His hope started dwindling as the harsh conditions took a toll on him. He then found a water pump, but to his dismay, it produced a tar - like substance. Due to the unforgiving desert and the lack of water, he even wished he was dead. Eventually, he decided never to blindly take advice from strangers and to always trust his map. This is how the features of the setting had a profound impact on the cyclist.
1702	7684	3	3	In the essay, “Rough Road Ahead Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”, the features of the setting affected the cyclist in multiple ways. First of all, he was traveling in the arid desert, which meant it was extremely dry. With scarce water sources around, the cyclist could not refill his water and was gradually getting dehydrated. Also, he was biking under the intense heat of the sun. This made him continuously sweat, which not only depleted the water in his body but also started to play tricks on his mind. Finally, the steep hills he had to climb caused him to exert more energy, further exacerbating his dehydration. Moreover, the seemingly endless hills dampened his spirits, forcing him to muster a great deal of inner strength and determination to keep going. This aspect of the setting had a significant emotional impact on him. Overall, the setting had both a physical and emotional effect on the cyclist.
1703	7685	3	3	The cyclist is alone, traveling on a flat expanse of land at first, following the directions that the old men gave him to reach Yosemite National Park in California. During his journey, as he cycles over hills and through deserts with the scorching sun beating down on him in the hot June weather, he becomes severely dehydrated. He realizes that without water, he could suffer a heart - stroke. His travels are desolate and lonely, with nothing but vast stretches of barren land around him. When he finally spots some buildings in the distance, he initially gets excited, only to discover that they are ghost towns. However, this sight still gives him a bit of a boost, and he recovers some determination to speed up. Fortunately, the cyclist finds a camp site. This saves him from passing out in the desert. He can rest there, replenish his water supply, and then carry on his journey, relying on his own map from then on.
1704	7686	3	3	In the story “Do not exceed posted speed Limit”, the cyclist is trying to reach Yosemite using the directions that some codgers, or eccentric old men, gave him. The cyclist noted that the old men looked as though they “haven’t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office.” He decides to take their advice, but about a third (assuming @NUM1 is one - third) along his journey, he gets lost. While eagerly looking forward to the “Cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite,” he finds himself traveling through a desolate and barren desert. “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” This kind of desolate setting can really bring down a cyclist's mood, especially when he is constantly thinking about the beautiful Yosemite. It could make him lose all hope of ever finding Yosemite at this rate. A nice setting can make a trip more enjoyable and the destination even more appealing.
1705	7687	3	3	The setting affected the performance and the mood of the cyclist. The rolling, steep hills that the cyclist had to climb most likely made him more tired and thirsty because he had to exert a great deal of effort to get over them. “Over one long, crippling hill, a building came into view.” These long and large hills not only made him thirstier but also gave him a sense of satisfaction once he conquered them. Ironically, the building turned out to be an abandoned and rusty grape juice factory. Although the sign featuring a boy drinking a refreshing glass of juice was still visible, it brought his hopes down. But he didn't give up and continued to move on. In my life, I've never had an experience where I had to keep pushing myself towards a goal while facing more distractions the closer I got. However, I can understand the cyclist's struggle in such a difficult situation.
1706	7688	3	3	ìDo not exceed posted speed limitî is a short story about a man who is bicycling through the beautiful yet challenging Yosemite. As he pedals along, he encounters some elderly men and politely asks them for directions. They, in good faith, lead him on this so - called ìoldî shortcut. Little does he know, this shortcut takes him through extremely tough terrain with steep slopes and rough paths, and also through an area experiencing extreme famine. The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways throughout the story. For example, when the bicyclist came to a deserted area, he said ìthere was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kindî. By this time, he was severely malnourished and desperately in need of water. This extreme thirst also led to him passing an abandoned Welchís grape juice factory with an advertisement showing a young boy pouring a fresh glass of juice into his mouth. He says ìIn an ironic twist that should please all sadists reading this, the building,î, then he goes into detail about the dilapidated building. The mood and feeling by this time was one of being tired and worn out, and the advertisement didnít help the situation at all. The author's mood did change with the setting, and before it got better, it was worse. Eventually, the cyclist found a way to overcome the difficult situation, and the story shows how the harsh setting can test one's will.
1707	7689	3	3	"The young cyclist began his day full of confidence, eagerly looking forward to his day of riding across California. Slowly, however, as he realizes he has been directed wrongly, his mood changes, and he begins to feel more hopeless. As he starts his journey, he feels carefree and ready for anything. He writes ""I carefully checked my water supply & then moved on. The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it at first. The beautiful surroundings seemed to have little effect on his initial enthusiasm. Later on, he realizes his water is quickly going down, and he is getting increasingly tired. His mood changes to one of exhaustion and defeat. Here he writes ìI got back on the bike, but not before I gathered up a few pebbles and stuffed them in my mouth. With any luck, Iíd hit a bump and lodge one in my throat.î He has become sarcastic and saddened by the hopelessness of his journey. Eventually, he finds relief when he gets a drink of cold water, which helps to bring up his spirits and sense of humor, allowing him to continue his journey with a new - found determination."
1708	7690	3	3	In the essay, the features of the setting significantly affected the cyclist. In the beginning, the setting was at the old manís cozy place. The cyclist was happy and confident, chatting with the old man and starting his journey with high spirits. When he reached the desolate ghost town and was out of water, he was extremely upset and frustrated. The empty streets and abandoned buildings added to his sense of despair. When he saw a building in the distance, he was relieved, thinking he might find help. But when he found out it was an abandoned building, he was deeply sad. When he finally reached the small store, he was excited and relieved. The store was a haven in the harsh journey, with its stocked shelves and friendly shopkeeper. That is how the setting affected the cyclist during his trip, showing how different settings can bring on a wide range of emotions.
1709	7691	3	3	Weather, places, the will to continue ñ all are reasons that explain how the features of the setting affected the cyclist. First, the weather will affect the cyclist because in the hot, sunny weather, you lose a lot of water through sweating, and this makes it hard to pedal the bike. The intense heat of the sun beating down on him will greatly affect his will to ride. I mean, come on, who wants to ride when it's burning hot outside? The places the cyclist went through, like small, desolate towns and rough, bumpy roads, would also affect him because itís pretty tough to navigate through such areas. The rough roads made his ride uncomfortable, and the lack of facilities in the towns meant he had to face many difficulties. Overall, the combination of weather and the places he passed through tested his endurance and will to continue the journey.
1710	7692	3	3	The story ìRough road ahead: do not exceed posted, speed limit ì tells of a biking trip gone wrong. But the story would  not be as terrifying if it had happened in a different place. The setting plays a large role in the story. The story begins on a pleasant present - day summer evening. As the man bikes along, he arrives at a ghost town completely devoid of any living beings. A feeling of unease sets in when he arrives at ìone ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldnít hold the lames mule. î Later, we see panic set in as the terrain becomes hilly, with tumbleweeds rolling across the path and snakes slithering around. It's like a scene from a cold western movie. Finally, all hope is lost when he reaches the grape juice factory and finds ìa sand - blasted picture of a young boy. î The desolate and menacing setting is a powerful tool which greatly influences the cyclist's state of mind, making him feel scared and helpless. The story effectively shows how the right setting can enhance the sense of danger and drama in a narrative.
1711	7693	3	3	In the story, “Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit,” by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affected the cyclist's physical abilities. The features affected his abilities because the climate and the dangerous environment were extremely hot and very rough to handle. Since he was cycling in the California deserts in June, the conditions were harsh. The passage that supports this is, “Tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake - it really did look like a diamondback - blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me. I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.” Also, the features of the setting give him determination. They give him determination because each new horizon he sees gives him a glimmer of hope. They give him hope since he knows he is that much closer to Yosemite National Park. The passage that supports this is when he thinks, “Looking at the distances I could see on the horizon, telling myself that if I could move it that far, I’d be fine.” In the story, “Rough road ahead, Do not exceed posted speed limit,” by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of his settings affect both the cyclist's physical and mental abilities.
1712	7694	3	3	The features of the setting have a huge effect on the cyclist. There was a point in the story where he ran out of water, and he remembered that the old guys had sworn the next town was only eighteen miles down the road. He was extremely tired and severely dehydrated, but he thought he could make it along the long, desolate road. So he started off, and two miles later, the terrain changed, and so did his outlook on this entire arduous journey. “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” He thought, “Sometimes life can be so cruel.” These hills took a great deal out of him, and he was now on a busy highway. Before this terrain change, the rider was very positive and thought he could complete this journey easily. He said, “I could make that!” But after the terrain change, he lost all hope and almost didn't make it. He despaired, “It didn't really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.” It is obvious as you read that when the terrain becomes tough, it has a huge negative effect on the cyclist.
1713	7695	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in a few ways. Initially, the roads were nice and smooth, but then they gradually turned into hilly stretches. It was a swelteringly hot day in June, and he had only a sparse water supply with him as he was peddling through the vast deserts of California. The last thing that affected him was that there weren't very many suitable places to stop and refill his water. All these aspects combined made his cycling journey a challenging one.
1714	7696	3	3	In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” by Joe Kurmaskie, a cyclist is on his way trying to find his way to Yosemite National Park, but runs into a little trouble when getting directions from a couple of older men. The one important lesson the cyclist learned was to never listen to short - cuts given to you by old men who are extremely out of date and haven't left their porch since Carter was in office. The cyclist learned this the hard way when he ends up lost and almost died of thirst. The setting takes place in the desolate desert of California or in deserted ghost towns. On his journey, the cyclist says, “...I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” This feature affects the cyclist because the extremely dry and scorching heat beating down on him continuously makes him severely dehydrated. Also, along his journey, the cyclist encounters numerous hills. The feature of the setting affects the cyclist by tiring him out completely and making him believe there isn't any hope of him getting out alive. Features of the setting like hills and deserts dehydrate and exhaust the cyclist, making his journey a life - threatening one.
1715	7697	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. It seems to be that the more desperate the situation becomes, the more determined he becomes. On page [NUM1], he thinks, “I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.” Right after he has this despairing thought, he climbs away from the abandoned factory of Juices and dreams. He says on page [NUM1], “All troubles, thirst, and fatigue were all behind me.” This shows that after a difficult situation, the cyclist feels relieved of all earthly obligations. Not only does the settings affect the cyclist but also the entire story around him, as it sets the tone and the challenges that drive the narrative forward.
1716	7698	3	3	The setting of the story encompasses areas that are extremely dry, with arid stretches where the ground is parched, as well as some humid pockets that seem out of place. The landscape is a mix of flat expanses where the horizon seems to go on forever and hilly regions with gentle slopes. The author clearly noticed the terrain changing, as described: “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills” (Joe Kurmaskie). Being out in the middle of a desert - like surrounding during June, with nothing but vast emptiness around him, is a truly scary thought. The intense heat and lack of water take a toll on him. He might experience mirages, those deceptive images that play tricks on the mind, or he could faint due to the searing heat and the significant amount of fluid he has lost. The hills, with their added effort required to traverse, don't help his situation either. In such harsh conditions, his endurance is truly being tested.
1717	7699	3	3	The features of the setting have a profound impact on the cyclist as he pedals through the unforgiving desert in the middle of June while carrying very little water. This situation affects him severely because he is constantly thirsty, yet he has only a meager supply of water to quench his thirst. Being in a desert in June means the sun beats down relentlessly, making it extremely hot. Also, in the story, it mentions that he comes across Welch’s Grape Juice Factory. On the side of the building, he sees a picture of a “young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth”. This vivid image makes the cyclist even thirstier as he imagines the cool liquid. Despite this intense longing, he continues on his journey, determined to find water at a bait shop. His perseverance in the face of such discomfort shows his strong will.
1718	7700	3	3	The cyclist in this essay has his sights set on Yosemite National Park. He initially feels confident in his ability to reach his destination, not fully realizing what challenges lie ahead. First, he encounters the windy roads that sway his bike from side to side. As he progresses along his route, his confidence gradually starts to wither away. The desert hits him like a boulder, as he is running short on water and desperately needs to rest. The extreme heat, with the sun shining brightly overhead, just exacerbates his situation. “Not a mile into this heat - section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” This clearly shows that the cyclist did not anticipate meeting this kind of terrain and is completely overwhelmed by it. However, the one thing he never does is give up. This is crucial because as he keeps going, just when he is on the verge of giving up, he finds a place to get water and to relax. “Then, as easily as running about, my troubles, thirst, and weariness were all behind me.” This indicates that he was strong - willed and determined to survive. He finally found what he needed, which filled him with happiness and a renewed will to live. Everyone in life needs to be determined to overcome the obstacles they face.
1719	7701	3	3	It gives him a hard time, but through these difficulties, he learns a great deal. He realizes that life is not always easy. It might not seem like a big problem at first, but sometimes, some small problems can snowball into bigger ones. Life is like riding a bike; there are ups and downs. Sometimes you face problems, and sometimes you get lost along the way. But that's just the nature of life. These experiences teach him to be more resilient and to face challenges head - on, understanding that every setback is an opportunity to grow.
1720	7702	3	3	The features of the setting very much affect the cyclist. He had to ride through extremely tough conditions and became utterly exhausted. I believe the toughest feature of the setting was the blistering heat. He told us, “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” The sweltering heat made him feel like he was in an oven. He was talking about how he needed to sip from his water more frequently than normally, as the heat was causing him to lose fluids rapidly. Another tough feature of the setting was the hills he had to ride up and down. As he was riding, he said, “Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.” Riding over these hills in the hot June sun in a California desert was an incredibly tough task for the cyclist. The combination of the heat and the hilly terrain made each pedal stroke a struggle. I believe the terrain very much affected him, testing his physical and mental limits to the extreme.
1721	7703	3	3	The features of the setting in this story make the ride more difficult for the cyclist. For example, the cyclist is moving through the “high deserts of California” (kurmaskie @NUM1). This shows that the cyclist is at a high altitude, where the thinner air makes breathing more strenuous and requires more effort with each breath, which makes breathing more difficult. Then the cyclist notes that the “Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). These undulating hills demand more physical exertion as the cyclist has to pedal harder uphill and control speed downhill. The hills would make the trip more difficult. This is evidenced by the cyclist describing one of them as a “long, crippling hill” (Kurmaskie @NUM1). Clearly, the terrain, which got increasingly difficult, negatively affected the cyclist, making the journey more arduous and challenging.
1722	7704	3	3	In the story, the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. For example, the condition of the road was bad. It changed from a smooth, flat road to short, rolling roads with uneven surfaces that jolted the cyclist's bike. Tumble weeds crossed his path unexpectedly, forcing him to swerve and maintain his balance. He had a severe lack of water, and the little water he did have tasted like battery acid, making it unpalatable and hard to drink. In the story it says, “I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.” This clearly shows how the adverse setting conditions made the cyclist's journey extremely difficult and precarious.
1723	7705	3	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist like if you have to go up a steep hill or along long bumpy type roads that shake the bike and rattle the cyclist's body. Then in the essay it says “Rough road ahead: do not exceed posted speed limit: @CAPS1” which indicates that the rough terrain does make things more difficult than average. The uneven surface requires more control and effort from the cyclist. Especially with a lack of water to make things worse, as the cyclist gets more fatigued and dehydrated, the challenges of the setting become even more overwhelming.
1724	7706	3	3	The setting greatly affects the cyclist trying to get to Yosemite National Park. First of all, the cyclist says he’s in Lodi, California on a “gorgeous day in June.” It’s very hot in California in June, with the sun beating down mercilessly. So the biker is affected by the weather because he could die of heatstroke as the high temperatures cause excessive sweating and dehydration. Also, he is in the middle of the desert, where he faces tumbleweeds crossing his path and a large snake that is possibly poisonous in the way. The presence of these obstacles and potential dangers puts him in more despair, because he could get hurt by a wild animal, or run out of water with no place to go get more! So the setting mostly negatively affects the cyclist, making his journey to Yosemite a perilous and difficult one.
1725	7707	3	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist; the author says he is in the California desert. This means that the cyclist must conserve water so he can stay hydrated for the long and arduous trip. The dry and hot desert environment causes rapid evaporation of sweat, increasing the risk of dehydration. Also, there are many hills, as the author says, “over one crippling hill…” with a lot of hills to climb, the cyclist uses up more energy and will become dehydrated quickly, if he isn’t careful. The constant uphill pedaling requires intense physical effort and leads to increased sweating. Finally, there are many abandoned towns that are several miles apart from each other. This again affects how the cyclists uses his water. He might think that there is a prospering town coming up, so he drinks his water, thinking he’ll get more soon. However, when he gets there, there is no water, and he must pedal several more miles to the next town with very little water. The setting is a great effect on how the cyclists act especially with no water, making every decision about water consumption crucial for his survival and the success of his journey.
1726	7708	3	3	The features of the setting in “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” greatly affect the cyclist. Depending on what sort of new terrain or landmark he came to, his determination increases and decreases. For instance, when he first caught sight of a building emerging in the distance ahead of him, a spark of excitement ignited within him. He leaned forward on his bike, gripping the handlebars tightly, and used all his energy to pedal furiously down the hill towards the building. Also, when he finally reached the next building and was pleasantly surprised to find a working bathroom, he rushed inside. He bent over the sink and greedily drank from the running water as his hope (of not dying) was renewed. The man riding the bike in the story had many different changes in his emotions during his long trek in this story that were dependent on the setting. These emotional fluctuations clearly demonstrate how the setting can have a profound and direct impact on a character's state of mind and motivation during a challenging journey.
