1	17834	7	3	Patience is when you're waiting calmly. I was patient when I was in line waiting for lunch. I didn't cut in front of anyone to eat. I was just standing there, patiently waiting for my turn. Patience, some people just don't have it. Lots of people will just cut in line or yell at you because they don't have any patience at all. Sometimes people will even push you out of their way. They only do that because they lack patience completely. Patience is what people truly need. People need patience because lots of feelings get hurt when there's no patience. Everyone should learn to have patience, as it makes our daily interactions much more pleasant.

But there was one time I was patient, and I bet very few others were as patient as I was at that moment. It was when I was learning to ride a bike without training wheels. When I was five years old and learning how to ride a bike, I just kept falling off. At one point, my bike flipped over and I almost broke my jaw, but thankfully I didn't. Finally, after @NUM1 weeks of constantly falling, I managed to ride for @NUM2 minutes without falling and finally learned how to ride a bike. This experience taught me that with patience, even difficult tasks can be accomplished.

So after we did our suicides (a running exercise), I asked the coach if we could go get some drinks. The coach said, “After our double - dribble down and back exercise.” So I did the exercise, and then we all rushed to the drinking fountain. I was at the end of an @NUM1 - girl line. I waited and waited patiently until finally, there I was, face - to - face with that drinking fountain. Then one girl says, “Can I have a drink? Thank you.” All I could do was stand there, stunned. That's when I heard a bright lady say, “Let's go!” I was @CAPS1 mad, but I quickly took a @NUM2 - second drink of water and rushed over to the coach. Now I'm often the first one ready, and I take long drinks, so my teammates call me a fish. This shows that sometimes we need to be patient even when we're frustrated.
4	17838	7	3	I'm going to write about a time when I went to the @ORGANIZATION1 fair. We had a great deal of fun there. We saw a ride that we really wanted to get on, so we got in line. Suddenly, we noticed that we were at the very end of the long line. So my mother said, “@CAPS1, let's get on another ride then.” “We've already tried the other rides,” my father said. So we stayed at the end of the line, patiently waiting until it was our turn. We said that this was going to be the last ride. Soon, there were people behind us complaining. Their younger children were getting really mad, and the parents were hollering. We just stood there, calmly and kept being patient. That didn't disturb us at all, since we were raised to be patient and wait our turn at things. I feel that being patient is very important. Because if you act up in line, you might make people think they're holding you up, but it's actually just the line moving slowly. Advice: when you are waiting at the end of the line, don't shout, scream, holler, or yell at anyone. It only creates unnecessary trouble. Just don't think about all of the people ahead of you. Talk to someone, just take your mind off of it for a while, then you'll notice that the line is moving quicker than you expected. P.S. We thoroughly enjoyed the ride, and it was all worth the wait.

When you go to the dentist or doctor's office, you need to be very patient. There was a girl who had to go to the dentist. She absolutely hated going to the dentist. It was always so boring. First, you'd have to sit there quietly while your parents did a whole bunch of paperwork. You have to just sit there patiently for about @NUM1 minutes before you even get to go in. Then, when you finally go in, they start working on your teeth for about ten minutes, and then you'd sit there for another fifteen minutes. Finally, when you are done getting your teeth cleaned, you'd sit there for another ten minutes while your parents talk to the dentist. So, you need to be patient sometimes, even when you're dying of boredom. Patience in such situations helps make the whole process smoother for everyone involved.
6	17840	7	3	There was a girl named @PERSON1. She adored spending quality time with her mom. Every weekend, they would either head to the movies, visit an amusement or water park, or simply stay home and enjoy each other's company. This time was different though. @PERSON1 was even a little scared about what was about to happen. Today was a @DATE1, and @PERSON1 and her mom were watching old videos of her mom when she was young. After the video ended, @PERSON1 and her mom looked at each other and laughed heartily. Once they settled down, @PERSON1’s mom looked sad. “What’s wrong, mom?” @PERSON1 asked with concern. “I have to go. I have to go somewhere for work and can’t take you with me,” mom replied regretfully. “Why not?” asked @PERSON1, her eyes filled with disappointment. “I don’t know, but I need you to wait here with your father. I’ll be back soon,” the mom said calmly, trying to reassure her. With that, @PERSON1’s mom left and drove away. @PERSON1 stood there, confused and wishing her mom didn’t have to go. Then she went over to the phone and called her dad. An hour later, @PERSON1’s dad came to her house. He calmed @PERSON1 down, who had been crying because she missed her mom so much. @PERSON1 went into her room and began to wait patiently for her mom. Weeks passed and @PERSON1’s mom still hadn’t returned. Every night now, @PERSON1 cried, hoping her mom would come back. During the day, she would wait, watching intently for her mom. @PERSON1 wanted her mom more than ever now. Though she never complained to her father and understood that her mom left for an important reason, but still she missed her mom deeply. Two years have passed since @PERSON1’s mom had left. @PERSON1 didn’t cry as much but still waited. Waited for her mother to come back. One day, @PERSON1 heard a knock on the door. She answered it, and there stood her mother. They stood on the porch for a moment, then hugged each other tightly. They both cried, and her mom whispered, “I’m sorry,” to @PERSON1. Now @PERSON1 and her were inseparable. They never left each other’s side again, cherishing every moment together.
7	17841	7	3	Un Patience @CAPS1. My name is @CAPS2, and I have a very hyper and impatient horse named @CAPS1. @CAPS1 is a beautiful chestnut quarter horse with a distinctive white star on his forehead. He is extremely impatient and always full of energy, ready to go at a moment's notice. For example, when we are getting ready to go on a horse ride on our back trails, he doesn't stand still when I am tacking him up at the post. He keeps shifting his weight and moving around, making it quite difficult for me. And when we are on the ride, he always rushes so far up ahead that I have to stop him to wait for the group. And that's when he gets really impatient. No matter what I do, he will not stand still and wait for the group. So, I have to spin him around and walk back to the group with him. Many times I have tried training him to be patient, using various techniques and methods, but I have always failed. I guess he just has so much energy that he always has to be doing something. But I will always love him no matter how impatient he is, as he brings so much excitement and adventure to my life.
8	17842	7	3	A time when I was patient was when I preordered a videogame called @CAPS1 @CAPS2. I preordered it a month before it came out, and I was constantly looking forward to its release. I could hardly wait for it to come out. I mostly wanted it because @ORGANIZATION1 is the well - known company that makes it, and this is the last game @ORGANIZATION1 was making because some other company bought the @CAPS1 series from @ORGANIZATION1. I was really interested in seeing how they would conclude the series. When the game finally came out on @DATE1, the fourteenth of two thousand ten, I went to the store with my friends and bought it. The game is truly amazing. I would give it four out of five stars. I’m not obsessed with it, though. I play it only about two hours a day, which is all my parents let me play anyway. Hala @CAPS2 is my very favorite game, and I'm glad I was patient enough to wait for its release.
9	17843	7	3	One time I was patient it was when I wanted a phone. I knew I didn't have a phone, but I was certain I was gonna get one someday. The day finally came to get my phone on @DATE1. It was my @NUM1 birthday. I was excitedly opening presents, and I had no idea what I was getting. But the last and biggest present was a shiny cell phone. I was overjoyed. So I immediately called my friend on it, and she said, “Whose phone are you calling from?” I said, “Mine!” I couldn't believe I could be so patient for such a long time. I was so happy that I could be so patient for so long. I did not know someone could be so patient for so long. Once I got my phone, I wasn't very patient when waiting for a text message to come back to me. At first, I kept checking every few seconds. But after all, I found my patience and just waited until I got the text message back. I wish I could be patient every day, but it's hard to do that. I'm happy that I have a phone so I can call my mom after all my activities. Then I know she is on her way, and I will be patient with her. Could I ever be more patient? Some days I'm never patient with anything. One day I will teach someone to be patient with me, and I will be happy to do that. But some day and every day after that, I will try to be patient for everybody. I wish everybody will be patient some day. Patience means you will just wait for that day or moment of life. This is a time when I was patient and when I want other people to be patient. I hope someday everybody in the world will be patient with everybody. Will you please help other people to be patient, and then they could teach someone new every day? I will be patient or try to be patient and wait for another thing to happen in life. I hope you are patient at times too. Thanks for reading the time I was patient and times when I want to be patient. Hope you enjoyed this story.
10	17844	7	3	I think patience is a time when you have to be calm and composed. It is also a time of waiting patiently for things to happen. For some people, being patient is extremely hard as they are always in a hurry. But for me, it's relatively easy. At times, I can be impatient, but I guess everyone has those moments. Being patient can be a bit nerve - racking, but I manage to stay calm. A lot of times, I get mad if I have to be overly patient. I think @PERCENT1 of people in the world don't like to be patient. However, with patience comes a reward if you are really patient! When you patiently wait for something, you often get a better outcome. I believe that cultivating patience is an important life skill, and although it's not always easy, it's definitely worth the effort.
11	17845	7	3	You know that life is so much harder when you don't have the patience. If you don't, then I'm going to tell you why. There was a time when I found out I was going to @LOCATION1. Now, that's the good part, but when I asked “how are we getting there?”, I learned we had to fly. Right then and there, I knew I was going to have to be very patient as I thought I didn't have enough patience to fly to @LOCATION1. Although it was tough, I got through it. Now, the worst thing was when I got to @LOCATION1, it was extremely hot out. We had to stand outside under the scorching sun to wait for the bus. It got so hot that I lost all my patience and got so angry at everyone that I thought I was going to blow up! Only because I didn't want to wait for the ride anymore. Haha, then I came to my senses and I realized it was way easier to wait. Eventually, the bus showed up and I already felt way better. This experience taught me the importance of patience in difficult situations.
12	17846	7	3	One nice sunny day, I was trapped in a doctor's office with no air - conditioning. This doctor's office had @NUM1 old, worn - out chairs in the dirty waiting room. I was already crammed in the room with about @NUM2 people for @NUM3 long, uncomfortable minutes. I was trying to be patient, but my patience was wearing off. Big drops of sweat dripped off of my face onto my black @PERSON1 short - @CAPS1 shirt. I was starting to get hot and mad, but I kept my patience. I knew if I was going to get mad even more, it wouldn't help or make the time pass faster. Then all of a sudden, “creeeeeck,” the door opened. A tall white woman with green shrubs on her uniform said, “@CAPS2.” This incident made me understand that patience is a virtue even in the most uncomfortable circumstances.
13	17847	7	3	A time I was patient was @DATE1, when I was in line to ride the dragster in @CAPS1 point. It was a super hot day. I was at @CAPS1 point with my best friend and we were getting ready to get on the dragster. The line was about an hour long and the sun was beating down hard on us, so to me it felt like forever. Just as we were about to go on the ride, they stopped us because the ride wasn't working right. So we had to wait another @NUM1 mins. Luckily, my best friend and I had good patience, unlike some of the other people who stormed out of there in the first five minutes. We waited patiently and finally got on the ride. It was one of the most fun experiences of my life. “I'm so happy we waited,” said @PERSON1, my best friend. Some people have patience like @PERSON1 and I, and some don't, like the people who ran off. I'm glad we waited or that great experience would not have happened. In this case, patience was truly a great thing for @PERSON1 and I, and it showed that good things come to those who wait.
14	17849	7	3	One day, my soccer team was in the championship game and we were facing the lions. At the start of the game, I was on the bench as I was the worst on my team. After the @DATE1, we were up @NUM1, but my coach still put me on the bench and I just sat there and cheered for my teammates. The next two quarters went by and it was a tie game @NUM2. Half - way through the @DATE2, our star player got hurt, so the coach put me in. I had no clue what to do; I was just chasing the ball around. With one minute left, I was standing by their goalie and one of my teammates shot the ball. It zinged through the air and hit me in the foot. The ball redirected into the goal and my team started to cheer. We were up @NUM3. After the @DATE2 minute was done and the horn went off, everyone cheered again and lifted me up. That's how patience helped me. It taught me that even if you start on the sidelines, patience can lead to unexpected opportunities.
15	17850	7	3	This is about a story when I was patient. I was on an @LOCATION1 “@LOCATION1, so this is what happened on the @LOCATION1. I was standing in line and ordered some sausages, eggs, pancakes with syrup, hash browns and orange juice. Then, a man with what seemed like a steak for his head walked in, ordered something and sat down. I got a little mad, but I was still being patient. Okay, but then I got really mad because the “steak - head” guy got his food before mine even though I walked in here first. So then I cooled down because a nice cute girl walked in, ordered and came to sit down where I was sitting. Then, an old couple who seemed to think they were all that and hip came in, ordered and sat down. Finally, the girl and I finally got our food. We decided to show the old people what's up, so we challenged them to a surf contest. But the main thing is to sit and wait and be patient even though it was @NUM1 in the @TIME1. This experience made me see that patience can turn a frustrating situation into an exciting one.
16	17851	7	3	Tick, tock, tick, tock. The rhythmic ticking of the clock seemed to mock me. Being patient is hard for some people but easy for others. Iím not a very patient person. Iíll tell about a time when I was patient. (the only time) One time me, my mom, and my sister we went to the doctor because my sister had a doctor's appointment. I asked my mom how long it was gonna be and she said ìabout @NUM1 min.î With a sigh, I said ok. When we arrived, she asked if I wanted to come inside and I said no, Iíll wait in the car. I settled into the car seat and was inside of the car waiting. Before long, I got bored and turned the music on. This was around @NUM2 or @NUM3 in. About @NUM4 later, I got tired of listening to music. Frustrated, I tried to fall asleep. That didnít work. My arms and legs were feeling tight, so I went outside to stretch. It was @NUM5 and my mom and sister come walking. Thats a time I was patient, and though it was tough, I managed to hold it together.
17	17852	7	3	One day @CAPS1 went to school pretty early in the @TIME1. He walked to school just as if it were a normal day, and goes to his first class in the @NUM1 grade. He chatted with his friends all through the start of class and then class was over. Then he goes to @NUM2 hour science and there is a lab with partners. @CAPS3 him and @PERSON2 decide to be partners. Half way through the lab, they found themselves stuck and didn't know what to do. @CAPS3 @CAPS1 goes up to the teacher and interrupts her while she's talking to another student. @CAPS3 the teacher says ill be with you in a moment, but he continues to bug her. @CAPS3 he got a demerit step. Then later that day he was in @CAPS2 and was working on a worksheet but the teacher was in a discussion with the principal. @CAPS3 he decided to wait for her to be done so @CAPS3 he wouldn't get in trouble, but it was taking much longer than expected. @CAPS3 he moved on to the next problem. Then the teacher comes back and he got her help. @CAPS3 in conclusion @PERSON1 learned two lessons that day. One that you can get in trouble for being impatient and get a step. Two that if you are polite and courteous in class and be patient you can get the reward of getting a letter citizenship grade. Which @PERSON1 did that day, and he'll surely remember these lessons in the future.
18	17853	7	3	I recall once a famous magician named @PERSON1 was performing a stunt that took enormous amounts of patience and courage. It was named ì@CAPS1 In Timeî. The magician had to stay in a block of ice for @NUM1 days or @NUM2 hours! The great magician had only a thin sweater on. He had the enclosed ice block open to the public. As the magnificent magician later said ìI could barely hear anythingî. He waited for hours on end, feeling like he was falling down an abyss or bottomless pit. Every passing minute seemed like an eternity. Until the final seconds ended. The magician was finally free. And alive, having successfully completed this incredible feat of endurance.
19	17854	7	3	One day, a few years ago, I woke up and my mom said we were going to my grandmaís house. So I started to get ready. After I was done getting dressed, I looked on my dresser and grabbed my @MONEY2 @MONEY3 that I was saving up to buy something, just in case we went to the store. When we got there, I saw my cousinís dad @CAPS1 walking a cute little puppy. I walked up to him and asked about the dog. He said it was his brother's dog and he was selling it. My mom said I could get a dog, so I asked him how much did it cost. @CAPS1 said @MONEY1. I got really excited because I had @MONEY2 and could get @MONEY3 from my grandma. So I called my mom but she was busy somewhere else. She told me that she wanted to see the dog before I buy him. So @CAPS1 waited there for hours but my mom took forever. Then finally, I got impatient and bought him. But my mom wasn't mad because she ended up liking him, and now I have a wonderful furry friend.
20	17856	7	3	The time that I was patient was not long ago. It was a day filled with boredom and waiting. I went to a candy store to buy some candy. I had my heart set on a lollipop. The man told me to hold on when he was getting my candy. It was @NUM1 minutes until he brought me my candy. I sat there quietly, being patient enough to wait for my candy. There was another day like that. It was at the carnival. I was at the end of the line waiting to get on a ride. There was a man who was arguing at the lifeguard instructor for not letting him on the ride. He was arguing for half an hour. I just stood there, being patient and waiting for him to stop. I did not complain or argue about the man who was wasting our time. In the end, I got to enjoy my lollipop and the ride, all because I managed to be patient.
21	17857	7	3	One day when I was patient was when I tried out for volleyball. I was really eager to make the team, but I had to be patient because the two coaches had to carefully pick who was going to be on a team and, if so, which team. My friends and I waited patiently in the gym as the coaches called kids privately into the hallway to tell them the results. They had to do it privately because there are two teams, the ‘A’ team and the ‘B’ team. Finally, there were about five other girls still waiting. I chose to go last because I thought I could handle the challenge of patience, but I was wrong. The thrill of finding out was intense! At last, it was my turn. I walked out into the hall and found out I was on the ‘B’ team. Although it wasn’t the ‘A’ team, I was still happy I didn’t get cut. That was a day I had to be very patient, and it taught me the value of waiting calmly for an outcome.
22	17858	7	3	A time that I was patient was last year at a cheer competition. In the beginning of the day, I patiently stood in line, getting myself mentally and physically ready to perform. Once our team was fully prepped, we waited eagerly to take the stage. After we performed, we went to watch the rest of the teams. The other teams were really good, and their performances were quite impressive. Then our team went and had lunch while some of the teams were still performing. We had to wait until all the teams were done. Once the teams were finished, they called all the squads to the mat; it was award time. All the teams sat down on the mat. My team members were waiting patiently to see if we won in cheer or in dance. We waited… and waited… and waited until finally he called our name. The junior varsity cheerleader! We took first in dance and fourth in cheer. That day was a good day for me, and I was very patient. Being patient can turn out right or not the way you wanted it to be. You never know until it happens. That is a time when I was patient at a cheer competition, and it showed me that patience can lead to unexpected rewards.
23	17859	7	3	I'm writing about the time I was patient at a basketball game. It was my birthday, and my dad took me to go watch the Denver vs. the Utah Nuggets in Denver. We were stuck in a huge traffic jam. The jam was caused by a wreck a couple of miles ahead, and everyone was trying to get to the game before it started. The cars were barely moving, and the heat inside the car was rising. I was patient with the whole trip because the trip was about a two - and - a - half hours long. My dad, uncle, aunt, and I were all kind of frustrated that it was taking so long, but I kept my cool and was able to make it through the two - and - a - half - hour drive. When we got to the arena, the Denver team and the players were warming up, and the game was about to begin. At the end of the day, the Denver team ended up winning. That was the best birthday I've ever had. Now I don't think I could ever keep my cool like that again because I have a very short fuse now. I will never forget that birthday again, as it was a test of my patience and a great birthday experience.
24	17860	7	3	Being patient? Being patient is very hard for me because I am bipolar and I have severe anger issues. My experience with being patient is when I lived with my foster family. They had grandkids who really annoyed me with their constant noise and mischief. My foster family had a different religion than me; I am an atheist. They are Christians, and they would constantly tell me I am wrong, trying to convince me to believe in their faith. It made me very upset, but I didn't say a word because I was trying to be patient. And I really hated it. With my anger problems, I'm very surprised I didn't go off on them. But yes, patience does take practice, lots and lots of practice. Because not everyone in this world is patient. Tolerance towards children… I don't like kids too much, but where I used to live, there were tons of little kids who were the grandkids of my foster family. I used to say those kids are annoying, but I had to tolerate them. Kids are very hard to tolerate, and so are “guardian parents.” They are the worst; they tell you what to do, and they aren't even your parents, but I tolerated it. This experience taught me that with practice, I can control my anger and be more patient in difficult situations.
25	17861	7	3	One time when I was patient was when we were going north. We had to pack for the trip, but I was already done because I had packed the week before. My family was still packing, so I went to sit in the car because I was already ready and had nothing else to do. When I went back inside the house, they were almost done packing, so I went to the bathroom. When I got out, they were finished packing. When we got going, I had to wait for over three hours to get where we were going. The car ride was long, and I was getting a bit restless, but I kept myself occupied by looking out the window. When we got there, we had a great time exploring Mackinac City. The reason I used this as my example is because it took a lot of patience to get to Mackinac City from Nbly. That day I learned a lot about how important it is to be patient, as the end result was a fun and memorable trip.
26	17862	7	3	Patients are very important. But I'm not very good at being patient with my patients. And when I'm waiting for my turn, I often end up forgetting what I'm going to say. I guess I'm not very patient because my family isn't very patient either. My family isn't very patient because we just want to say what we're going to say before we forget it. Our family is also very forgetful. That is probably another reason why we aren't patient. Patience is important because it helps you be more calm and it helps you wait your turn. That's all I know about patience, and I realize I should work on improving it.
27	17863	7	3	Patience is when you can take your time at something. When you're able to wait, not in a hurry, pushing, shoving, and rushing like something bad has happened. Being patient also means that you are understanding when it comes to tolerating others, and it's when you are calm, cool, at peace, and full of love. These qualities of patience can have a positive impact on our daily lives and relationships.
28	17864	7	3	When I was patient was when I went down the river with my dad and my two sisters (@CAPS1 @MONEY1). The only way I'm patient is when my dad says we are going from north to @LOCATION1. So I have no choice but to be patient because it is a two - hour trip. But there is a train track bridge that my dad usually stops off of and takes a break and we eat some lunch. The bridge is about a one - hour ride down the river if you go all the way. But when it's just me and my dad, we just float the whole way. This experience shows that sometimes circumstances can make me be patient.
29	17865	7	3	"Patience? I am not a patient type of person. I am a big fan of @PERSON1 @CAPS1. He played in a @CAPS11 called @CAPS2 which I really wanted to watch. Which came out @DATE1. That I haven't even seen yet. Until one day I was sitting on my porch where I asked my mom to take me to @CAPS9 and watch @CAPS2 that @DATE2. When she said ""wlc"" (maybe she meant something like wait later or something), I was really upset because I wanted to watch it really really bad. I was being very patient at the time. I had called my @CAPS4's, @CAPS5's, sister's and brother's to take me. But they said they were busy so I cried myself to sleep. The next @NUM1 days my mom and dad were talking about going to the movies and out to dinner. I walked in screaming and yelling ""@CAPS6 ARE @CAPS7 @CAPS8 @CAPS9 AND WATCH A @CAPS11 AND @CAPS12 @CAPS13 @CAPS14 @CAPS7 @CAPS16'@CAPS17 @CAPS9 @CAPS19 @CAPS7 OWN @CAPS21"" Then I left out of the room. The very next day my brother and his girlfriend went to @CAPS9 and watch it knowing I wanted to. They came home teasing me saying @CAPS6 how good the @CAPS11 was. So that night I went downstairs to demand to @CAPS9 and watch ""@CAPS2"" saying "" I am being very patient with you all about taking me to watch @CAPS2 but you all are pushing my buttons so I demand to @CAPS9 tomorrow"" Then I waited @NUM2 seconds. Then she said that I could @CAPS9 this @DATE2. That was the very @NUM3 time that I was patient, and I'm proud of myself. I can't wait to watch my favorite @CAPS25 @PERSON1 @CAPS26."
30	17867	7	3	"I am not a patient person at all. But sometimes I have to be, like for my birthday for instance. I would love it if my birthday came at least every month. But of course, I only have @NUM1 birthday a year, so I have to wait. I would like to be a patient person. It's just not in the cards for me. My father, on the other hand, is more patient than anyone. I know he will tell me to clean the car @DATE1. I told him I didn't do it yet, so he says he will give me more time. I couldn't be that patient with my kids. I would tell them to clean it now or they would be grounded. I wouldn't force them to or anything, but I'm not gonna wait a whole month before I get my car cleaned! I guess I could try to be as patient as my father, but that would be really hard. Although if I'm ""patient,"" I'm sure I will be able to gradually improve and become more patient in different situations."
31	17868	7	3	Patience is when you are waiting for something to happen and you experience difficulties but you do not complain. My friend @PERSON2 is a remarkably patient person. Her and her brother are both very patient, showing great resilience in the face of challenges. Their dad has been gone for most of their lives, bravely fighting for our country. This is the story of the time @PERSON2 and her brother @PERSON1 were patient. When @PERSON1 was born, his dad was @NUM1 years old. @PERSON1's dad had already applied for the army. His dad was there for most of his early life. Two years later, @PERSON2, my best friend, was born. Their dad was with them until @PERSON2 was about @NUM2, I believe, but he left that year. @PERSON1 knew why his dad was gone, but @PERSON2 is about a year behind in understanding because she has really bad A.D.H.D., so she didn't know why she didn't see or talk to her dad for about three years. When she turned about six years old, she finally knew her dad was gone, and that was also the time @PERSON1 started to consider being in the army, and it was the time their dad was injured in the leg by a machete. When their dad came back for about a year, they spent a lot of time with him. @PERSON2 is very fragile, and he would try to play with her and tickle her, but it hurt @PERSON2, and she would scream “@CAPS3! @CAPS3!” but he would just keep going and act like he didn't hear her. @PERSON1 isn't fragile at all. He loves his dad, and so does she, but she doesn't like him as a person. She likes my dad more than hers because she sees him more and she thinks he's nicer. In conclusion, I think @PERSON2 and @PERSON1 are very patient because they don't know if they'll ever see him again after he gets on that plane, and I've asked their mom, and she says they never complain about missing their dad.
32	17869	7	3	Patience is an important thing. Patience is when you are understanding and tolerant, able to remain calm in difficult situations. I have been patient many times. For instance, when my mom uses the phone late at night, I patiently wait until she gets off to talk to her. Before events like plays or movies, you have to be patient until the movie or play begins. I am most patient during tests. Like this one, it clearly shows that patience is very important. If you don't have patience, to some people, that can be annoying. If I didn't have patience, I would be a completely different person. People would mind me a great deal, and they wouldn't get along with me well. So, instead of bothering someone, one should stop and be patient. In the end, patience helps us maintain good relationships and achieve better results.
33	17870	7	3	Long ago in the land of @LOCATION1, there was a young boy named @CAPS1. @CAPS1 was full of energy and enthusiasm. He wanted to become a ninja like the rest of the older boys, but he was too young. He was only six years old. One day, @CAPS1 came running home. He wasn't just running; he was flipping, twirling. @CAPS1 was acting like a firework, full of excitement and energy. @CAPS1 came bursting through the door and said, “Mama, mama, I'm @CAPS2 old enough to be a ninja!” said @CAPS1. And @CAPS1's mom said, “Well, sorry, you can't. Ninja training isn't until another six years,” said @CAPS1's mother. “Why not now? When I @CAPS2 turn twelve,” @CAPS1 replied. “Well, the sensai is still on his training, so you'll have to be patient,” so @CAPS1 waited six long years. During those years, he kept practicing his skills and dreaming of becoming a ninja. Finally, @CAPS2 became a ninja, fulfilling his long - awaited dream. This shows that with patience, one can achieve their goals.
34	17871	7	3	One in a land called @CAPS1 bokane there was a young man named @PERSON2. In the land of @CAPS2, all the people lived off the land, relying on nature for their survival. They believed that everything had a spirit, and when you died, the spirit of judging decides what you will be in the next life. To the people of @CAPS2, honor was everything, and no person valued @CAPS6 more than the hunter @PERSON2. One day, @PERSON2 and his friend @PERSON1 went into the sacred forest to hunt danes, a deer - like animal. As they approached the hunting grounds, both men nocked their bows and shimmied up the trunk of an ancient oak. They sat there quietly, both @PERSON2 and @PERSON1, waiting for several hours before seeing a dane. And when they did, @PERSON1 had no arrow ready. Because of this, @PERSON2 got to take the chance to kill @CAPS6. The dane looked at @PERSON2. @CAPS6 stared at him. Its unblinking pupils dilated, and it was snorting blue mist from its nose. Yet @PERSON2 did not take the shot. Instead, the dane fled into the treeline. “@CAPS5 did you not take the shot?” whispered @PERSON1. “@CAPS6 was too far away, my friend. I was not sure one arrow would kill @CAPS6 without pain,” @PERSON2 replied simply. The next day, they returned to the woods, and again a dane appeared. This time, though @PERSON1 had an arrow ready, but @PERSON2 had the right to this dane as @CAPS6 was the same one from the day before. The dane's rear was toward the pair, and again @CAPS6 was staring at @PERSON2. @PERSON2 simply stepped back. Soon @PERSON1 took the shot since @PERSON2 would not. The arrow flew high and impaled the obsidian tip into an ash tree. “@CAPS5 did you not take the shot?” whispered @PERSON1. “It is not honorable to take the life of a beast with @CAPS6's back turned,” @PERSON2 whispered back. On the third day, the same dane stalked through the hunting grove of @PERSON2 and @LOCATION1. The dane walked through the grove from the left this time, giving @PERSON2 a clear shot at its right flank. This shot @PERSON2 took. The arrow flew straight and pierced the animal's lungs and heart. “@CAPS9 the spirit judge @CAPS10 will be pleased,” @PERSON2 states as he carries his kill from the woods. In the end, patience rewards better than impatience. No matter the circumstances, being patient and acting with honor will lead to more satisfying outcomes.
35	17872	7	3	One time when I was patient was when me and my family went on a fishing trip to @LOCATION1, @CAPS1. Once we got on the boat, it took @NUM1 minutes to slowly make our way through the river. The water was calm, and we could see the fish swimming below. Then at @NUM2, we just waited, trolling through the water. The boat was rocking side to side like a baby in its crib, creating a peaceful rhythm. We spent time setting up all the poles and lures carefully. Then around @NUM3, we got our first hit. My dad rushed over to get the pole and started reeling as fast as he could. The fish put up a good fight, but eventually, he got it in. It was a @ORGANIZATION1 at @MONEY1. Then around @NUM4, another pole got a hit. I rushed over, grabbed the pole, and started reeling it in. The fish was strong, and I struggled a bit, but with some help from my family, my fish turned out to be a king @ORGANIZATION1 that came in at @NUM5 and @NUM6 inches tall. That is why it always helps to be patient. You never know what's going to happen if you are patient. In this case, our patience on the fishing trip was rewarded with some great catches.
36	17873	7	3	A long time ago, me and my family were all set to head to the cozy cottage we owned. It was about a four - hour drive on the open road. That cottage is truly the funniest place to go to, with its creaky floors and the nearby lake full of mystery. I was so happy that I could hardly contain myself and couldn't wait until we got there. I knew I had to be patient, though. But I really wanted to get there so bad, the thought of the cottage's charm was driving me crazy. However, I also knew that if I would complain a lot, I'd surely get in trouble. I learned that the hard way. About a couple of weeks before that trip, we had to visit my grandma. She lived about two hours away. During that drive, I kept complaining that it was taking too long. Then, when we got home later on that night, I got my phone taken away for a week. So, after that incident, I knew not to complain ever again about something taking too long. So, on our way to my grandma's cottage, I didn't utter a single complaint. Not complaining is indeed a smart thing to do. If you are impatient, it's best not to go on long trips. Since I was patient the whole ride to my grandma's, my mom was really happy with me. When you're patient, people will recognize that you're a very tolerant person, and it makes family trips much more enjoyable.
37	17874	7	3	One time I went in the dentist's office and I had to sit in the rather cramped visiting room/area for about 15 min - 20 minutes. I really didn't care much at first, because I had to go to school after I was done. You could tell I was not very happy because you're only supposed to be waiting for 10 minutes. I was sitting there, looking around at the dull walls and the old magazines. Finally, I got in and went to sit in the chair. They took my rubber bands off and I had to sit there and wait for about 12 minutes. I was still being patient, because truthfully, I didn't want to go to school. I don't like coming in the middle of class, because everybody stares at you as if you're some kind of alien. The doctor finally came to check on me. Then I got different color rubber bands on, which made my braces look a bit more fun. Also, the doctor came to see me and see if my braces were all right. He checked every little part carefully. I finally got out of the dentist's office and it was about 12:30 so I got to go home and I was happy as I could skip the rest of the school day.
38	17875	7	3	There was a time when I was patient when I went to the barber shop. My family and I were going on a trip and I had to get my haircut the day before we left. I went to the barber shop and it was so packed that it was hard to even find a place to sit. The guy that cut my hair told me I was next in the chair. So then more and more people started coming in and he let those people jump in front of me. I just sat there quietly and waited, looking at the various hairstyle posters on the wall. After those people were done, he never called me up. Instead, he got on his phone and went outside. Then he told me to wait until he came out of the restroom. Then five more people came in. That's when my mom called my phone and asked me if I was done because I had been up there from 3:00 to 4:30. She said to go to someone else's chair because we were about to go somewhere. I still needed to pick my stuff as we'd be leaving at 6 a.m. the next morning. Despite the long wait and the barber's unfairness, my patience paid off as I eventually got a decent haircut and was ready for our trip.
39	17876	7	3	One summer week a couple of years ago my grandparents were over. We went to my grandma's sister's house and my grandma and aunt (my grandma's sister) were going to teach me how to tie my shoes because I was going into kindergarten and the teacher wouldn't do it for you. They said if I learned to tie my shoes I would get to pick something out at the dollar store so that got me all excited! I was imagining all the cool things I could get. When we got there, after I had a delicious lunch of sandwiches and fruit, they began teaching me. The trick they taught me went like this: after you have the first crossover step you make the bop (tree) and you put the other string around it (the bunny running around the tree). Then you put it through (the bunny diving in its hole). Then you're done. After many tries, I was starting to get the hang of it. I could feel my fingers getting more used to the movements. Later we went back to my house and my grandma kept helping me. She would gently guide my hands. Finally one afternoon I got it. My grandma was so happy and she kept telling me good job with a big smile on her face. Later we went to the store and I picked out a shiny little toy. My grandma had to be patient with me. She wasn't getting all mad when I kept messing up. She just kept being encouraging and patient. My grandma's patience really helped me learn faster, and it made the whole experience a lot of fun.
40	17878	7	3	Patience. Being patient means that you need to make and do one thing constantly to make one truly understand. That is the essence of patience. My mom is the epitome of patience. When I don't understand a problem, she will explain it to me in a calm and clear way, never in a rush. She'll use simple examples and draw little diagrams if needed. She doesn't yell at me when I don't understand, unlike my dad, who is very impatient. He would yell, and possibly curse at me in Chinese. That happens nearly every time I don't understand something. His face would turn red with anger. But my mom will continue to explain to me until I understand what it means. She'll repeat the steps over and over. Some people may be impatient because of their traits or because that he or she has high blood pressure. Patience is something many people claim to have, but in reality, it seems like even more people lack it. Having patient people like my mom around can make learning and life in general a much more pleasant experience.
41	17879	7	3	I am patiently waiting every year for one special day to come. My birthday? Yes, it was a special day for my mom and dad. I'm the @NUM1 boy my mom ever had and the @NUM3 boy my dad had. I am still waiting for my birthday to come again, as it always brings so many wonderful memories and expectations.
42	17880	7	3	Swimming is a lot of fun. I enjoy feeling the cool water gently embracing me all around. Patience is an important part of swimming. You have to be patient when waiting to start practice, carefully stretching your muscles, waiting for detailed instruction when learning a new stroke, or learning a new way to turn at the wall, etc. On the first day of the swim team this year, the coaches thoroughly went through safety rules, regulations, and what we were going to do throughout the year. For all the people who already knew this stuff, like me, it wasn't very easy to be patient. But I personally think the entire team did a great job of listening attentively. Patience is indeed important in the world of swimming.
43	17881	7	3	Patience, what is it really? Do any of us truly have it? I think if we take a moment to think about it, we could all be patient. One time when I was in @LOCATION1, we went to @ORGANIZATION1 and we rode without having to wait for any of the rides. It was a breeze. The next time we went there, we had to be patient because the lines were really long, snaking around the area. I could wait, but it seemed like a lot of the little kids had a hard time standing still, fidgeting and whining. Another example about patience is when the miners got stranded in the mine in @LOCATION2 for @NUM1 days. They had to be extremely patient and wait for someone to rescue them. They also had to be patient when they were coming up from the mine in that small, cramped elevator thingy. One last example on patience is when you are walking in a group with other people. You have to be patient and listen to their ideas carefully and let them do some of the work. These, I think, are just some examples of why you have to be patient or when you have to be patient in our daily lives.
44	17882	7	3	The time I was patient was when we were going to Disneyland for the first time, and I was very excited! We only had one week left to wait to go. But I couldn't wait that long. I thought I had waited long enough already, and I wanted to go at that very moment. Even though I had to wait, I still had a fun time at Disneyland. I just had to be patient and enjoy the anticipation. In the end, the wait was worth it as I had a great experience there.
45	17883	7	3	I will be writing about patience in my own mixed - up way even though you are adults. Once there was a little sickly worm getting ready to change into a butterfly or a moth. But this sickly worm had a problem. He was still too skinny to change; he had to be nice and fat like a fat pretzel stick cut in half. He crawled from bush to bush, eagerly eating any green leaf he could find. But here's where another problem kicked in. It was becoming winter outside, so every leaf he found was brown and nasty. The grass was changing too. But he wanted to change into a moth so badly that he had no choice but to eat the dry leaves and grass. And he was very patient about it too. But then he got tired of eating dry leaves and grass, so he grew more and more impatient because he wanted to change so badly that he almost exploded. But he woke up and saw that he was in a white silk wrapping, so he wriggled out of it. And he saw that he was a moth after all. Then he remembered he was eating nice green leaves together. He wrapped himself up and wanted to sleep. And that's how he had that strange dream, a dream that showed the power and challenges of patience.
46	17884	7	3	"I have lived in a lot of different places throughout my life. These places are @ORGANIZATION1, @PERSON1, @CAPS1, @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1, and @CAPS2. That's @CAPS3 different places. @CAPS6 was and still is land that is home to about @CAPS6 @CAPS4. Somewhere along that long road in @LOCATION2, my parents got divorced. My dad moved to @CAPS5 and eventually @PERSON2. We, my sister and I, moved to @LOCATION1 with my mom. @CAPS6 was fun there because @CAPS6 hadn't seen my cousin, my aunt, my uncle, and my grandma for about six years. @CAPS4, I hadn't seen my dad in almost @NUM1 months. My grandma told me not to worry and that I'd see him soon. By ""soon"", @CAPS6 didn't think it meant @NUM2 months. In those @NUM2 months, we wanted a house near a patch of woods and a fresh - water @DATE1. My mom even got a boyfriend that she later broke up with. Then later, she started and still is dating the guy we are renting a house from. When my dad called and said that he was coming, @CAPS6 made me so happy. @CAPS6 @CAPS7 didn't think that @CAPS6 could go @NUM4 months without seeing my dad. But @CAPS4 @CAPS6 did. Now that he's settled, I can see him once a month for one weekend. That's better than @NUM4 months or not at all, and it makes our time together more precious."
47	17885	7	3	I was patient on the trip to @LOCATION1. It took two long days to get down there. During the journey, I got hungry and had to go to the bathroom. Whenever I felt hungry, I had to wait until the next stop when we got gas. So, I had to be patient and refrain from complaining until the gas tank was empty. That's when we'd stop for gas, and I could finally eat something. Alternatively, I had to be patient until there was a @CAPS1 on the right - hand side or a rest area. These places are great because they have vending machines and bathrooms. We prefer the right - hand side stops because it's easy to get off and get back on the highway. Through all these waiting moments, I learned that patience is key during long trips, and it makes the journey more bearable.
48	17886	7	3	When I was patient, I showed patience once or twice. One specific time was when I really needed to use the phone, but my mom was on it. I sat there quietly, waiting for an hour and a half to use the phone. Another instance was when I was eager to go to @ORGANIZATION1 to get some pop. I watched as my mom was busy getting everybody ready to go to @ORGANIZATION1. I didn't rush her or complain; instead, I was patient. These experiences taught me that being patient in small things can make family life more harmonious.
49	17887	7	3	"It was my first camping trip! Well, we went camping when I was one, but I don't remember much from that time. I was super excited! So, I'm sorry if I couldn't help but keep wondering @CAPS1, ""When are we going?"" My patience was not very good at that moment. While I was waiting for my dad to hook the camper up to his truck, I sat there feeling extremely bored. I kept pestering him, asking, ""When are you going to be done?"" or ""When are we leaving?"" Every time, I got the same response, ""Just be patient, honey."" So, I tried, but it wasn't really working. We finally left. It was an hour - long drive, and when you're seven years old, that's a very long time. I had nothing to do in the car; I was bored out of my mind! So, I said, ""Daddy, when are we gonna be there?"" I got the reply, ""Later, just be patient."" So, I followed his demand and went along with his idea. Once we got there, the first thing I wanted to do was swim. As my mom was getting her swimsuit on, I was so impatient that I felt like I had ants in my pants. I was about to go knock on the bathroom door, but I didn't. I took what I had learned earlier and sat down patiently waiting for my mom. Throughout this whole camping trip, I learned a big lesson on patience. If you are patient, things will happen much faster. I still use this lesson today, but every once in a while, everyone gets a little impatient."
50	17888	7	3	A time when I was patient was when me and my siblings were waiting to see if they were going to allow us to get our first puppy. We sat around, waiting and waiting for about an hour while my parents were having a serious discussion about whether we should or shouldn't get the puppy. When finally they called us down to the basement. At first, they said no, and we were completely devastated. My mom really wanted the puppy, but it was my dad's decision. My sister then made a cute face that my dad just couldn't resist. So, he then said yes. After that, I then had to be patient again. We were going out of town in two days, so we couldn't get him the next day. The next day came, and my dad was at work. So, my mom decided to surprise my dad by bringing the puppy home today (@CAPS1). We went and got him from the store (shaggy @CAPS2) because my aunt who lived in a different state gave us permission that we could bring @CAPS1 down with us to her house. When my dad came home, he was surprised and overjoyed to see us playing with @CAPS1 outside. We all immediately fell in love with @CAPS1, and he has become all of our new snuggle buddy, making our family even more complete.
51	17889	7	3	You have to be patient when you are cooking some cookies. It takes a long time to cook cookies as the dough needs to bake slowly in the oven to achieve the right texture. You have to be patient when you are waiting to play a game, perhaps sitting on the sidelines watching others have their turn. And you have to be patient in the waiting room until they call your name, sitting quietly and trying to pass the time. You have to be patient when you get out in a game and you have to be patient to get back in. When you get a home run you have to be patient when they try to get the ball, standing at the base and waiting. For example, in the game of Sorry, you have to be patient to get the card 1 or 2. If you get a 1 then you can get out of the house. If you get a 2 then you get out and get another turn. Overall, patience is key in many aspects of these activities.
52	17890	7	3	"My sister is very patient unlike my brothers and me. Well, my siblings and I had our progress reports coming, and I was so excited to see what I got. My brothers were anxious, and we were constantly asking our mom, ""When are they coming? Did you get them?"" But my sister was always calm and patient, sitting quietly and not showing any signs of worry. Then the day they arrived, we all got nervous except for my sister. The reason why she is patient is because she tries to keep it off her mind by sleeping or reading a good book. But back to report cards, we opened them and then everyone was happy even my sister because we got good grades. Then after that, my brothers and I learned from my sister and now we all have patience, which will surely help us in many situations in the future."
53	17891	7	3	It had been about one month after I got my iPod touch and I really wanted to get this certain thing. No, it was a movie. The movie was I [Title of Movie]. I had already seen it once from my cousin's iPod but it was so cool, I had to watch it again. It had so much action in it, with fast - paced chases and intense fight scenes. And there were zombies making a terrifying attack. Multiple words [Related to the movie]. Overall, I was really looking forward to having this movie on my own iPod touch.
54	17892	7	3	"I know I can, I said to myself as I was getting ready to do a back walkover for the first time by myself. I bent backwards, tried kicking over and fell! Errg! I stood back up and asked my coach, ""Are my shoulders right?"" The coach replied, ""Adjust your shoulders to make the kick over easier."" ""Got it,"" I said. As I bent backwards again, I slowly raised my left leg to kick over, then I pushed my shoulders forward and I did it! I finally did it by myself! Later that night I showed my mom I could do it. So I did the same exact thing I did at practice. I did it again! But this time at home. The look on my mom's face could never be replaced as she was so proud of me. Then she ran over and gave me a high five, then a big bear hug! So I said, ""Thank you for being so patient."" She said, ""It's all for you baby."" This experience taught me that with practice and patience, I can achieve my goals."
55	17893	7	3	3 years ago on my birthday, the only thing I wanted was an iPad touch. Well, everybody got to the party. We ate delicious cake and creamy ice cream. Then I opened presents. I got 5 presents but none was the iPad touch. I was sad. Then I opened birthday cards and I got $100. I told mom since I didn't get the iPad, I can go buy it. But I had to wait till everybody was gone to go get it. After 2 hours of being patient, I finally went and got it. Holding that iPad in my hands made all the waiting worth it.
56	17894	7	3	A time I was patient is when my little brother kept messing with me. He was being so annoying, constantly doing dumb stuff like pulling the curtains down or playing with the stove. I was so angry that I wanted to hit him. But I didn't hit him because he was just a little kid and being bad. I took a deep breath and tried to calm myself down, and eventually, he stopped his mischief.
57	17896	7	3	I have been patient lots of times at the @ORGANIZATION1. @CAPS3 @CAPS1, @CAPS3 sister, @CAPS3 brother, and @CAPS3 mom and dad, we all had to wait at the @ORGANIZATION1 to get all of the shots ready for @CAPS3 brother, sister, and me. It took forever, about two hours for the @ORGANIZATION1 to get the shots ready to be used. One time me and @CAPS3 dad had to wait for one to two hours so that I could sign up for football. We had to wait to weigh, get the @PERSON3 - sized helmet and pads. We also had to wait for @CAPS3 pad punts and @CAPS3 mouth guard. @CAPS3 dad and I one time had to wait a long time because @CAPS3 mom bought @CAPS3 dad a @NUM1 gun. @CAPS3 dad had to register the gun in his name. For basketball sign - up when I lived in @CAPS3 pleasant, it took a long time to sign up for basketball because we had to get @CAPS3 number put on the @PERSON3 - sized shirt for me and @CAPS3 last name. I also had to get basketball shorts in @CAPS3 size. When I played soccer for the @PERSON4 soccer team, it took one hour because there were so many kids that wanted to play soccer like @CAPS5, @PERSON1, @PERSON2, @CAPS6 and me. When @CAPS3 mom took me to the sign - ups last year, it took almost three hours to sign up and get pictures taken. Every school day, @CAPS3 friends and I wait like twenty to thirty minutes to get a lunch or a snack like zebra cakes, or granola bars. It takes a long time before we can go outside to play football, soccer, volleyball, and kick - ball. The end.
58	17897	7	3	I was patient when my mom was giving birth to my baby brother. We had to sit in the waiting room. My sister and I sat there for @NUM1 hours. I slept @NUM2 times and quite a lot because my dad was hungry so he got @CAPS1 food. The first hour, I was really excited and couldn't wait. The second hour, I was coloring with the crayons and paper the nurse brought to us. The third hour, I watched TV. The fourth hour, I slept till about @TIME1, that's what my sister said. My dad came out wearing a plastic - looking dress with the matching head/shower cover and slippers, and he said, “The next time I come out, you two are gonna be sisters to a baby boy.” My sister and I were so happy. So an hour later, my dad came out and said, “Do you want to see @PERSON1?” My sister and I screamed “yes”. When we saw him, we were so happy to think he was all ours.
59	17898	7	3	If you could ask for one thing, would you ask for patience or motivation? In this situation, I would ask for patience. I remember when I was about four or five years old. My two sisters and I boarded @CAPS1 to Florida. It seemed like we were sitting on the @CAPS1 for hours before it actually took off. After about ten minutes, I asked if we would be there soon. My sister said no, and that we were only up in the air for about ten minutes. I watched all the people just sitting there. Some were on laptops and listening to @CAPS2 players. I looked up at my sister and wondered how she could be so patient. After I asked if we were almost there for the second time, my sister did not answer me. I just sat there doing nothing. I had nothing to entertain myself with. I did not say a word for two hours and then I eventually fell asleep. If you could ask for one thing, would you ask for patience or motivation? I am still not very patient, but I am more patient than I was back then. This experience taught me that patience is something that can be learned over time.
60	17899	7	3	“@CAPS1! Look out!” @CAPS2 squealed. The sound of crunching metal was deafening. There was no way out. My eyes seemed sealed shut, but they were as wide as could be. The eerie silence frightened me. I felt arms grab me, pulling me to what they considered safety. In no way, was this to be considered safety, for this was the beginning of one living - nightmare. The living nightmare of my life. Here’s a picture of what I saw: @CAPS3 cars, twisted, tangled and smushed so close together, they seemed as if they were one object. Lying beside me was a small boy. That boy was my brother, @ORGANIZATION1. His chest expands slowly, but as it does, excruciating sounds radiate from him. Blood trickles out from his many cuts. It’s unbearable to watch. Ambulances’ sirens wail as they approach. My father I have yet to see. And that’s what scares me most. I still have nightmares of that night. The night everything changed. Not only had I lost my father and brother, but in some ways, I’d lost my mother as well. @CAPS5’d never understand the pain of watching your little brother die, all because of something you desired. If I hadn’t made my father turn around to get my forgotten notebook, I’d still have a @CAPS1 and little @ORGANIZATION1. Ever since the funeral, I could feel my mother and I pulling apart. Nothing with us has been the same since. We fight constantly, never listening to what the other has to say. Maybe it’s just the life of a typical teen and her @CAPS8. I wouldn’t know because in no way were we typical. When we aren’t fighting about who - knows - what, we just keep our distance. Sometimes, though, the silence is scarier, more heart - pounding, than the shouting. Silence is just so freaking loud! My mother is beginning to attempt the seemingly impossible. @CAPS5 begins to try and understand my strange ways. “@CAPS4”, @CAPS5 starts, “I know I haven’t been patient with you lately, and for that I’m sorry. I will try to be, starting now. I only ask you of one thing.” I give her a questioning gaze, so @CAPS5 continues, “I would like you to tell me why you blame yourself?” @CAPS5 didn’t have to explain any farther. “@CAPS6, I made @CAPS1 turn around,” my voice caught in my throat, “just to get my stupid notebook.” A single tear weaved its way down my face. “@CAPS7, honey!” my mother teared up as well. “That doesn’t make it your fault! You had no idea it would end that way!” I knew my patience had been worn through for a long time, but I refused to snap at my mother now. @CAPS5 was only trying to help. I fought my annoyed tone, which was battling its way out. But I was going to win that fight. “@CAPS8,” I said, regaining composure, “that’s how I feel about the issue. I wish I could just take your word for it, and maybe over time I will, but right now, I just need my @CAPS8.” What shocked me most was the smile that formed on my mother’s lips. “I will wait then.” And then @CAPS5 hugged me. Slowly, with patience and time, our relationship is starting to heal and become more like it used to be.
61	17900	7	3	There was one time I was patient when my little brother's PlayStation wasn't working, and it took me a while to get used to the situation. It was an evening, and my little brother had just finished eating. He was eager to play his PlayStation but was having a hard time turning it on. The problem was that some of his games were scratched up. But the next day, we went to the store and bought him a lot of other brand - new games. So, when he tried the new games, he still couldn't get it to work. Then he asked me if I could help him, and I did my best, but it still didn't work until I cleared up the PlayStation. After that, we had to wait patiently. Finally, at last, my little brother and I kept saying “work, work, work, work” until it finally turned on. To this day, we still say that whenever we want the PlayStation to work.
62	17901	7	3	Patience. I showed patience when I had to babysit. I gently rocked the baby in my arms and played simple games with him. I carefully fed him his food and then took him for a short walk around the room. Eventually, he fell asleep. My mom still was not home from work, and I realized I was going to be late to the movies with my cousins. I played a quick game on the PlayStation to pass the time. Then I looked out the window, walked outside, and sat on the steps. Mom still wasn't there. My cousins were outside. They asked me to stay a little longer. Finally, here came mom, and I could go now.
63	17902	7	3	There are many times when I've been patient, but here are just a few. It was a late afternoon, and my family and I were supposed to go to a big function that day. As always, I didn't know what I was going to wear. After about an hour of rummaging through my closet, I found what I was going to wear. I went downstairs, only to find that no one was ready, and we only had an hour and a half left. I was frustrated and told everyone to go get ready, but nobody listened to me. But I didn't care, so I went up to take a shower. Just as I was about to go in, my mom came and told me I had to wait because she needed to take a shower first. Then one by one, everyone took a shower except for me. I was losing my patience, but I still waited because I didn't want to start a commotion. Finally, I went in to take a shower. We were all dressed and ready to go. At the last minute, when we all got in the car, my sister forgot her bag and jacket, so we had to wait till she got them. We finally made it to the party, not on time but at least we made it. In conclusion, a few examples of me showing patience are when I waited to take a shower and when I waited for my sister to get her bag and jacket.
64	17903	7	3	The time I was patient was when I was waiting for my mom to have her baby. The reason why is because she was being a pain to me. She was mean and moody about everything. So, I was like “oh my goodness, she needs to have this baby so all this can be over and done with.” This was when she was only six months pregnant, so I knew that I had to be very patient with her until the nine months were over. Even though it was tough at times, I held my tongue and tried to be as helpful as I could. Finally, when the baby was born, all the waiting was worth it.
65	17904	7	3	One day at the baseball sign - up event, when everyone was signing up for the baseball league, @CAPS1 was there, making sure everything was done correctly. There were forms to fill out, trophies to be discussed, and other details to take care of. Her friend @CAPS2 walked out of the room because he didn't have the patience to wait. So, when he came back into the room, the sign - up sheet had already gone around. After the conference, @CAPS2 had to talk to some people and sign up, but he had to sit through a longer lecture from his dad. When it came to playing baseball, @CAPS2 quit because he was frustrated. He was at the bottom of the batting lineup and only played outfield. So, when someone hit a home - run over his head, he dropped his mitt in the field and walked off the field in a huff. His lack of patience really affected his baseball experience.
66	17905	7	3	I was patient when I wanted my thought @NUM1 and I had to wait until my birthday to get it. I was patient to get my new phone, but I had to be good at school, and that was hard for me because I used to always be bad and do stuff like that. I used to want everything, but I used to have to be patient and I used to always be good to get it. In the end, my patience paid off as I finally got what I wanted.
67	17906	7	3	ì@CAPS1 Patient!î @CAPS2 @CAPS10 yelled as I was almost bouncing off the walls, full of restless energy, waiting for @CAPS2 friend to get to @CAPS2 house. ìI get @CAPS3, I just canít wait! @CAPS10, itís @CAPS2 first time, what do you expect!î I told @CAPS2 @CAPS10. DING @CAPS4! The doorbell rang and I sprinted to the door. ì@CAPS5!î ì@CAPS6!î @CAPS5 exclaimed. ì@CAPS8 you guys need to go wait in the garage for @CAPS18 @CAPS9.î @CAPS10 said. ì@CAPS11!î we said in harmony. We went out the door and @CAPS3 was pitch - dark. ìI canít see, hold me!î I screamed in terror. All we saw were headlights and we knew @CAPS3 was @CAPS2 @CAPS18 @CAPS9. ìAre you guys ready? Itís almost @CAPS13 @CAPS14 and we gotta leave or we wonít make it to @CAPS15 @CAPS16!î @CAPS2 @CAPS18 @CAPS9 was excited. Just hearing that word, @CAPS15 @CAPS21 was the key to getting there. Having patience for the @CAPS23 thing was great but at @CAPS15 @CAPS16, you gotta have a lot of @CAPS21. In the end, our patience and excitement were about to lead us to an adventure.
68	17908	7	3	One of the greatest ways for a person to have patience is when you are being hunted down in a game of paintball. I have had experience once, and I hope it never happens again. I was playing paintball with a lot of my friends, and if I was not patient, I would have ended up getting shot in the head with paint. I was in a small forest, breathing hard after a close encounter, and I was behind a really thin tree. I had eliminated everyone except for one. I started breathing harder, because he was right by the tree I was leaning against. I decided I would come close to sacrificing myself if I just stood there, so I climbed up the tree carefully. I was lucky I had a camouflage shirt on, because if I didnít blend in, I would get shot. I was deep in the tree, but it wouldnít have mattered, because I was too heavy for any of the branches. I fell out of the tree, but as I was falling, I quickly aimed and shot the enemy in the leg. I had won! That is how patience rewards you, as it allowed me to find an opportunity even in a difficult situation.
69	17909	7	3	I was patient a few years ago with my brother @PERSON1. It was almost his birthday, and he was very excited. He was excited because he wanted a flying toy helicopter he had seen while watching television. The helicopter was very expensive, and I did not know if he was getting it for his birthday or not. He wanted me to tell him if he was getting it, so he kept bugging me constantly. I wanted to yell at him or hit him, he was so annoying. I did not, because I knew if I did I would get in trouble. So I made up a simple game to play with him so he would forget about the helicopter and stop asking me. It didnít work, because he kept on asking me anyway. I made up another game where you have to jump on the trampoline and spin your arms like a helicopter and not fall over. Finally, he stopped asking me about the helicopter. After we ate cake, we actually had to remind him about it. When he opened his presents, he did get a helicopter. We spent the rest of the day trying to make it fly, and my patience throughout the day made the birthday a fun one for him.
70	17910	7	3	One night when I got home from cheer, I was absolutely starving, and the dinner wasnít even on the grill. We were having steak, brown rice, and mac and cheese. To pass the time, I went upstairs to take a shower. I took ten minutes to take a shower, and it still wasnít ready. So I did some homework. I did math, reading, and I studied for a test. The mac and cheese was ready, the steak was almost ready, and the brown rice wasnít even close to being ready. I was so hungry and tired, but I kept my patience. Oh my gosh, the food smelt so yummy. I wanted to eat right then. I was so hungry that I had to put gum into my mouth to keep my mouth busy. Two minutes later, the steak was ready, the mac and cheese was ready, but we were still waiting for the brown rice. My sister and I set the table and poured our drinks. I still had my patience. Five minutes later, the food was ready. All four of us sat down at the dinner table and ate. Oh my gosh, it was so yummy. I had two little pieces of steak, three scoops of rice (I love rice), and a tiny piece of mac and cheese. The dinner was awesome. After that delicious dinner, I went straight up to bed, satisfied and glad I had been patient.
71	17911	7	3	"One time I was very patient. We were on a long - haul train going to @LOCATION1. Unfortunately, I didn't have my game or music player to pass the time. It felt like the journey would never end, yet @CAPS2 I didn't complain. I sat quietly in my seat for what seemed an eternity. Then when we finally got off the train, I said ""@CAPS1. I'm done."" @CAPS2 then came the bus ride to the Museum of Science and History. I thought to myself it wouldn't be too bad. But once again, stop after stop we went. Until finally, we arrived. It was truly amazing; there were tons of interesting things like an exhibit that made tops or @CAPS3. @CAPS2 then, patience was tested again when we went to the history section. It was like the train ride all over again. Dad had to see every single display and artifact. Then we had to take the bus back to the train. Next, it was the train journey again. @CAPS2 this time I had a top to play with, but it got boring quickly, so I still didn't complain. @CAPS2 dad said the trip had taken too long and I would be able to bring my music player next time. That is my example of patience."
72	17912	7	3	"I want to say I found her, text right away but I didn't. I learned something though. Yeah, it took @ORGANIZATION1 and all the other @CAPS1 (@CAPS2 intelligence) for me to piece it all together. But love is, love is patient. If you run to it, it probably won't stay with you, but if you wait and are patient, maybe, just maybe it'll come to you. I just have to make sure I'm somewhere she can find me, said church. @NUM1 year later. "" @CAPS3 what's thhhiiis."" @CAPS4 said. ""I know what this is. Can I just shut the door for the night?"" @CAPS5 @PERSON1. "" @CAPS6, Patience @PERSON1, we're waiting for @CAPS7.""  @CAPS8 replied. "" @CAPS3 here he comes now"" @CAPS10, @CAPS10. "" @CAPS11 what I found in church. "" @CAPS6"" @CAPS4, you found the @CAPS1. Capture, wait he's in."" ""Do you think we have to wait for it to unlock?"" ""When will it do that unlocky - openy thing? I don't know, we will have to wait and see. That is if it will open, and in the end, patience might just pay off."
73	17913	7	3	One time my friend @PERSON1 was at my house and we were intensely playing Halo. We were having a really great time. We munched on popcorn, guzzled a lot of pop, and gobbled up a lot of candy. Then @PERSON1 had to go to the bathroom. He was in there for a while, and suddenly I had to go to the bathroom too. I waited and waited, and I really had to go badly. I was very polite and patient because I never yelled at him or knocked on the door telling him to hurry up. I did ask him once if he was okay, and he said yes. After that, I just waited patiently. Then he came out and @CAPS1 a very big relief. This experience showed me the importance of being patient with friends.
74	17914	7	3	"Patience, what do you think when you hear that word? When I was little, I always thought it would be simply impossible to have a thing like that. But after I badly sprained my ankle and was put in a cast and on crutches for four long months, I really got the hang of it. My mom would always say ""patience is a virtue."" Have you ever wondered what it takes to have patience? Well, it's really just the ability to control yourself. You have to be able to get through tough situations, like moving around slowly on crutches, and still be in control of your emotions. And you really have to control yourself when people annoy you or things take a long time, like waiting for the ankle to heal. In the end, that experience taught me that patience is indeed a valuable quality."
75	17915	7	3	At the doctor's office, there were a lot of people, so we decided to stay and wait. Also, my mom and my dad went with me and my sister to the doctor. Furthermore, my sister and I were eager to go outside and play, but my parents said no. So we watched TV while my mom was engrossed in a magazine and my dad was reading a newspaper. Finally, there were just a few people left. After the person ahead of us went in, the doctor called out my name and my sister's. So my dad and mom went with us so that my sister wouldn't get scared. They just did some routine check - ups. After that, my dad paid the bill and we left for home. That's how we were being patient at the doctor's office.
76	17916	7	3	One day I had to wait in a long line for @NUM1 hours just to get on a thrilling roller coaster. It was @CAPS1 hot outside, but I was very patient. So, I just fell asleep while standing with my eyes open. My mom had to be patient too. When we were stuck in traffic on our way to the camping grounds, we had to wait @NUM2 hours just to get out of it. But mom didn't freak out or anything. In the end, patience helped us get through those long waits.
77	17917	7	3	One time, in recent years, I saw a boy who was at the front of the lunch line. He was just about to go in, but he wasn't all the way in the line, so he had to go to the end. As he got sent to the end, he got mad, but he still went. He was patient and didn't complain. Next thing he knew, he was at the front of the line again. I think that being patient means when you are calm and you don't rush things. And before you know it, you'll be the next one. This shows that patience can pay off.
78	17918	7	3	"Patience is about waiting for something for a long time. If you have patience, that is good for you. Here is a time where I had patience. Last year in @DATE1, after school, my dad and I went hunting for deer in @CAPS1. We found a good homeguard's blind and sat in chairs, quietly waiting for a deer to come along. You really have to have patience while going hunting. We didn't see anything for a while, but then a deer finally came along. My dad got ready and said, ""Cover your ears."" Then he shot, but we didn't see any sign of deer blood, so he must have missed. Then we packed up our things and went home. That is the time I had patience to go hunting with my dad, but we didn't get anything though. Still, the experience taught me the value of patience."
79	17919	7	3	"A time that I was patient is when I broke my foot. It was a @DATE1 when I was at the park, having a great time. I was climbing a pole to ring the bell when I suddenly slipped. My little brother came running over right away, and I told him to go and get help. But he had no idea where to go. So, I lay on the ground with a broken foot for over @NUM1. When my brother returned, he asked, ""Where do I go?"" And I told him to go to the gas station across the street and ask to use the telephone. I was really trying to be patient. When he got back, he had my mom with him. My mom said that I was really patient. She picked me up and we drove to the emergency room. When we got there, it was packed with people. They got us in as soon as they could, but it felt like a long time to me. When they called my name, my mom picked me up and we went toward the doctor. He asked, ""What brings you here?"" We told him what happened, and he took me into the room. The doctor carefully moved my foot around. Ten minutes later, he came back in with the x - rays and announced to us that my foot was broken. He gave me a cast and crutches, and then we left. I told my brother thank you and gave him a really big hug. The next day, everyone at school said that I was brave and very patient, and I said thank you! This experience made me realize the importance of patience in difficult situations."
80	17920	7	3	"One time I was patient when I was in @LOCATION1 getting on a ride called ""@CAPS1 @CAPS2 parents @CAPS3."" There was a @CAPS5 long line, and usually, I'm the type to say ""@CAPS6 on!"" Or sometimes ""@CAPS7's go!"" But this time, I was being @CAPS5 patient in the line. I kept myself calm and waited my turn. I was proud of myself, and so was my mom. That was the time I was being patient, and it made the whole experience more enjoyable."
81	17921	7	3	Tic tak times ticking. I was patient one time, and it was in the doctor's office. My appointment was at two, and I had to wait and wait and wait and wait. I sat there quietly, trying to distract myself, until it was @NUM1. Finally, they finally called me in. Once again, I had to wait and wait again. So, I was trying so hard to be patient. Trust me, it is not easy for me, at least because I can't even sit there for @NUM2 minutes and stay still. I have to move around, so it was hard to sit there, listening to the sound of tik tok for a while. And that was the time I was patient. It was hard to believe, but I did it. The hardest part was when you hear one of those ticker clocks go tik tok, and I was standing there for a while. Now you absolutely know that for some people, including me, it is sometimes hard to be patient. Sometimes it's okay to be patient, and sometimes it's so hard to be patient and sit there and do absolutely nothing. So, that is my story about the time I was patient and was not impatient sitting there doing nothing, not complaining, waiting to read @CAPS1 magazines. It shows that with a bit of will - power, even someone like me can be patient.
82	17922	7	3	One time when I was patient was when there was a twenty - two hour car ride to Florida. It was me, my cousin, my two sisters, and my parents. The car was filled with chatter and excitement at the start, but soon it was very boring. I was sitting in the back with my sister, and we kept fighting for foot space. We were constantly nudging each other, and it was quite annoying. Around five hours in, I was feeling cramped. My legs were aching, and I couldn't find a comfortable position. We stopped off for dinner at a small diner on the roadside. The food was decent, and it gave us a bit of energy. Then we were on the road again. When it started to become night, the road froze, and it was too dangerous to drive. So, we stopped off and slept in the car. It was cold and uncomfortable, but we managed. We woke up during sunrise, and the view was beautiful. Then we went to Cracker Barrel for breakfast. The pancakes were fluffy, and the coffee was hot. It was delicious. Then we got back into the car and drove the rest of the way to Florida. It must have been a long drive, but it was worth it because we had a great vacation in Florida.
83	17923	7	3	Some people say that if somebody's trying to annoy you and you are patient then they will stop, but that's not always true. One day my brother was downloading new ringtones, which I thought was no big deal until he downloaded the mosquito tone. The mosquito tone is a loud high - pitched noise that only people under a certain age can hear. It's really funny if you're the one playing it, but if you're listening to it, it hurts your ears and gives you a headache. So one day my brother, who can be a bit of a troublemaker, has this idea, the one only a jerk could have. He decides he's going to follow me around playing it as loud as it goes. It was terrible. Every time I tried to focus on something, that annoying sound would pierce my ears and make my blood curdle. After thirty minutes of enduring this torture, I decided to call my friend, but it didn't really help. Then I listened to music, trying to drown out the noise, so he turned it up even louder. Then I had this amazing idea. I stole his battery when he wasn't looking. The next day I made a deal with him. If he would stop playing that ringtone, I would give him back his battery. Of course, he said yes, so I didn't have to hear the tone anymore. So now you know why patience doesn't always work, and sometimes you have to take matters into your own hands.
84	17924	7	3	"I was patient for a whole @DATE1. Although, that was only because @CAPS2 mother had promised to purchase me a brand new video game system. This new video game system was the Wii. For @CAPS5 had just come out and had me interested the first time I saw @CAPS5. @CAPS5 was completely modern and had advanced graphics that were far better than other systems at the time. I had informed @CAPS2 mother about this system immediately. ""@CAPS1, I will buy @CAPS5 for you, considering your report card was exceptional."" @CAPS2 mother had guaranteed me. ""@CAPS3! Thank you mother,"" I had exclaimed excitedly. Now I was getting @CAPS2 hopes up and expecting @CAPS5 within @CAPS6 weeks. Although I had done that only to later on disappoint myself. @CAPS2 mother had informed us that I was to get @CAPS5 in between the time period of one to several months. ""@CAPS4 @CAPS5"" I had shouted. "" @CAPS6 months?""  ""@CAPS3 @CAPS6 months, I don't have enough time to think about that stuff. There are more important things to consider,"" @CAPS2 mother explained. So that is what started the longest period of patiently waiting in @CAPS2 entire life. I would often daydream about playing games on the Wii. After approximately one and a half months of waiting, @CAPS2 mother had finally said, ""@CAPS9 are going to @CAPS10 today to buy your Wii"". At that very moment, I nearly exploded from happiness. ""@CAPS3! "" @CAPS12 I had started to do a dance that no one understood, not even me. So when @CAPS9 pulled up to @CAPS2 favorite video game retail store, I was so excited I couldn't sit still.  ""@CAPS13 down! Geez, @CAPS5's just a video game system!"" I @CAPS12 stopped immediately. ""That's what you think."" I mumbled to myself. When @CAPS9 had returned home, I had kept playing until @TIME1. So that is when I learned that patience pays off when you're patient, and all the waiting was worth it in the end."
85	17926	7	3	Patience is hard for me because I have almost no patience for anything! So you can imagine how hard it was for me and anyone else who has no patience waiting in lines at Disneyland. First of all, the drive - it was horrible and long. We were stuck in traffic for a while, and the car was hot and stuffy. We were in the car for what seemed like forever before we finally got there. I tried my best to be patient, and I was. I didn't complain at all, even though I really wanted to. When we got to Disneyland the first day, the lines were terrible! Some of the waits were up to @NUM1 hours long! People were pushing and shoving, and it was very chaotic. My little brother wanted to go on all these kid rides that had huge lines, but I held my patience, not wanting to get anyone upset. Since I like everything to get done fast and not waste my time waiting, I felt like I was going to explode at dinner. Dinner was at this seafood restaurant, which was bad anyway because I hate seafood! The smell in the restaurant was making me queasy. While all this waiting was happening, I kept my patience even when it took an hour to get our meals! Even worse was waiting for the Disney busses to get back to your hotel. There were so many people, and it was hard to find a spot. My mom and dad said they were very proud of me keeping my patience through all of the waiting. I learned a lot of things there. One, Disneyland is not a good place for people like me who are not very patient. Second, patience is one of the hardest things in life, but some of the best things in life require you to have patience. So, that's @NUM2 time I had to have a lot of patience, and I realized patience is a good thing to have as it can make experiences more enjoyable.
86	17927	7	3	Tick and tock went the second hand of my watch, and I just kept going. The fifteenth octave was far away, and there were people coming in and out of the area, some with presents and boxes, giving out tree - shaped candies. The coat changes didn't attract a large crowd. On a balcony of the apartment, I went to the window and listened to the ride outside, like a hauntingly unstable cello. And the fastest thing that happened was leaving my bag. At eleven - thirty, truly. I went back to the airport and then I went home. In those moments, I was patient. In the waiting, I was patient in the cafeteria and at the airport, and I finally understood what patience is all about. It's about enduring the time and circumstances with calmness.
87	17928	7	3	One sunny day I went to a concert at @ORGANIZATION1, and there was an incredibly long line snaking around the venue. While I was standing in that line, there was this girl who had no patience at all because we had to wait in line for @NUM1 1/@NUM1 hours. As that time slowly passed, we all moved forward to get our spots. Before we could do that, there was another long line, even longer than the first one. But it was okay because I had the patience to wait. With all this waiting, it reminded me of the time my mom went to the doctors' office for @NUM3 hours, and I had to sit in the waiting room. Also, one time I went to the living room with my mom, and she started talking on the phone. She told me to hold on, but my sister kept interrupting her. I told my sister that she needed to hold on and let mom finish talking on the phone. So, she ran up the stairs and shouted, “You're a stupid punk!” I just said, “I don't care.” Patience is indeed a virtue that helps us through such situations.
88	17930	7	3	I vividly remember the time I was patient with my parents. It all started when I saw this really cool game I wanted at the store. Politely and kindly, I asked my dad to get it for me. He said he would get it for me on the following weekend. So, I had to be patient and eagerly wait for the weekend to arrive. I was so excited about getting the new game that I mentioned it quite a lot, not remembering my dad telling me not to tell my mom. Well, the weekend finally rolled around, and when I asked my dad if he was ready to go, he said no. When I asked him why, he said it was because I didn't keep my mouth shut, and my mom didn't want me to have it at the moment. Of course, I was angry because my mom always has something to say to my dad and me when I get a game. Just then, my dad walked into the room and said maybe tomorrow, which happened to be @DATE1. He said he could borrow money from my grandma and get it then. That's exactly what I did, and I got my game. Later, my dad gave the money back to my grandma, and we were all happy. The point is that it took a great deal of patience to finally get my reward, and it was worth the wait.
89	17931	7	3	Being patient as a kid is never really easy. I know, for me, being patient is like taking a baby's lollipop away; it's just not a pretty sight. But one time, I really had to exercise my patience. It wasn't easy at all waiting in line at Kings' Island for @NUM1 hours just to go on the ride. The ride had some issues, and we waited about another @NUM2 minutes, maybe even @NUM3 minutes. And yes! It finally started working again. Many people had left, which was nice because the line shortened a bit, but it was still probably going to be a long wait. It was a relief when we got into the building because it was nice and air - conditioned. We sat around, waiting and debating whether or not we wanted to stay or leave. In the end, we decided to stay and waited what seemed like forever! Until we finally stepped into the space shuttle. There was another room we had to pass through to get to the ride. Finally, the wait was over! Using my patience and waiting in line for so long really paid off in the end. It was an amazing ride, and it taught me the value of patience.
90	17932	7	3	"@PERSON1, this is so boring! I really want to try my backflip! I whined impatiently. @CAPS1, you're not ready yet, just wait. If you wait and practice more, it will be much easier,"" said @PERSON1 as she watched one of the other gymnasts perform a back - hard - spring. We had been working on our back - hard - springs for weeks, and I was the best at them in the class. We had to wait another two weeks until we started on our back flips, but I was extremely eager to try it out. I rolled my eyes at @ORGANIZATION1's answer and continued to practice my back - hard - springs. I was doing them down the wedge, and in the middle of each one, I'd do a little roll just for fun. Someone called @PERSON1, so she walked out of the gym to talk to them. Just because she was my coach, I thought she shouldn't tell me when I should or shouldn't do my back flip. I really wanted to try it, and since @PERSON1 was out of the room, it was my chance. I took a deep breath, gathered my courage, and lunged into my backflip. As I glided through the air, the thought that I never learned how to land my flip suddenly crossed my mind, and I landed hard on my ankle. ""@CAPS2!"" I yelled in pain. I tried to stand up, but I couldn't; my ankle hurt so terribly! @PERSON1 ran into the gym as I fell after attempting to stand up. ""@CAPS3 happened?"" ""I tried my back flip.""  ""I told you not to! If you were patient, and waited till I showed you how to do one, this wouldn't have happened!""  ""@CAPS4…"" ""I'll go get an ice pack."" Unfortunately, since that day, I have had persistent problems with my ankle. If I had been patient, I wouldn't have gotten hurt, and I would still be actively involved in gymnastics. From then on, I've firmly known that being patient is always the right thing to do. It can prevent unnecessary pain and setbacks."
91	17933	7	3	One time I was a patient was when I went to the @CAPS2 for a thorough check - up. Me and @CAPS1 dad had to wait in the rather crowded lobby for quite some time. After everyone one - by - one went in for their appointments, I was getting restless. I couldn't take it no more, but he firmly made me stay. So I kept quiet. Well, most of the time really I wanted to say something really bad like how long this was taking, but instead I held it in. So finally we went in and I was so happy. It was like I was the happiest man on earth. That’s @CAPS1 story about patience, showing that sometimes waiting pays off.
92	17935	7	3	A time when I was patient was when my mom took my sisters and me shopping. My dad was at work, and my mom took me and my older sisters to a busy shopping area. It was boring as some of the clothes in the store had a clear division, with boys' stuff on one side and girls' on the other. One store only had girl clothes which I really hated. But I didn't say anything. After that, since I was so patient, my mom asked me where I wanted to go. I said to Best Buy. I got a game, it was College Football OQ. When you have patience, it can pay off in the end, and you should always have patience wherever you go or whatever you're doing.
93	17936	7	3	I am patient. I always have to wait for something or earn it. I go to my groupings with my parents, but I have to wait for them to finish their preparations. I also have to wait to go to my aunts', which sometimes means sitting in the car for a while. The worst time to wait is going to @CAPS1/a up @LOCATION1 and camping. There are so many things to set up and so much waiting involved, but I still manage to be patient.
94	17937	7	3	One time I was patient while waiting for the doctors, and I had a great time chatting with the staff in the waiting room. Another time I was patient, I was at the dentist. I sat quietly in the waiting area, looking at the dental magazines. My third time I was patient when I was going to @ORGANIZATION1. It was boring waiting, with nothing much to do but stare at the walls, but I was patient. Last but not least, I was patient to go on the Tower of Terror. It was the funnest ride there, and the wait was definitely worth it. Patience really does lead to great experiences.
95	17938	7	3	Patience is important in life. Sometimes when you don’t have patience, things tend to go wrong, and that’s not always a good thing. So here are some situations when you do not have patience. If you don’t have patience, you can get into trouble. For example, if you were in a long, quiet line for something and you couldn’t talk because if you did talk, you would get in trouble. So if you didn’t have any patience, you might blurt out @CAPS1 “my gosh this is taking forever.” Then you would get in trouble for talking. Here is another reason why you should have patience. You should have patience; for example, if you were sick and you went to the doctors’ office and there was a really long line, you would probably say “forget it” and then go home. So if you went home, you would get even more sick, and that would be bad. Finally, another reason if you didn’t have patience. For example, say you wanted to go to the mall and buy a new pair of shoes. You went into the store and you found a pair that you liked and they fit just right. But when you went to go check out, the cash register didn’t work, so they had to call maintenance to come and fix it, and they told you that it would be an hour. So you sat and waited for twenty minutes, but you did not have any patience, so you said “forget it” and you left and didn’t get the shoes. Those were some examples of people who didn’t have patience. But if they did, that wouldn’t have happened to them because they would have waited. Having patience is a good thing, while not having it can lead to missed opportunities and negative consequences.
96	17939	7	3	I sat there, quietly staring off into the distance, intently waiting for something to happen. I casually leaned back into my chair and gently propped my head toward the ceiling. I took a deep breath and tried my best to clear my head and be patient. But when I opened my eyes, I was sitting on some bars in line for @ORGANIZATION1's cellar paint. The voices of many people filled my ears, a mix of laughter, happiness, and an underlying sense of danger. The line was estimated at a two - hour wait, but my friend @PERSON1 and I were really eager to ride the ride. We looked up at the roller coaster while the hot sun beat down, almost taunting us. “@CAPS1, why is this taking so long?!” I said impatiently. “@CAPS2, next time we should go during the week. Do you want to leave?” “@CAPS3.” I internally fought with myself to be patient for the ride. The line slowly inched forth. Beads of sweat formed on my forehead as the heat became more intense. I wanted to remain patient, so I pulled out my music player and started to immerse myself in my music. I gradually became more willing to wait. But before I knew it, people were yelling at us to move forward. Embarrassed, I quickly jammed my music player in my pocket. But the line had moved a tremendous amount. It had been about an hour and forty minutes when we reached the place to get on. I was really proud of myself for being patient. We looked at the ride with excitement and hopped on. Patience really pays off. I learned that I should be patient with all sorts of things in life.
97	17940	7	3	I am always patient when I hunt and fish. I often go hunting. Once I find a good spot, I either set up my equipment or climb up into a tree. I wait for a long time for deer, turkey, and @CAPS1. Sometimes, after hours of waiting, you don't see anything at all. The key is to get out early in the morning and be extremely patient. Most of the time, during deer season when I go out, I usually see @NUM1 deer. The reason I see them so often is that I have a great deal of patience. Patience is truly the key in hunting and fishing, as it allows me to have more successful outings.
98	17941	7	3	One time when I was patient was when I was waiting for my fitted, mirror, league hats to come in the mail. They said it would only take @NUM1 days. So, I said “ok, that's not too long.” The days flew by quickly. The hats were supposed to come in the mail that day. So, when the mail truck came by, I was so excited. But there was only a box for my mom. “@CAPS1,” I said. I was really disappointed, but I thought to myself that they would come tomorrow. However, they didn't come. I was still patient, but I was getting close to losing my patience. Two more days passed, and I just gave up. Then one day, when I got home from my friend's house, they were there. Yes, finally! All my patience paid off, and that's the time I showed great patience. This experience taught me that sometimes, waiting patiently is the only way to get what you want.
99	17942	7	3	A time when I was patient was when my favorite @ORGANIZATION1 of the year comes, the @ORGANIZATION1. I had waited patiently all year, carefully counting down the days till @DATE1. Schoolwork like reading books and doing homework was almost done for another year. You could sense the tension in the air as everyone watched the clock on the last @ORGANIZATION1 of school. As the hours went by, with each passing second, @CAPS1, @ORGANIZATION2, everyone in the class grew more and more restless. But I was patient; I sat quietly at my desk, waited calmly, listened to the teacher's last words, and read a few pages of my book. But nothing could compare to that final moment when the bell rang and the students cheered. There was a big smile on everyone's faces as they left the classroom door for the final time that year. This patience taught me that waiting for something good can be rewarding.
100	17943	7	3	Ok, I think to start, yeah, this is the good one. Once upon a time, some years back, I had to be patient for my phone, and it was my first phone. I knew I had to be really good to get it. It was a brand - new phone that had just come out, and I was determined to have it. I did a lot of chores around the house and at school. My mom said I could get it next week. I was so excited, but when next week (@NUM1) came, I was so happy, but she said “next week @DATE1.” I just kept doing what I was supposed to do. On that @DATE1, I got in trouble, but I still got paid for doing my housework. I also did some help for the next - door people and earned some more money. Finally, I got the phone. It took a long time, but it was all worth it. That is my story of patience, and it shows that with patience and hard work, you can achieve your goals.
101	17944	7	3	One day Alex was bothering me. So I decided to be patient and try to ignore his actions. But he kept on bothering me, non - stop. So I decided to firmly tell him to shut up. Again, he didn't listen to me. So I told @PERSON2, “Alex did not stop yet.” Then I said nothing and was going to try to be patient with the @CAPS1 who talks a lot and @PERSON1. Eventually, it did work and Alex finally stopped. So I was happy. But he (Alex) started again. So I told him to stop or I would tell the teacher again. So he just shrugged his shoulders and kept right on making all of the stupid noises. So I told the teachers, “Alex, you better stop this instantly.” So Alex finally stopped and began scribbling with his pencil all over his piece of paper. In the end, I'm glad I stood up for myself and got him to stop.
102	17945	7	3	A @DATE2 ago, my @CAPS1 was brought into the @ORGANIZATION1 because the incision from her previous operation had opened up. Due to this @DATE2 physical ordeal, I have missed three days @DATE1 and one day @DATE2 of school so far because I was gone visiting her in the hospital. Now I'm back and trying hard to catch up with all my classes. So far I've achieved that goal with @CAPS2 and social @CAPS3, but I still have yet to catch up in the other subjects. Although students are only allowed one day to make up what they missed per day they were gone, my other teachers have been extremely patient and helpful to me. They are willing to hold off grading me until I catch up in their class. I believe with their support and my efforts, I'll make it through this difficult time and get back on track with my studies.
103	17946	7	3	I am writing about a time when I was patient. To be honest, I myself am not a patient person. One time I had no choice but to be patient because my mother made me. We were waiting at the bus stop for the bus to come. I was very angry because it seemed like it took forever for the bus to arrive. I was pacing back and forth and muttering under my breath. So my mother said, “@CAPS2, stop complaining and be patient. @CAPS1, be serious!” So as soon as I sat down, the bus came. This experience taught me that sometimes it's better to just be patient and wait.
104	17947	7	3	“@CAPS1 @CAPS8! Really?” It was a @DATE1 @TIME1 at @LOCATION1 pritz. The forecast was @CAPS8, @CAPS8 and @CAPS1 @CAPS8. The tigers were playing the “@CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4.” @PERSON1 was pitching for the @CAPS4 and Justin @CAPS6 for the tigers. My dad, my mom, my brother and I were just two rows from the front row, excited to watch the game. It was the bottom of the first inning and I felt a huge drop of @CAPS8 touch my head. Then I felt another, then another. “@CAPS7, upstairs for shelter!” my dad yelled. As soon as we got up to the shelter area, it started pouring heavily. The players went into the dugouts. My mom called my grandpa to see what the forecast was. “@CAPS8,” @CAPS9 said. My mom took her sweatshirt off and gave it to me and my brother and said, “It's gonna be a long @TIME1, so rest up now.” At first, I didn't understand. But after she explained to me, I knew it was indeed gonna be long. At the time of this, I was only @NUM1 or @NUM2, so waiting is not really my thing. An hour passed by and it was still raining. @NUM3 hours, then @NUM4, then finally 41/@NUM3 hours passed by. It was @NUM6 at @TIME1! The game still wasn't starting. My mom called my grandpa again. @CAPS9 said we still have another good hour of @CAPS8 left. We sat there for what seemed like forever! Me and my family were so bored. But my mom said patience will pay off. @NUM7 ½ hours later, it cleared up. They wiped down the seats for us. We were ready to watch a game at @NUM8 am! My dad bought all of us ice cream for being so patient. The game ended at @NUM9! We only stayed till @NUM4.00 though because of the drive. In the end, I got to see an awesome baseball game (and get ice cream), and I truly learned that patience pays off.
105	17949	7	3	Patience is to be quiet in lines, waiting to do something or going somewhere until it's time and not acting out like hitting the wall and going crazy about waiting for something. For example, waiting to get a new game or waiting to get a ticket to go to the show to see a movie. These are ways you could be patient while doing different things in life. Like one day, I was waiting in line to get a game. It took so long to get it, but I stayed in line and used patience. I kept myself calm by thinking about how great it would be to finally have the game. In the end, my patience was rewarded when I got the game and had a lot of fun playing it. This shows that being patient in such situations is really worth it.
106	17950	7	3	Being patient is hard to do, @CAPS1. I vividly do remember a time when I was patient. This was at the bustling @CITY1. Me and my group had to patiently wait for everyone to get back to the bus. We were the first ones to reach the bus, so it took quite a while before they finally came. @CAPS1, before they did, I was as calm and patient as can be, not letting the delay bother me at all. This experience taught me that patience can be achieved even in situations where it's challenging.
107	17951	7	3	"One time I was patient is when I was going skating at the local rink. And I was waiting for my mother to come pick me up from @CAPS1 @CAPS2. I told my friends ""you'll need a ride"" and I made a silly mistake and told my mother the wrong time period. It was @NUM1 o'clock and I told my mom @NUM2 o'clock, so I had to wait a whole @NUM3 hour. During that hour, I tried to stay occupied by watching the other skaters. In the end, I learned that being more careful with time - telling can save a lot of waiting."
108	17952	7	3	That is the time I was to be patient. Hope you enjoyed. I am not a very patient person; very rarely have I been patient. But, there are sometimes when I was. I still remember three years ago when I was in @NUM1 grade. My whole day was full of patience. That day I was getting picked up early from school because that night I was going to the amazing @ORGANIZATION2 and the wonderful @ORGANIZATION1. When I woke up I was so excited! I had been waiting for that day for a whole four months! I was so happy it was finally the day; when I got to school I had to tell everyone the news. My friend went a few days before and said it was a really good @ORGANIZATION1. When it was getting close to the end of the day, the speaker in my classroom went “@CAPS1”. Then the lady and I had a quick chat for an early pick - up mission. I had been waiting for that moment! After I got picked up we went and picked my cousins up from school too! Then we went to their house, got ready, and we were off to a day we had all been waiting for. It was truly a rewarding experience that tested my patience.
109	17953	7	3	"The time when I was patient was when we went to the mall to go get my customized hat. This is the only time when I was patient. I went to the store called Lio's, which had a nice, cozy atmosphere. I carefully picked out my hat and everything. So I said I wanted “Saad” on it. He started doing everything then I asked how long he said @NUM1 minutes. We went around the mall, checking out different stores, and went back to the store that took like @NUM2 to @NUM3 minutes. So I asked the guy is it done, he said ""not yet"". I was watching him doing another guy's hat. So he stopped the other guy's hat, I didn't wanna make a scene and yell at the guy so I just kept waiting and waiting until he was finally done with the hat that took about an hour. So I thanked the guy and left the store with my new hat & I was really happy with how it turned out."
110	17954	7	3	Come on I need some help. Sir please sit down. I will be writing about a time my @CAPS4 took a suit to a tailor for an important conference. Can you please find my suit? Sir we are trying our best, we might have given it to someone else on accident. I need that suit to go to my conference. Well sir what we can do is have you pick out another suit and we will have the tailor start immediately on your suit, okay? I like this one. What needs to be done, asked the tailor. The pants are to be long. I will have it done in no time. @CAPS1, I have about two and a half hours left and that's when my plane leaves for @CAPS2. I will have it done in @NUM1 minutes. I will be back here in @NUM1 minutes. For waiting, I will even throw in a free tie. At the end my @CAPS4 ended up with his suit, just in time for the conference, and the free tie was a nice bonus.
111	17955	7	3	A time when someone I know was patient was when my mom heard that my aunt @PERSON1 was going to get married and @CAPS1, my mom, was helping plan it. @CAPS1 was patient because during the time of helping plan a wedding, @CAPS1 was going to @ORGANIZATION1 and was two months away from graduating from a @ORGANIZATION1 called @CAPS2ís @ORGANIZATION1, while taking care of a seven - month - old baby boy with the help of my dad and myself. Also, @CAPS1 was trying to get her parents here from @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1, dealing with a lot of paperwork and arrangements. After two months of planning a wedding, taking excellent care of a now eight - month - old baby boy, studying hard for a test, and helping her parents arrive here, and graduating, @CAPS1 was able to help plan a beautiful wedding on @DATE1. This is a time when someone I know was patient.
112	17957	7	3	This is my way of understanding patience: patience is power. Without patience, where would you be in the time of waiting on your house to be built? You'd probably be going crazy because you don't want to be living in a shabby, uncomfortable trashy trailer, camper, or even a sub - standard house. What about if you're in a doctorís office for @NUM1 long, uneventful hours! Yes, you're going to be agitated! But, see, if you have patience, you're going to be able to wait calmly. Patience is truly power!
113	17959	7	3	Patience is very hard when you're waiting for something you want. It's extremely difficult when you're waiting in a line that is very loud, with people chattering and making a racket, or when you order something on the internet and you have to wait just two or three days. If you're not a patient person who can't wait for the simplest thing that will only take a short while, then you're a very impatient person who can't wait. If you are an impatient person, then you are selfish, easily mad, and evidently not patient. In life, we should strive to be more patient.
114	17961	7	3	When I was at the mall one time with @PERSON1, we went to a flea market and bought matching hats and stylish skirts. Then we went to the Chinese stand and there was a strange - looking bag there. We waited for like a half - hour to get our food. We waited patiently and we finally got our food and we sat down at a table, and that was the last available table. Then a family of four was looking for a seat and @CAPS1, being kind - hearted, we got up and gave them our table. Then we went to the movies and we waited in line. @PERSON1 was being impatient, so @CAPS1 had him save our spot. Then I took @PERSON1 across the busy walkway and got @PERSON1 a show ticket. Now @PERSON1 was ready to pay. @CAPS1 we walked back to the movie theater and we bought @NUM1 big bags of popcorn, and then we patiently waited in line to get our seats. That is one of my stories of being patient with my friends.
115	17962	7	3	Hunting is one of my favorite hobbies. Hunting requires what you will think of as a great deal of patience. When you are sitting in a tree blind, during @MONTH1, you experience one of the most boring @NUM1 minutes of your life, just sitting still and waiting, which definitely requires a lot of patience. After you settle in and are being quiet, the woods come alive all around you with the sounds of birds chirping and small animals scurrying. I have to admit, I don't have a lot of patience in general, but hunting requires a different kind of patience. Hunting is something that many might think as just sitting around doing nothing. But if you are patient enough and quiet, you are rewarded with whatever you are hunting. This is one thing that I definitely think requires a lot of patience, but it is not the kind of patience that you would typically think of; it's an entertaining patience that makes the wait worthwhile. That is why I think everyone should try to be more patient in their lives.
116	17963	7	3	Once upon a time there was a pre - teen named Lola who lived in a land called Wonderland. Lola was a single queen. She had lots of money and food, and she had a big, luxurious house. But there was one thing that Lola was missing. There was supposed to be a pre - teen prince for her. There were lots of boys throwing themselves at her, but not one of those cute, strong pre - teen boys was the right one for her. So one day, Lola wanted to go to the village and see all her people. They were very happy to see her. They were yelling her name, “Lola! Lola!” and telling her that she was the best queen they ever had. Then, after they stopped yelling her name, Lola saw a cute and strong pre - teen prince, and his name was Henry. Lola fell in love at first sight and went over there and said hello. He said, “Hello, beautiful.” Then Lola said, “Do you want to come to my place and have dinner?” and he said yes. “Where do you live?” he asked. Lola said, “In the big mansion.” He said, “Ok, see you at six.” He did not know Lola was a queen, so he went to the place. They ate crab legs for dinner. Then after dinner, they played video games. After that, they started to like each other. Then a month later, they were boyfriend and girlfriend, and everything was going good. Lola wanted him to ask her to marry her, but she had to wait patiently, and she did. She waited a year, and he still did not ask her to marry him. Lola knew that if she asked him, it would not work out, so she waited and waited some more. He still didn't ask her. So the next day, Lola went out with her friends, Lily, Rose, Feanne, and Grace. They went to the spa and sat in the mud bath. They were talking about how Lola and Henry were doing. Rose said they were doing good. “He just won't ask me to marry him. I don't think he wants to ask me, but we're living together,” Lola said. The next day, Lola came home, and all her friends and family were in her house. In front of everyone, he asked her to marry him, and Lola said yes. Everyone was happy for her. He said, “I was going to ask you. I just wanted it to be an event you will never forget.” Lola asked her friends if they knew, and they said yes. “Everyone knew. We just couldn't tell you.” A year later, they had a big wedding. It was so pretty, and it was the wedding of the village. Everyone was there, and they partied all night. The newly - weds lived happily ever after.
117	17964	7	3	There once was a soldier named Private Connor. He is a private first class. His best - friend named Jake, who was also a private, said, “I can't believe we have to wait six months before we actually get to deploy.” Connor replied, “It's so frustrating.” Jake responded, “That's how it is, man.” They both started walking to the firing range. Ping! Went the target as the bullet struck it. Jake exclaimed, “Great shot!” Connor said, “Thanks, practice makes perfect.” Right in the center was the hole where the bullet struck. Connor had great aim, but he still had to wait. Jake said, “Patience.” Connor was patient and all, but he wanted to go so bad. Finally, his time came for deployment. He was so excited to go. One day on patrol, his convoy was hit hard by mortars. He was killed in an instant. In this story, patience is the key to everything. Remember about patience next time you have to wait, as even with patience, life can still bring unexpected and tragic events.
118	17965	7	3	In your own way about patience. How do you show patience? You don't be rude, and you just stand there calmly and wait until your turn. To me, patience means you stand or sit there quietly, with no rude comments and a composed demeanor. For example, one time my mom's friend was patient for her because she had to wait as my mom exchanged my brother's helmet at the store. She stood there quietly, not showing any signs of annoyance. When I was in the store, my cousin was patiently picking out an outfit, and I was taking a long time looking at some accessories. When my brother and I were in the shoe store, he was buying a pair of shoes. I was patient. I didn't get mad or make any rude comments. I just browsed around the store quietly. One time me and my nephew were in the store, and I was ordering some food. He made rude comments because he was impatient. The choice of being patient is that you have to be patient and wait your turn to go. The whole purpose of this writing is that you have to be patient in life, as it makes various situations more bearable and harmonious.
119	17966	7	3	One time when my family went to Disneyland, we had to wait in line for the one roller coaster. I pointed out which one it was. Well, I wasn't as patient as my sister, but I was pretty patient. I tried to distract myself by looking at the decorations around the line. After the ride, I had forgotten how long it took to get to go on the ride. My parents remembered. They thought we had left the park and drove off to somewhere. Well, there are many other times I have been patient. Like the time my friend took two days to put music on my iPod. She had just gotten her iPod touch and she wanted to put music on it. So she asked me if I wanted more music on my iPod too. Well, I said yes. Even though I know I can't spend a day without using or just looking at my iPod, I tried to keep myself busy with other things. But the only thing I could do was be patient. Ok, after two days she finally gave it back. I thanked her and asked what took so long. She said that the computer was taking forever to transfer the files and her internet was really slow. Patience in such situations helps us maintain good relationships and enjoy the end result.
120	17967	7	3	“Mom, can I go over to Lily's house after school today?” asked Amy. “I'll call and tell the school, okay?” answered her mom. You are probably worried who Lily is. Well, she is Amy's best friend in the world. They have been friends since they were in diapers. Do you know how old they are now? Well, they are thirteen years old now. Now let's talk about Amy for a minute. Amy is from a family of five: her mom, dad, brother, and her mom has a baby on the way. Amy is so excited for the new baby. She always wanted a little brother or sister. At first in school, Amy got the message saying that she can go. So Lily and her start to walk to Lily's house. When they got there, Lily and Amy had a snack. “Hey, Amy, what do you want your mom to have, a boy or a girl?” asked Lily. “I really don't matter to me. But if I had to choose, I would want a sister. I have already thought about it,” answered Amy. “Well, be patient. You will get what you want,” said Lily. “Oh, it's a girl!” That was what the doctor said when Amy's mom gave birth to her new baby sister on June 15th. Amy was so happy. She wanted to just hold her, but every time she asked, either the baby was too young or it wasn't the right time. The baby was getting tired, so Amy gave up. Finally, one day, Amy's mom came into her room and said, “Here, can you watch your sister so I can take a nap?” That was the happiest moment of Amy's life. So me and my sister grew up to be the best of friends, just like Amy and Lily. That's what happens when one is a little patient.
121	17968	7	3	ì@CAPS1î @CAPS2, my teacher said in a clear voice, ì@CAPS3, we are starting the meap test!î ìuhhhî the @CAPS2 sighed exactly at the same time, looking a bit disappointed. After the teacher passed out our booklets, we carefully filled in the necessary information, neatly wrote our names, and then began. As the test dragged on, I @CAPS4 steadily @CAPS5 and finally finished! But there were slow workers who were very slow, taking their time. I was bored! There was nothing to do but just sit down quietly. I wanted to complain but I decided not to for the sake of my @CAPS2. Finally, part @NUM1 was finished. ìTime for part @NUM2, @CAPS2!î exclaimed the teacher. ìoh youíve got to be kidding me,î I said to myself. Part @NUM2 was short, but it took one kid @NUM4 mins! At the end of the day, the teacher was very proud of me for being patient. Later that year, my meap results came in and they were fantastic! It really paid off to be patient during the test.
122	17969	7	3	One time I was patient was when I was going to @LOCATION1 because the car ride was @NUM1 hours long. I was extremely hungry, incredibly bored, and really needed to use the bathroom badly. I didnít tell anybody because I knew we could not stop. I looked out the window, watching the passing scenery, but soon got bored. We were going to @LOCATION3. I was happy when we stopped to eat in @LOCATION3. I know that from @LOCATION2 to @LOCATION3 is not a long way, but hey, I ate at @NUM2 and it was like noon. We finally got to eat after spending about an hour in @LOCATION3. I did really good being patient because when I am impatient, I get really moody and people donít want to be with me when Iím in a bad mood. Being patient during that long car ride made the whole trip more bearable.
123	17970	7	3	Patience is a person who deals with difficulties without complaining. For example, like when you're waiting in the doctor's office for a check - up. Or perhaps in the eye doctor's office or maybe a dentist's office. When you're in the doctor's office, it's all quiet and then suddenly there's a phone ringing! Then the doctor walks in, or the dentist. All there is to do is just keep waiting and waiting. It can be quite frustrating, but a patient person can handle this situation calmly without making a fuss.
124	17971	7	3	ìTime to go outside!î the teacher said happily, knowing that @CAPS2 would get a break soon. All the kids rushed outside to @NUM1. ìCome play with us! We're playing jump rope!î one of the girls said sweetly as @CAPS2 swung the jump rope around rhythmically. The little girl smacked her little flat shoes on the cement just light enough for @PERSON1 to hear. ìIím waiting,î said the little girl impatiently. ì@CAPS1 on,î @CAPS2 said with an upset tone. ìfine!î the little girl said as @CAPS2 crossed arms and swayed back and forth impatiently. One of the boys came up to @PERSON1. ì@PERSON1, do you want to play tag or hide and seek?î ì@CAPS3,î @CAPS2 said sweetly with her arms folded nicely in her lap as @CAPS2 ran away waving his arms around wildly. @PERSON1 laughed at him and then thought, ìIf I play with him, then my other friend will be mad. But @CAPS2 was being mean to me!î The little boy, particularly waiting for @ORGANIZATION1ís mind to be made up, hopped about like a bunny trying to make her laugh again. ì@PERSON1!!!î The little girl said, jumping up and down, making her little plastic shoes make a noise as they hit the ground. ìI donít have to play with @NUM2,î she said. ìbut I am your best friend,î @CAPS2 said, getting a glare that only her mom would forgive. ì@CAPS6 eyes donít work on me!î @PERSON1 said. ìfine!î @CAPS2 said again and the little girl ran off. ìI can play with you now,î @CAPS2 said. ì@CAPS7, lets play tag?î @CAPS2 said laughing. Then @NUM3 said, ìThanks for playing with me,î the little boy said. It was a fun time outside with all the kids and their different requests to play.
125	17973	7	3	Last @DATE1, I went to @CAPS1 @CAPS2. And we drove for hours! Oh my god, my butt hurt so much! We got there and there were no parking spots, so we went to the back - back lot. But then I was excited as we were walking towards the park. I was looking forward to the wicked twister. To my surprise, my @CAPS3 asked me to pick the first ride. I said the wicked twister. So we got in line and I looked at the line for the wicked twister and guess what? It took @NUM1 minutes to get on the ride. I was so patient that day. Then we cut the corner and there was like @NUM2 more people! So that day, I rode almost all the rides in the park and ate a whole @NUM3 - pound burger, fries, and a shake! So there's my story about my patience. It was a great day at the park, and my patience made it all the more enjoyable.
126	17974	7	3	Crash. Boom! Oh no, there's an accident. @CAPS1 @CAPS1 traffic stops. “We can't stop. Not now,” yells my younger sister. “I'm gonna be late for dance class.” “Oh @PERSON1, just be patient. This traffic will be moving before you know it,” I said. As minutes passed, @PERSON1 has to go to the bathroom. My mom tells her she has to wait, but she replies, “I don't want to wait.” I sat and looked out the window silently because that's all I really could do. @PERSON1 screams, “I have to go to the bathroom.” “@PERSON1, I said please just be patient.” I gave her a candy that only shut her up for a couple of minutes. @NUM1 minutes passed and my sister is fast asleep. I asked mom when she thinks the traffic is going to clear up. She told me she has no idea. @NUM2 minutes later the traffic starts to move but stops then starts to move again. Finally, we arrived at our exit and my sister makes it to the dance class. She got out of the car and dashed into the studio. That was a time I was patient, and it was rewarding to see her make it to her class on time.
127	17975	7	3	About three years ago, my family and I spent a weekend at @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1, a sun - dusky place in @LOCATION1. It was a perfect weekend except for driving four hours in the car with my older and younger siblings. It was loud; there was crying and all that annoying commotion, but I was patient. When my family and I arrived at @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1, it was extremely crowded! It was like jam - packed crowded. My mom took my little sister and brother on the kiddy rides, and my dad took my brother and me. My group went on all of the big scary rides. I went on about every single scary ride that day except for the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3!!! This ride was the biggest one of all time. I was dying to go on it. My group got in line and realized their line was about half a mile long and the park was going to close soon. Twenty minutes later… I was being so patient in this line. We were in the quarter - of - a - mile range in the line. My dad decided it wasn't worth it. So my group met up with the rest of my family and we sadly left @ORGANIZATION1. It was one of the saddest ride - related decisions ever. So maybe next time I should be even more patient and see if things work out better.
128	17976	7	3	Have you ever waited for something or someone without complaining? If so, you are being patient. Patience isn't just waiting a long time; it's being respectful and not complaining about waiting. In order to be patient, you have to be respectful and quiet unless they ask you something. It takes hard work to be patient. For example, if you're at school and need to go to the bathroom, wait till the teachers are done talking to someone, or if he/she is on PowerSchool. Do not interrupt teachers during a meeting or when they're talking. People will like you a little more if you're patient. So remember, when you're waiting for someone or something, always keep the word patience in mind, as it can make your interactions and experiences much more pleasant.
129	17977	7	3	When I was in third grade, I befriended one of my classmates who had some disabilities. I had to learn to be patient with him. When it comes to dealing with someone like him, patience plays a great part in our friendship. Even though he had his difficult days, I would say to myself, “You have him as a friend, and you must have patience.” And to this day, he and I are still friends, which shows that patience can truly strengthen and sustain a friendship.
130	17978	7	3	I will tell you about when I was patient. For a long time, I hoped you will read about it. I was going to @LOCATION1 to go to Disney World. It took forever! It took three days of driving. We played games like I Spy or used the Game Boy. We very rarely took breaks for peeing or eating. I didn't like the trip at first. But when we finally got there, it was worth it. We had so much fun going on the rides, watching the shows, and experiencing the magic of Disney World. It made all the long - hours in the car worthwhile, and it taught me the value of patience.
131	17979	7	3	"One day I was at home and I was getting ready to go out and have a meal. When I arrived at the restaurant, there was a very long line of people waiting to be seated. So I was on the phone with my friend @LOCATION1 and @PERSON1. We were talking about the upcoming @CAPS1 test. As time passed and the line barely moved, I said in frustration, ""@CAPS2, why is this taking forever?"" They told me to be patient and wait until it’s time to order. I then asked, ""What does patient mean?"" They said it means to understand the situation, be tolerant of the wait, and do not complain. I replied, ""I might try that."" And then, before I knew it, I was sitting at a table in Red Lobster, enjoying my food while still on the phone. So now I know whenever I go somewhere with long lines, all I have to do is be a lot more patient and not complain. This experience taught me the value of patience in daily life."
132	17980	7	3	This is a story about when I was patient. My family was planning an exciting camping trip to go up to @LOCATION1. There was a huge campground where you can reserve an area and set up your tent to camp there. The bad part was that it was about @NUM1 hours away by car. So I packed a magazine to read during the journey, some paper for drawing, and my @CAPS1. I decided to make the best of the long drive. Me and my sister @PERSON1 were playing a game against each other in the backseat of the car at @LOCATION2 for about an hour. But as the miles passed and the @CAPS4 music played on the radio, all I could think about was the campground and the fun we would have. Later, I was looking at a magazine about camping. I didn’t know it was about camping at first, so when I realized it, that made me even more excited. Then I spent about half an hour drawing pictures of the camp and the activities I hoped to do. That was really fun. I ended up taking a nap for another half hour to pass the time. When I woke up, I just stared at the road wide - eyed, constantly thinking about camp. Finally, @CAPS2 said, “@CAPS4, we're here kids!” “@CAPS3!” we all shouted in excitement. @CAPS4 set up the camp, played on the playground, went swimming in the nearby lake, and had a wonderful bonfire at night. All that waiting in the car was definitely worth it. But the ride home seemed a lot quicker. That is the story of a time I was patient, and it showed me that patience can lead to great rewards.
133	17981	7	3	Hi, I'm writing about the topic of patience. I firmly think patience is very important to the world. Because if no one had patience, everyone would be running around crazy like banshees and getting mad all the time. It is crucial to have patience because in life, it’s not always fair, and you have to wait your turn. For example, when I go to get my allergy shots at the clinic, I have to be patient. There are often many other people there, and some got there @CAPS1 earlier and have to be served first. I also have to be patient at my football games. In a game, everyone on the team has to play, and I can't just take @CAPS1's spot and play the whole game. Lots of people who aren’t patient can make other people around them also lose their patience. Another term for not patient is inpatient. Everyone needs to have some sort of patience in their daily lives. That is what this world needs, a little more patience. With more patience, our world would be a more harmonious and peaceful place.
134	17982	7	3	This is a story about one time when my mom was patient. One time me and my mom went to the clinic to get my medicine. We were one of the first people to arrive there. The waiting area was almost empty at first. Then a lot more people started to come in, and the waiting room got crowded. My mom thought we were going to be the first people to get called, but unfortunately, we weren't. First, @NUM1 groups of people were called. Then another @NUM1 more groups got called. And then @NUM3 more groups were called. My mom just sat there quietly, waiting patiently. Finally, me and my mom got called. This was a great example of my mom's patience. It shows that patience can help us get through difficult waiting situations without getting frustrated.
135	17983	7	3	Have you ever learned the true meaning of patience just in one moment in your life? I have, and let me tell you about it. One day I was at home, sitting on the couch watching TV. All of a sudden, I had to use the bathroom really bad. Unfortunately, both my momma and my sisters also needed to go. My momma went into the bathroom first. She didn’t take very long, but then my sister went in and was in there for quite a while. I was getting really mad as I was holding it in, but I still waited patiently. I knew that eventually, I would get my turn, but it was really hard. I was doing all I could to hold on. I was banging on the door gently, trying to let my sister know that I was in a hurry. Finally, she came out, and I quickly went into the bathroom and handled my business. In conclusion, this is a time that I was patient. This experience taught me that even in uncomfortable situations, patience is the key to handling things calmly.
136	17984	7	3	Patience is a virtue. It’s something that we all truly need in our daily lives. Without it, we can’t accomplish anything that requires patience. People would quickly get bored because they lack the ability to be patient. Now, here’s a time I was patient. After @DATE1, I decided to buy an iPod Touch. Since no local stores were open, I had only one other option: online shopping. I used Amazon to order it. I couldn’t wait to get it! Unfortunately, I had to wait for about a week to receive it. It was quite boring waiting for it, but I found other things to occupy my mind. When it finally arrived, I was so happy! I was glad I waited. From this experience of being patient, I learned that you can’t get everything right away. I learned that for those who wait patiently, good things will surely come to them. Also, I became better at waiting for everything. That’s how I was patient and have since been better at being patient. Patience truly is a valuable quality that enriches our lives.
137	17985	7	3	"Over the @DATE2, on the @DATE1 to be exact, me and my family went to see fireworks at a local park. It was a great opportunity for me and my brother to visit all our friends, and we were extremely excited. It took us more than an hour to get there. I was so patient because I knew if I wasn't, my mom would not be in a happy mood. ""Are we there yet?"" my brother moaned. ""@CAPS1 my @CAPS2, @PERSON1, we just got in the car,"" I said. My brother has always been a bit impatient, and every time he said something, the ride felt even longer. But I held my tongue and remained patient throughout the journey. In the end, our patience was rewarded when we arrived at the park and witnessed the beautiful fireworks display. It was a reminder that patience can lead to wonderful experiences."
138	17986	7	3	Patience is very important in life. I have been patient many times in my days. I'm going to tell you about a time that I was patient and it paid off. It was @DATE1, exactly two months before my birthday. I went to my mom and asked her if I could get a phone. She said I was too young, and that she didn't get a phone till she was in college. I told her that almost everyone else had a cell phone but me, which was partly true. She told me she would think about it, and that if I bugged her about it again she wouldn't get me a phone. It was @DATE3 now, just @NUM1 more days till my birthday. I thought about what kind of phone I wanted, whether it would be a sleek smartphone or a more basic model. I also thought about what color case I would get for it, maybe a bright red or a cool blue. I thought about that phone for weeks. Then the day came, it was @DATE2, my birthday. I woke up in the morning to the delicious smell of pancakes. After we ate, we went to my grandma's house because it was also Thanksgiving. After a wonderful dinner with the family, we went back to my house for my birthday surprise. I opened my presents from aunts, uncles, grandparents, and then the last box. I opened it, and it was my phone! I was so excited that I immediately called all my friends on my new phone. That was the best birthday ever. It is a good thing to be patient, because I was patient I got the phone I wanted. That’s why you should always be patient and wait. By; @PERSON1. Patience can turn our wishes into reality.
139	17987	7	3	One day when I was home alone, I felt incredibly lonely as if nobody was with me. I was home alone because my uncle was very sick and my parents went to go visit him. I was very scared and I felt @CAPS1 had left me. So I prayed and prayed, pouring out my fears and loneliness, but I felt or heard nothing back. So I fell asleep, and in my slumber, I heard @CAPS2 voice. He was talking to me! I was running in a field full of tall grass. I saw a man dressed in white walking through the mud, and when he came out of the mud, there was no dirt or stain on him. I ran up to him and asked, “Man, who are you?” He replied and said, “Little child of @CAPS1, why do you look so lonely? I am your angel. I have come to tell you what your father has said.” He talked to me for a long time, sharing words of comfort and reassurance. And as we talked, I did not feel scared or lonely anymore. There was a single cloud in the sky. He said he had to go but that he was my guardian angel. After that, he slowly rose into the sky. I will never forget him. He is my angel. And that was the time I needed to have patience to hear @CAPS4 voice. Patience allowed me to receive this precious encounter and the comfort it brought.
140	17988	7	3	The time when I was patient was when Christmas came around. At first, I was so eager for Christmas to arrive. I just wanted it to get here as soon as possible. But my mom told me I had to just wait and that it will come soon. So I waited and waited because I really wanted a Wii console and The Sims @NUM1. During the waiting period, I tried to keep myself busy with other activities like reading books and playing board games with my family. So finally, when Christmas came, I got what I wanted and even some extra presents. Usually, @CAPS1 is not that patient, but the reason I was this time is because my mom told me that it will come soon. I learned that when you really want something or really want to do something, the more patient you are, the faster it will seem to come. Patience can turn our long - awaited desires into wonderful realities.
141	17989	7	3	Every day on the bus, I have this particular kid sit by me. He is incredibly annoying each day, with his constant chatter and hyperactivity, but I listen to him anyway out of politeness. Usually, we get along fine, but we do debate about things from time to time. He tells these out - rageous stories about @CAPS1 and snipers, which are often hard to believe. He isn't really my friend, but he's someone to talk to. I think that if I listen and talk to this kid, it's a god - sent mission because he clearly doesn't have many friends, and it makes me feel good to give him someone to share his thoughts with.
142	17990	7	3	Have you ever been patient? I firmly believe that we should all strive to be patient. Patience is something that we all will definitely need in the future. You can practice patience in various situations, like while at the fair, standing in the lunch line at school, or when you're teaching a dog new tricks. I'm going to specifically talk about patience at the fair. You should be patient at the fair. When you're standing in those long lines for the exciting rides, you need to be patient and not get frustrated. When you're getting tickets or a bracelet at the fair counter, you also need to be patient and wait your turn. That is one clear way you need to be patient. Now, let's talk about the lunch line. You need to be patient there too. We all are going to eat, so there's no need to rush. I've had people push at me all the time in the lunch line; they just didn't have patience. That's another way we should have patience. Now, teaching your dog tricks. @CAPS1 one, you need a whole lot of patience. You can't just expect a dog to know tricks right away; it's a slow and steady working progress. You need to be slow and patient with your furry friend. That is why you need to be patient. You need patience at the fair, in the lunch line, and when teaching a dog tricks. At the fair, you need to be patient to enjoy the experience fully. At school, you need patience to get through the daily routines. At home, you need patience in dealing with family. That is why patience is so important in our lives.
143	17991	7	3	"Patience is something that people don't have sometimes. I know I lacked it once, and I'm gonna tell you about that incident. It was a bright sunny day, perfect for a family barbecue outside. All my family members were outside enjoying the beautiful weather. My dad was busy making delicious hot dogs and hamburgers on the grill, the smell wafting through the air. My mom was carefully setting up the table with plates and utensils. Me and my siblings were having a great time playing catch with a football in the yard. All of us knew how to throw and catch a football skillfully, but not my little brother. Considering his eagerness to learn, all of us chose to teach my little brother. We tried once, demonstrating the proper way to catch, and then we tried twice, explaining the technique in detail, but he just wouldn't get the hang of it. Finally, all my sisters got tired of explaining the object of the game to him, so they gave up in frustration. Me, on the other hand, said the instructions over and over until he might understand it. I myself got really tired of telling him over and over what to do. But then I thought 'hey, give the kid a chance; he might just get it', so I just kept on helping him. ""@CAPS1 is ready! Come inside"", my mom had called out. ""Time for @CAPS1, let's go inside"" I said to my little brother. ""@CAPS2! Just one last time, I promise I will get it!"" he exclaimed with determination. ""@CAPS3, but just one time"" I responded, knowing he had been saying that the past few hundred times he'd tried. But I thought it wouldn't hurt to do it once more. As I released the ball from my hands, my brother ran up to it with all his might and caught it! After he caught it, he shouted ""I did it"" with pure joy, and I looked at him proudly and said ""good job"". He then ran inside to tell my parents that he finally caught it. I was really glad that I had taken the time to help him. I knew he could do it no matter how many times I tried or he tried. I knew he would get it soon, and he did! And that was the time I was patient, and it was truly worth it."
144	17992	7	3	To me, when someone is being patient, they are typically in a line, perhaps waiting to buy something at a store or to enter an event, or waiting for a particular thing to happen. They are being very calm, with a composed demeanor. They aren't rushed, not fidgeting or showing signs of impatience, and are very quiet, just quietly biding their time. This kind of patience shows self - control and respect for the situation and others around them.
145	17993	7	3	"My brother's check - up was today. I wondered why I even came along. All I did was sit patiently for @NUM1, which felt like an eternity. There was absolutely nothing I could do, but @CAPS1 I managed to keep my cool. Waiting there in that dark, stuffy room was incredibly hard. I picked up a nearby car magazine and started flipping through its pages aimlessly. @CAPS1 the only interesting thing I found was an article about a new @CAPS2 coming out. I read that article in @NUM2, and then I went to the bathroom. Really soon, I was back in that wasteland of darkness, sitting there all alone. I whipped out my phone and texted a couple of my friends, hoping for some distraction. Five minutes passed, and there was no answer. I closed my eyes and layed my head back, just waiting and waiting. Right when I was about to bash my head on a brick wall out of boredom, my brother enters the room and says ""That's it"". And then I got a text by two people. It would have been so much better if I'd gotten those texts while I was bored out of my mind! In the end, it was a long and uneventful wait, but at least it was over."
146	17996	7	3	The time when I showed patience was when I went snowmobiling with my family. We were all excited for the adventure. Because my dad and I had to get the snowmobiles warmed up, carefully get them off the trailer, and then start them. He had to ride one around to find a suitable track for us, and I rode behind him on the other sled. I also had to make sure the snow gear was properly on. It was a bit of a hassle, but I kept my cool. Then we went to my aunt's house in @LOCATION1. I've been to a lot of places on the sleds, and this experience was just another one where I learned to be patient.
147	17997	7	3	This is the time when I was patient with my friend @PERSON1. @PERSON1 and I live in the same apartment building, so we often hang out together. One day, I had an idea to go to the carnival. I noticed she wasn't too keen on the idea, and then she said she was scared of roller - coasters. But I told her it wouldn't be a big deal and that we wouldn't go on the big rides. The day of the carnival arrived, and I was really excited, and so was @PERSON1. As we got there, she was extremely scared to go on the rides. So, I calmly told her we could start with the smallest ride. After we went on a few small rides, she wasn't as scared. Then, as we were walking around, she saw one of the biggest rides there and said we should go on it. I told her if she wanted to, we could give it a try, and she seemed sure. After that ride, we kept going on different bigger rides. As we were walking later, she said thanks for having patience and that I was a good friend. In summary, that was the time I had patience for a friend.
148	17998	7	3	There have been times in my life where I had to be patient. My friends and I decided that day to go to @LOCATION1 @CAPS1. I love roller coasters, but I really hate the long lines that come with them. When we got there, we had to wait a half - an - hour just to get inside the park. After that, we made the decision to go on the @CAPS2 ride first. Next, we had to wait another @NUM1 minutes to get on the ride. Other rides we wanted to go on also had long waiting times. So, throughout the day, there was quite a bit of waiting. Even when we went to get food, we had to wait in line. With all this waiting, it took a lot of patience. My friend and I had to be understanding and tolerant of the long lines. By the end of the day, all of us had gotten used to using our patience. That trip to @LOCATION1 @CAPS3 taught me to be a more patient person.
149	18000	7	3	The patience was truly tested. The engines roared, the propellers spun vigorously, and the plane slowly moved forward, heading steadily toward the runway. Everyone on board cheered with excitement. Then we heard a loud crack, and the plane suddenly stopped. We sat there for over an hour, just waiting. Finally, the pilot got on the intercom and calmly told us to get our luggage, exit the plane, and go back to the @LOCATION2. At that time, I was about to lose my patience, but I managed to keep it together. Well, it all started at the @LOCATION2. I've never really liked planes. However, when I heard we were going all the way to @LOCATION1, @LOCATION3 from @LOCATION4, I gladly chose to take the plane rather than endure a long car ride. We boarded the plane at @LOCATION2 through gate @NUM1. The plane took off fast, and we were soaring in the sky. I was a little confused when we landed @NUM2 minutes later in @LOCATION5. I thought we were going straight to @LOCATION3! It turns out we had a two - hour layover in @LOCATION5. I had to sit quietly and be patient for two hours. I was really excited to go to @LOCATION3, and I hate sitting and waiting. Two hours later, we found out that our flight was delayed an hour. We sat and waited until we finally boarded the plane again. As we started moving forward, the plane's wing tip caught on the side of the building and broke off. The flight attendants quickly helped us unload the plane. I noticed all the grumpy faces of the people who were eager to get on with the flight. I agreed with them, but I tried my best to be patient. After three hours of intense waiting, the plane was fixed, and we were finally off. I knew if I had not been patient, I would not have made it on the long journey to @LOCATION3.
150	18001	7	3	One time, I got sent to my room. I had to sit on my bed and couldn't do anything at all. I asked once to get out, but he added more time to my punishment. So, for about an hour and a half, I had to sit there in my room. I took a nap for about twenty minutes to pass the time. I was so bored just sitting there. Then, he finally let me out. I realized that being patient during that time was the only way to get through the punishment.
151	18002	7	3	"Once, I was @NUM1 years old and I was so extremely eager about getting a new bike that I didn't have a single bit of patience at all. So that day, I asked my dad, ""Can I get a new bike?"" He said, ""Not now."" I pleaded, ""Pleaseee."" Then he said, ""Later."" After that day, my dad was getting dressed. I excitedly said, ""Yes!! That's for my bike, so."" I went up to my dad and told him, ""I'm ready."" He said, ""What? Where are you going?"" I replied, ""With you."" Then he said, ""No, not now."" I got so incredibly angry and went and sat down. After an hour had passed, my dad showed up. So I ran as fast as I could and said, ""Can we go now?"" He said, ""Ali, be patient."" I said, ""Why? You said we are going to go."" So my dad parked the car and went downstairs and ate lunch. So I started to get really angry. I went to the couch and sat there and watched @CAPS1 while my dad was eating. After he was done, he said, ""Ali, let's go!!"" I said, ""Where?"" He replied, ""To buy you a bike."" I ran so fast and hugged my dad and went and got dressed. After I got my new bike and I was patient, I realized that patience truly pays off."
152	18004	7	3	"This is a story when I was patient. I believed in aIeons. So I went into a large, open field and sat down quietly and waited for them. I was about @NUM1 years old at that time. So I thought to myself to go out there. I was out there, sitting and waiting and waiting. Then I saw something shiny in the sky. My gosh, I thought it was an aIeon at first, but it was just a shooting star. I was so excited but it wasn't one. All of a sudden, I saw a deer and it was running right after me. So I quickly shot it. Then I continued waiting. I was getting really bored so I made up a song. I sang, ""I am waiting for the aIeons, yes I am waiting, yes I am."" When it got dark out, I saw something strange in the distance. It was the aIcons. The space - craft stopped right in the middle of the field. The aIeons walked out and I shot all of them. Then I took them home and showed them to the whole town. They didn't believe me. Then I told them to go to the field and look at the space craft and they all fainted. That's a time I was patient, and it led to this amazing discovery."
153	18005	7	3	"Patient; When arriving at Cedar Point, there was one ride I really wanted to go on, that is the @CAPS1. The only problem is that it is a @NUM1 - hour wait. Standing there in the blazing hot sun on @NUM2 sweltering @CAPS2 days, I was having second thoughts. Looking up and seeing the bright light and the @CAPS3 difficult - looking shades of green truck, I wondered if it was really worth it. But I knew deep down it was. After @NUM3 minutes, @PERSON1, my brother, was already bored. So we played @NUM4 rounds of @CAPS4 to pass the time. I won every time. Almost an hour later, we got to the first pop - up stand. I got three pops and about @NUM5 candy bars. @PERSON1 got double the amount of me. Two hours later, we got to the elevator which was going to bring us up. At the top, they strapped us into the front - row seats! What great luck. Crank! Crank! Crank! Went the roller as it slowly trudged up the hill. Then the cart dipped down and we were @CAPS2 going @NUM5 miles per hour. We went up, down, side - to - side, and I even went upside - down for about three minutes. When we finally pulled back into the station, @PERSON1 had puked @NUM1 times. Meeting my group back at the car, we began the @NUM8 - hour car ride home and I turned to my brother and said, ""It's another chance."" So a new game of @NUM4 @CAPS5 began, and our adventure continued."
154	18006	7	3	When I was ten years old, my mom promised me a phone. But then she told me I had to wait until @CAPS1. That really got me mad because @CAPS1 wasn't until next month. I couldn't wait because this phone was a touch - screen with a cool keyboard. But I tried to be as patient as I possibly could. The next day, I kept seeing these really attractive commercials of the phone I wanted on TV. It was very hard to be patient but I did my best. So every day, I had to try to keep my mind occupied on something besides the phone. Also, a couple of my other friends had a phone and I really wanted to text them and share my daily life. Before I knew it, it was only a week until @CAPS1, so I was super excited, even though I had to pay for the phone bill. I just wished the time would fly by quickly, but it didn't. So all I decided to do was just wait patiently. After six days passed, tomorrow was already @CAPS1! My days of miserable waiting finally paid off! So I woke up the next day and opened my present and it was a brand - new phone! My heart started beating fast with excitement. I was so happy then I thanked my mom sincerely. So being patient will eventually pay off, and I learned this valuable lesson through this experience.
155	18008	7	3	When I was in fourth grade and I was going to a concert and I had to be very patient. I was waiting in a long, winding line to get in. While I was in line, I started chatting with my friends. We played some simple games like rock - paper - scissors and walked a few steps up every minute. I sat there with my mom, and then we'd walk a bit and sit down again. It just seemed like the line wasn't moving at all! The wait was really testing my patience. Finally, we got up to the front and me and my friends were so incredibly excited. Being patient paid off because if I would have bothered my mom too much, she might have gotten mad at me. Once I got into the concert, the music was amazing, the lights were spectacular, and I had a lot of fun dancing and singing along. That was a time that I was patient, and it made the concert experience even more enjoyable.
156	18011	7	3	Patience is used when people are not in a hurry to get where they are going. For instance, when checking out at a busy store or dealing with tasks at work, some people can be rude and not exercise their patience. At school and work, you should always use your patience. For example, I use my patience at Kinchat School because there are over one hundred third - graders. Half of them are bustling around when it's lunch time, and the other half might get hurt and they don't know what to do. In such situations, patience helps maintain order and calmness.
157	18012	7	3	"A time I was patient is when I took the Taekwondo test. It took two days to take the comprehensive test. The test was on June 15th and June 16th, from 9 am to about 5 pm. I passed the test! I then had to wait (patiently) until July 20th for the Taekwondo promotion ceremony, and I received my Taekwondo level one. That is my greatest accomplishment in my whole life so far. It wasn't easy. I started when I was five, and I am now twelve. I had to perform all the forms I knew at the time, and about 20 stances, including front stances, back stances, side stances, and black - belt stances. There were 15 minutes of sparring, also called kumite (kun - 8 minutes of practical self - defense. I also needed to make a poster, get a parent recommendation, a teacher recommendation, write a 5 - page written report, and a written essay. I needed to perform a form and show self - defense application, do a weapon skit and a practical self - defense skit, and send in a progress report and/or most current report card. In conclusion, I had to ""endure"" the long process of my Taekwondo journey. It was a challenging but rewarding experience that taught me the value of patience."
158	18013	7	3	"One time I went to Cedar Point and I was riding in the car. And we were about 2 hours away from the Cedar Point park. And I was talking with my sister, my friend, and I fell asleep. And then we were there. I was so excited that I couldn't wait to go on the roller coaster. And I was walking in the park with my sisters, mom, and dad into the park. All I could hear was people screaming on the roller coaster. And then we were in line for the roller coaster. I was at the back of the line and I was so impatient. I was like in my mind, ""Come on, come on!"" And I was feeling like I didn't want to go on it anymore. But then it was time to ride the roller coaster and I went on it. I was off the ride in matters of 90 seconds. This experience taught me that sometimes we need to be patient to enjoy the fun things in life."
159	18014	7	3	Patience is a virtue I have always wanted. Sometimes I lose my patience when something takes too long. In the fairgrounds seriously, there was an event called the Grand Spectacle. It was a rain - affected event, and many people wanted to see if the show would close down. The rain unexpectedly did stop but I had to wait until 6:30 pm. It was only six for! So in other words, my family and I had to stand and wait for two hours and thirty minutes. The two hours seemed to take forever. It was an unbelievable torture! My brother kept on annoying us with his high - pitched squeaky noises. My brother had to be reprimanded three times before he stopped! Finally, they let us in at 9:00 pm, and we got pop and hotdogs. We found our seats and began to watch. Man, I'm glad I was patient enough. The show was worth the wait, and it made me realize that patience can lead to great rewards.
160	18015	7	3	"One day when I was going to Disneyland, we drove for a whole day because we went in the wrong direction and my mom got mad. At night, around 1:30 am, I was the only one aware because my three brothers, Jake, Tom, and Cameron were sleeping in the back of the van. My sister Lily and I were in the front. I got really angry because a guy took the last room they had. But I managed to be patient and really, we found a room the next day. We went to the Disneyland Resort to stay. We were going to the water park/musement park. There was a new ride, ""The Scoping Tail"". But we had to wait for 1 hour to go on that ride. I was really patient but my mom was getting tired and mad because it took so long. Then the next day it rained and rained, so we went to the indoor pool at our hotel. But we couldn't go in because there were too many people, so we had to wait. I wasn't patient because I wanted to go swimming. After almost a half - hour, we got to go swimming. Then the next day we had to leave. This time it took almost two days to get us back home. The time we got there was at 3:00 pm. I was patient enough to help my parents get all the stuff in our house. Then we finally got to go to bed. I was so happy that this long - awaited trip had so many memories, and patience helped us through all the difficulties."
161	18016	7	3	ì@CAPS1 kids. Today @CAPS10 are going to look into our microscopes. I will carefully pick your partners.î @CAPS5 @PERSON1. @PERSON1 picked @CAPS2 to be my partner. I think she is really smart and good at science. @CAPS10 were assigned to a microscope. The teacher clearly told us @CAPS10 had to draw everything @CAPS10 see in our notebooks neatly. @CAPS2 looked into the microscope, and saw blue lines scattered everywhere in the view. ì@CAPS3, can I see?î I asked eagerly. ì@CAPS4 I have to draw it in my notebook first.î @CAPS5 @CAPS2. ì@CAPS1, @CAPS17 hurry up.î I @CAPS5, not noticing I was being impatient. ì@CAPS8, who can accept @PERSON3 in their group? He needs a partner.î @CAPS5 @PERSON1. @CAPS2 looked up from the microscope and raised her hand quickly. ì@CAPS10 can!î @CAPS5 @CAPS2. ì@CAPS12! Really @CAPS2?î I complained. ì@PERSON2, donít be rude. You know he is new to our @CAPS8.î @CAPS5 @PERSON1. @PERSON3 walked over, got a chair and sat down right in front of me. He was patiently waiting for @CAPS2 to draw what she saw in her notebook. ì@CAPS2, can you go any slower?î I shouted. ì@CAPS17, can you yell any louder?î she shouted back. Finally it was @PERSON3ís turn. He looked at the microscope and started drawing carefully. I tried to peek at @CAPS2ís paper. She noticed, and I quickly glanced back. ì@PERSON2, you really need to @CAPS4 your turn and be patient. @CAPS10 will all get a chance to look through it.î @CAPS2 @CAPS5 to me. ìYouíre right. Thanks @CAPS2. Iím sorry I was acting like that.î I @CAPS5. ìitís alright, I act like that too, @CAPS3, maybe @CAPS10 should all sit together at lunch.î @CAPS5 @CAPS2. ìThat would be cool.î @CAPS5 @PERSON3. It would be a great chance for us to get to know each other better.
162	18017	7	3	Being patient is sometimes hard but sometimes you donít care. There are many times I was patient. Sometimes I have to wait an hour or @NUM1 minutes, which can feel like an eternity. There is a time when I had to wait an hour. The one time when I was patient was at dance. My mom dropped me off at @NUM2. I waited five minutes because I was a little early. After I waited five minutes I started to worry that maybe they were in a different class but no they werenít. After waiting thirty minutes I was really bored and remembered that dance started at @TIME1. I could of called home but I didnít have my phone with me. Then when five more minutes went by I went in the playset. I was swinging alone, feeling a bit lonely. When it was @TIME1 my mom came to pick me up from dance but I told her, ìit starts at @TIME1. So I have to leaveî. She kept asking me why I didnít call and I kept telling her I didnít have my phone. Then she left and I went to dance for two hours. Being patient that long is a humbling experience to me. I can usually go fifteen minutes but I canít go an hour easily. That was one of the horrible times I was patient, but it also taught me to be more prepared next time.
163	18018	7	3	I was patient when I had to watch @NUM1 little bad girls at my sisters house. My sister asked if I wanted to spend the @TIME1 at her place. I agreed, then her god - kids came over. That @TIME1, my sister suddenly remembered she had to go somewhere important. So that morning she left me with the kids for @NUM2 hours. The kids were a bit naughty, running around and making a mess. But I had to wait patiently for her to come back. I played some simple games with them to keep them occupied. Finally, after what seemed like a long time, she did come back. It was a challenging but rewarding experience that tested my patience.
164	18019	7	3	One day I had to wait about @NUM1 hours which seemed like a year, but I didnít complain. I sat in the doctors office waiting to get called, I sat there and waited with my mom. I sat and read a magazine while my mom texted her friend. About three people got called in forty - five minutes. But I sat and looked at the magazine intently. They called a kid whoís name was @PERSON1, and I thought it was me because my names @PERSON2. I finished my magazine and went on to the next one. I thought I would like it because it had war on the front of the cover, but it was just a cover nothing cool inside except a floating tranlula trick. About one hour passed and only five people were called. I finally finished all the magazines and I was really bored. I watched people get called one by one. Finally there were only my mom and I and another group, and of course they got called before us. It was about three hours till we were called, and when we did we had to wait even longer because they had technical difficulties with their machines. When we did get in we had to wait a half and hour for the doctor. But we got in, he made my knee twitch and then made me hop on one foot, why I donít know. But he did the regular put the thing that goes in my ear and the thermometer that goes on my tongue. But we finally got out and went home. My mom asked me how could I be that patient, and I said, ìI have not a clueî. Maybe it was just because I knew there was no other way but to wait.
165	18020	7	3	When I was going to the doctor I had to be patient. I went there because my auntie's driveway had a crack. And I was riding my scooter fast. I must wasn't paying any attention because my scooter had hit the crack hard, so I sprained my knee. So my dad came out of the house to pick me up. I had to get in a wheelchair and wait because there wasn't any more curtains available for the examination area. I waited for an hour then I got my turn. And they carefully checked my knee. Then they gave me crutches to walk with. It was pretty hard to go up my house stairs with the crutches, but I managed. It was a tough experience that required a lot of patience, but I got through it.
166	18021	7	3	I was patient when I was on my way to @LOCATION1 to see my @CAPS1. I was patient because I didn't want to get really excited about @CAPS2. When I get overly excited about things, more often than not, we end up having a change in plans, and we would have to “cancel”. So I stayed calm. We were in the car for a little over an hour, then my brother suddenly realized he forgot something. We had to go back and get @CAPS2, and I remained patient about @CAPS2. We were quiet the whole way there. This is the story of when I was very patient about going to @LOCATION1. It just goes to show that patience can help us deal with unexpected situations.
167	18022	7	3	Has your parents or you ever sent an application for a job? Well, my uncle did and was extremely patient about it. He wanted that job more than a kid wants ice cream on a hot summer day. One day, my uncle carefully typed up an application for the job he desired. When he was done, he copied and pasted it into an email. As soon as he pressed send, he quickly grabbed his phone, his heart filled with hope for the job. He checked his phone right when he got up, making sure there were no missed calls or messages. He knew he had to be patient. He was still waiting for the call, @CAPS2, but still nothing. It was one week, and he was thinking about calling the place, @CAPS2, but he didn't. Then he got a phone call that afternoon. He quickly ran like a cheetah to get his phone. It was just my mom asking if he got the job, @CAPS2. All he said was “no” with a heavy sigh. I felt bad for the poor guy for not knowing yet until one day. The next morning, he got a call and he picked it up, screaming, “@CAPS1 do you want!” @CAPS2, not realizing it was the boss for the job. So he quickly apologized and also got the job. He was so happy knowing he waited for a long time, sort of patiently, and got the job he wanted. When he went to work at his new job, he really loved how he got it and now knew you always have to be patient and everything will work out great. So now, always remember to be patient no matter @CAPS1 the deal is. My uncle @MONTH1 may not be an expert, @CAPS2, but he should be now. Again, remember to always be patient and good things will come your way. Patience truly pays off in the end.
168	18023	7	3	Super beast patience. I was coming here from school one day on the bus. So @CAPS1, what felt like @CAPS2, I finally got home. I ran inside and saw my high - school brother with a box of pop. I asked, “Blare, where did you get that money? That is the money I've been saving.” You wouldn't guess what he said. “I took it out of your wallet.” I yelled, “What! I've been holding that money in there so I could go to the movies.” As I thought about my plans with my friends, I got really angry. I ran at him, jumped in the air, and punched him right in the nose. His nose started bleeding. I tried to run, but he grabbed me each time. But he said he'd pay me back later and let me go. I thought, now he is so patient with me. He could have really hurt me, but he didn't. Next week, he saved me from a tough situation and hasn't hit me since. This shows that patience can turn a bad situation around.
169	18025	7	3	When are they gonna be here! When are they gonna be here! I was in @CAPS1 visiting my family, and my cousins were going to be coming in from @LOCATION1. I was so excited and very impatient. I couldn't wait until they pulled up in their shiny black car and I could give them a hug that would really show how happy I was to see them. It was around lunch time, and I was watching out the window while munching on cold pizza. I kept on counting down from ten, saying they are going to be here in @NUM1, but they were never there. Soon I realized it was about @NUM2 p.m. and knew I wouldn't see them until tomorrow. I decided I will be patient so I don't waste the whole entire day thinking about it. After a good night's rest, I got up, had breakfast, and then watched some @CAPS2. “@PERSON1! @PERSON1! Honk! Honk!” Could it really be? No, it couldn't. It was uncle @CAPS3 and his big, noisy motorcycle. A few hours later, I heard @PERSON1 again and thought uncle @CAPS3 was probably leaving. But then I heard my cousins. I @ORGANIZATION1 and @CAPS5 flew up out of the chair and totally gave them a hug that knocked the daylights out of them. I guess patience really is the key. It made the moment of seeing my cousins even more special.
170	18026	7	3	A time that someone has been patient with me is when I was younger and my sister taught me how to braid. It took a long time because my small hands didn't always do things correctly. But my sister always took the time to help me whenever she could. I thought I would never do it right. And that's when she told me these wise words, “practice makes perfect”. She let me choose from her best string selection. She slowly and carefully went over how to do it step by step. And before I knew it, I was braiding just as well as her. I am so happy that she encouraged me to keep trying and that she was patient with me the whole time. This is an example of one time someone was patient with me, and it shows that with patience and guidance, we can learn new skills.
171	18028	7	3	One time it was incredibly hard to wait, but I remained patient and in the end it was @CAPS1. One time my family and I were going to @CAPS2 world. The morning I woke up, I was practically jumping with excitement because I really wanted to get to the airport and go to @CAPS2 world. After we packed the car, we drove to the airport. In the car, my brother and I were chatting non - stop about how excited we were. Once we got to the airport, we got super excited! When we reached the area where you wait for your plane, the workers told everyone waiting for the same plane as us that the plane to @LOCATION1 was gonna be around one hour late. My whole family and I really wanted to get to @ORGANIZATION1 world as soon as we could, but we would just have to wait. We walked around the airport, looking at the different shops, and then got something to eat. Then we found out that we only had to wait twenty more minutes! My family and I just sat down and talked and before we knew it we were getting on the plane. Being patient can really help solve the situation.
172	18029	7	3	On @DATE1 it was my birthday and I was just turning @NUM1. I was over the moon with happiness!!! Well, while I was being happy and my big sisters were bustling around getting things together for my party, my mom was at work. We had all sorts of party things such as juice, fizzy pop, delicious food, sweet candy, crunchy chips, and creamy ice - cream, but no cake. My mom was supposed to pick it up when she got off work. Then it was time to open the gifts. After we opened all my gifts, it was time for cake and ice - cream. We had the ice - cream but no cake. I didn't cry and scream like a baby, though my sister did, but she was still @NUM2 and I was @NUM1 and I had to act as a proper @NUM1 - year - old. My mom called and told us she was running a little late and she would be here after she got my cake. When my mom got home we cut the cake and when I took the first bite I said to myself it was worth the wait! I was happy I waited like a big kid, but I was even more happier I was @NUM1! This experience taught me that patience can lead to sweet rewards.
173	18030	7	3	I am normally always patient, but the time I had to be the most patient was when I baby - sat on @DATE1. I was babysitting with my older cousin @PERSON2. We were babysitting twin four - months - old baby girls for eight long hours! Let me tell you, babies are a ton of work and you need a whole lot of patience with them. One time during the day that you needed to be patient with them was when they cried. These babies cried a lot and for a long time, so it took quite a while to calm them down. Like when I sat one twin down and it fell asleep, it would start screaming and I used patience to take my time and soothe them down. Another event during that day that I used patience was to get them to fall asleep. The baby I mainly took care of took a while to fall asleep. So I was patient while walking around the house, gently bouncing her up and down in my arms. Of course, eventually they both fell asleep. A third time I used patience was feeding them. See they were very small twins, so they took a long time to eat. Also when I fed the baby I took care of, Natalic, I had to use patience to not freak out when she spit up all over my shirt. @PERSON2, my cousin also used her patience when “her baby,” @PERSON3, spit up on her too. That day took a great deal of patience, but it was still very fun. And you can see that taking care of @LOCATION2 and @PERSON1 was lots of work, but patience definitely got me and @LOCATION1 through it. Babysitting these twins was a true test of my patience, but it was also a rewarding experience.
174	18031	7	3	Patience is a very long and often arduous task, but the rewards far outweigh the time you spend waiting for the thing you were waiting for. From waiting for a computer to start up, watching the screen gradually come to life, to standing in a long line for a thrilling roller - coaster, your patience will be rewarded. However, many people are not very patient. (Guilty as charged, me) But they can learn over time to be as patient as monks. In short, be a bit more patient and you'll find that patience can bring you great rewards.
175	18032	7	3	One time when I was little we were going to the dentist in Ann - @CAPS1 and there was a huge amount of traffic. Me, my sister, and my brother were in the car, fidgeting around (we ended up waiting for @NUM1 hours). I was really unhappy, so my mom told me to be patient. I didn't know what it meant at the time, but now I know. It means to wait and be calm. When I got to the dentist and sat down, I found out I was late so we had to go back home and do it again tomorrow. This experience made me realize that patience is important, even in frustrating situations like this.
176	18033	7	3	A time when I was patient was when I went to Cedar Point. We drove from @LOCATION1 to @LOCATION2 in our family car, and it was a long, tiring ride with lots of traffic. When we got there, there was a long line of eager people to get in. My mom said, “All right, guys, time to be patient.” Once we got in, we went to the first ride we saw, which was a popular roller - coaster. It also had a long line snaking around the platform. Mom said, “We are going to have to be patient all day if we want to ride all the rides.” After waiting patiently, we finally got on the ride and had a great time. This experience taught me that patience can lead to fun and rewarding moments.
177	18034	7	3	Have you ever had to be patient? I had to be patient when my older brother broke his finger. This happened at his friend's house on a trampoline one hot @DATE1 summer day. When my brother broke his finger, it seemed like he was @PERSON1 in extreme pain, groaning and holding his hand tightly. My mom wanted to see his hand, checking his knuckles and all that stuff that moms always do, looking worried. It seemed like it took so long to ask my mom a question if she was in the same room as my brother because she was so focused on my brother. My mom called the doctor's office during the third day of the accident and got an appointment for my brother. I thought, “Okay, whatever, I'll stay at home while he goes to the doctor,” but there was one person in the way of that, and she is mom. She said that I had to go to the doctor with her and my brother even though I didn't want to. After that day, I kept telling my mom excuses why I couldn't go, like I had homework or a headache, but she wasn't buying them. So, after a very short car ride that seemed to be a long car ride filled with my complaints, we were in the waiting room waiting. In that waiting room, we were waiting, waiting, waiting, and guess what else? If you said waiting, then you are right. In the waiting, seconds got confused with minutes and minutes got confused with hours. Those “hours” of torture made the car ride look like a gentle kitty ride. There was no entertainment, no TV or magazines to distract those cruel minutes from going so slow. If you've ever seen a snail go, imagine that six times slower, and you'll start to understand how slow the time went by. Finally, after all of the time we've been waiting, the doctor comes in the room and asks for my brother. The only problem with the doctor is that she is even more boring, speaking in a monotone voice and using words so long it made the @CAPS1 look small. I was so tired that I stopped caring. Finally, it was time to go home, and no one was happy except for me. I was so happy to leave the doctor. Let's review. I had to be patient when my brother broke his finger. My brother turned into @PERSON1 in pain and had to go to the doctor. The doctor's office was extremely boring. I was patient and finally I got to leave the doctor's office. Some times being patient has rewards. My reward was being able to leave the doctor's office and go back to my normal life.
178	18035	7	3	One time at the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 sports store, I was getting some arrows for my archery hobby. But no one was there at the cash - register to ring up my arrows. So instead of ringing the bell a hundred times and getting frustrated, I just waited there quietly and patiently, looking at the other archery equipment on display. I was waiting for about @NUM1 minutes for someone to come. When someone did come, they said, “Thank you for being so patient” and rang me up so I could leave with my new arrows. That was a time I was patient, and it showed me that a little patience can make the shopping experience smoother.
179	18036	7	3	A time I was patient was when I was waiting in line for lunch at school. I was patient because there were lots of other hungry students in line, and some people were letting other people cut in front of them, so the line was getting longer and moving very slowly. As I stood there, I saw some of my friends getting impatient and complaining, but I decided to stay calm. I just thought about how good the lunch would taste once I finally got it. After what seemed like a long time, I finally reached the front of the line, got my lunch, and sat down to enjoy it. That is the story of one of the times I was patient, and it taught me that patience pays off when it comes to getting what you want.
180	18037	7	3	One time I was patient was when my dad was going to send me a @CAPS1 surprise present. I was just waiting and waiting for it, checking the mailbox every day with hope. While I was waiting, I just spent my days sleeping, eating, playing games in my room, going to class a lot, and watching TV. After two long weeks, I only got it. It was @ORGANIZATION1 dang's game and one hundred dollars. I called my dad and said, “Thank you.” After that, I played my game all night and saved my hundred dollars until my birthday. That was the time I was patient, and it made the gift even more special because I had to wait for it. This experience taught me that patience can make the rewards even more satisfying.
181	18038	7	3	As I slowly walked down the charming lane, carefully looking for the perfect gift I had seen the day before, I was filled with anticipation. To my disappointment, I soon find out it was sold out. Today was my mom’s birthday, and I was determined to find the gift. It was the perfect gift, a precious moment figurine that I knew she would love. I politely asked the manager if they by any chance had any in the back. Sadly, they didn’t. He kindly said, “The new shipment should be arriving at five.” I didn’t think I could wait another three long hours. My dad then drove me home. I was anxiously pacing back and forth, thinking it would occupy my mind. Sadly, it didn’t. Finally, I realized I needed to relax and be patient. Before I knew it, the time was five, and my dad and I went back to the store. In no time, there was the perfect gift right there in front of me. I excitedly picked it up and gave it to the clerk to scan. I handed her the money and headed straight home. When mom got home, I happily handed mom the gift and realized that patience really does come in handy when it comes to waiting.
182	18039	7	3	One day we were driving to @ORGANIZATION1 for a very special event to see the president of the United States of @LOCATION1, @PERSON1. When we got to the park where we were going to see him, there were cars parked as far as a mile away! It was quite a sight. When we finally parked the car, we started walking. It was a long and tiring walk, but when we finally got to the gate, I was extremely excited! After we got through the strict security, we thought we would never get to our destination. Me and my parents stood in that line. I think we were there for about two hours until finally everybody spread out and took their places. Then we sang the national anthem, and the president stepped up to the podium and gave a long and inspiring speech. It was the longest line I ever stood in, and I was very patient throughout the whole experience. This event taught me the value of patience in waiting for something truly special.
183	18040	7	3	One day I was at a baseball game in @LOCATION1. The line at the entrance was huge; it stretched out for half a mile, and we were standing right at the end. The crowd in the line was buzzing with excitement. So it took us about an hour to slowly make our way up there. During that time, I had to be very, very patient because if I hadn't, my dad would've gone crazy. The people around us were chatting and shifting impatiently too. Finally, we got in. So that’s my story about patience, and it shows that patience is necessary in situations where we have to wait.
184	18041	7	3	There was only @NUM1 minutes of class left, and I had @CAPS1 to do. So I watched the clock tick down ever so slowly, my eyes fixed on the moving hands. @NUM1 minutes left, @NUM3 @NUM4 at @NUM5, the teacher, with a concerned look, asked, “what are you doing?” I said, “@CAPS1. I have @CAPS1 to do.” The teacher then suggested, “why don’t you put your head down?” I was losing my patience and was on the verge of snapping, but I held myself back. I took a deep breath and put my head down. Next thing I know, it's time to go. I kept my patience and didn’t get in trouble, which shows that self - control in frustrating situations can prevent unnecessary problems.
185	18042	7	3	Did you know that patience is one of the keys to happiness? For an example, I was walking along the street and @CAPS1 when this guy walked up to me. He started talking to me about his family. Just remember I wasn’t very patient at the time. @CAPS1 He kept going on and on, sharing every little detail, until I finally snapped and said, “do you know how to shut up?” Badly, he replied, “yes” @CAPS1 and then ran home, crying. @CAPS1 I went home feeling remorseful. When I got home, I felt sad for the guy, so I @CAPS1 and said “sorry”! And for some reason, he said, “got you.” I said, “what?” I was so mad at first, but I was happy when it was over. But that taught me a lesson though, always be patient because you don't know who's watching, literally. Patience can prevent us from making hasty and regrettable actions.
186	18043	7	3	I am always extremely patient with my family. My mom and @CAPS1 do a great deal for me, and I'm always patient if they take me somewhere. Sometimes, for hockey, my mom and @CAPS1 take me. Usually, my @CAPS1 takes me, but on @DATE1, my mom takes me, and I remain patient. When it comes to homework, I am always patient. If I want to go to @PERSON1ís golfland and my mom says she will take me, I'm always patient. In all these aspects of my life, I've learned that patience makes things go more smoothly.
187	18044	7	3	Patience. My cousin Romeo is the most patient person I have ever met. At @LOCATION1, he is studying to be a doctor, and he must go through eight long years of college. These eight years involve learning complex terminology, studying cells, and understanding human anatomy, so he has to be incredibly patient. My cousin goes to @ORGANIZATION1, which is quite close to where I live and where my aunt lives. Romeo comes home often and never complains about homework, school, or anything. He has the highest level of patience, trust me. He is the perfect role model. Romeo is on his fifth year of college, which means four years down and four to go. He doesn't have a specific way of dealing with stress, besides the fact that he squeezes his hands. It's not easy to stay motivated and relaxed, but he manages to do that. Before he left for @ORGANIZATION1, he told me that patience is half the process and half the reward. Romeo truly embodies patience, and I hope to learn from him.
188	18045	7	3	Here is a story, about patience, in my own way called @CAPS1ís @CAPS2 @CAPS3. “@CAPS4, hurry up and find my shoes! I don't want to be late for school again,” I hollered at my @CAPS4 “@CAPS1”. “@CAPS1,” @CAPS4 said in a hurried voice, “you asked me a second ago. It doesn't take a second to find some lost shoes; you just have to be patient.” “I know, I know,” I sighed, “but I still don't want to be late.” “I know, but remember, being patient will get you far.” “@CAPS6,” I agreed. So that @CAPS3 at school, @CAPS1 remembered her mom's words and was very patient throughout the whole @CAPS3. She didn't whine with her friends about the bus being so slow to get to school, she didn't cut her friends in the lunch line to get her food faster. At gym, when someone had the volleyball stuck in their shoe, she didn't grab it to avoid being bored; instead, she just stood there patiently. During the end of the @CAPS3, @LOCATION1's friends started acting like her too. Their teacher noticed how very patient they were when they raised their hand instead of blabbing out the answer. At the end of that class period, they all got some candy. The other students noticed and wondered how they could get candy. Then in @LOCATION1's next class, she could feel everyone's eyes on her, but she knew it was for a good reason. Everyone learned to raise their hands and not push when they left the classroom. Pretty soon, everyone started getting candy, and the teachers were so happy! When I got home that @CAPS3, I hugged my @CAPS4 so hard and then told her what happened at school. From that day on, I truly learned the value of being patient.
189	18046	7	3	The day I stood for some free @CAPS1 of lays chips. When I was at @ORGANIZATION1, they were giving out free @CAPS1 of chips. I was number @NUM1 in the line. The first time I got to the front, @CAPS3 @NUM2, my friend @NUM3. There was a giveaway day. We waited for a long time and finally got done with the @CAPS4 laye. I was really patient. I waited for @NUM4 hours and @NUM5 minutes. We chatted while waiting. We finally got one chip and then left. After that, we got into a game, but we were very tired. We were going to @LOCATION1, and it was the worst test of my patience I've ever experienced. But in the end, I'm glad I was patient and got that chip.
190	18047	7	3	@CAPS1 was a beautiful morning. The sky was a clear blue, the birds were cheerfully singing, and my sister was going skydiving. She and her boyfriend, Zone, were planning to go skydiving, so me, my friend, and my parents tagged along to watch. There were a couple of people in front of them, so we had to wait for about an hour. Then another hour passed, and they still weren't even close to their turn. We were starting to get hungry, so we went into town and ordered some breakfast. We got our drinks and were about to get our food when we got a call that they were going soon. We had to cancel our meal and hurry back to the place. When we got there, it still wasn't their turn. I don't really know how, but something happened, and we had to sit and wait in the middle of the field for almost four more hours! Finally, it was their turn. They got in the plane and flew up. They circled the field for a while, and then @CAPS1 looked like a little dot fell out of the plane, and then another followed. They landed successfully. It turns out that we sat there for eight hours before they jumped, not including the hour and a half drive there. I think that I was pretty patient that day, and it was all worth it to see my sister have an amazing experience.
191	18048	7	3	"One time I was patient when @PERSON1's @CAPS1, perhaps a device like a projector, would not work. Every body sat down and was quiet. It took up the whole hour. There was a little chit - chat here and there, but mostly every body was quiet for her while a capable student helped her. We were going to watch a movie about @NUM1 themes of @CAPS2, but when she tried to play the movie, it would not come on. You could hear the audio but couldn't see the picture. Then, at the end of the hour, you could see it but you couldn't hear it. ""But it worked for all the other classes,"" @PERSON1 said. The next day she gave us fruit snacks for being so patient and she got the movie to work. First it was in just gray and white, then she jiggled a card and then it showed color. But the day that I was patient was the @NUM2 time. I was patient with a teacher. She was proud of me and I was proud of myself. I can't believe what I did for @PERSON1. Then it happened again. This time she let every body just chill in our chairs and talk with our friends, but I just watched her fix her @CAPS1. But the next day she didn't give us a treat because our treat was just chilling in our chairs and talking with our friends. That was a time when my classmates and I were patient."
192	18049	7	3	When I was patient, we had to wait in a long line for a @CAPS1 roller - coaster. I was scared, and some kids in line were impatient and wanted to get on the @CAPS2 ride fast. I was patient and waited until we got on. I was very scared when I was on it. The coaster went up high and then dropped suddenly, making my heart race. When I got off, I had a big smile on my face. I was glad I was patient because I experienced the fun of the ride.
193	18050	7	3	"You being patient is important. People should always be patient and not rush anything. All you have to do is take your time and wait. People need to understand that if you are not patient, then particular things won't happen to you. If you ever wanted something, then you have to be patient. One day at @ORGANIZATION1, my cousin, Shayna was not being patient because she wanted to get on the dance box. But, she couldn't because a little girl named @ORGANIZATION2 was on the dance box, and Shayna was not happy. And you know us girls when we get our attitudes. Shayna got mad and started to cry and roll her eyes at @ORGANIZATION2. Then she walked up to me and said, ""She won't let me get on."" I said, ""@PERSON1`@CAPS2, you have to be patient and wait your turn because she was on it first, and that would be rude and unfair to make her get off."" @PERSON1`@CAPS2 apologized and they both took turns on the dance box. But last, @PERSON1`@CAPS2 was happy and she learned her lesson. Patience truly makes social interactions more harmonious."
194	18051	7	3	A time when I was patient was when my mom broke her hip. When my mom broke her hip, she moved slower than my grandpa. You are probably asking yourself how does this make me patient. Well, I had to follow her everywhere she went. If I wasn't patient, I think my mother would be in worse condition than what she was in. I mean, it took her almost fifteen minutes to walk to her bedroom. Normally I'm not a patient person at all, but when this happened I had to be patient. I'm glad @DATE1 that I was patient because now I am more patient than I was before. My mom is proud of my behavior because I actually grew up for a few days to help her out when she needed me. Being patient is a good thing. You look at life differently. Now I can imagine myself being patient more often. I mean I'm not glad my mom got hurt, but I'm glad of the consequence of the problem. After the big accident happened, I have learned that everyone needs a little bit of patience, like me. That is one example about how I learned to be patient, all because of my mom.
195	18052	7	3	“Left! Right! High kick left, roundhouse right! The boy's arms are moving so fast you can barely see them. His legs are striking the punching bag with tremendous power! “@CAPS1!”, the old man yells, “my boy.” @CAPS2 says, “you are lacking patience.” The old man named @ORGANIZATION1 puts a blindfold on the boy named @CAPS3 and lets sand - filled jute bags be thrown at him. The first one hits him in the head, but the boy quickly reacts and kicks the second one, busting it open. @CAPS2 grabs the third one and uses it to block the fourth one. The boy learned to be patient and wait for the enemy to strike first. This new - found patience will surely serve him well in future battles.
196	18053	7	3	I know a girl, she’s my friend, and her name is @PERSON1. @PERSON1 is a very good person. She diligently eats all her veggies, promptly does all her homework, and consistently has straight A’s. @PERSON1 only has one problem. She is not patient. One day @PERSON1 and I went to the movie theater. We went on a Saturday night, so it was quite busy. There was a long line to buy the tickets. @PERSON1 looked at me and groaned loudly. I told her, “Be patient @PERSON1, it will only take like ten minutes.” @PERSON1 groaned again and crossed her arms impatiently. “Get over it you potato sack,” I told her. After about two minutes we were only five people behind the ticket counter. @PERSON1 was pacing around restlessly like she was in the worst - case scenario. She started pulling her hair as I stared blankly at her. She ran to me and said, “@PERSON2, we gotta get to that counter before I explode!” I looked at her with my, why don’t you just shut - up, eyes. Then she nodded. I stayed patient with @PERSON1 throughout the night making sure she didn’t go crazy. I made sure that I kept my cool so I could make sure we didn’t get kicked out. You should always be patient or things might turn out bad.
197	18054	7	3	Today I am talking about patience. Patience means to take something easy or to handle something with calmness. Like for example, I went to an ATM machine and I wanted to get money. So, I put the card and the pen in the appropriate slots, then I wanted $20. But it gave me only the receipt, no cash and no cards. I didn't break it; I just called the company and I got the money and the card back. Now, this is the main story. I went to the mall to get a shoe. It was one hundred and ten dollars originally, and it was on sale for one hundred dollars. When I wanted to buy it, the cashier man said, “One hundred and ten dollars please.” Then I told him, “It was on sale.” He said, “Get out of my store.” Then I told him I came to buy a shoe. Then I returned the shoe and went out. That's a time when I was patient. Patience is important as it helps us handle difficult situations better.
198	18055	7	3	A time I was patient was when I went to @ORGANIZATION1 of @LOCATION1 with my grandma, grandpa @PERSON1, and my brother @ORGANIZATION2. We were all just casually walking around and we saw a guy drawing cartoon pictures of people. I said, “Grandma, can’t we do that please?” She said, “Yes.” My brother got to go first. I was just quietly waiting for his turn to be done. Then his picture was done, we looked at it and we all laughed heartily. I was next. I sat on the seat and the sun was right on me. I got very hot and I really didn't just want to sit there, but I was patient. I didn't say a word, just sat there and smiled. A picture that took about 15 minutes to draw felt like a half - hour. Then I was done. I looked at the picture, laughed and smiled. I liked it. I was patient and I got what I wanted. Being patient at @ORGANIZATION1 taught me that waiting can lead to good things.
199	18056	7	3	I generally don't have the privilege of patience, but I made an exception, though. My brother, @PERSON1, ran out to the car, running from the pouring rain that set a gloomy mood that day. He opened the car door, and the first thing out of his mouth was, “We need to talk.” My mom responded, “About what at 5?” I knew my mom didn't want to talk about what happened to @PERSON1, especially since he got an in - school suspension, around me. If my brother hadn't cared about me hearing, I don't think I would've put up a fight. This was not the time. @PERSON1 started to divulge into his story, causing tension in the air. “Today, some guys who I realized aren't really very friendly poured water purposely on my sweatshirt. So, I went to tell the principal, at school.” “Good. That's what you're supposed to do,” my dad interrupted. “Well, the person, who did it, @PERSON2, got in trouble and went into timeout. When he came out, he started to follow me, and I felt threatened.” I held my breath, looking straight ahead of me. Tension was what I was breathing, not air. My mom filled in the next part, “So you started punching him?” “Yes,” he admitted miserably. “@PERSON1, you need to find constructive ways to release your anger. There are going to be a lot of jerks out there. You can't start punching them,” my dad scolded. “I know, I know now. I'm sorry,” my brother stuttered in his very annoying fashion. I timidly asked @PERSON1, “Would you like a hot dog when we get home?” “No” I bit back any rude response to the mean tone he was using. I understood that he had a bad day. Then, I realized that being patient and understanding with my brother was the best thing I could do. I think I gained a little more patience that day, which will help me in future difficult situations.
200	18057	7	3	The place I was patient was at my mom’s doctor appointment. It was a little healthcare place at @LOCATION1 road and it was quite small. I had to wait out at the lobby and it was extremely boring at first. I first started watching channel 5 news and it got interesting. Then I went to the front counter, got a blue pen and a blank piece of paper and then began drawing. When I finished drawing, it looked like a car that looked as if it was a fancy car. And then I began looking for something else to do. I kept looking and then there was a car magazine. There were cool cars like low - riders, exotics, and custom - made ones. When my mom was done, I was patient and then we left home. Patience in such waiting situations makes the time pass more smoothly and helps us avoid unnecessary stress.
201	18058	7	3	One time I was patient was when I was standing in a long line at the petting zoo on a sweltering @DATE1 day. The sun was blazing around three in the afternoon. The animal I was waiting in line to see was a cute, shaggy donkey. Of course, the donkey was the crowds' favorite animal. There were only a couple of people casually observing the other animals. In the donkey line, there were hundreds of eager onlookers. I was around the middle of the long line. I was getting increasingly tired, but I was determined to see this donkey! I was being very patient, waiting and waiting and waiting. Finally, only a couple of people were in front of me! I could get a slight view of the donkey's ears twitching. A couple of minutes passed, and then I was petting the donkey. @CAPS1 was that patience worth it or what? I thought to myself. I left the petting zoo, beaming with happiness. I had never been that patient in my life! I gave myself a pat on the back, proud of my self - control.
202	18060	7	3	"One time I was in the doctors' office, and there was a huge crowd of people there. I had just arrived, and my dad was looking around and telling me we should go because there were so many people waiting. But I said, ""Let's be punctual and wait."" So, he agreed. Person after person was called in, and my dad showed great patience. It was @NUM1 hours until they finally called our name. We went in, and I got my five vaccinations and vaccine shots. It was a bit painful, but it was over quickly. Then we left the office and went home. We sat down to eat dinner. We had a delicious taco salad for dinner, and it was a great way to end the day."
203	18061	7	3	I'm really not a patient person, but one day last year at the end of the school year, my older sister @PERSON2 was having a baby. I was extremely excited because that was going to be my first nephew. So, I went to the hospital, and so did my grandma, mom, my other sister, my # @CAPS1, and my sister @CAPS2, the one who was having the baby, and her boyfriend. There were lots of people there, and not all of us could go in the delivery room at the same time. I was too young to see the baby being born, and I really didn't want to anyway. My sister got mad because she also couldn't go in there, so she huffed off and left, but I stayed. It was incredibly boring just sitting around, but I stayed put. I went into the waiting room to pass the time. It took @NUM1 hours for the baby to be born. We went to the hospital at nine o'clock. The baby was born around @NUM2. I went home to sleep at @NUM3 and went back there at @NUM2:00. We saw the baby at @NUM5. His name was @CAPS3. He is so cute, with tiny fingers and a button nose. I'm so glad to be his @CAPS4. Right now, he is six months old, and I love it when I see him. And when he is older, he will know that I was there the whole time, patiently waiting for him to be born. Love @PERSON1.
204	18062	7	3	"A time where someone I know was impatient was in my science class during a lab project. It was actually, to me, a very comical way of showing impatience. My classmates and I were divided into groups and stationed at different areas of the lab. We were doing a project on plant classification, carefully identifying the different characteristics of various plants. So, everyone was in a rush to quickly finish up their projects by taping their plants on their posters. After a bit of a scuffle where our group fought for the tape from another group that was hogging it, we finally got hold of the tape. Our group was just about done. Then, two people from another group came over to get some tape. One of them started fumbling around trying to take some pieces, and I guess to the other one, he was taking an eternity. So, the one waiting, in a fit of impatience, loudly said, "" @CAPS1 @CAPS2!"" It was so hilarious that the whole class burst into laughter."
205	18064	7	3	When I was patient, I was @NUM1 yrs old when I ordered an item online. I was really looking forward to it. @NUM2 days went by, and there was still no sign of my package. A week went by, and one day, a UPS truck stopped at our house. It dropped off a package and drove away. I was so overjoyed that I didn't even notice that the package was addressed to my mom. I eagerly opened it, only to find pampered chef stuff inside. I was really angry and disappointed! @NUM3 weeks went by, and still, nothing. I was so upset that I didn't really know what to do about it. But then, another UPS truck came. I didn't even see it at first. And guess what? In the package was my long - awaited item! I didn't even realize it until @DATE1. I was so happy that I got it that I completely forgot to order a game to go with it. And that was the time I was patient. See ya.
206	18065	7	3	Being patient means waiting. One time, when one of my brothers needed patience, we spent six long hours just to bail him out. We had to visit four different prisons to finally get him out. I was really scared during that time, but I knew that if I remained patient, everything would turn out well. We had to bail him out before @NUM1 o'clock. We had been there since @NUM2 in the @TIME1. My mom was extremely nervous. I told her many times to calm down and that everything was going to be alright. So, he and my cousin went inside, and we asked if we could bail my brother out. They told us they weren't bailing anyone out at that time and that it might be around @NUM3. So, we went to grab something to eat. When we went back again, they told us we had to sign a paper, and we did. Then it was @NUM4 o'clock. They gave us something that we had to cash. We went to @NUM1 different stores, but they all said we couldn't cash it there. So, we went to the Chase Bank, and we were able to cash it. Finally, we took out my brother, and our long - awaited mission was accomplished.
207	18066	7	3	One day, a really cool new game came out. There was a kid who was aware of volumes @NUM1, @NUM2, @NUM3, and @DATE1, but they said this particular one was the hottest volume. The kid eagerly asked his mom for @PERCENT1. His mom, @CAPS2, said “what for?” The kid, @CAPS1, replied “so I can buy this cool new game.” @CAPS2 said “@CAPS3, your father and I have to pay bills and buy food.” @CAPS1 said “@CAPS4, I understand,” in a very disappointed voice. Later, when the boy's hard - working father walked through the door, the boy said “@CAPS5, could I please get @NUM4, so I can buy this game?” The father said “@CAPS6, I know how much you want this game, but I'm sorry I need to help your mother pay bills.” The boy, @CAPS6, said “@CAPS4, I understand.” Then, the boy's grandmother called and said “I need someone to cut my lawn for @NUM5.” The boy grinned widely and said “I'll be right over there.” @CAPS1 mowed the lawn with great excitement. When @CAPS1 got the @NUM5, @CAPS1 immediately went to the game store. When @CAPS1 arrived, the line was @DATE1 blocks long. His grandmother said “well, you gotta have patience.” Finally, as the boy was next in the line, he was just about to fulfill his long - awaited wish of buying the game.
208	18067	7	3	One day, we went to the mall. It was me, Sharae, and Reynal. Me and @PERSON1 wanted to go to @CAPS1 @CAPS2, but Sharae wanted to go to Pac Sun. So, we were patient and let her go to that store. Then, me and Reynal wanted to go to @CAPS3, but Sharae wanted to go to @CAPS4. Again, we were patient and let her have her way. Then, me and Reynal wanted to go to @CAPS11, but Sharae wanted to go to @ORGANIZATION1. Finally, at @CAPS5, we said “ENOUGH! WE WANT TO GO TO @CAPS11!!!” She pleaded, saying “ok, ok, ok, but can I just...” “No. Please, no, please. NO!” We firmly replied. She then said “Alright, we'll go to @CAPS11. I was just gonna ask to go to the bathroom.” And with that, we finally headed towards the place we wanted to go.
209	18068	7	3	Patience is a very helpful trait to get you through life. Being patient means waiting calmly or being content. A patient is a person usually waiting to see a doctor. There are many types related to the word “patient,” like “patient,” “a patient,” or “patience.” I'm going to talk about two kinds, probably not the two you would think. I am going to discuss a patient and being patient. Although there is no pun intended, I feel that they both remind me of a story. One cold, dreary morning, I had to take a trip. It wasn't a field trip nor a vacation; it was a trip to the doctor's office. I needed to go there to get my yearly vaccine. The morning probably wasn't really cold; I was just extremely nervous. When we finally arrived at the doctor's office (which seemed like it was even farther away than I thought), the office man called me and my dad up to the front window. My dad said “I have an appointment for my son.” The lady at the front window asked “the @NUM1 appointment?” “@CAPS1, that's the one,” said my dad. She then said “Your son looks to be scheduled for a tetanus vaccine” and @CAPS2 told us to have a seat. I waited patiently, engrossed in reading my book. After a while, I started to feel restless. I was quite bored and found myself fidgeting with my fingers in my pockets. My dad, who likes making funny statements, told me “you know what? You're a patient patient!” I laughed. But my laughing was cut short when the doctor opened the door. Before I knew it, I was getting a needle in my arm. After that, I was all good. What I learned was that being a patient patient helped me stay calm while getting my vaccine. If I wasn't so patient, it might have hurt a lot more. I learned an important lesson that day about the power of patience.
210	18070	7	3	This story is about Chicken Hound, the fox, and a time when he had to be patient. Let me set the scene. The scourge sent Chicken Hound and his mother, @PERSON1, to be boiled. They were both supposed to be killed and thrown in the ditch. But Chicken Hound only blacked out. When he woke up, he quickly realized his dire situation. He knew that he would have to wait until it was dark to reach the @CAPS1 wall. As he waited, annoying insects swarmed all over him, but he endured it. Finally, when the cover of night arrived, he rolled in the mud to prevent any further blood loss. Then, he began his long and arduous journey. That was the moment when Chicken Hound truly had to show his patience, and his patient wait was the first step towards his possible escape.
211	18071	7	3	I have used patience many times. I use my patience when dealing with @ORGANIZATION1 on the bus, while relaxing at home, and during various activities at school. The first time I used patience was when I was fishing. At that time, I had my tweety @CAPS1 fishing rod in one hand and a bag of salt and vinegar chips in the other. As I was patiently waiting for a fish, I met my friend Bubbles, a Norwegian goose that was maybe a week old. When I met him, I fed him some of my bait. I guessed he liked worms, so I gave him all my bait and put down my fishing pole. And as soon as I grabbed my chips, I had a bite! It turned out to be a very small sunfish. But still, to this day, I see Bubbles once a year (he lives near my favorite fishing spot). And this year he had some sidekicks, two ducks. I named them @CAPS2 and @PERSON1. They are very friendly and love Skittles. @CAPS2 is kind of shy around other ducks, and @PERSON1 is very content just sitting next to me or on a bench. And Bubbles loves cheeses and cuddling with his duck buddies and with me in the calm @DATE1 grass. And this story is true. The experience truly shows the value of patience.
212	18072	7	3	My family and I were going to @LOCATION1 for @DATE1 break one year. I was really excited to get there, but we had to take two long flights until we finally arrived. My family and I got up super early to drive to the airport. It was about @NUM1 hours of a long - drive until we got there. Then we checked our bags, went through security, and went to go and find our plane. Then we found out our plane had gotten delayed. We sat in the airport for a few hours, trying to pass the time by reading magazines and having light conversations, until the plane came. Then we got off that plane and went to go find the next one. That plane was delayed too! So we had to wait a few hours again, this time feeling a bit more frustrated, until the plane came. Then we had to sit through another plane ride until we finally got to @LOCATION1. This trip took a lot of patience because I was so anxious to get there. In the end, I realized that patience is essential when dealing with unforeseen travel disruptions.
213	18073	7	3	Write in your own say about patience. @PERSON2 and his mom are on their way to @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3. @PERSON2 has been waiting his whole life to go there. Bill’s mom gets a call from cousins, @PERSON3, Bob, and @PERSON1. His cousins ask can they go? @PERSON2’s mom says sure. @PERSON2 is a patient boy, so he just lets it go, even though he was a bit disappointed that his long - awaited solo trip with mom was changing. Still patient. Once @PERSON2’s mom gets his cousins, his mom gets another call from his five friends. They all ask the same question his cousins asked. His mom says yes. They each live in a different place far apart, so it will take twenty minutes to get to each house. During these pick - ups, @PERSON2 sits quietly in the backseat, trying to stay positive. Finally, they are all in the car. @PERSON2 is so mad but is still patient. When his mom gets another call, @PERSON2 says, “Who is it now!?!”. It’s his dad calling to say, “I’m at the @CAPS3 with @PERSON2’s brother and sister, where are you?” @PERSON2’s mom responded, “I’m pulling in now.” This story clearly shows @PERSON2's remarkable patience in a challenging situation.
214	18074	7	3	Hi my name is @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and I am in school doing the meat testing rite now as we speak. Well! What do you want to talk about? Well, let's talk about when I had to be very, very patient. I was going to see Eclipse, the Twilight Saga. We got tickets early, about a month early. So I had to be very, very patient. So I wait and wait, and @NUM1 days have gone by so slowly. I start to think what if I stop thinking about it, it might come faster. Well, I ask if I could go to a friend's house, and she was going to see the movie too. So the month went by, and it came the night @CAPS6. I get to go and see the movie, and my friend calls me. She said she can't sleep; she's so excited. I stayed up all night thinking and thinking about what was going to happen in the movie. Well, not knowing what was going to happen drove me crazy. Not knowing what was going to happen well, I finally fell asleep. And guess what, I wake up and @NUM2 more hours, and I will be getting ready to watch Eclipse. And the time went by, and I was ready to go as soon as I woke up. Well, it finally came. We were on our way to see it. We got there and we sat down in our seats and watched. The movie was great, but it was hard to be patient. That’s the time I had to be patient, and it taught me that patience can make the anticipation even more rewarding.
215	18075	7	3	@PERSON2 and her twin brother, @PERSON1, waited excitingly in line for a concert. @PERSON1 hated going places with his sister; she was @CAPS6 weird. “@CAPS1,” @CAPS2 whined. “@CAPS3,” @PERSON1 asked, taking an earbud out of her ear. “@CAPS4 did I have to come?” @CAPS2 asked impatiently. “@CAPS6 you could learn how to be patient, smart one,” @PERSON2 said, looking to see how many people were in line now. @PERSON2 put her earbud back in her ear and blasted ‘@CAPS7 @CAPS8 The @CAPS9 Of @CAPS10 @CAPS11’ by Allstar Weekend. Allstar Weekend, the awesome band they would see in concert. @PERSON2 had always been the patient twin; in fact, that’s what everyone called her. @CAPS2 was the complete opposite of her, the impatient twin. @PERSON2 almost enjoyed waiting; it made her more excited for things. When the time finally came to see the concert, @PERSON2 was glad she was patient. She was ten times more excited than anyone else there. This experience further proved that patience can enhance the joy of the moment.
216	18076	7	3	There was a time when I was extremely patient, and I was waiting for a long time for my cousin, @PERSON1. We were walking around town, and we were looking for some silly bans. First, we went to the @DATE1 store. But when we got there, they were closed. So, we started walking again. Then, we saw my brother and my other cousin @CAPS1. They were on bikes, and we were walking. Then @CAPS1 said there's a @PERSON2 store down there, so we walked down there. Then @CAPS1 and my brother told us to get on the bike, and they walked. So, we went to @ORGANIZATION1 and checked how much they cost. They cost @MONEY1, and some of them cost @MONEY2. So, we went to @PERSON2 tree, and there was a @MONEY3, but we didn't get them because @PERSON1 didn't like the ones they had. So, we went all over the place. When we found them, she didn't want them. So, we went to my grandma's house, and she asked me where we were all day. I said we were out looking for some dumb silly bans. And my grandma said don't go where @PERSON1 wants to go. If your mama tells you to come over here, come over here. And I was trying to be patient by not trying to yell at @LOCATION1. In the end, even though we didn't find what we wanted, I'm glad I was patient through the whole process.
217	18077	7	3	Time my friend was really patient! One day, it was @DATE1@NUM1, and that day was when report cards came out. My grades were quite good; I had @NUM2. But my friend @PERSON1 was failing maths. She had an @CAPS1, and she knew if her mom saw it, she would get in trouble. @PERSON1 tried to cross it out and put a good grade, but she knew her mom would find out. So, she told her mom “report cards didn't come out yet”. And her mom believed her. So then, she tried re - printing it. She called me and tried to get my opinion. I told her my honest thought and said @CAPS2. But I also said “if you don't wanna get in trouble, then yeah”. And she said... When her mom asked her “did the report cards come out?”, she said “yeah”. Then her mom found out it wasn't a real report card. So, her mom called the teachers, and it was a fake grade. Then she got in trouble, but she was patient about it and she told the truth. Her mom went to the office and got the real grades. My friend @PERSON1 was patient while she told the truth. That's a time when my friend @PERSON1 was patient about her grades. Even though she lied and tried to change her grade, she still was honest and patient about it. I know that it was wrong for me to tell her yeah, but she begged me so she wouldn't get in trouble. In the end, I hope she learned that being honest from the start is the best way.
218	18078	7	3	Have you ever been patient? I have, and I have to say it was truly rewarding. I was sitting in the waiting room at the @ORGANIZATION1’s @CAPS1 @CAPS2. I had planned to get my @CAPS1 washed, deep - conditioned, and flat - ironed. The lady at the front desk called me up. “I'm sorry, but @PERSON1 won't be here today. Is there anyone else that you'd like to do your @CAPS1?” A perplexed expression spread across my face. “Is she the only one here?” I asked. “Yes, but she has a client right now. She can take you tomorrow at three o'clock,” she suggested. “That's fine,” I said. My feelings were kind of upset at first, but that all changed when I walked outside. It was pouring rain. So, I guess it was a good thing that I didn't get my @CAPS1 done. It was a great thing that I was patient. Being patient has its clear advantages, and this experience just proved it.
219	18079	7	3	A time when I was patient was at @CAPS1, the largest indoor water park. I was eagerly waiting to go on the turbo twin racers. “@CAPS2 time @NUM1” our @CAPS3 said in a robotic voice, but it was only @NUM2. That means I had to be in the car for another two hours, almost three. That's not fair, I thought to myself, but I knew if I wanted to make it to @CAPS1, I had to be patient and wait it out. “I have to go to the bathroom,” I said in a moaning voice. “Well, can't you hold it?” my mother asked. I'm about to explode, and you're asking me if I can hold it? I thought to myself. “Ok, pull over here, but it's gonna add to our @CAPS2 time,” she said. “I @CAPS4 it core!” I yelled back to my mom as I was running out of the car door. When I got back in the car, I heard our robotic @CAPS3 say “@CAPS2 time @NUM3”. Oh man, that means no more bathroom breaks. I'm gonna have to hold it if I have to go again. An hour or two went by when I heard the @CAPS3 say “arrive at destination on left”. “@CAPS8!” I screeched out. I rushed out the door to the main entrance to @CAPS1, but then I saw a sign that said “water park closed!” When suddenly, I felt my dad's hand hit my shoulder, and he said “sorry sport, maybe it will be open tomorrow”. Unfortunately, it wasn't open the next day. It was still closed because they were working on too many rides, and it was dangerous to go into the park. So, I had to be patient for that whole day, but I couldn't as we were leaving tomorrow! The next day, it was closed again until five, but we were expected to check out at @TIME1. So, at @TIME1, the park was still closed, and we were checked out. “I guess we can stay for the rest of the day. I'll go arrange to stay one more night,” my dad said. “@CAPS8. I get to go in the park!” And that was the time I was patient, and it finally paid off.
220	18080	7	3	I think patience means when you're calm and you don't care what somebody is doing. An example of patience is when your mom is shopping for a long time, and you want to go to the video game store, but you stay there. That's a good sign of patience. A bad sign of patience is when you throw a fit in the store. Another good sign of patience is when you're at an amusement park, and there's a really long line, and you don't complain. That's a very good sign of patience. A bad sign of patience in that situation is that you complain the whole time. Also, a good sign of patience is when you are waiting for your big sister to get out of the bathroom, and you just wait until she gets out. A bad sign of patience is when you break down the door and you have to pay for the damages. A good sign of patience is when you're locked out and you go to your friend's house and wait calmly. In conclusion, patience is an important quality, and we should always strive to show good signs of it in different situations.
221	18081	7	3	I was patient when I saw a huge bass jump out from the water near my cottage. I calmly waited, ate a simple breakfast of cereal and toast, and then prepared to go fishing. My little brother, full of excitement, also wanted to go fishing. So, I patiently waited for him to carefully get a new bait, tie it securely to his fishing line, and then come out. Once we got out front, he quickly caught a small bass. I gently unhooked it and brought him over to show mom and dad what he had caught. Little did I realize that a huge @NUM1 - pound bass was lurking around out there. As soon as I cast my line for the first time, @CAPS1! A huge bass took my bait. At first, I thought I had caught a carp because of the strong tug. But when I saw that @NUM1 - pound bass jump with my bait in its mouth, I was shaking with excitement! When I showed that fish to my dad, he almost fainted, and the same reaction came from me, my mom, and my little brother Cody. And right now, that magnificent fish is at the taxidermy, preserved for us to always remember this amazing moment.
222	18082	7	3	One day on my way to school, I stopped by to pick up my friend. He was extremely excited and told me that he had this new game called Call of Duty: World at War. He just kept on talking non - stop about it, describing what he could do online in the game. Then, during the last class of the day, he sat beside me and said, “I can't wait to go home and play my new game.” I simply replied, “Cool.” Then he started complaining, “But I have to wait one more hour.” I told him, “Just be patient and wait.” He then said, “You're right. It's not like it's going anywhere. I can play it anytime.” After that, he invited me, “Wanna come over and play?” So, we both went to his house and played the game. I told him, “Remember to always be patient till the time is here. Patience makes the experience even better.”
223	18083	7	3	The one time I was patient was when I was waiting for the new game Kill Zone @NUM1. I had to carefully come up with @NUM2 bucks. @NUM3 was for the game itself and @NUM4 was to put it on hold for me at the store. As soon as the store had it on the shelves, I was there. The manager was carefully placing the games out, so I quickly grabbed one and bought it. I rushed home, plugged in my PS4, and started playing online. I now have @NUM1,190 points. Merged all together, the game is really hard. On the first day, there were store managers around, one even in the back. I do not suggest the game for all those who are under @NUM6 because of its high difficulty level.
224	18084	7	3	One day my family and I were going to @PERSON1 to see Jimmy, because he was out on a job in @LOCATION2 fixing a belt line. After my brother and I got home from school, we immediately left to go to @LOCATION2. As we were traveling, we saw a lot of interesting things like the city of @LOCATION4 with all its tall and modern buildings. Then we saw a sign that said “You are now leaving @LOCATION3” and another sign that said “You are now entering @LOCATION1”. That's when it happened - the traffic jam. We were going through @LOCATION5 at @NUM1 mph. How unwise was that? Not very. But the worst part was the waiting. It lasted for hours. We just sat there in the car, but we found ways to amuse ourselves. We watched the seagulls flying around, the waves crashing on the shore, and looked at the beautiful buildings there. That's my example of patience, waiting through that long traffic jam to reach our destination to see Jimmy.
225	18086	7	3	The time when I was patient was at the doctor's appointment. I was standing there in the waiting room, calm and quiet, looking around at the pictures on the wall. When the doctor called my name, I wasn't nervous at all. So, when the doctor gave me @NUM1, which @CAPS1 didn't have at that time, I took it with a smile. Then, me and my mom went home happily. We stopped by a local deli and got some sandwiches and then watched @CAPS2 on TV. After that, we had some delicious spaghetti for dinner and went to bed early because I had school the next day. Then, I had a good day in school in the @NUM2 grade when I was in land. When I went home, I did my homework, cleaned up my room in the house, watched @CAPS2 again, ate dinner, and then went to bed early for an early start the next day. It was a simple yet fulfilling day that showed my patience at the doctor's and my responsible routine after that.
226	18087	7	3	"A time when I had to be patient was on my birthday. About a week before my birthday, me and my dad carefully ordered me an @CAPS1 girl doll. I was super excited because it was my very first doll. I kept imagining how I'd play with it and show it off to my friends. The shipping was a problem, though. During the week of my birthday, I constantly kept waiting for the @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS2 truck to come. I was really disappointed because it was shipped from @LOCATION1 and it shouldn't take that long to get here. Another week passed and it still wasn't here. I had to be extra patient. I could track it online, but seeing the slow progress still didn't make me happy. The reason why it took so long to get here was because when it was already here, they kept it in the post office. Then finally my mom went ahead to ask when they're going to send it and the lady said, ""it's on the way."" A couple minutes later, the doorbell rang. When I opened the box and saw the doll, I screamed with joy. It was truly worth the wait."
227	18088	7	3	Patience? What can I say? Personally, I don't have any of it. I like things to go quickly and smoothly. I also really don't like it when people do things slowly, as it makes me feel restless and impatient. In general, lacking patience can sometimes cause me a bit of stress, but I know I should work on it.
228	18089	7	3	"Patience is not a natural thing; it's something you have to learn. Taking a three - hour car ride is a perfect example of patience, exactly like what I experienced. As we started packing our suitcases for @CAPS1 city, I couldn't contain myself. I was already fully packed up, but mom and dad were still standing around. ""Please, can you finish packing? See, I really want to go!"" I exclaimed. ""You'll just have to wait a minute,"" they said. But I couldn't wait, so I grabbed some of their things, threw them in the trunk of our car, and walked to our kitchen to finish reading a book while they packed. After they finished packing, dad was carrying the last of the bags from their bedroom. As he was about to complain, he noticed me, sitting patiently at the table. He thanked me, saying ""Thanks for being so patient, and just for that, mom and I have a surprise for you."" He set down the suitcases and briskly walked over to a white plastic bag. He suddenly pulled out a rectangular favor. It was something like the one in the @CAPS6 @CAPS7. ""Thank you so much, man,"" I replied. This just goes to show that patience really pays off, only if you don't complain, of course!"
229	18090	7	3	"The time I was patient was when I was @NUM1 years old. On that day, when I was @NUM1 years old, my mom said I had to go to the dentist on @DATE2. It was @DATE1, and I was still sleepy. My mom woke me up, and I said, ""Yes, I'm going to sleep."" She said, ""Wake up, it's time for you to go to the dentist."" I popped up in bed and started screaming. She was like, ""Be quiet because other people in this house are trying to go to sleep."" I said, ""Ok, mom."" She was like, ""Go grab you some clothes."" I said, ""ok."" So when we had both put on some clothes, I was just chatting away. I was like, ""I'm going to the dentist to get some stickers."" I just kept repeating that. When she pulled up in the parking lot, I stopped talking and said, ""We're here."" Then she parked the car. I opened the door, and then my mom signed us in. Then we sat down. There were a lot of people there. So when we sat down, @NUM3 mins later they called us. I was about to yell, but then they came. The dentist lady took me to the room and told me to lift my head up so she could put the thing on. Then the male doctor came in. He was like, ""We are about to clean your teeth."" I was crying because I thought it was gonna hurt. I was crying and saying it was gonna hurt. They put the thing on my teeth and said, ""See, it doesn't hurt."" Then they were done @NUM4 mins later. The female lady dentist was like, ""You can pick @NUM5 stickers."" I was so happy because I finally got some stickers. So when we left, we got in the car and then I went to sleep. That was the day I was patient."
230	18091	7	3	One day I had to be patient. It all started when I raked some leaves in the yard, working hard under the sun. I was going to get paid for my work. Well, I was supposed to get the money on the day @CAPS1. I wanted it that very second because I had plans to buy something I'd been wanting for a long time. But I had to be patient. I kept thinking about the money and what I'd buy, but I knew I had to wait. Finally, when I got the payment, I was really glad I'd been patient. It taught me that sometimes waiting is necessary.
231	18092	7	3	One of my stories of being patient is this one time I was at my uncle's house and I wanted to play the toy. Well, there were like five other kids too. I politely asked him if I could play and he said I had to be patient. So I quietly sat there and waited. It felt like at least an hour or two as I didn't say a word about it the whole time. Then, finally, I got to play. That's my story about being patient, showing that patience can lead to getting what you want.
232	18093	7	3	I was with @PERSON1 when I was about to have an allergy test. I sat and waited for @NUM1 hours. I had played my @CAPS1 @CAPS2 for an hour. Then I watched TV that I had put on before. I got so restless that I started to pace. My parents had to stop me from leaving @NUM2 times. I almost left the floor the sixth time. Then it came time for me to go down to the allergy room. It was a bit of a fight because I wanted to walk and they said no, but they won. After the allergy test, I had to lay flat for @NUM2 hours. Then I finally got to go home, relieved that the long wait was over.
233	18094	7	3	@NUM1 years ago, our immigration limit had run out. We needed green cards to become @CAPS1 @CAPS2. So, in a state of desperation, we went to an immigration center. We walked up to the front desk and told the lady we were there. She told us to go sit in the waiting area. There were about @NUM2 people there! At that point, I knew we were going to be there for a while. We went to the waiting area. I had no way of amusing myself as it strictly said at the front that no gaming devices, no musical devices were allowed, and all phones must be switched off. It was torture. After about an hour and a half, they called our name. I was so pleased. After we got our fingerprints and everything completed and we walked out to the car, my mom said she was very pleased with the way I behaved in that office, which made me feel proud.
234	18095	7	3	"I remember a time when I was patient. I used to be able to wait for anything. One time, I asked my mom for a game and she said, ""Tomorrow."" To my surprise, she got the game the very day I asked her. At one time, I thought I was the most patient person in my whole family. I am so patient that I can wait a month just before I go to Cedar Point. You have to be born with patience. Some of my friends are patient but they can't wait as long as I can. Some of them even ask me to teach them how to be patient. I say the same thing to them as I say to everybody who asks me about being patient: You have to be born with patience. It's not something you learn over the years. I could wait three weeks without getting paid from my dad. As some people get older, they grow less patient. That doesn't work on everybody. But sometime soon, I know my patience might be like everyone else's when I get older. Who knows, maybe somebody might be more patient than me in the world, but for now, I'll cherish my patient nature."
235	18096	7	3	I have used patience a lot of times but I think the most patience I've had was hunting. You just have to sit there, not talk and stay still. I was hunting out behind my house with my uncle @PERSON1. We got out there at six - o'clock am and then waited there until nine o'clock at night. The deer finally started to come in and one deer got close enough for me to shoot. I carefully drew my bow and shot at it, but it was so dark I could hardly see and I missed it. My uncle didn't even see it until the last second. When I pulled the trigger of the release, I knew straight away that it was going to miss. All you could hear was the deer running away and the arrow crashing through all the leaves. So later that night we went home really hungry, but the experience still taught me the value of patience in hunting.
236	18097	7	3	A time when I was patient was when I ordered a @CAPS1 in the mail. It was a cool @DATE1 @TIME1 evening, and I was excitedly ordering a @CAPS1 online from the comfort of my room. When I got to the shipping section, I carefully paid the shipping fee, and then went to the check - out screen. I saw the estimated time of how long it would take to get to my house. It clearly said @NUM1 weeks. “@CAPS3?!”, I exclaimed in disbelief. “That’s a really long time.” Well, it was decided. I had to make it through @NUM1 weeks. I took a deep breath and told myself I was ready. So, I waited. And waited. And waited some more. Until one @DATE2 sunny morning, I saw a @CAPS1 package at my doorstep. The address on it said “@CAPS6 @CAPS7”. I was absolutely @CAPS4 happy! This incident taught me to always be patient, because chances are, you’ll get @CAPS3 you're wanting in the end and the wait will be worth it.
237	18098	7	3	That warm tear running down my cheek, the hot wind gently blowing my blond hair out of my face. The only thing I could think about was why God had to take her so soon. Let's go back a week ago. We had just got the sad news that my grandmother was going up to heaven with the angels very soon. As soon as the next day, we quickly packed our bags and were on a plane heading to @LOCATION1. This was my dad's mother; he was outwardly calm at the time, but we all had to be extra patient with him because he was the closest with her out of the @NUM1 children. When we finally took off, we were in turbulence throughout the whole @NUM2 - hour flight. That meant we couldn't get up, couldn't @CAPS1 food, couldn't @CAPS1 @CAPS3 and also had that queasy feeling in our stomachs. It was the @CAPS4 worst flying experience I've ever had. I flew all the time, just this time it was truly horrible! We had to take @NUM3 stops till we got to the @LOCATION1. Then another @NUM4 minutes passed till our bags came in. I was so relieved to get out of that death - trap! When we got to the house, I had my last precious time with my grandmother. It's a memory I will never forget. The stubborn little smirk on her face when we walked in was priceless. One thing I will never forget was my nickname from her “chicken little”. This entire experience made me cherish every moment with loved ones and taught me the value of being there in difficult times.
238	18099	7	3	“@CAPS1! @CAPS1! @CAPS1!” @PERSON2 impatiently said, “I wanna go first!” Well, at the time in cheerleading, this girl named @PERSON2 always thought she was the first to do everything. Oh yeah, my name is @PERSON3. I'm always a flyer along with @PERSON2. I'm always patient and wait my turn because I don't wanna complain or be a problem. “@CAPS3 set! @NUM1, @NUM2 down up @NUM3, @NUM4, @NUM5, @NUM6” the two bases and backspots loudly yell. They skillfully pop @CAPS4 out and up and then scream “@CAPS5!” “@CAPS6 job.” @CAPS7 praises. “@CAPS8, it's my turn, @PERSON3, you can do this, you're better than her.” I thought to myself “@CAPS9 we can do this.” One of our bases, @PERSON1, encouragingly said. I get into the @CAPS3 position. Hands on shoulders, getting ready to be popped up into the air. Our other base @CAPS10 shouts “@NUM1, @NUM2 down up! Okay, @NUM3, @NUM4, @NUM5, @NUM6 - @CAPS5!” “@CAPS6 job @CAPS12!” @CAPS13 cheers, though there's a bit of a loss in the attempt. “I was so excited. I just did a pop @CAPS5 without messing up my @CAPS5.” I thought with pure excitement. Being patient might be @CAPS6 rewarding after all. From that day on, I've always been patient. It can really help you out so you know what you have to work on or work less on and it can lead to great achievements.
239	18100	7	3	Are you good with being patient? Sometimes I am but sometimes @CAPS1 I'm not. Well, I'm going to tell you a story when I was patient when @CAPS1 I'm normally not patient in situations like this. I had gone to school with my mom so she could take a test and then drop me at the mall to meet my friends up there. While I was waiting, I was texting and browsing the internet. Then, my stomach started to rumble; I was really hungry. I wanted to text my mom and make her rush so I could get something to eat. As I was about to hit send, I stopped and thought about what I was about to do. I knew how @CAPS5 hard and long she had studied for that test. I didn't want her to get a bad grade because of me, so I just sat there quietly. I texted other people. Some people called me, so my mind was off food for a while. After my mom finished her test, she came out of the room. I asked her “@CAPS5 did it go?” She looked at me, smiled and said “I felt confident, but now @CAPS1 I'm hungry.” I shouted out “me too!” We got in the car and went to Subway. I had got the forest now meal. With cookies, chips, and a drink, it was delicious. My mom had dropped me off at the mall. I told my friends what happened. We laughed for some reason. Then, we went to @ORGANIZATION1, Charlotte, @CAPS7, @PERSON1 and other places as well. After I thought about it, I realized I never want to do that again. I was starting to get stiff and my butt started to hurt. I sat there for @NUM1 hours with nothing much to do. Never again will I do that. At least I had bonding time with my mom. That's one bright side to this whole experience.
240	18102	7	3	A time when I was patient was when I was at school. I was sitting quietly in my seat, waiting for my science teacher to call on me to get ready to go. The classroom was a bit noisy with students chatting softly. She was methodically calling people to stand by the door to get ready to go to their next class. I watched as my classmates got up one by one and made their way to the door. I kept my patience, knowing that my turn would come. Finally, my teacher called my name. I stood up, gathered my things, and joined the others by the door. This simple experience taught me that patience in small situations can make the daily routine run smoothly.
241	18103	7	3	Patient @PERSON2.Hay, when is our food going to be here? (said @PERSON1) You have to be patient, said @PERSON2. Well, in so @CAPS1, said @PERSON1. Well, you will have to wait, ok. @CAPS2, here's your food. (Yes, @PERSON1 shouts. Patience is always the key. @PERSON2, I'm done. Ending, let's go, said @PERSON1. Hold on, I haven't finished my food. Hurry, patience. Fine.) I'm done. Wow, that... Patience is the virtue. You ready? Yup, off we go. Success, lala - wait, you posted it. And @PERSON1, all right, btd an. @CAPS3, hurry, patience, @CAPS3 said @PERSON1. Fine, I'll just go slower. And @PERSON2, @CAPS4, I'll have patience. Where we are... @NUM1 min. This is good news. That was a good ride. I @CAPS3 right. I'm dad, you have @CAPS3 patience now. And so, thanks. Hey @PERSON2, look at that dumb talking down to us. Where? @PERSON2 replied. The @NUM2 story building. @CAPS4, watch out, said @PERSON2. Patience, @PERSON1 said. You don't need patience. Yes, I do. Just... splat. @CAPS3, if only I wasn't impatient. Patience truly is a difficult but necessary thing to have in such situations.
242	18105	7	3	Have you ever had to wait @NUM1 hour in line? This is exactly what it was like for me and @CAPS1. We were at Cedar Point, an exciting amusement park, waiting to ride the Top Thrill Dragster. We had just arrived, and the first thing we decided to do was to take a thrilling ride on the Top Thrill Dragster. However, the line was about a three - hour wait. Despite that, we went ahead and joined the line. We had just finished our first hour of waiting, but it felt like three long hours. I knew I had to be patient and relax, but every passing minute just felt like an eternity. After another hour, my stomach started to growl. I checked my watch; it was @NUM2. We had got here at @NUM3. I was starving and tired, but I stayed put. Finally, an hour later, it was our turn. When I got off the ride, I knew it had been worth it to be patient. In conclusion, I learned that patience is something you have to have for a lot of things in life, like waiting for an amazing experience at an amusement park.
243	18106	7	3	"Don't you ever wish everyone in the world would be patient? @CAPS4, if you don't, I do. Lucky for me, one time I was a not - so - good girl and I did something I was not supposed to do. But since I have such great parents, they were trying their best to be patient with me. Like all parents, they had to give me a lecture about what I did, and they did not let me get out of the hook that easy. ""@CAPS1 @CAPS2 please come down to the office"" I heard on the announcement. As I was walking down the hallway, I was really nervous. ""What have I done?"" I asked myself, thinking really hard. Before I knew it, I was at the office. ""Yes,"" I said to the person that was there. ""Do you know why you're here?"" @CAPS3 said. ""No,"" I replied. ""@CAPS4, I've been having some complaints from these girls,"" @CAPS3 had told me. ""@CAPS4, oo ya,"" I said. ""@CAPS4, ya what?"" @CAPS3 said. ""The only reason why I was being mean was because they were being mean and they were being such suck - ups. They would tell my friends that the only reason I hung out with them was because they had money, which was not true,"" I said. ""Ok, I get where you're coming from. Let me call them down,"" @CAPS3 said. ""@CAPS5 and Alesay come down to the office please."" As they came down the hallway, I could hear their footsteps. I really did not want to talk to them. But in the end, I knew that patience from everyone involved would be needed to resolve this issue."
244	18107	7	3	One thing I am not very patient with is the MEAP. The reason I am not patient with the MEAP is because it is very boring. You cannot talk during the test, and it is just dull. I hate the MEAP; it is very difficult. You don't see ten - year - olds or @CAPS1 doing the MEAP easily. The MEAP expects you to do too much work. It is one of the reasons I dislike Michigan. The MEAP asks you questions and uses words you never saw or heard before. In my opinion, @CAPS2, when we are going to do the MEAP, I would prefer them to ask questions and use words that we know. Another thing I don't like about it is that they grade our writing based on opinion. They grade according to what they think of it. To me, the MEAP is stupid. @CAPS2, if I had a choice, I would choose not to do it. Since the MEAP is important for my academic record, I do it for my grade. These are the reasons why I am very impatient with the MEAP, and it shows how patience can be a struggle when dealing with unappealing tasks.
245	18108	7	3	"When I was little, I was patient. I would always sit quietly and wait for directions. My mom always liked it that way. @CAPS5, now since @CAPS1 is bigger, she thinks @CAPS1 is impatient. @CAPS5, you're what? @CAPS1, no, I am patient. I get along well. I am not antsy. I'm not the type who says, ""When are we going, you guys?"" That is how I was when @CAPS4 was learning how to speak. @CAPS5, I guess that's how it goes. And @TIME1, I was patient because my mom and dad were having a serious talk, and I was not about to interrupt. It was a grown - up talk. As I've grown, I realize that maintaining that childhood patience can be a challenge, but it's still an important quality to have."
246	18109	7	3	My mom is patient because I use her phone a lot to text and call my girlfriend and to text and call friends. She tells me when she needs to use it, even when I'm in the middle of a text or a call. This shows her understanding and patience with my usage of her phone.
247	18110	7	3	A time when I was patient was waiting for Christmas. My mom told me she was getting me a PlayStation for Christmas. I was so happy. Then when Christmas came and I was opening my presents, there was no PlayStation. So I asked her about it. She said she would get it in April when taxes came. So I had to be patient and wait for two months and a couple of days. I was mad because I thought she had it. So I just had to go to school and wait and wait until April came. It seemed like the days got longer and longer. I was getting madder and madder. That was the longest two months ever. I didn't even know it could feel so long. I thought a year went by. After a while went by, it was finally April, but I didn't get it until like the end of the month. That just crushed my little heart so badly to wait for something that long that I wanted so bad. When I got it, it was so fun to play with all the games and apps and the controllers. It was amazing. If something was to happen to it, I would be destroyed. A PlayStation is expensive, but once you get it, you have to take care of it. That's why I'm keeping it in a special place away from little kids. I don't even let them play with it at all, and if I feel like they might, they can play with my supervision. That's the only time they can play. That thing cost too much money to get lost or broken. Especially after all that time I had to wait. My little sister is getting something like it, but it's some kind of educational one. My little brother is getting a DS. I'm happy they're getting something so they can stop asking for my stuff. My mom is getting me some games for it for my birthday. I had one, but my little brother or sister lost it. I was so angry that they can't play it at all. That was definitely something to wait and be patient about. That's why no one can play it because I'm scared of it getting lost or broken. If it does, my mom won't get another one.
248	18112	7	3	The first time I baby-sat was with two little girls. A toddler named Lily and a baby named Ava. After their parents left, everything was fine. That is, until Ava started crying like crazy. At first, I thought she was saying, “Mama, Mama!” Then I realized she was saying, “Bunny, Bunny!” Her Bunny is a blanket, and when I handed it to her, she stopped immediately! Now I realize how patient I was with her. I'm glad I figured out what she wanted. Hopefully, next time I'll be just as patient and handle such situations smoothly.
249	18114	7	3	When I had to be patient, one of my most memorable times was when I ordered my first classical guitar. I ordered my guitar from a reputable guitar website that my guitar teacher recommended. I waited and waited until finally I got my guitar. I took it out of the box, and it was chipped. I was extremely angry. We sent the guitar back for a new one. About a month later, I got another guitar. So I thought. I opened it up. It was the same guitar I had sent back. I was even more angry. So again we sent the guitar back, hoping that we would finally get the right one. It was my birthday, and I got my guitar. I was so happy, and this time it was not chipped. I was so happy when my guitar arrived on my birthday. This experience taught me the importance of patience when dealing with such issues.
250	18115	7	3	Patience is a special skill for some people, and for some, it's very hard. When I was a little girl, I never had any patience, and even now, I don't have any either. But my friend was always patient with me. Yeah, she would tell me to hurry up or she'd leave, but I would just start laughing and come down right away. She waited for me to pick up a stray cat and take it to the pound. That's what she would always do too. I will probably never learn patience until adulthood, like when I'm older, but I know I will learn it someday. One time, my friend waited for three hours just to learn about history. I would have never had the patience for that, but then again, she did get an A on her history homework. So her patience for that was really cool, and she told me that patience is a number one priority. This was one time my friend had patience, and it made me realize that with time and effort, I too can develop this important skill.
251	18116	7	3	It was a bright sunny day, with clear blue skies and a gentle breeze, and there was a long line outside the airport. People were anxiously waiting for their flight to @LOCATION1. It has been three hours and everyone was getting impatient, fidgeting and muttering to themselves, but there was a young little boy in the group that didn’t seem to complain, he was very patient, quietly looking around with wide - eyed curiosity. Now it has to be five hours, their flight has been delayed, the sun went down, casting a warm orange glow that faded into darkness, and there was a riot going on, with people shouting and pushing, but still the little young boy was still waiting patiently, sitting calmly on his small suitcase. It has now been twelve hours, people began to leave, tired and frustrated, it was midnight, and yet the boy was still waiting there and has not yet moved, his eyes fixed on the departure board. Now there was only fifteen people left, it was dusk, the sky turning a soft pink, and yet the boy waited there patiently. Their flight has arrived and only there was three people there. They went in the plane. The other people that left saw the plane ready to take off and ran towards it. But they were too late and the only people who made it to @LOCATION1 was the two girls and the patient boy. The end.
252	18117	7	3	Patience is difficult to do, especially when it comes to waiting in line for something important or waiting for a letter to come in the mail, constantly checking the mailbox day after day. A time when I had to use patience was when I thought of a great poem. I heard about a book that you could enter your poem and then might put it in the book. So I worked for a couple of days as hard as I could, sitting at my desk, scribbling and erasing, and I only ended up with @NUM1 lines. I couldn’t think of anything else so I entered the poem. It said on their website that the letter will arrive in @NUM2 to @NUM3 business days so I waited for a long time, each day passing slowly with anticipation. One day @NUM2 months from when I sent the poem in I got an apology letter for it being so long for them to respond. Anyways I kept reading and it said that I used patience, which made me realize that sometimes waiting pays off.
253	18118	7	3	This was one day when I had to do something that I didn’t want to do and if I didn’t do it I couldn’t go anywhere or go to the movies. When I was at my aunt's house and I had to clean up her house and I didn’t want to do it, so she had told me that her house should be clean when she comes back home and I was the only one there. I started to grumble as I picked up the broom. When I went to @CAPS1 point, everybody went on this scary high - in - the - sky ride and you have to take your shoes off, then we got something to eat, a quick snack to refuel. The next day when everybody woke up, we headed from the hotel and went home and ate breakfast. Then I didn’t want to ride my uncle's four - wheeler down the hill but he had started it up and pushed it. I had on knee pads and elbow pads and gloves, feeling a bit nervous. When I got to my grandma's house, I didn’t know that everybody was helping but I didn’t want to, but my mum made me help. So nobody went outside to play football. It was a good game because I looked out the window the whole game. I didn’t have patience because I wasn’t in it. Wow, I was watching the football game out the window, the other children ran out the door and I was not done with the wall. In the end, I finished the work and realized that sometimes we have to do things we don't like.
254	18119	7	3	The time that I was patient was today when everyone was taking the @CAPS1.E.A.P. When we all got into the classroom, nobody whatsoever did not want to take the @CAPS1.E.A.P. Our teacher told us that we had to write on five pages and on @DATE1 we had to finish part two of the writing session, and nobody wanted to, groans filling the room. So when we got the packet that we had to bubble in our answers, we had to fill something out on the front of the packet. Then we had to put our first and last name on it before we could take a break. When the break was over, we needed to get a free - reading book and our teacher had to read all of us the directions to us. We got started and when everyone was finished she told like five or more people that they could have a bathroom break. When everyone went, she read the directions to the other part. When everyone was doing that, some people got done really early and they got really bored and they didn’t want to read so then they all started to talk. She said she would be right back that she had to go to the bathroom. So once someone came in and would watch us, then all of the guys would make paper basketballs and started to shoot them into the tiny basketball hoop. Then she came in and told us to get in our seats and that we would be starting the last writing session and that after this it would be lunch and it might even go through our lunch and then everyone was freaking out. So that was the time that I was just patient, and I learned that patience can help get through difficult tasks.
255	18120	7	3	One time when I had to be patient was when I went to my first NASCAR race. I had to be patient because there were a lot of people there and I didn't want to get last. I had to wait till the people who were in front got in their seats, standing there, craning my neck to see. Second - we finally got our seats and I had to sit by this scary person, he was acting really weird. So the race was beginning and you could tell because the racers were getting into their cars, revving the engines with a loud roar. The jets went over us, leaving a trail of white smoke, and the @ORGANIZATION1 was going. Then the racers were off to race. Finally the race starts and my favorite racer is in the lead (@PERSON1). The cars were going so fast around like you could feel the bleachers shake, the ground vibrating beneath my feet. It was a fun experience but you had to stay close, listen and be patient. This experience taught me that patience can lead to great moments.
256	18121	7	3	I am never patient, but when I am, it is only once in a while. Sitting down quietly and not doing a single thing drives me nearly insane. When I'm doing nothing and it's extremely quiet, I get really bad headaches. For example, in school when I'm waiting, I get really fidgety. I tap my foot, tap my pencil on the desk, and tap on just about everything around me. I must do something or I'll go crazy. Waiting in a doctor's office or flying on a plane for a while can become really boring. When I wait for too long, I feel lazy and tired because I'm not moving at all. I get antsy when I'm trying to be patient and waiting for something. It usually takes no longer than 30 min (half an hour) before I start to feel really bad. I can't be patient for very long or I'll get all jittery. One way I help myself is by playing sports and constantly engaging in active things. By keeping myself occupied, I can better manage my impatience.
257	18123	7	3	Patience is when a being shows the ability to wait calmly and make good decisions. For me, patience is the ability to stay composed and level - headed. Patience is very important because it allows me to rationally deal with situations so that I don't get into trouble. Maintaining patience in times of stress is difficult. It is difficult because people around you might be pressuring you or adding to the chaos. Without patience, people make hasty and bad decisions, and this often leads to negative consequences. Patience lets me deal with bad ideas like the ones that cause unnecessary conflict. By using patience, I can analyze the problem, deal with it effectively, and then move on. Such bad ideas are truly a very bad influence, but with patience, I can overcome them. In conclusion, patience is an essential quality that helps us navigate through difficult situations and avoid making regrettable choices.
258	18124	7	3	"It was the night before Christmas eve and I could hardly contain my excitement. In my family on Christmas eve, we go to my grandparents' house. When we are there, we have lively conversations, enjoy delicious food, and my favorite part - open presents. As my mom, dad, and I drove up to my grandparents' house, I was so eager that I could barely wait to open the car door. I sprinted up to the front door and rang the doorbell repeatedly, as if I rang it a hundred times. ""Hello there, dear,"" my grandpa said. ""Grandpa, can we eat quickly so I can open my presents?"" ""Yeah, sure."" After we were done eating, I dashed down the stairs as fast as my legs could carry me. I was so impatient. As I waited somewhat patiently while all of my old relatives opened their presents, it was finally my turn. I ripped off the wrapping paper in a flash and saw that it was a game. Since it was the first present, I opened it in a hurry, but from then on, I waited patiently until it was my turn again. This Christmas eve was filled with joy and the lesson of waiting for the right moment."
259	18126	7	3	I saw someone being very patient. They got to a restaurant before I did. Then I ordered my food, and it arrived quickly. Meanwhile, they still had no food in front of them. I waited for a bit, but eventually, I had to leave. Finally, after I left, they got their food. That's what I call patience. It shows that sometimes, waiting can be a virtue, even when it seems like the wait is endless. In a world where we often want things right away, this person's example of patience is a good reminder.
260	18127	7	3	When I was seven, I played on a basketball team named the Tigers. We were playing against the Lions for the championship, and I wasn't in the game at first. My coach told me to stay on the bench this game because I was a relatively inexperienced player on my team. Without me playing, my team was down by 10 points, and my coach still didn't put me in. I knew that if I stayed calm and showed patience, my coach would eventually let me play. So, when it was the fourth quarter with a minute left in the game and we were down by 5 points, my coach told me to get in the game and win it for us. So I got in, and with 30 seconds left, I got the ball and started making shot after shot. But when there were 10 seconds left and we were down by 1 point, I got fouled. I had to take a technical shot, which is when you are at the foul line, all alone with just the ball and the rim. I made my first shot easily, but for my second shot, I was a bit nervous. So I thought about what got me in the game - patience. As I got ready to shoot, I took my time, got patient with the shot to think it through, and when I shot it, I made it. Once the other team got the ball to inbound it, we stole the ball and won the game. If I wasn't patient in this game, we wouldn't have won, and I wouldn't have gotten the trophy to take home with me. This experience taught me the invaluable lesson of patience in a high - pressure situation.
261	18128	7	3	My mom generally has very little patience, which is why it truly surprised me when she showed an abundance of it on the day my grandma passed away. I was in a state of shock as I witnessed her being sad yet taking her time with extreme care and slowness, as if every single move she made had to be absolutely perfect. It was an incredibly terrible day, and all any of us could think of was to break down and cry. My mom, however, knew deep down that my grandma would have wanted her to be happy, so she was extremely mindful of her every move. As soon as I arrived at the place, she immediately came right up to me and gave me a huge, comforting hug. No matter what my little brother and I did, even if it was a bit disruptive, she didn't even mind. That was a very surprising day because in my entire life, I had never seen her that sad but at the same time so patient. It was a day that made me realize there was a side of my mom I had never fully known.
262	18129	7	3	A time that I was patient is when I had my twelfth birthday. All of my friends, except one, were so enthusiastic about keeping the fun going and wanted to keep playing. So, being the good sport that I was, we continued with our activities. We decided to go for a walk with the dogs, enjoying the fresh air and the company of our furry friends. After that, we sat down to have a delicious dinner, sharing laughter and stories. And then, the much - awaited moment of opening presents arrived. When we were all done with that, we finally opened my presents. I was extremely excited to see what was inside those beautifully wrapped boxes. That is a time that I was patient. I was very proud of myself for doing what my friends wanted to do first. Plus, in the end, I got a lot of exciting stuff, and I realized that waiting and doing what my friends wanted to do first was a truly great idea. I'm pretty sure that we all had a wonderful time that day, creating memories that I'll cherish forever.
263	18130	7	3	@PERSON1 was having a great time swinging with her friend all day. She was swinging so high that the chain of the swing suddenly came loose, and @PERSON1 fell hard to the ground. She was screaming in intense pain, her voice filled with terror. So, they slowly walked into the house. When they got to the house, @PERSON1 was still screaming and crying uncontrollably. Everyone quickly got in the car and drove as fast as they could to the doctors. The nurse informed them that she had to wait an hour to see the doctor. @PERSON1 was really impatient at first until she and her friend started having a long conversation. They talked about all sorts of things, from their favorite movies to their future dreams. When the doctor was finally ready to see her, @PERSON1 had completely forgotten all about why she was there in the first place. @PERSON1 found out that she had broken her arm. Later that day, she sincerely thanked her mom for being there for her and then called her friend and thanked her for helping her be patient during that difficult time. It was a day that taught her the value of friendship and patience.
264	18131	7	3	I thought that when I got hurt during a football game and was lying on a stretcher, everyone around me showed great patience. They fully understood that I could only move at a very slow pace. They waited for me in the hallways, patiently standing there, and carried my stuff from room to room. An example of someone showing this patience was @CAPS1 @PERSON2. @PERSON2 was in a hurry to go to the bathroom, but instead of rushing off, he walked with me slowly, step by step, so I wouldn't be alone during that difficult time. Another example of someone being patient with me is @PERSON1, Lauren. Lauren was patient with me when I asked her to help me with some small things, like adjusting the pillow on the stretcher. She did it without any hesitation or annoyance, showing her kind and patient nature. Everyone's patience during that time made me feel cared for and supported, and it was a reminder of the wonderful people around me.
265	18132	7	3	The time I was patient. One day my mom and I went to the eye doctor. It was my very first time going there, and I was a bit nervous. We went to this receptionist lady and sat down to wait for the doctor to call us. We sat for @NUM1 minutes, and I was getting a bit antsy. Then, we finally heard the doctor calling my name. We went inside the doctor's room, and I sat down on the chair. The doctor did all these different eye - related things, like shining a light in my eyes and asking me to read some letters on a chart. Later, he told us that we had to meet one more doctor. We sat down again and waited patiently. Then we heard my name again, so we went into another room. The worst thing was that I saw a medicine bottle on the table, and I was really scared. The lady asked me to look up and open my eyes wide. After that, she took the medicine dropper and was about to put it in my eyes. I was so scared that when she put the medicine in my eyes, it burned a little. I didn't want her to do the other eye. I wanted to just stand up and run outside, but I knew I had to be brave. She did the other eye and told me to now keep my eyes closed until she came back. When she came back, she told me that was it, and we were done there. I thought to myself, that wasn't so bad after all. It was a small challenge that taught me the importance of being patient.
266	18133	7	3	I forget to grab my helmet and knee pads out of my mom’s car cause she works until @NUM1 and at @NUM2 that evening, I realized I was in a bit of a bind. Then my patience showed up as I decided to wait until she got home to retrieve them.
267	18134	7	3	Patience can mean a lot of things. It can mean to be understanding, like when someone makes a mistake and you don't immediately get angry. Or it can mean to be tolerant, such as when dealing with difficult people or situations. Being patient can also mean you don't complain. Like if you ask someone to get you something and they say that they will get it in a certain amount of days. If they don't get it the day they said they would and you were expecting it then you should not get mad. You can also be patient if you have to wait for something. If you are getting a new pair of shoes but the only way you can get them is they have to be ordered. You should not start to complain if it takes a long time. You should be able to wait without getting angry that you don't have them yet. Being patient can mean all of these things. If you do these things you can tell that you are patient. That is what being patient means, and it can greatly improve your relationships and daily life.
268	18135	7	3	Patient, that’s all I am when I go fishing. If there is a spot where you cast, it takes sometimes almost fifty casts just to get a bite. Then you have to wait for the fish to swallow the bait. Sometimes you have to be patient in picking the lure you are going to use. That is because you have to take into account the water color, the amount of weeds in the area, and what the fish in that particular spot usually eat. Then you have to have patience with the spot you're at too. After the motor runs, you have to wait for the fish to come back to their normal behavior. So you have to have a lot of patience to go fishing, and it's all part of the rewarding experience.
269	18136	7	3	Anna sat there waiting patiently, her fingers drumming softly on her knees. “Come on, come on, come on!” She thought to herself, her mind filled with excitement and nerves as she anticipated performing her now improved beam routine. Anna was one of the last gymnasts to go, only making her situation more difficult. She took a deep breath, squared her shoulders, and sat down patiently again, waiting for her chance to shine to the judges and show off all her hard work.
270	18137	7	3	It was the @DATE1 when I went to see the Creed concert with my cousins. There must have been @NUM1 or @NUM2 people in front of us in the long line. Then I heard and saw people shoving and pushing to get in, creating a bit of a chaotic scene. About @NUM3 to @NUM1 minutes later my legs started aching but I held on, gritting my teeth. I kept telling myself, “the pain is worth the wait!” Finally we got to the security guards. They had to use a metal detector on us to ensure everyone's safety. When we walked into the concert hall, I said, “that was a truly worth - waiting - for experience.”
271	18138	7	3	"A time when I was patient. Two weeks ago, @CAPS4 @CAPS2 excitedly said her @CAPS1 was coming. @CAPS4's grandma was extremely happy upon hearing this news, so she decided to buy her sister a bus ticket. Bus tickets usually cost a significant amount of money. In this case, it was @NUM1 dollars. That was quite a large sum. She couldn't miss this bus because I was really eager to see her. I was so impatient that I just couldn't wait. She was supposed to arrive on @DATE1. However, she didn't show up. I was feeling sick at that time, so I called @CAPS4 @CAPS2 at her workplace. I said, ""@CAPS2, why didn't @CAPS3 come?"" @CAPS4 @CAPS2 replied, ""@CAPS5, she is coming. You just have to be patient."" ""Alright,"" I said. The next day was @DATE2. I asked, ""@CAPS2, is she here yet?"" ""@CAPS8, @CAPS5, be patient. She will be here tomorrow,"" @CAPS2 said. ""Okay, I understand."" I almost gave up, thinking that she wasn't coming. Then @CAPS4's mom called @CAPS4's godmom. She said it was @CAPS6. So she told me she was going to @ORGANIZATION1. I really love @ORGANIZATION1. It's so great. I asked @CAPS4 @CAPS2, ""@CAPS11, I have a @CAPS12. @ORGANIZATION2 cheese burger."" I mentioned @CAPS13 to @CAPS4's uncle, and @CAPS4's mom said she wasn't coming. I told @CAPS4's mom that I wasn't giving up and that she was definitely coming. So I said I was hanging up. Then, @CAPS4's mom said to @CAPS4's uncle @CAPS14, ""Should I get her something to eat?"" I initially thought she meant @CAPS4's grandmother. So I pondered for a while, wondering who ""her"" was. Then I called back. @CAPS4's mom said, ""Oh, I'm getting food for uncle @CAPS14's dog."" I asked, ""@PERSON1's? For a dog?"" She said it was dog food. So @CAPS4's mom picked me up from @CAPS4's godmother's house. I couldn't walk because every part of @CAPS4's body, including the legs, back, and arms, hurt. So @CAPS4's grandmother came to her house since we had the keys. She asked, ""Where @CAPS16?"" @CAPS4's uncle whispered something, and I exclaimed, ""She's here!"" I ran into @CAPS4's uncle's room and hugged her. I asked, ""How are you?"" because when I went for @CAPS4's grandmother's birthday, she lived in South Carolina. This is @CAPS4's story. That's when I was patient and finally got to wait for @CAPS4's mom's @CAPS1."
272	18140	7	3	Two years ago, when the very first @CAPS1 model came out, my step - dad was so excited that he immediately paid eight hundred dollars to get one. He was over the moon and spent a lot of time bragging to his family and friends about his new purchase. During that time, my mom accidentally broke her phone. Unfortunately, my step - dad didn't want to let her use his @CAPS1. As a result, my mom was without a phone for at least three months. She was a bit annoyed, but she knew it was worth being patient. As time passed, the newer and improved version of the @CAPS1 hit the stores. My mom was finally able to buy it. She was extremely glad because this new @CAPS1 had more apps and even a webcom compared to the first one. I truly believe that my mom did a great job at being patient. If it were someone else, they probably wouldn't have been able to wait that long. Patience really paid off for her in the end.
273	18141	7	3	"When I was about @NUM1 years old, there was one thing I desperately wanted in the whole world. You know how some little girls would want a baby doll? Well, not me. I wanted a rex. This toy was the biggest and meanest dinosaur on the planet, at least in my little - kid mind. It was incredibly cool to me. It could walk, talk, run, and even ""bite"". Every time I went to the store, I would head straight to the toy section. I'd find that rex, look it in the ""eyes"", and say, ""You will be mine one day."" You know that feeling when you really, really want something, and your mom says Christmas is coming up, but it's actually @NUM2 months away? I wanted it right then, not in @NUM2 months. So I started thinking about what I could do to get the rex before @NUM2 months. I got an idea! I would clean up more around the house, walk the dog more often, and do better in school. I hoped that would work. So I asked my mom, ""Mom, if I start doing all this good stuff, can I get some of my Christmas things in a week @NUM5?"" She replied, ""No, you'll just get more things on Christmas."" I was so angry that I was about to cry. But @NUM2 months wasn't that long after all. Before I knew it, it was time to open my Christmas gifts. I thought I had opened all my gifts. I looked around carefully, and I had! But I didn't see the rex. I was really sad, even though I had about @NUM7 or more other gifts. I still didn't have that rex. So I sadly walked to my room. My mom came into my room with a big box. Could it be the rex? I jumped out of my bed so fast that my mom probably didn't even see me move. I looked inside the box, and it was a bunch of baby dolls. Then she said, ""Go downstairs."" And there he was, the rex, looking as if it was happy to see me. It was all worth the wait."
274	18142	7	3	"@NUM1, @NUM2, @NUM3, @NUM4, @NUM5, @NUM6, @NUM7, @NUM8!"" My poms coach, @PERSON1, shouts as we practice the dance repeatedly. I truly love poms, but sometimes it can be extremely tiring. We have practice on @DATE1 and @DATE3. There are six of us on the team, including me. My coach loves to make each of us perform the dance alone once. On our first game, we had a practice session right before we left for our very first performance. All of us were incredibly excited and just wanted to go and perform all day. However, the game was scheduled to start at @NUM5:45 pm, but it didn't actually begin until @NUM6:00 pm, which was much later than we expected. So our entire poms team, our coach, and all of our family members had to wait patiently on the bleachers for over @NUM11 hours. Finally, it was @DATE2, and when the clock struck three, it meant we all went onto the track to stretch. We were all very happy, but still a bit disappointed that we hadn't gotten to perform earlier. We had a minute on the clock, so we walked to the other side of the field. As we got into our formation, the clock quickly started counting down from fifty seconds to @NUM12, and then we only had @NUM13 seconds left until we were supposed to go on. I couldn't believe it. Only @NUM13 seconds until our very first performance! The excitement rushed through my head as the man announced, ""@CAPS1 performing @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 pom - pon team,"" followed by our names over the speakers. The crowd roared as we entered the field. We quickly reminded ourselves to smile. Then the music started, and we all danced our hearts out, showing our respect and gratitude to our coach and our parents. After we finished, we were immediately surrounded by our friends and family. And waiting and being patient didn't seem so bad anymore. It was definitely all worth the wait."
275	18143	7	3	When dealing with toddlers or the elderly, you must have a great deal of patience. Patience is a key virtue when interacting with anyone, but the very young and the very old especially need more of it. Elderly people often become confused, have difficulty hearing you clearly, or are just a bit slower in their actions. You must practice patience and show them respect. Very young children can also get confused because they are just starting to learn about the world. Toddlers will often become upset and refuse to do what you tell them if you have no patience and start to yell at them. Patience is also extremely important when dealing with mentally or physically challenged persons. If they have challenges, they can't help it. Mentally challenged people often don't understand instructions or don't want to do certain things, just like toddlers. You should be patient with the physically challenged because some tasks can be very difficult for them to complete. In general, you should be patient with everyone because patience is a form of respect. Fear is not respect. By being patient, we can create a more understanding and inclusive environment for everyone. That is how I truly feel about the word patience.
276	18144	7	3	A time when I was patient was when I was babysitting, and the kids I was babysitting were acting up. They were running around the room, shouting, and being generally unruly. It was hard for me to get them to calm down. But, I noticed that if I was patient, then they would be too. So, I just sat down calmly and told them to calm down, but they wouldn't. So I told them that again in a gentle voice, and this time they were a bit quieter. I noticed that if I ignored their misbehavior or remained patient, then they would settle down and stop because they were trying to get my attention. If I was being patient, then I knew they would be too. It worked. They settled down and were being well - behaved. When I was babysitting them the next time too, they remembered how I had handled the situation, and it was much easier to keep them calm.
277	18146	7	3	“Pull back harder on the reins!” my teacher yelled. “I'm trying, but he's just not listening!” This horse had to be the most stubborn horse I had ever ridden in my life! He did whatever he wanted, whenever he wanted, and paid no attention to me at all. “Okay, bring him in.” she said. I slowly walked the horse into the center of the ring. “I really am trying, he's not listening.” I said. “I know he can be a bit hard - headed, but I make you ride him because I believe you can handle him.” The horse's name was Max. He was a reddish - brownish color with big glassy brown eyes. He looked like a great horse that listened to its rider. Wrong! He was not nice or sweet and didn't listen at all! “Just walk him around a couple of times along the perimeter.” my teacher said. “Fine.” I replied. As I was halfway around the ring, Max stopped. Then he turned to his right, walked up to the window, and started licking the water that beaded up on it. “What is he doing!” my teacher yelled. “I think he's licking the water off the windows.” I said. “Get him away from there, he could get sick!” As I said earlier, this horse has terrible listening skills! Now I was getting in trouble because of him! “Be patient.” I guess I did need to calm down, so I relaxed a little and continued riding with no problems. I guess I really needed patience and to relax. Even if so, I am still never getting on that horse ever again, as it was just too much of a hassle.
278	18147	7	3	On my way to the city to visit my dad. While in the car, there is a variety of food, and I brought along my tablet to keep me busy. I brought my tablet along because it would be annoying if I asked “Are we there yet?” every few minutes, and I knew that a two - hour drive would need some entertainment. Most of the time, I would be playing fun games so that time goes by fast. If I don't play games, then I eat a snack, play with my baby cousin, who is full of energy, and take short naps. After a while of doing these things, I sit back and relax, looking out of the window at the passing scenery. The whole trip is two hours, but by doing all that, it seems to be more like one or one and a half hours. It made the long drive much more bearable, and I was looking forward to seeing my dad.
279	18148	7	3	Patience is basically waiting and tolerating it. Every year on June 15th, my family becomes seasonal at a campground. There, we play and have fun and make many life - long friends. Every weekend, we go out there and take our speedboat, “The Glass Froth”. We carefully put it into the lake and dock it at a dock. Then we go fishing in every part of the lake and sit there for six hours. This is where patience comes in. We have to sit quietly and watch our bobbers float on the smooth glass - like lake. We sit there, watch the gentle ripples, talk about our days, and soak in the sunlight. It is quite peaceful, especially since I'm off school, and I get to spend quality time with my parents. Then in school, I have to wait throughout the year patiently so the year can be over. So we sit there until the sudden noise of one of our bobbers sinking into the water. After that, there's some yelling and “Get the net” sayings. The funny part is that it is either a large bass or a small one. And all this fishing and waiting takes a great deal of patience, which is a valuable lesson I learn every time we go to the campground.
280	18149	7	3	My dog, Teddy Bear, is very impatient because when he comes in from outside, he knows he gets a treat. But he has to wait for the other dogs to come in. He starts jumping around, whining, and pawing at the door. His tail wags so fast that it's a blur, and he keeps looking out the door, waiting for the other dogs. He can't seem to stand the thought of having to wait even a few extra seconds for his treat. It's quite obvious how impatient he is, but it's also kind of endearing in a way. Even though he struggles with waiting, he eventually calms down a bit when the other dogs finally come in, and then he gets his well - deserved treat.
281	18150	7	3	One @DATE1 @TIME1, as I sat in the hospital waiting room / lobby with my father, mother, sister, and brother, I was remarkably patient while waiting for my sister - in - law to tell my brother that we could enter the hospital room to see their brand - new baby @CAPS1. We had been waiting there for about an hour and a half. I really tried to stay calm and composed. Every ten to fifteen minutes, I'd get up and take a short walk around the area because I was so shaky, nervous, and jumpy. And it probably didn't help that right before I started being patient, I had drunk three cans of Pepsi. But in the end, all that waiting was worth it when we finally got to see the precious baby.
282	18151	7	3	Patience to me is a personal thought that firmly turns into action. I've shown patience many times before. I used to visit the store at the corner of my block. One day, when I went there, I had to stand in an incredibly long line that stretched to about the halfway point of my block. I went inside, quickly gathered my stuff, and then joined the end of the line. A half - hour passed, and it was just five minutes till closing time. I managed to reach the window and pay for my things @NUM1 minute before the store closed. I was just standing in line, doing nothing but waiting. To my surprise, the owner of the store let me get a total of @NUM2 things for free. I got half of the stuff I wanted, and the other half were household things. So, clearly, being patient really pays off and can unlock many different treasures. So, start running with patience and leave impatience far behind.
283	18152	7	3	Well, you definitely need patience when you're fishing. You have to sit quietly by the water, waiting for a fish to bite, not getting frustrated by the long periods of inactivity. Also, when your food is on its way and going to be served to you, you should be patient and not get impatient. Moreover, it's crucial to be patient with everybody else in various situations, like when they're speaking or making a decision. By being patient in these aspects of life, we can have a more harmonious and pleasant experience.
284	18153	7	3	Just as I finished munching on my hamburger, I noticed an old, shabby - looking bus parked outside the restaurant window. “@CAPS1’s that?” I asked in my squeaky seven - year - old voice. My @CAPS3 responded, “That bus takes people to the palace across the street, where @PERSON1’s playing.” “@CAPS2 it be cool if we @CAPS4 go?” I questioned with excitement. I saw my mom whisper something to my brother. It was then that they told me we were going to the show. Excitedly, I climbed into the back seat of our car, and we drove across the street to the palace of @ORGANIZATION1. It was truly huge! All I could think about was entering that marvelous building, but my @CAPS3 kept telling me we had to wait. About fifteen minutes later, the two Pepsis I had drunk earlier made their way through my system. “@CAPS3, I have to go to the bathroom,” I said repeatedly. Finally, my @CAPS3 took me through the front doors. The inside of the building was even more fabulous than the outside! However, a rail of red rope blocked our way. “@CAPS4 my son use the bathrooms?” my @CAPS3 asked a lady who sat behind the front desk. She gave a cold “no” and we were forced to return back to the car. Another fifteen minutes passed. The concert would start soon, so we returned to the building. This time the red rope had gone, but there was a line of nearly fifty people waiting to get through the metal detector! It took almost @NUM1 minutes, but we made it to the front of the line, passed through the metal detector, and took our seats. That was a true test of my patience, but it all was worth it when I was finally allowed to use the bathroom and enjoy the amazing concert.
285	18154	7	3	I was patient when I went to @LOCATION1 @CAPS1. It all started when my friend @PERSON1 gave me a call and asked me to go with him. Without hesitation, I said yes. I knew I had to be patient as per the plan for @DATE1. Then he started driving, and it was a really long drive. But I kept my cool and didn't complain. When we finally reached the entrance of @LOCATION1, I felt a great sense of satisfaction for being patient throughout the journey.
286	18156	7	3	Once upon a time there was a peculiar place called Unpaciente Land. The name was quite fitting as the people there were always in a hurry and short - tempered. But on Grumpy Lane, a quiet and unassuming street, lived a little girl named @ORGANIZATION1. She was the most patient girl ever, with a calm demeanor and a kind heart. One sunny day, @ORGANIZATION1 decided to go to get her hair cut at “Mtso Fast Saloon!” When @ORGANIZATION1 got there, the chaos was palpable. Everyone was screaming at @CAPS1, the hair cutter, who looked flustered and stressed. @ORGANIZATION1, undeterred by the commotion, stood up bravely and said, “Hey, if you want your hair to look good, sit down and be quiet.” And to everyone's surprise, everybody did. @ORGANIZATION1 went home with a beautiful haircut, just like everybody else. Then, because of her wise and patient act, @ORGANIZATION1 became the mayor of Unpaciente Land. She renamed it @CAPS2 Land. From that day forward, everybody in the land learned to be patient, just like @ORGANIZATION1.
287	18159	7	3	A Time when I was Patient. A time when I was patient was when I went to the doctor with my step - mom and brother. My brother was getting his knee looked at as he had injured it during a game. We were in that crowded waiting room for like two or three hours! The long wait was testing everyone's patience. Jody, my step - mom, was getting really irritated. She kept pacing back and forth and muttering under her breath. I told her calmly that the doctor will be out soon. I was very patient throughout. While waiting, @CAPS2 and @PERSON1 were playing with his phone, and the soft glow of the screen and the occasional sound of the game kind of made @CAPS2 relax. Usually, everyone tells @CAPS2 that I'm really impatient. But for some reason, when I'm really excited, like this time about seeing if my brother could get his knee brace off, I'm fairly patient. Sure enough, when the doctor finally called my brother in, he was able to get his knee brace off. He was so happy, and I realized that those two hours of waiting were definitely worth it! This was a time when I was patient.
288	18160	7	3	One time I was patient. It was Dec @NUM1, @DATE1, @CAPS1 eve. I was so excited that @CAPS1 was just around the corner. On @CAPS1 eve morning, I slept till @NUM2. I was so eager for @CAPS1 to come. I knew I had to be patient, so I played video games to distract myself from thinking about @CAPS1. When I went to the store later that day, I saw all the @CAPS1 - themed things on the shelves. The colorful decorations and the special treats made me feel like I couldn't wait any longer. That night after dinner, I was torn. A part of me wanted to stay up and soak in the excitement, while another part wanted to go to sleep early to make @CAPS1 come faster. I decided to make some more snacks and then finally went to sleep. When morning came, I was so happy that I practically ran into the living room. Sure enough, there were the presents neatly arranged under the tree. My mom and dad were still sleeping. I decided to watch some TV until @NUM3 came. I really wanted to open the presents right away, but I knew it wouldn't be right. So I waited patiently and went back to sleep for a while. At noon, I woke up and ran to the living room. My mom, dad, and my brother were there. I opened my presents with great enthusiasm, like a lion feasting on a gazelle. I was so happy that I had waited.
289	18161	7	3	When I was patient, I had no fears and no arguments, and I had a really good deal. I had a @CAPS1 that was truly amazing. @CAPS4 was so good that my sister @PERSON1 said, “@CAPS2, can I get some?” I replied, “@CAPS3, you @CAPS2.” @CAPS4 was like a miracle to me. So I was driving her car to the gas - station. On the way, I stopped at @ORGANIZATION1. I said, “@NUM1 @CAPS5, please.” @CAPS4 was a cousin of mine, and she said, “@NUM2 days ago.” I was like, “Wow.” Then @PERSON1 called my phone because it was @CAPS4's daddy's weekend. She said, “Get down there now.” I was really taken aback and thought, “Wow.” In the end, being patient through all this led to some great moments and a good outcome.
290	18162	7	3	A time when I had to be patient was on the drive to @LOCATION1. @CAPS1 took a few hours, so here is @CAPS2 story. We were leaving the house when I suddenly realized I forgot something. I quickly ran inside to get @CAPS2 dog, Penny. [She is a real, lively dog, not a stuffed one.] As soon as I opened the door, @CAPS2 dog bolted out, but I managed to catch her and put her in the truck. We stopped at @CAPS2 grandparents' house to rest for a bit. After that, we travelled through lots of winding and bumpy roads until we finally got to the highway. “@CAPS1's gonna be a long ride,” I said with a sigh. On the highway, we passed so many cars, and then they passed us. For a scary second, we lost our grandparents' car. I looked back and, behind about twelve cars, I found them. We reached @LOCATION3 in about four hours. I knew @CAPS1 was going to be a long trip, so I decided to take a nap. During @CAPS2 nap, @CAPS2 parents, especially @CAPS2 mom, took pictures of me. I thought that @CAPS1 wasn't nice, but it was all in good fun. We now had one more state to go through, and then we'd be in @LOCATION1. That state was @LOCATION2. By the time we reached @LOCATION2, @CAPS1 was already @NUM1. We decided to get a room in a hotel - like place. In the morning, we stopped and had a delicious breakfast. Then we were back on the road again. I had to be patient because we still had a two - hour drive to go. It was the longest five - hour journey I'd ever had, but I was patient, and @CAPS1 went fine. We arrived in @LOCATION1 and had no clue where we were going. So @CAPS2 dad turned on his GPS, and we finally found our way to our cabins. That is a story about a time I had to be patient.
291	18163	7	3	Thereís many times Iíve been patient, especially @CAPS1. This one time, my little sister kept bugging me non - stop. Usually, I might lose my temper, but this time, I didnít scream at her or hit her. She was constantly asking me to turn on the music, and when I firmly said ìnoî, she threw a huge fit. So, I calmly got up, gently picked her up, and in a really nice and kind voice, told her to stop before she got into trouble. To my relief, she stopped. Then, I told her to sit down quietly and watch TV. In closing, that was a time that I was patient with my little sister, by not screaming at her or hitting her when she was disturbing me. I managed to stay calm and didnít become a mean person at that point. Last but not least, that was a clear demonstration of me being a patient person.
292	18164	7	3	Patience for me is when Iím helping others with their problems. So, in this story, Iím going to describe to you what patience truly means. Patience is when you are whole - heartedly willing to sit down and lend a helping ear to someone with their own problems. I have a lot of patience because I sit down all the time and genuinely help people with their problems. One day at my old school, @PERSON1, this girl was having very difficult problems at home. When she came to school, she was sobbing uncontrollably. I immediately went to go ask her what was wrong. She was saying that she didnít want to be at home because her mom didnít let her go anywhere; she always had to stay home and watch her two younger brothers. So, I sat down with her the whole day, making her feel like she finally had someone to talk to in her life. As we sat and talked, she seemed to feel much better and felt like she had found a true friend. In conclusion, I really felt like I had shown patience, and since that day forward, I have continued to sit down and let people tell me about their problems, knowing that a little patience can make a big difference.
293	18165	7	3	There was a time I was patient for a whole day! It was @CAPS1 eve, and it was about @NUM1 in the morning. I had just woken up, and after a refreshing shower, I ate a quick breakfast and brushed my teeth. Usually, by now, I would have probably asked my mom @NUM2 times if I could open one present, but on this day, I hadnít asked her even once yet. I was upstairs, engrossed in playing my PlayStation when my mom called out @CAPS2!!!! I opened my door, and as usual, my cat was right at my door. I quickly shut my door, hopped over my cat, and rushed to the stairs. Then I yelled ìfoodî and hurried down the stairs straight to the center. As I started walking down the stairs, I heard a @CAPS3!! So, I started running down the stairs as fast as I could, knowing my two @NUM3 - year - old brothers were coming. They met @CAPS7 at the counter and asked @CAPS7, ì@CAPS4 many times have you asked to open a present?î ì@CAPS5î I calmly replied. They looked like they had both seen a ghost. After lunch was over, I ran over to my friend's house across the street to play basketball. About an hour later, we finished our game and took a bike ride. We got back about @NUM4 for @CAPS2. About @NUM5 minutes later, I was done watching @CAPS6.V., took a shower, and then went to bed. My mom woke @CAPS7 up at @TIME1, and we headed downstairs. As soon as I saw all the presents, I screamed @CAPS7 @CAPS8!!!! And that was the time when I was patient for a whole day, showing that I could control my eagerness.
294	18166	7	3	ì@CAPS1 @CAPS2î said my little sister @PERSON1, ì@CAPS3 you help me practice kicking a soccer ball? We are doing it in gym, and I @CAPS6ít know how.î ìOf course,î I said, ìlets go to the back yard.î On my way out, I quickly grabbed a ball. I carefully set it down on the ground in front of me and said, ì@CAPS5 you do is step forward with your left foot and kick with the top of your right. ì ìIíll try,î @CAPS8 said doubtfully. @CAPS8 ran up to the ball and kicked, but missed. But that was okay. @CAPS8 tried again, and another miss. @CAPS8 sat down dejectedly on the ground. I walked up to her and gently said, ì@CAPS6ít give up. It's only your second try. Not everyone is good at soccer right away. Try one more time. ì ìOkay, one more try,î @CAPS8 said. @CAPS8 ran up to the ball and kicked. The ball went sailing beautifully into the goal. ì@CAPS9 you for teaching me @CAPS2,î she said happily. ìIt was my pleasure. Just try to be patient with yourself, and youíll be a great soccer player. I promise,î I replied. ìOkay, but I want to practice some more,î she said. ìSure, let's keep practicing,î I said, continuing to help her improve her skills.
295	18167	7	3	Patience is when you are understanding and tolerant. In many aspects of life, success is achieved with patience because some things are truly worth waiting for. @CAPS1 is always a time and a place for everything. Whether it's achieving a long - term goal, building a relationship, or learning a new skill, getting there is achieved with the great virtue of patience. Patience allows us to navigate through life's challenges with grace and perseverance. It helps us make better decisions and build stronger connections. So, in the end, patience is not just a virtue; it's a key to a more fulfilling and successful life.
296	18168	7	3	We had been patient enough on the long - haul plane ride to @ORGANIZATION1. The flight was filled with the usual discomforts, yet we endured. We had also been patient while checking in at the hotel, waiting in the queue as the staff sorted through the paperwork. Now was time for a true test of patience. We sat down at a cozy table in a well - lit restaurant of the hotel. Our friendly waitress came over, took our order for drinks and a delicious - sounding meal, then promptly disappeared. We got our drinks and waited for our meal for @NUM1 minutes, then @NUM2 minutes. @NUM3, @NUM4, @NUM5 minutes passed. After an hour, our stomachs growling, we called her over and politely asked for some bread. Lo and behold, she brings bread! We then ask her where is our food. She promises to bring it out right away with an apologetic smile. We wait until we’ve been waiting for @NUM6 hours. Our patience wearing thin, we call the manager over to complain, and he brings out the food a minute later. After @NUM6 hours of unwavering patience, we finally got our food, and despite the long wait, the meal was quite good.
297	18169	7	3	A time I was patient was when me, my mom, my dad, and my big brother were going to @CAPS1 @CAPS2. We had to quickly pack up our essentials and leave in an hour. I was a bit disorganized, wanting to leave it for a room and tints and all sorts of things, but we managed to get packed up and hit the road. During the long journey, I decided to have my head down and wait for the excitement of @CAPS1 @CAPS2 heading my way. I was dreaming about the amusement park having no lines so I could get on every thrilling ride while being hungry. As I was about to get on a ride in my dream, I felt someone gently shaking me. It was my brother, waking me up. When I gained light, I saw a big old sign that says welcome to @CAPS1 @CAPS2. After all that sleeping, I thought my patience had paid off. But as I thought there are no lines, I was heart - broken. The lines were as long as having to traverse @LOCATION1 itself. Something deep inside me told me it was going to be a long wait. As I grew impatient, I started to draw. Then somebody grabbed me; it was my mom. She said, “Why are you in a mood?” I said, “Because these lines are so long.” She replied, “Just be patient; it will be worth the wait.” That’s what I did. Finally, it was our turn, so I got on the ride, and she was right. Being patient in line was worth the wait, and it was so much fun to get on the ride. The experience taught me that patience truly brings rewards.
298	18170	7	3	It was @DATE1 when my family and I went to Cedar Point. The anticipation in the car was palpable; it was really exciting and fun just thinking about the adventures ahead. The trip was about three or six hours long. I got a bit sleepy on the way and went to sleep. When I woke up, we were at Burger King. I ordered a kids meal for myself, and it was delicious. So, as we got back in the car, I stayed up the rest of the way there. Then I started seeing the colorful water parks and modern - looking hotels; it was really nice. Then I spotted this really tall roller coaster in the distance. I got so excited that I ran towards the line, but alas, they were all long. I had to wait for @NUM1 minutes. When it was my turn in line, I was so happy and excited that when I got my stamp, I ran to the @CAPS1 - @CAPS2 indoor roller coaster. So I had to wait an hour in line, and I got really tired, but I kept moving forward, step by step. When I finally reached the stairs, I got on the ride. I was a bit scared at the same time because it was dark inside. Then we took off, and when it got over, I was dizzy. But I was so eager that I went on another ride and got even dizzier. I also got on this ride that rocks side to side. This is the time I showed patience, and it was all worth it for the amazing fun at Cedar Point.
299	18171	7	3	Waiting in the long line to enter @LOCATION1 @CAPS1, I complained loudly, “@CAPS2! When are we going into the park? I can't wait to have fun!” “Be patient,” my mother hissed back in a low voice. “Being patient is boring!” I complained again. “Yeah,” shouted my sister, “@CAPS4, I'm so bored! It's not fair.” I felt a bit hurt and was about to say more when my @CAPS2 shouted, “@CAPS5! We're almost there!” It seemed like hours passed, but finally, we got to the ticket booth. “Finally!” I exclaimed. We went inside the park. “What should we do first?” I asked. My sister pointed to a ride and yelled, “That one!” She then ran towards the ride, and we followed her. “Come on, let's ride @CAPS12. It looks fun,” said my dad as we walked to the line. “Ugh! More waiting!” I shouted. “This is gonna take forever!” I complained, but deep down, I knew I had to be patient for the fun that awaited.
300	18172	7	3	I showed patience before, and I am about to tell you about that time. Two years ago, I worked at my @CAPS1’s home to earn some money. Working there is tough because he makes you do so much work. I got all of the overgrown grass cut at his farm, cut wood, and did a lot of other odd jobs. After around seven hours of hard work under the hot sun, I asked my @CAPS1 if I could have my money. He hesitated, and when I asked why, he told me that he gave a bunch of money to my uncle for vacation. My heart sunk. I asked him when I was going to get it. He shook his head like he had no idea. Rage filled me, but I tried to hold it in. One week later, I went back to his house to ask again because I really wanted to buy something. He shook his head no. My mind said be patient, but my body was full of impatience. I decided to listen to my mind. Waiting was really tough, but I knew patience was the right thing to do. Patience can bring an opportunity. Three weeks later, he still hasn't gotten me my money. One day, I heard someone knock on my door. I moved over to it. It was my @CAPS1. He came with a huge grin on his face. Suddenly he opened my hand and gave me twenty dollars! “@CAPS1, that’s more than double,” I said, my heart throbbing. “I know but you deserve it,” he replied. I was shocked to hear my @CAPS1 say that. That day I showed patience, and it really did me good to have patience because I made so much more money than I expected. Think about my story the next time you don’t wanna show patience, cause it might just pay off big time.
301	18173	7	3	When I was about nine years old, I came home from school and took my homework with me. I showed one of my older brothers my math homework. He looked at it carefully and then started helping me understand it. He did a couple of answers step - by - step to show me what I had to do because I didn't really know how to solve those math problems. After that, he had to do his own homework, so he told me to start working on mine. So I began to do my homework, and I managed to get all of my questions correct. But there was a really hard question on it. I wanted to ask my older brother for help. But instead, I didn't do that because he was deeply focused on his work. So I took a deep breath and thought hard, and finally, I did it myself. I felt really proud of myself.
302	18174	7	3	"Middleton middle school, I'm one of their students. My name is @CAPS1, I'm new here, and you might think that I'm a boy. Well, if you do, you better listen closely; patience is a virtue. On my first day, I walked into @PERSON1's class. I sat next to a girl with wavy blond hair, sparkling blue eyes, and a warm, genuine smile. ""Hi,"" @CAPS3 said. ""My name's @CAPS4,"" @CAPS3 said in a perky voice. ""Hi,"" I said back. ""I'm @CAPS6, but you can call me @CAPS1."" ""Nice to meet you, uh @CAPS1,"" @CAPS4 replied. ""Let me show you around the school."" ""Great!"" I answered back. @CAPS4 and I became fast friends. But when @CAPS3 introduced me to her friends, they all made fun of me for having a boy's name. @CAPS4 yelled at them, but I said it was okay. @CAPS4 just wouldn't let it go. Finally, I said to her, ""It's okay @CAPS4! Just let me handle this."" ""Really?"" @CAPS3 asked, crossing her arms and tapping her foot the way she did when she couldn't figure something out. ""You just don't have any patience!"" I said, getting a little angry that she couldn't understand. ""Fine, be that way @CAPS1!"" @CAPS3 said, storming out of the room. "" @CAPS4 wait!"" I cried, but I had to run after her. ""Please, you don't get it. You can't keep getting mad at them for making fun of me. I know you're trying to protect me, but it's okay. Have you ever heard of patience before?"" I asked, ready to run if @CAPS3 ran from me. ""I guess you're right,"" @CAPS3 said, looking down at the scuffed floor. Then, I told her everything I knew about handling such situations, and we never had a problem again."
303	18175	7	3	"I was on my way to Tennessee with my @CAPS1, @CAPS2, my younger brother, @PERSON1, and my grandpa and grandma, who I call @LOCATION1 and @ORGANIZATION1. We were driving in two different cars. I was with @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 in @CAPS1's white Mercedes. @PERSON1 was with @ORGANIZATION1 and @LOCATION1 in @LOCATION1's gold minivan. The windows were down in our car, and @CAPS1 and I were smelling burning rubber. We were in front of @LOCATION1. As we slowed down, @LOCATION1 pulled to the side of us and told us to pull over. We pulled over. @CAPS2 got out, took one look, and said, ""We're leaking transmission fluid."" We drove into town with @LOCATION1 following us. We stopped at an auto shop. We were the only people there. The mechanic told us to get everything we needed out of the car. After we cleaned the car out, he pulled the car up onto the lift, and that's when I saw the garage for the first time. It smelled like gas, and everything was greasy and dirty (including the mechanics). ""This is going to ruin our trip,"" I said to @CAPS2. ""We don't know that for sure,"" he replied. It was so hard to sit and be patient. I walked back and forth between the minivan and the garage for about two hours. Some of the other mechanics came, too, but no one could find out what was wrong with our car. @CAPS2 got on the computer they had there and looked up car parts, but it didn't help. The day before we left, @CAPS1 had taken her car to @CAPS10's garage for a tune - up. We weren't sure if that was related. After sitting at the shop for about three hours, I got hungry, and so did everyone else. So we went to a restaurant across the street for lunch. @CAPS2 stayed at the shop for a little while longer than the rest of us. At lunch, @CAPS2 said, ""We're going to have to call Triple A to come pick up our car. We're going to have to go back home!"" I was so upset. After all this waiting, we have to go back home. On the way out of the restaurant, I tripped and landed on my wrist. I sprained my wrist, so we went back across the street. Behind the auto shop was a Walmart, so we stopped there, got a bandage for my wrist, and picked out a book to buy. I got the vampire diaries, @PERSON1 got a Star Wars book. We read them on the way home in @CAPS12's car, and it made the long journey a bit more bearable."
304	18177	7	3	When I went deer hunting with my dad, I tried my best to be patient. Me and my dad set out early in the morning and found a good spot in the woods. I had to be patient by waiting quietly in the cold. The hardest part was not only being quiet but also staying still for a long time. Being patient means waiting for something patiently. I had to be patient because I was waiting for a deer all day. Even though I didn't get a deer that day, I remained quiet, still, and patient throughout the whole hunt. I learned that patience is an important quality in hunting, and I was proud of myself for being able to control my restlessness.
305	18178	7	3	Finally, all those months of waiting are coming to an end! My mother is going to give me a cell phone! Although it was her old one, it will be brand - new to me, and I'll be able to talk to my friends whenever I want. I might not get the services I want right away, but at least I'll have to stop worrying about being late for appointments. Like I said, the waiting is almost over. Okay, so I'm not the most patient person in the world, but this is definitely worth it! You see, I'm going into track, cross - country, and choir. Since I ride the bus home and all of these activities end long after the buses leave, I need someone to pick me up. In order for that to happen, I need a cell phone. My mom said that first, I need to be thirteen. Second, she needs to transfer everything to her new phone. Last of all, I need to prove that I am dedicated, I can keep my grades up, and that I am responsible enough to have one. I turned thirteen in @DATE1, she's transferred everything, I've proved I'm dedicated, I've kept my grades up, now I just have to prove that I am responsible. In order to do that, I've been watching the neighbor's pets while they are away, mowed their lawns carefully, helped babysit their grandchildren with enthusiasm, and I'm working on cleaning the house thoroughly and keeping it clean. So far, I've been able to persuade my dad and grandmother that I'm responsible. Even my brother and half - sister think I should have a cell phone! But my mum still isn't sure. I think that if I can clean half of the house and keep it clean until @CAPS1, she will finally give me her old cell phone. I'll probably have to clean up the mess after @CAPS1 too though. When I get a cell phone, I'll have to continue everything I'm doing now. So, I won't be off the hook or anything, but I will have a little more freedom! I still have a long way to go, but it will all be worth it in the end. I will finally have my own cell phone to keep me connected and safe.
306	18179	7	3	Patience is important. Because if you don't have patience, you won't get that far in life. If you don't have patience, people won't like you at all. And if you don't have patience, you won't be able to fix stuff. Without patience, it becomes hard to achieve goals and build good relationships. So, having patience is truly essential for a fulfilling life.
307	18180	7	3	@CAPS2 story is about the time @CAPS2 mom ran out of gas. @CAPS2 mom was driving down @LOCATION1 @NUM1, steadily driving home. Soon we started running out of gas. The bad thing is, it was raining heavily outside. Then we ran out of gas completely. First she had to get someone to pull over and ask if they had a cell phone. Someone finally did. She asked if they could get gas. Every one said ‚Äú@CAPS1!‚Äù @CAPS2 mom then decided to call @CAPS2 dad and ask him to get gas. He then shows up an hour later with a couple gallons of gas. That was just enough to get @LOCATION1 home. If @CAPS2 mom had @CAPS1 patience she would of gone crazy. In the end, her patience got them through this difficult situation.
308	18181	7	3	One day when I was out camping with my friend @PERSON1 I asked him if we could climb the dunes and he said we would do it later. So I waited hours and hours, feeling quite eager. Then he said after our lunch. Then I asked him after lunch and he said yes. But when I saw the dunes, their steepness made me realize it was a bad idea for me to climb it but I did anyway. After I got to the top, I lost my balance and @CAPS1 stayed there like a dead animal. After five minutes I was good and climbing to the top dune off because after I got up I ran down the dune and when my friend told me to stop I stopped. But I got sand in my coat pocket. Then I hit a rock and did a front flip. Then I fell. When my friend came down we both laughed and @CAPS2 back to our campsite. It was an adventurous but also a lesson - learning experience.
309	18182	7	3	My name is @CAPS1 and Iím writing about a time I had to be patient. It was a nice @DATE1 @TIME1 in @DATE2, specifically the eighteenth, and we were going to drive down to @LOCATION1 for a vacation. We were going to  @CAPS2 land. Everybody was up in the household, busily packing everything into a van that we rented for the trip so everyone would fit into the vehicle. We had packed all things into the car. My mom made us a good breakfast. A hearty meal of sausage, pancakes, bacon, and scrambled eggs. It was delicious. After that we got into the car and we were on the highway. I had fallen asleep an hour into the drive. By now it was ten o'clock at night and I woke back up. My sister was yelling at my brother and then me and my sister got into an argument. My mom told all of us to be quiet and we did but we were all getting on each other's nerves. And I had to be patient for another two days but we got there and I was glad to be there. So overall it was a fun trip till we had to go back. The patience during the journey made the vacation all the more rewarding.
310	18183	7	3	I was on the farm waiting for my dad to get home so I could ride my four - wheeler. Then later that night he called me saying he will be later than I was expecting. He came home three hours later. That meant I had to ride my four - wheeler tomorrow because nobody was home except for my grandma. My dad doesn't want me to ride my four - wheeler when my dad or my uncle @PERSON1 is not there. At that point I was impatient, really looking forward to the ride. The next day my dad called me saying he had to work late again so I could not ride again. I was impatient even more, but then my uncle @PERSON1 showed up and I asked him if I could ride my four - wheeler and he told me I could if my dad said it was @CAPS1. So I called my dad and he said it was @CAPS1 if my uncle @PERSON1 said it was fine with him. Then I could ride my four - wheeler, and I was not impatient anymore. Finally, my patience was rewarded with the chance to ride.
311	18184	7	3	Hunting requires a great deal of patience. When you go hunting, you can't simply go out and immediately get a deer. You've got to watch and wait. Because deer don't come right to you. Deer don't like people, and they can smell you from afar. If you're not patient, you won't get anything. In the end, patience is the key to a successful hunt.
312	18185	7	3	Last year, I had to sell my cow because she was seriously sick. I had been waiting for eight long months to get a new calf. I didn't know where I would get one until I asked my uncle. He dealt with @CAPS1's small cow breed, which normally costs @MONEY2, but he gave me a good deal on her for @MONEY1. It took me eight months to find her. During those eight months, I got really anxious and couldn't sleep well at night. When I finally got her home, I was extremely happy that I had found her when I did. I still worry about her at night because of the cougar that is roaming around the countryside. I hope she stays safe.
313	18186	7	3	Do you ever like waiting in the line at the store? Well, I don't either. Well, I am going to tell you about a time when I was impatient and then patient. Every morning, I have to take the bus to school. I usually get to the bus stop @NUM1 minutes early so I can have a little chat with my mother. One day, I got up too early. I made it to the bus stop really early. @NUM2 minutes later, I got impatient and decided to go back home. By the time I got home, I realized I was going to be late. I hurried to the door, but it was too late; the bus was gone. I should have been more patient. Another day, I was going to a burger place to get a hamburger with bacon, cheese, and a toaster bun. When I got there, there were about @NUM3 people in line, so I decided to wait my turn like a patient person. As I waited, I watched people pay at the cash register. Finally, it was my turn. I ordered my burger, and when I took that first bite, it was definitely worth the wait. In conclusion, you have to be patient in everything you do, whether it's in sports, at school, at home, or even in public. I hope my story made you realize how important it is to be patient.
314	18187	7	3	A time I was patient was on @DATE1 at the @ORGANIZATION1. I was there around @NUM1 in the @TIME1 when we claimed our seats right in front of the stage. We waited about @NUM2 minutes until the first @PERSON1 came on stage. The name of their @PERSON1 was @LOCATION2. Their appearance was quite strange; they looked like a rock @PERSON1. But they were just a regular @PERSON1 that played normal music. They played songs I've never heard of before, but now I hear them more often. The second band was another one I never heard of. I can't remember their names, and their music wasn't really my taste. The next @PERSON1 was one I knew a lot about; their name is the @PERSON1, and they were really great. Their lead singer had a long beard and an afro, which was very funny. Their performance seemed to go by the quickest because I enjoyed them so much. Next was another singer I had heard of. His name was @PERSON2, and he was also amazing. He even made up a song on the spot about @LOCATION1 and didn't stop for like four minutes. Then he was done, and the time was about @NUM3 @CAPS1 at night by then. I was starting to get tired. But right then, I saw the @CAPS2 boys getting ready, and I was really excited. They opened up with a song named @CAPS3. There were strobe lights and regular lights everywhere. The stage that was holding the drum even moved. It did some crazy moves, like a @NUM4 - like spin and a @NUM5 - like flip. It went @NUM2 feet in the air and did all sorts of flips and tricks that you could imagine. Their lead singer @PERSON3 and their drummer even had a drum - off, which was really cool. That performance went on until about @NUM7. It was truly amazing, and I will probably never witness something like that ever again.
315	18189	7	3	Being patient is hard sometimes but easy at other times. Like @CAPS1 for example. I always get up really early on @CAPS1 morning and quietly lay on the couch. The same goes for my brother. We get up around @NUM1 am and turn on the @CAPS1 tree. As soon as the lights come on, our eyes light up because we see all the presents we're going to open. First, we just lay on the couch and stare at them, trying hard to figure out what we got. Then we find another chair and stare at them from a different angle. We keep doing this until we both end up back on the couch again. We get yelled at once or twice to go back to bed, but it's no use because we never do. Then, about @NUM2 am, we start getting really excited. We go into our bedrooms and try to find something to do to keep our minds off the presents, but that never works either. Then we go back on the couch. About @NUM3 am, we go into our kitchen and carefully make coffee for our mom and dad because they say they always need their coffee before we open presents. Then we go and gently wake them up. When they finally crawl out of bed, we rush them to drink their coffee so we can see what we got. Finally, about @NUM4 minutes later, they finish their coffee and let us open our presents. It took such a long time, but it pays off in the end when we see all the wonderful gifts.
316	18190	7	3	"When I was patient, I was sitting in the car while my mom went to get something at the nearby store. I decided to go with her. I showed great patience because I didn't pester her by asking when we were going to go home or complaining that it was so boring. Instead, I tried to just go with the flow. I was there for about an hour, but did I care? No, because I was the one who wanted to come along. If I had complained, then she would have said, ""Why did you come?"" In the end, my mom said that since I had been patient, I could get a chocolate bar. This shows that if you're patient, there might be a reward at the end."
317	18191	7	3	The time when I was very patient was when I had to get my teeth pulled. The whole process took two long hours. They would take a break for about @NUM1 minutes every half - hour. During this time, I had gotten many shots in my mouth. They even had to rip my gum open to take out two teeth, first the ones on top and then my two bottom teeth. I remained patient throughout. The dentists even said I was one of their best kids because of everything I had gone through in my mouth and the long - drawn - out pain. This was the time I got @NUM2 teeth pulled and showed great patience, which shows that patience can help one endure difficult situations.
318	18192	7	3	"When can I drive?"" I whined. ""When the time comes, you have to be patient; otherwise, you won't,"" yelled my @CAPS1 over the loud, heart - warming sound of @CAPS2 starting up for the @NUM1 time that year. I loved that sound; it's my second - favorite sound. The vibrations were rattling my legs as it raced away with @PERSON1 driving skillfully. I could wait until it was my turn. After several rides and @NUM2 minutes passed, @CAPS1 said the words I thought he'd never say, ""@CAPS3, your turn."" I looked at him and then at the truck. Wow, he looked small next to that huge truck. I ran as fast as I could down to the pit. I climbed onto the tire's rim, then to the top of the tire, and finally into the cab. ""@CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6, gaggag @CAPS7. Oh yeah! This felt right. I couldn't go fast, but I almost tipped it over. So that's a good thing. So, all in all, patience comes a long way as it finally got me my chance to drive."
319	18193	7	3	"I don't have much patience, but I'll tell you a story about a time that I did. It was a sunny day outside, and it was @DATE1 after school. I had no homework, so I invited my friends over, and we were planning to go to the landslide skate park. We were all gathered at my home, but @CAPS1 wasn't there. My mom said, ""@CAPS2, if he's not here in two minutes, we have to go without him."" I was really mad then and started writing a note to put on the door. The note read, ""@CAPS1, we had to go without you because you were late! Sorry, be on time next time. - @CAPS4."" Just as I was about to finish signing the note, he pulled up in his car. That was the story of when I showed patience, and it was good that I waited as we all had a great time at the skate park."
320	18194	7	3	One time in @DATE1, I was taking a test called the @ORGANIZATION1 (@CAPS1). My friends and I arrived at the testing venue early. So, we had to be patient. There were a lot of things we could do, but our choices were quite limited. Being patient is hard; sometimes, it feels like ages have gone by, but really only @NUM1 minutes have passed. Sometimes, patience requires a lot of mental peace. One time, my dad and I were going to work in @LOCATION1. The bus was late by @NUM2 minutes, and it felt like a few weeks had passed. Sometimes, patience can be both good and bad. Good patience is when a team is about to score a goal, and the audience is patient enough to let the team execute their play successfully. Bad patience is when you're late to work because of traffic, or the bus is late, and you're just left waiting. Sometimes, you can distract yourself while being patient, like texting, calling a friend, or talking or playing a game with a kid or by yourself. So, you can see that patience can be good or bad and also requires a lot of mental peace, especially during situations like taking the @ORGANIZATION1 test.
321	18195	7	3	When I was around the age @NUM1, I went to @CAPS1 with my grandpa, grandma, mom, and dad for a family reunion. We stopped so many times that I can't even count. I think it was for breaks, but I did not want to stop or be patient because I was eager to get there and see what everything looked like. It seemed like it was going to be a big place. But the bad part was that we had to leave our dog at home for a week. I was impatient to get home too because as soon as I got home, I was going to sleep. We left our house at @TIME1 and reached the motel at @TIME2 am. In the afternoon, I was sick of sitting in the car. I did not want to get back in the car to go home because it's a long way to wait in the car. I was very impatient. If I could have gotten there in half an hour or so, it would have been a lot better than the @NUM2 hours of travel time. However, it was a lot of fun to see new things that I had never seen before on the way there. On the way home, I was just sleeping. I was so bored that at every stop, I would switch cars. At that time, I did not have a tablet, but I did have my @CAPS2 until its battery died. Then I used my iPod and my cell phone. All I could do on them was call and play games. I was so impatient that I'd rather go to the hotel and sleep than sit there listening to the older people talk about what had happened. I hardly knew any of them, so I couldn't tell you who everyone was. In the end, despite the long journey and my impatience, the family reunion was still a memorable experience.
322	18196	7	3	"I was patient this one time while waiting to get on the computers. I told my mom to wake me if she finished using the computer. After an hour, I fell asleep and woke up a little while later. To my surprise, my brother was on the computer for three hours, reading manga that we already had. After just three minutes, my dad kicked me off to check his email. He said he would be off soon, yet he spent the rest of the day and a bit more of the next day watching ""Indearath Star"" for six hours. Considering he spends eight hours connecting to the internet at work, that adds @NUM1 to @NUM2 hours on the internet every day of the year. It was really frustrating to wait so long and then get pushed aside, but I tried to be patient. In the end, I learned that sometimes patience is tested in unexpected ways, but it's still an important quality to have."
323	18197	7	3	There was this guy that I liked a lot. After @NUM1 years and @NUM2 Ω weeks, I finally had the courage to ask him out. He said yes to going to the dance with me but no to going out with me. A little while later, about a week later, I asked him again. He told me to give him till the end of the week. I waited and waited, and it seemed like forever. Then my friend just couldn't take it anymore. She asked him out on @DATE1, and he said yes with a million yeses, and joy came from his mouth. Then on @DATE2, after getting to know me better, he broke up with me. We have been fighting ever since, but we're still besties. Even though things didn't turn out the way I hoped in the relationship, our friendship has endured, and I've learned that patience and friendship are important in different ways.
324	18198	7	3	"Being patient is hard, and not all people are patient, but patience is an important thing to practice. You have to be patient almost everywhere you go, like when waiting in line. You also have to be patient with people, such as those who are learning or whom you are teaching. I was patient in @ORGANIZATION1, which was really difficult. When I was really little, maybe four or five years old, we went to @ORGANIZATION1. My older sister wanted to go on a ride, but I couldn't go because I was too short. So my mom stayed with me while my older sister and my @CAPS1 went on the ride. I was so sad, but my mom told me to wait and not get antsy. After a while, I started asking, ""When is the ride going to be over, mama?"" She kept responding, ""I don't know, whenever @PERSON1 and @CAPS1 get off the ride."" @CAPS2 I couldn't wait any longer, but when my @CAPS1 and sister got off, they told my mom that they wanted to go again. My mom said, ""OK,"" and that's when I got sad. Then she said to me, ""But because you waited so long and nicely, I will take you to get a smoothie."" ""I love smoothies!"" I screamed. Patience is important because, since I was so patient, my mom got me something I love. Patience is a hard thing to do, but once you master it, it's a great quality to have, as it can lead to nice rewards."
325	18200	7	3	"Last year, I went to the doctor for a normal check - up. When she tested my vision and hearing, I also felt the cold instruments. She placed a stethoscope on my chest to see if my heart was @CAPS1.K. After that, she checked my neck. I could feel her icy - cold fingers on my neck. About a minute had passed, and she said she would be right back. Another doctor came in and felt my neck. Finally, my mom asked, ""What's going on here?"" They said the glands in my neck were full and that I needed to have my blood checked to see if I had a thyroid issue, which means the glands in your neck are full and it could lead to having to take pills for the rest of your life. So a few days later, we went to get my blood checked. As we waited, I started to get really nervous. I had butterflies in my stomach really bad. Then @NUM1 minutes passed, which seemed like an hour. They called me in, and I sat down. The nurse said everything would be fine. So I trusted her. She took a rubber tube and tied it around my arm. It sorta hurt, like a pinch. Then @NUM2… @NUM3… @NUM4… and the needle went in. I saw the blood going into the tube. It was really cool. Then we went home. It took a week of sleepless nights because I was so anxious. They called my mom, and it felt like it took about a year (not really). I couldn't tell by her expression. Then she said no, and I was so happy. I was being patient, which was what kept me from running down there and checking the results myself. In the end, patience helped me get through that stressful time, and I'm glad everything turned out okay."
326	18201	7	3	ìWhen do we get the xbox!î I asked @CAPS1. ì@CAPS2 hours,î he replied. ì@CAPS3!î ìyes.î ì@CAPS4.î ì@CAPS4.î @CAPS2 hoursÖ. I thought, this is gonna feel like a week. First, I got on the computer. After ten minutes I got off because nothing was interesting. Next I looked at the t.v guide. Nothing good was on. Why am I so tired! I thought. It must be that I did too much earlier. I was thinking but luckily, I fell asleep. I woke up. Four hours left. Once again I looked at the t.v guide still nothing. I just turned the t.v on. A @PERSON1 just ended. ì@CAPS7 up next on @CAPS8 land is The @PERSON1,î the @CAPS8 commercial said. ì@CAPS10 see this,î I said out loud. It turned out better than I thought. It was a no - color @PERSON1 that was about a police official and his son. After watching four hours of the @PERSON1, I heard the front door open. I heard @CAPS1 come in and say, ì@CAPS12 got it!î I was excited then I said, ì@CAPS14,î and then fell asleep. ì@CAPS15 wake him up.î @CAPS1 whispered. This long wait finally seemed to be over.
327	18202	7	3	One time my brother @PERSON1 was patient. Patience is being understanding and listening through difficulties without complaining. Our family lived in @LOCATION1 and were going to cedar point on vacation. We had fun all day and at @NUM1 we went on @ORGANIZATION1. @PERSON1 went on the blue @ORGANIZATION1 while the rest of the family went on the red. The blue keeps you up at the top for @NUM2 and drops you while the red one shoots you up to @NUM3 feet. The line for the red @ORGANIZATION1 was shorter than the blue one so we got to go on first. Once the ride was over @PERSON1 was already at the top of the blue @ORGANIZATION1. We heard a loud sound that meant the blue @ORGANIZATION1 cart was coming down. But the blue cart wasn't coming down. @PERSON1 was stuck at the top, @NUM4 feet in the air. @PERSON1 got a birdís eye view of the park. I would have been scared if I were @PERSON1. At @NUM5 the ride lights came on and the cart plummeted down. Finally, he got a ride. Each of us on the rides got free season passes to cedar point. This is a time when @PERSON1 needed to show patience, and he did so admirably.
328	18203	7	3	On @DATE1 we went to the dollar tree. I really wanted to go to the game stop, but I knew we had other things to do at the dollar tree first. So, I was patient. After we finished our shopping at the dollar tree, then we went to the game stop. This small act of patience allowed us to complete all our errands smoothly.
329	18205	7	3	In the beginning, I woke up from sleeping and felt really sick. So, I took a shower and put on my clothes. I told my dad ìCan I go to the doctor because I feel sick?î Sadly, he said ìwe will leave @NUM1 amî and it was @NUM2 am. Then, I had to wait on the couch while my brothers, my dad and my mom were taking showers. After that, I wanted to yell and complain because they were going too slow and trying to look presentable. However, I didnít. When they finished they had to look for the keys until they found it. It was @NUM3 am and my dadís favorite music was on the radio, so we stayed and watched the whole song. In the middle, it was @NUM4 am and then we went to the doctor and had to stay waiting for everyone to get their turn until it was @NUM5 which is our turn. We actually made an appointment. They checked what was bothering me and it was nothing. Still, I left and I still waited until my brothers finished. In the end, I was really pissed off because I had to wait for them to get in the car. My dad said ìAre you happy? You said that you feel sick and there is nothing wrong with you.î Then, we went home thinking that I had been patient for the whole day. I was saying to myself ìI learned my lesson and it is if you are patient the day can go fast.î This experience taught me the value of patience in difficult situations.
330	18206	7	3	Over the @DATE1 I went to @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2 to visit my aunt @CAPS1. We got up early and drove to @LOCATION4. It was the first time I was going to go on a plane. My dad said I better have patience or else the ride was going to be boring. Me and my sister got on the plane and flew to @LOCATION3 and it took @NUM1 minutes and that was easy. But then we got on another plane and went directly to @PERSON1 and that took @NUM2 hours. It was a very long ride but I had patience, but my sister didn't have any patience at all. The whole ride she was asking when we were going to get there. And that was the time I had patience, and it made the journey more bearable.
331	18207	7	3	"A time I was patient. My family were going to go camping, so we got packed up and loaded the car. The ride was 3 hours long so I had to be patient. I played my friend's PlayStation for a couple of minutes. It was fun. We left early so we could do some fishing when we got there. Then I tried to relax. I was so tired. But I couldn't with my cousins @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 screaming and yelling. I finally fell asleep. Then we hit a pothole and our car was out of gas. Luckily, we were right in front of a gas station. It took us an hour to get it fixed, so we snacked on a granola bar and we left. Then my cousins got all excited. ""We're almost there!"" I was happy I could put up my tent and go to sleep. I saw our campground and when we got there we had to put everything up. I had to be patient to go to sleep. Then the kids found a pack of cards. They wanted to go play. Their mom wanted me to take them. I was so tired I didn't want to go. But I knew it would be fun for them. So we stayed and played for a while. The park was pretty close to the camp site. We came back as quickly as possible and finally, I set up my tent and went to sleep."
332	18208	7	3	"I was patient when I was going to Cedar Point. We took a bus and it took seven hours. So my friend @PERSON1 decided to watch movies on the tablet. We watched ""Street Dreams"" and ""The Incredibles"". We were still a long way from Cedar Point. We decided to call my mom for a prank call. It was hilarious so we did it again. Then we took turns napping and watching the big open road. Eventually, we both fell asleep. When we woke up we were there. This is the time I waited patiently. Because I waited patiently then I don't mind waiting now. I learned to do something else while waiting. Now I can wait for longer periods. This helped me in my future as I'm more able to handle waiting situations calmly."
333	18209	7	3	I was patient during the MEAP. I was patient because I was done early and a lot of people were not done yet. When I get done early I like to draw or do some of my work but I didn't have any work so I knew then when everyone got done we waited for 10 min then we start the MEAP again. When I got done with that, no one else was done so I waited for 15 or 20 min then everyone was done. Then we stretched and walked around for 5 min then we sat back down and start the part 3. When we are done we get to do work. I am usually the first one done. Then when I get done with the test I get up and walk around so I can get A's and B's on my tests like the MEAP test because it is so important to get good grades and when you are patient you will find out to get good grades like A's and B's, which will open up more opportunities for my future studies.
334	18210	7	3	"On my last trip at Cedar Point I made a horrible mistake. I waited in line for 3 hours on the Mantis. I had to be patient, but it was hard to because the mister fans were having technical difficulties. And how can I be patient when it is 90 degrees outside?! The only good part of the line was the shade. That was the only way I kept my patience. I told myself, ""and in no time you will be there."" But I spoke too soon. Half an hour seemed like 3 hours, but I think the heat was just getting to me. Finally, after 4 hours in line the mist fans started to work. Patience can bring luck. I waited for what seems like only ten minutes but actually was an hour. After I got off the ride, I was relieved. I guess patience in some ways, is the key to success as it allowed me to finally enjoy the ride I had waited so long for."
335	18211	7	3	One day a man named @PERSON1 had a doctor's appointment and overslept. When @PERSON1 got out of bed he saw that he was late for his doctor's appointment. As @PERSON1 got out of bed he rushed into the bathroom to take a quick shower, as if he had time. @PERSON1 noticed it was getting later so he didn't get to wash up or brush his teeth, so he grabbed a piece of gum on the way out the door. @PERSON1 finally got to the doctor's, went inside and saw there were a lot of people in the waiting room. He went to go check his name in and sat down. He started to get frustrated and tired of waiting, so he calmed down and realized the importance of patience. @PERSON1 kept himself busy for two whole hours playing with his phone and many apps he downloaded. @PERSON1 was so busy he didn't realize that he was the last person still waiting. Other people had their check - ups and left and others just left without theirs. Finally, they called @PERSON1 for his appointment. As @PERSON1 was going in he put 2, maybe 3 pieces of gum in his mouth and started talking. @PERSON1 was done, zoomed home, flew into the shower, and brushed his teeth, got back in the bed and went to sleep, happy that the long and tiring day was finally over.
336	18212	7	3	Patience is very difficult for me. Having patience is extremely difficult for me, because I am completely lacking in patience: I cannot wait for things to happen. During school, I am constantly looking at the clock. Most of the time, I just can't wait for class to be over. Sometimes I think I rush things a bit too much. I sincerely wish I was patient, but unfortunately, I'm not. I'm not patient because I keep thinking about what comes after the waiting, and I get overly curious. For example, in class, I get excited for when the day ends. Some day, I hope to improve on my waiting style. However, I don't think that will happen anytime soon, but I'll keep trying.
337	18213	7	3	Patience is very important at my house. My mother always firmly says you have to be able to be patient to succeed in anything. One time I was at home sitting comfortably in front of the computer. I was surfing the web and really enjoying it. My mom loudly yelled across the house for me to come see her. I reluctantly got out of my chair. I slowly walked through the kitchen, then through the hallway and into her bedroom. She said that she had to go to the grocery store to get some groceries. She was wondering if I wanted to go with her. I said no and asked her if she would make me a sandwich. She replied yes and then left. While she was gone I tidied up my room, folded the laundry and watched some interesting television shows. It was about 3 o'clock and she still wasn't home. I was very hungry and beginning to become quite worried about her. I was tempted to call her but then I clearly remembered what she always says: be patient to succeed. About a half an hour after 3 o'clock she got home. She had bought me some lunch meat so I could make a sandwich. While I was eating she told me she was really proud of me on how patient I was while she was gone. I think patience is very important. I also think everyone could use a little more of it in their daily lives.
338	18215	7	3	Patients, in my way of saying, is a person that waits a while if she needed to. The only reason I'm putting this in my own way is because no one is patient in my family. A patient person is someone where if they were stuck in heavy traffic then they'll be able to calmly sit and wait, or if there's a really long wait or a long line. Or they'll be able to patiently wait for something they need. Patients, to me, is just waiting for my turn. It's about waiting if I have to, or if something runs out and they have to wait for it to come and get it. That's what patience means to me in my own simple way, and it's an important quality to have.
339	18217	7	3	I am going to tell you about a time I was impatient. I had been working hard everyday in the summer. I was trying to do the best I could to earn money. I was saving up to buy a three - hundred - dollar bow, a forty - dollar target, forty - dollar broadheads, and other useful hunting accessories. I was finding myself to get more and more impatient every single day. Slowly I was getting really tired of working, bored of constantly saving money, and very tempted to spend it on other things. Finally, after a long time, I saved up enough money. I happily bought my stuff. I practiced all day long with great enthusiasm. Soon I became more accurate with my shots. I was fully ready to go hunting. The first night I was out in the quiet forest, I passed up a doe at eight yards. I haven't had anything close enough to shoot since then, but I'll keep waiting patiently next time.
340	18218	7	3	One time when I was patient was when the flu shot was going around. I had to go to this one particular place to get the flu shots. When we got there we got in line. I had to be patient because the line was really long and it seemed to take forever to get through. We brought chairs, hot cocoa and some things to do to keep us occupied. I had to be patient until I got to the front of the line. The worse part was that most of the time was spent outside and it was Christmas Eve, so I had to be patient in the cold. When we finally got inside the warm building I was so relieved and happy. Then about 2 o'clock we got to the front of the line. I'm glad that I never have to wait in line for three hours to get a flu shot again. It was a tough test of patience, but I'm glad I got through it.
341	18219	7	3	I was patient during my game as it took an extremely long time. This long - drawn - out process got me so frustrated that I pushed my big toy because it was making me mad. Then my mom came up with an idea. She hinted that I lean down on the stilts. With mom's money, she bought me a toy. She took it her way. Now I'm patient. The end. I'm patient to go to lunch. I got @NUM1 big lunch items, so I got @NUM2 items at home to go to lunch. So don't take too long for some guesses. In @NUM3 hours, I'll have lunch. I'm mad as it's @NUM4 until lunch. Now, when is the test? I forgot to ask. After the game is over, it's @NUM5. We go to lunch. It's @NUM6 and we've finally got to lunch. I heard the line. I had to be patient. She made my snack so good that I ate all of it. Then I drank my milk. Then we tried to be patient. After that, my good wishes were fulfilled. I was happier than ever.
342	18220	7	3	One time I demonstrated patience was when I was at basketball practice. It didn't happen until the end of the practice session. No one on the team knew that this unexpected incident was going to happen. It just occurred out of nowhere. I hit the wall hard. I had a serious accident. We were running suicides, a common and intense drill in basketball. I was running at a very high speed and I couldn't stop in time. I went head - first into the brick wall. I didn't panic because I knew I had to stay calm and be patient. I had to wait on a lot of things. First, I had to wait for an ambulance, which took a long time to arrive at the @ORGANIZATION1 gym. Then I had to wait for a doctor to give me stitches, which didn't take long. Lastly, I had to wait for the doctor to give me the discharge papers. This all happened here at @ORGANIZATION1. We were in the gym for our regular basketball practice. It was in the @DATE1, but I can't remember the exact date. I was also in the sixth grade at that time. It happened because I couldn't stop in time while running. When I hit my head, it didn't hurt immediately. When I got my stitches, some parts of my head hurt. When they took the stitches out, it didn't hurt. But I had a massive headache afterwards. I was really glad when everything was finally over and I could go home.
343	18221	7	3	I am a very patient person. An example of my patience is with games. For some games, especially those highly - anticipated new releases, you have to wait weeks, or even months for them to become available. For others, like those that are in long - term development or have complex updates, you might have to wait years. I have experienced this waiting process before. I've patiently anticipated the arrival of new game features and expansions, and it has taught me to be calm and composed while waiting for something I truly enjoy.
344	18222	7	3	I have had to be patient many times in my life. One that I can clearly remember was waiting in a long line for the opening of @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS6 on this @DATE1. The line must have had at least @NUM1 people standing in it. This is one of the largest apple orchards in the area where I lived. It was my first time going, but my sister had gone there before, countless times. She said that it was one of the scariest things she had ever been to. She brought a friend with her, and her name is @PERSON1. The opening was going to be at @TIME1, and it was only @NUM2, yet the line was still growing behind us. My heart was pumping faster and faster with anticipation. I glanced at my watch almost every @NUM3 second. Time seemed to stand still as if it had forgotten to keep ticking. Finally, it was @NUM4. That was when we heard an announcement. Beep! “@CAPS4 ladies and gentlemen! I am sad to announce that we will be opening up @CAPS3 @CAPS6 in @NUM3 more minutes. I'm sorry. Thanks for your cooperation.” click. I heard everyone in the line groan in disappointment. A lot of the people just left, planning to come back tomorrow. Andrew, @PERSON1 and I just sat down on the ground to wait it out. Then finally, we heard one last announcement. Beep! “@CAPS4 once again! Are you ready for some @CAPS3? Then come on in! It's time for @CAPS3 @CAPS9!” That was my story of being patient and finally getting to enter the long - awaited apple orchard.
345	18223	7	3	Waiting for my child was the longest @NUM1 hours of my life. I had been sitting in the waiting room for nearly the whole time. The nurses kept coming to me, giving me updates in an attempt to calm me, but it was to no avail. So I lit out a smoke to ease my nerves. I was extremely worried as I didn't know if my wife, or our baby would live. I wondered if the baby would live a happy life. I just took a puff of smoke, and continued to wait for hours. I sat there, shutting out the rest of the world to shield my own anxious thoughts. I worried if the child would be picked on in the future. I sat, ignoring the nurses' pleading voices as they tried to reassure me. I also thought about whether the child would shut life out. I just sat there, waiting for my newborn child. My long - lasting silence was broken by the sound of a baby crying. I rushed over to my wife's room, my heart pounding. When I entered, I found her holding a beautiful baby girl. “Waited for you long enough,” I said with relief and joy. This experience of waiting taught me the true meaning of patience and the value of new life.
346	18225	7	3	A time that I had patience is when my family went to @CAPS1 Avengers Adventure. We were all inline to go on Shiver Me Timbers, the biggest coaster at the park. “You're in line,” I firmly said to a kid that had cut in front of my friend @PERSON1 and me as we were walking up the ramp to get on the ride. The kid quickly went to the back of the line that just got longer, and the other kids cheered. As we got up to the top of the ramp, the ride suddenly malfunctioned, so we sat there for about an hour. Then, they fixed it, and we got in. I took off my glasses. The ride started. We went up the biggest hill, then smaller and smaller hills! Then a turn, and then the last hill. Excited like a diver going @NUM1 mph, the ride was finally over. That was a time I had patience.
347	18226	7	3	We were driving to @LOCATION1. My uncle lived there, and since he always came to our house, we were going to his new house. I was really excited about going there, but there was one problem—it was over a ten - hour drive. My parents woke me up the morning we were leaving, and I felt extremely tired. I looked at the clock, and it said six thirty a.m. I knew we weren't bringing a lot of food and things, so we went to get packed up and in the van. But it took longer than it seemed it would. My dad said we would leave around seven thirty, but it was an hour more than we planned. We got all packed up and were finally on the road. It was about an hour in when I fell asleep in the back seat. We made a stop an hour and @DATE1, and I woke up. After we got back, my brother and I watched a movie on our portable DVD player. We kept driving there, and I knew it would take a while, but I kept my patience and fell asleep most of the time. When we got there @DATE1, it was great. Their house was up in a mountain. I had fun visiting them. We walked around town, went into stores, and I had a great time seeing my uncle and aunt. This was the time I was patient, and it was all worth it.
348	18227	7	3	A time I was patient was when my family went to @CAPS1.I. Adventures, and we all wanted to go on the Leaver water slide, the biggest water slide there. It had the longest line there, and it made a swirl. My family was at the end of the swirl. It was early morning when we finally got in and went to the Leaver water slide. It was huge, just about @NUM1 feet tall. And we got in line. Only about half an hour had gone by when my mom left. Then another half an hour had gone by when my older brother left. Now it was only my other brother, my sister, my dad, and me left in line. When someone got hurt on the ride, they shut it down for two hours. Finally, they opened up the ride again, and my other brother and sister did not come with us. So now it was only my dad and me left in the line. It was our turn on the ride next when my dad got scared and left. So it was me and an old man who went on the same little float. The old man kept his calm, and I was so happy to finally get on. This experience taught me the value of patience.
349	18228	7	3	Patience is very important; it can truly help you be successful in many things. In school, patience is extremely important because some things just have to wait. For instance, when waiting for your turn to present a project or for the teacher to finish explaining a difficult concept. Being patient in the game of chess or checkers is crucial because while the other person makes his or her move, you can be carefully thinking of what move you will make to counter - attack it. Patience is very important when playing games or doing schoolwork. Patience is also about waiting. For example, everyone is excited on @CAPS1 eve and can't wait till morning, but they have to be patient and wait till morning. Also, on your birthday, you don't know what you'll get, but instead of peeking, you have to be patient and wait to open the presents. Patience is a very helpful skill to have, and it enriches our lives in many ways.
350	18229	7	3	“@CAPS1! Today is the day we get to go to @CAPS2 point,” @CAPS3 @PERSON1 excitedly exclaimed. “Let's go, @PERSON1, let's get this show on the road,” @CAPS5 announced. The family was planning a vacation to go to @CAPS7 point for @DATE1 long, and today was the day they got to go. The family got all of their suitcases and piled them in the car. When everything was properly situated, they took off. “Hey, @CAPS11, how long is this drive gonna take?” @CAPS9, @PERSON1's older sister, asked. “Well, about six hours, sweetie,” @CAPS11 replied. The family lived in @LOCATION1, so they had to drive a long way to get to @LOCATION2. “Oh no, @CAPS11!!! I can't survive six hours in a car!!!” “Come on, @CAPS9, you wanted to come here, you just have to have patience like @CAPS3 @PERSON1 here.” “I guess I'll try to wait.” About three hours in the car, @CAPS9 kept repeatedly asking the question “Are we there yet?” Even though the answer was always “No,” she asked it anyways. @CAPS3 @PERSON1 eventually got really annoyed of this and shouted “Stop it! Just have some patience!” “Okay, okay,” @CAPS9 replied, “I will stop.” After about two more hours, they finally arrived. The parents bought the tickets and asked their children what ride they wanted to go on. They both smiled and said “The @CAPS20.” So they walked up to the line and waited. They just waited and waited some more. After what seemed like four hours waiting in line, @CAPS9 gave up and shouted “I don't want to wait in line anymore! I am leaving!” So the family walked back into the car and drove off. When they got settled, @PERSON1 told @CAPS9, “All it takes is some patience, and you can have some fun.” @CAPS9 didn't respond, but hopefully, she'll learn the importance of patience next time.
351	18230	7	3	One day @PERSON1ís mom, ì@CAPS1î decided to go shopping and @PERSON1 desperately wanted to go. He was excited at the thought of spending time with his mom outside. But his mom kept saying @CAPS2, firmly believing that @PERSON1 might get bored. So @PERSON1 begged and begged, his eyes filled with pleading. Finally, his mom said, ì@CAPS3 but you can't complainî. Then @PERSON1 went shopping with his mom. They drove to the store and soon arrived. Just about @DATE1, @PERSON1, feeling restless, said. ìIím bored. Can we go nowî. His mom @CAPS4 @CAPS2, gently reminding him to just be patient. @PERSON1 then said, ìPatient? You want me to be patient? We've been here for like  @DATE1 hoursî. His mom calmly replied, ìWe have only been here for ten @DATE1. I have @CAPS2 more patience,î said @PERSON1, clearly frustrated. So his mom made a deal with @PERSON1. It was, if you be good for @NUM1 more @DATE1, we will go to the ice cream place. The next @NUM1 @DATE1 were torture for his mom. With every second, @PERSON1 kept saying, ìIím bored. Can we go now? Hurry up.î Finally, @PERSON1 and his mom left. They got in the car and drove right past the ice cream place. @PERSON1 said, ìWait! We passed it.î His mom said, ìI know.î @PERSON1 said, ìWe made a deal, remember.î His mom replied, ìYup, but you broke the deal. So what did you learn?î @PERSON1 said that when you make a deal, sign a contract. His mom said, ì@CAPS2. Patience is a virtue that you need to learn. So that is my story about patience in my own way.
352	18231	7	3	A time when I was patient was when I took the @CAPS1 test in @NUM1 grade. In my class, there were only @NUM2 @NUM1 graders, while the rest were @NUM4. Due to the small number of @NUM1 graders, we tested in the principal's office. That was the day when we had to take the writing part. These writing tests are hard and take a while. When we started, some people rushed as fast as they could to get done, eager to finish and relax. I, on the other hand, took my time to plan what I was going to write about. We had lots of time, so I knew I should use the most of it to make everything good. To do this, I had to be patient with myself. This means that I should look over my answers again and make sure I had them correct. When I was done with the writing section, I carefully went over it to make sure I had everything right. I had plenty of time, so I was able to double - check every detail. When I was done correcting my work, I waited for everyone else to be done as well by reading a book I had brought with me. That was the time when I was patient, and I realized that patience really pays off in such situations.
353	18232	7	3	Patience is everything. Ever hear these words? When you're waiting in line for a test, food at a restaurant, or when you're stuck in traffic, you're annoyed and angry. But then those words come to your mind. ìPatience is everything.î One time, I was waiting in the longest line ever, waiting to see the ordering counter. I was in a rush as I had a class I had to get to in five minutes. My heart was pounding with anxiety. When I could finally see the counter, I saw the employees rushing around, trying frantically to get all the orders done. Then I saw the reason for the hold - up. There was an old man at the front of the line, trying desperately to order. He was looking at the menu with a confused expression. I didn't blame him. With all those choices, he didn't know what to pick. The rest of the line wasn't as patient. ìHurry up,î one person said. ìCome on,î @CAPS1 another. I just waited patiently, thinking that the line wasn't really being fair. I walked up to the old man and suggested a choice for him, and he ordered. Sure, I was @NUM1 minutes late for my class, but I was patient and understanding towards the old man. What comes around goes around, they say. The rest of the day, I felt good about my good deed, and it made me realize that patience and kindness can make a difference.
354	18233	7	3	Are you always or even sometimes patient? If not, you're normal. @CAPS1 - @CAPS1. But everyone on @LOCATION1 should be patient. It will help you in the long run. If you and I were patient, our world would be a little bit easier. For example, if your brother, for an instance, was in your bathroom and you had to use it, you could wait for him to finish. This is saving arguing and it's being patient. I often say things like ìIím patient!î but that would be a lie, because I am far from it. I get impatient easily when things don't go as planned. Not saying it's easy, but we all should try. By being patient, we can avoid unnecessary conflicts and make our daily lives more harmonious.
355	18234	7	3	@PERSON1 was a hamster. One day, @PERSON1 was out of his cage, playing with his owner's sister's hamster, also named @PERSON1. @PERSON1 had just got a brand - new hamster toy. @CAPS5 had a bunch of tubes to climb in, a slide, and a running wheel. It looked really fun. @PERSON1 wished he had one, but his owner didn't have enough money yet. Even when @PERSON1 played in his own simple toy, he still kept looking at @PERSON1's new toy with envy. @CAPS5 was very hard for @PERSON1 to wait, especially when @PERSON1 saw @PERSON1 happily playing in his. This is the story of when @PERSON1 was talking to @PERSON1. ìI really wish I had one of those hamster toys,î said @PERSON1. ìBut my owner doesn't have enough money!î ìDon't worry,î said @PERSON1. ìYou can play in mine until he does. I hear he's almost got enough.î ìOkay, I guess, that's close enough,î replied @PERSON1. A few days later, @PERSON1 got the brand - new toy. It was even better than he had imagined. He exclaimed, ìI guess the wait was worth it!î @CAPS5 was twice as big as @PERSON1's old toy, so they could share. And they both lived happily ever after, enjoying their time together with the new toy.
356	18235	7	3	"I'm not a very patient person, so I'm going to be writing about what patience is. Patience is when you don't complain when you're bored or waiting for something. For example (for your convenience, I'll be writing a story about patience; please take note that this story is completely untrue), I was walking home and saw an elderly woman. She was having trouble with her groceries. I wanted to help her, but all I was thinking about was my cousin who was going to be arriving at my house any moment now. I walked up to the woman and asked if she needed help, and she replied, ""If you could, I live over there."" She pointed to a large tan house. I carried her things to the door. ""There you go,"" I said. ""Would you mind helping me put them away?"" the woman asked. I thought about how my mother never wanted me to go into a stranger's house, but I sort of knew her, so I said that I would help. The woman smiled. I then picked up the bags and said, ""Is your home unlocked?"" ""No, it's not,"" she replied. ""Where are your keys?"" I asked. ""I believe they're lost somewhere in the lawn."" I searched for about a half - hour, then I found them under a bush. I brought the keys to her and said, ""There you go."" She opened the door and I helped her with her groceries. When they were all put away, I said, ""I ought to be going."" ""Not without some way I can repay you,"" said the woman. ""Go find my purse."" I waited and waited; it had to have been an hour. The woman came out of the kitchen with some change. ""It's only change; I couldn't find my wallet,"" she said and gave me the change. I left feeling like a good person because I was patient with the woman. I told my mom about my good deed and my cousin got to stay longer. This was my example of patience. If this ever happens to you, make sure you're patient and know the person."
357	18236	7	3	One day, after coming home from watching a movie, we were stopped by a train at a railroad crossing. There was only one train, or so we thought. After a while, a very large freight train came rumbling along. In the car were my dad and me, and my old stuffed toy sat in the car with us. We sat in the car for at least 15 minutes, but the train showed no signs of ending. But then suddenly, it stopped; the train stopped dead in its tracks. We thought of turning around, but the cars behind us were bumper - to - bumper. In about 5 minutes, the train began slowly starting up again. Soon after 10 minutes, the train finally ended. After the crossing gates went up, we started driving, but another train was coming. So my dad put the pedal to the metal and sped it out of there. We were so patient. In all, we spent 45 minutes, almost an hour, waiting. But we were patient, and that long - awaited drive finally came to an end.
358	18237	7	3	When we drive to a distant place, I have to be patient. When we are in the car, I really have to be patient because it takes 3 hours plus the extra time we spend going to the restroom, going out for lunch, and we even stay for the night. But when we are on the road, it is so monotonous. That is how I need to be patient. I have to bring a car bag to entertain me. It contains a book, a pad of paper, and my dad's laptop also. A big factor is my iPod. Especially, I don't like that my legs get all cramped and uncomfortable. I really hate that feeling. But at the end result, I love the destination. You just have to be patient enough to get there, and the end factor, the place we reach, is the best.
359	18238	7	3	One day at my school, it was lunchtime and I was very hungry. The lunch area was filled with kids. I could hear my stomach growling; I was so hungry. I stood in the lunch line for ten minutes, then I started thinking maybe I could cut in line. But no, I didn't. It felt like an hour had gone by. I was still waiting, trying to be as patient as possible. Then I realized the line was moving quicker and quicker. Until I finally got my food and sat down to eat. I had only five minutes of recess left, but I was just happy to eat. This shows that patience pays off.
360	18239	7	3	"I know someone that was patient. The person was at the doctor's office. She was suffering from a headache and was very impatiently waiting, but being only six years old, she still waited. They can fix the problem of long waits by asking nicely, ""Can I go ahead of you, please?"" That will solve everything in a kind and respectful way. That is what I think is the respectful way to handle such situations when patience is being tested."
361	18240	7	3	"I remember a time when I was six. I was waiting in the walking clinic @CAPS1 for almost @NUM1 hours. So I asked them if they could change the @LOCATION1 channel to @ORGANIZATION1. After @CAPS2 got over, I fell asleep. It seemed like @CAPS2 @CAPS5 lasted forever. I heard them say, ""@CAPS6 salslory."" My mom tried waking me up, but she couldn't until I rolled off the couch seat that they had in the kids' area. I was at the walking clinic @CAPS1 for one reason: my asthma @CAPS2 had been bad @CAPS1 for a while because I'd been sick. When they called me down, my mom said that I was really patient, and the nurse even said I was actually patient to wait that long. So she gave me a lollipop, a small one. After all of that was done, I went home and went to bed. That's the time I was patient @CAPS1 for two hours."
362	18241	7	3	Someone I know who is patient is my mom. My mom is one of the most patient people I know, especially on this certain day. Every once in a while, my brothers, sister, and I are just kind of hard to handle. We were on our way to church when my brother and I started arguing and fighting, for no particular reason. We always bicker and bother each other. My littlest brother and my sister were frequently screaming and shouting at one another for dumb reasons like he stuck his tongue out at me, she pinched me. Then we finally got to church. I guess my mom figured it would stop once we got there, but no. My three - year - old brother @PERSON1 repeatedly ran around and threw things in the church. My oldest brother kept on calling my sister names, and I kept talking with my friends. I know I would not be nearly that patient with anyone. So that is why I think my mom is so patient. After church that afternoon, all she told us to do was behave. And after we realized how patient she was, we just figured on our own that we should listen to her and behave, showing our respect for her patience.
363	18242	7	3	One day at the fair, I was patient. I really wanted to ride the bumper cars. So I got in line. There were about @NUM1 people in front of me, so I knew I had to be patient. I stood there in the line, watching the people having fun on the bumper cars. They let @NUM2 people in at a time, so it took a while for me to get my turn. Then it was my turn. I wanted to go with my friends, so we let some people go in front of us. We waited a bit more. Then after @NUM3 minutes, it was our turn. We excitedly picked our car and had a great deal of fun bumping into each other. That's a time when I was patient, and it made the experience of riding the bumper cars even more enjoyable.
364	18243	7	3	During the @DATE1, my mom broke her wrist while we were riding our bikes down a trail. At the end of the trail, mom turned a corner too fast and flipped over her handlebars. I didn't know she had broken her wrist until she stood up and told me. When she told me, I froze. No one has ever had a broken bone in my family before, so I didn't know what to do. Mom calmly told me we had to walk our bikes to the car, since we got to the trail by car. As we walked our bikes toward the car, mom didn't say anything about how much pain she was in. When we got to the car, I had to put the bikes in the backseat. Now, to those who don't know, bikes are a bit heavy and putting them in the backseat of a car is a bit hard. Also, when your mom has a broken bone and is in a lot of pain, and the bikes won't go in the backseat, the situation can get rather stressful. My mom saw that I was getting upset and told me to calm down and carefully directed me on how to put the bikes in. After that, mom told me to get her glasses that we accidentally left on the trail. I ran as fast as I could to get her glasses, but they were broken by the fall. So I ran all the way back to the car and since we had the same eyesight, I gave her my glasses. My mom needed glasses because since I'm not old enough to drive, she had to drive herself to the emergency room, and she did so without a single complaint. When we got to the emergency room, we had to wait a while before anyone would see us. I was freaking out, but mom was actually telling jokes about how she got hurt doing something healthy like exercise. I admire my mom for her patience and calmness in a situation like that. She didn't once complain or whine about the pain she was in. She didn't yell at me when I was taking a while putting the bikes in the car. While I was pretty much about to hyperventilate right there and then, she was calmly telling me it was okay and helping me move along. It was as if I was the one who got hurt and she was being the mother as always and taking me to the emergency room. I know for a fact that I wouldn't have handled the situation that well if I broke my wrist. I know that I would've been crying and wanting someone to just hurry up and help me. I'm amazed at my mom's understanding and tolerance. I hope I can achieve that too, so I can handle difficult situations with grace like she did.
365	18244	7	3	"One day when I went to the doctors to get shots, my mom said I was very patient. My mom brought me to the doctors so I could get my flu shots, like every other year. When we got in the car to go, I kept saying, ""Do we really have to go?"" Of course, my mom said yes. Once we got there, we had to wait a little bit. My mom had to get the papers, so I just stood there and watched the colorful fish swim around in the tank. Then my mom said, ""Let's go in the waiting room."" After that, she said I had been very patient for waiting, except for in the car when I was whining. So I said thanks and asked, ""When are we going to get in there?"" Then when we finally got in there, I had to be weighed and be asked all these questions. Then the nurse came in and gave me these shots in my left arm. She said, ""You are like almost the only one of our kid patients that has been patient."" And that is the story of when I was patient, and it made the whole doctor visit a bit easier."
366	18245	7	3	"Some people are inherently patient, calmly dealing with various situations. Others are not, easily showing restlessness. Some have short attention spans, finding it hard to focus for long. Patience is a quality of a person who is understanding and tolerant. They can experience difficulties without complaining, remaining composed. Some people have problems sitting still or waiting for something, constantly fidgeting or expressing impatience. They are clearly not patient. There is a well - known saying that goes, ""patience is a virtue."" Many have surely heard of that. Patience is waiting for @NUM1 hours in line to see a movie, quietly standing there and not having to move around. Patience isn't pacing back and forth in annoyance. Being patient when facing problems is indeed a fine trait, as it helps us handle life's challenges more gracefully."
367	18246	7	3	"On I @DATE1, my family decided to take a trip to @ORGANIZATION1. After we got to the airport, we had to wait a long time. So there we are at the bustling airport, about to leave to go to @LOCATION1 when our flight is delayed because an early - morning thunderstorm rolled in unexpectedly. The waiting took forever; every minute seemed like an hour. After half an hour, I asked my mom for some money to get some breakfast, but of course, my mom firmly said, ""No way."" I was about to lose my temper when this guy came over the speaker, ""We will have to delay the flight to @LOCATION2, @LOCATION3 a little longer."" Just then, I remembered that I have a @CAPS5 in my bag and I go to turn it on, only to find it's dead. Then after an hour, the storm stopped and we were finally able to board the plane. From that day, I clearly found out I'm not a patient person, and I realized how important patience is when dealing with unexpected situations."
368	18247	7	3	"This is a story about patience. One day, my friend tells me, ""Hey, did you ever be patient?"" I told him, ""No, I have never in my life been patient."" ""Well, you should,"" he told me seriously. One day, my friend is excitedly telling me that his new game is coming out, but I just start talking over him while he was speaking. I could tell that he did not like it at all. So in class, I am telling everyone that I won him in a race. But I had no patience in me, so I started complaining to him. I said, ""I won,"" and he said, ""You have no patience,"" and the argument kept going on and on. Then my other friend got really annoyed and said, ""Stop it right now! I am sick and tired of this. You have no patience and you lost @NUM1 game!"" ""Ok, sometimes we all have complained in our life! Just stop fighting please."" So the next day, I said to my friend, ""Do you have anything to tell me? I will listen better now."" I learned that I should listen to what people have to say before talking, and that will get our friendship to the next level, making it stronger and more harmonious."
369	18248	7	3	Patience is the key to life, some say. I don't really know if it is or not. Patience is when you are quiet, calmly waiting for things to happen in their own time. It is when you can do hard things without feeling frustration, anger, or sadness, maintaining a steady and positive mindset. When you have patience, you can do things with ease, smoothly handling tasks without difficulties. Patience is about self - respecting, being kind and fair, and not being self - seeking. Patience is showing respect, not disrespect. Patience has no trace of evil, and it does not boast about its achievements. Patience does not lie; instead, it makes things better when they are difficult. It makes it easier to focus and do things more effectively. It helps us to wait for things patiently, which in turn can lead to better outcomes in life.
370	18249	7	3	"When I think of being patient, I think about the time I went to southrend @LOCATION1 for hockey. We were on the road for @NUM1 Ω hours! While we were on the way there, I didn't say one thing about how much longer or anything. Although I was on a crowded bus with all my hockey friends, watching a thrilling hockey movie. When I think of patience, I think of waiting without asking, ""Is it done yet?"" or ""Are we there yet?"" I myself don't have the best patience. When I want to use the computer or to ride the four - wheeler and someone is on those things, I tend to ask, ""When will he be done!"" a lot. Patience grows with you as you develop. As you get older, you will be able to wait longer times without getting stressed out about how everything takes so long. Even this test requires patience, and by learning to be more patient, we can better handle the various waiting periods in our lives."
371	18250	7	3	"It all started on a bitterly cold and snowy @DATE1. There were only two days till @CAPS1! @CAPS1 is my absolute favorite time of the year because you get to see all the lights that are the vivid colors of the rainbows, twinkling and shining everywhere. Also, people are extremely happy around this time of year, with smiles on their faces and holiday cheer in the air. I always become so impatient waiting for @CAPS1 to @CAPS6. This year, I decided I was going to be patient. So, I started being patient by going with my mom to buy a new set of lights for the @CAPS1 tree, and to buy presents for my family. While we were shopping, there were all kinds of people in the store, bustling around and looking for the perfect gifts. And when we got to the checkout line, there were a lot of people patiently waiting in line. My mom gently told me to be patient, and I did my best. When we finally got out of the store, we rushed home to start decorating. I put up the blow - up @LOCATION1, which was taking a very long time as I had to carefully inflate it and secure it in place, but I knew I had to be patient. Finally, it @CAPS6 to making the cookies, which was the best part. We carefully cut the dough into different shapes and put them into the oven. It was taking a long time for them to cook. My mom said to be as patient as I could. And I was patient, and the cookies were eventually all festively topped with sprinkles on them. With everything made and put up, we were ready for @CAPS1. ""Come on @CAPS1,"" I said to myself. I knew I need to be patient or @CAPS1 will never @CAPS6. Finally, @CAPS1 @CAPS10 arrived, and everyone came over and had a delicious dinner with us, and got the presents I bought them. As everyone left, I walked to my room not remembering that it was @CAPS1 @CAPS10. Then when I woke up late, and everyone was waiting for me, I got excited. I realized that I was patient and it paid off."
372	18251	7	3	Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant. I was patient when I went to @LOCATION1 during @CAPS1. When I went to @LOCATION1 @CAPS1, I had to wait in a long line. I didn't have to wait for an extremely long time, but I still had to wait. I didn't like it at first, as I was eager to get in, but I managed to be patient. It was definitely worth the wait. I also had to wait in line for food, and there were a lot of people in line there, chatting and looking forward to their meals. That was worth the wait too, because their food was really good, with great flavors and fresh ingredients. That is how I used my life - skill of patience. Patience is a good life skill to practice as it helps us deal with various situations calmly and enjoy the rewards later.
373	18252	7	3	"One time, my cousin was impatient because she was going to the movie @CAPS1 and a party. @CAPS1, there were a lot of kids at her house, running around and making a bit of a mess. She had to clean up the house before her mom came home. Also, that day, she called our entire family but they didn't pick up. So, she hurried up @CAPS1 and tried to clean before her boyfriend came over. Then she quickly hurried up @CAPS1 to get in the tub, then got out and put the kids @CAPS1 in the tub. She still had to figure out what to clean up. Then she rushed out of the @CAPS1 and left us there while she went to get us something to eat. While she was gone, we started to clean up. Then she called me and said, ""I'm on my way with food."" I said, ""Oh."" Next, her boyfriend came @CAPS1 and he was ready to go. She came back and the house was clean. Then her mom came home. Her mom went in the room and changed her clothes. Her mom said, ""Where are you going?"" She said, ""To the movie and a party."" Her mom said, ""No, you're not. Go clean up the bathroom first."" She got mad and said, ""Moma, I've been patient all day. I'm ready to go."" Finally, she washed it up and then they left, looking forward to the movie and the party."
374	18253	7	3	Patience is when someone is understanding and tolerant. Well, I'm going to tell you about someone who is patient. My friend @PERSON1 is a very patient person. @PERSON1 is understanding because when someone asks her to wait, she listens attentively and patiently waits. For example, when her parents were having an important conversation, and when she was trying to tell them something, they told her to wait because it is rude when you interrupt adults when they're talking. Instead of getting angry or impatient, @PERSON1 quietly waited for her turn. She sat there, maybe looking around the room or thinking about what she wanted to say, but she didn't make a fuss. This shows that @PERSON1 is a very patient person, and it's a great quality to have in daily life.
375	18254	7	3	A time when I was patient was when my birthday was coming. I was so excited and wanted my party to come sooner. But my parents kept saying no, that everything needed to be prepared properly. Finally, @CAPS1 the party came, I got all my presents except the ones from my parents. They said @CAPS1 after everyone left, they would give them to me. But no one left till ten o'clock. So, I was so tired that I fell asleep. When I woke up, no one was up yet. So, I still had to wait. (I really hate waiting.) @CAPS1 when my mum got up, I asked if I could open my presents. She said to wait till your father gets up. @CAPS1 when my dad finally got up (@NUM1), I was so relieved that I finally got to open my presents. The presents were really great, just what I had hoped for. It was definitely worth the wait, and it taught me that patience can lead to nice surprises.
376	18255	7	3	I awoke at the sound of the shrill alarm clock on a sort of groggy morning. It was early, and to my relief, my mom was on time to prepare breakfast. I was in a real hurry to get going. Today was the day that the Xbox @NUM2 came out, and I desperately wanted it. My mom had made a deal with me. If I was patient the whole time when we were running errands, I could get it. As an hour passed, we arrived at the grocery store. I darted inside and quickly grabbed a cart. My mom said again that I have to be patient. So the rest of the time I just quietly followed my mom and never showed any signs of being impatient. After what seemed like hours, we were done, and the next stop was the library. I couldn't do anything there without getting in trouble; I really hated it. But I just sat there on a bench quickly. It was already dark when we finally went to Best Buy to buy the Xbox @NUM2. We went and got it, and I was so incredibly excited! My mom said I deserve it after being so patient all day.
377	18256	7	3	This @DATE1 I went to @LOCATION1. What most people forget is the @NUM1 - hour long plane ride. We were in a group of @NUM2 families, all my friends. When we boarded the plane, we were extremely excited. The seats at the gate were scattered all over. So I sat with my @NUM3 favorite friends on that trip. We were all loaded with electronics and snacks. As we took off, I thought the flight was going to be a breeze, but I thought wrong. At first, it was fine. We talked and played games on our i - pods and such. But after like @NUM2 hours, we started getting itchy and our i - pods died. So then we decided to watch a movie on our in - flight DVD player. The player was starting to run low on battery and the plane's system was acting up. The thing died, and we still had like another @NUM2 hours, and we only got to watch one movie. On the back of each seat, there was a TV, so we forced it on, but it was one of @NUM6 of the malfunctioning ones. We started to get really bored and the flight was getting late. We didn't know what to do; it was hopeless. We had to sit and wait. It was a true test of patience. Finally, we landed at home. It was the longest @NUM3 hours ever. We did nothing. But as soon as we landed, we bolted out of our seats and into the air. The flight was over. We didn't have to be patient any longer.
378	18257	7	3	Patience for me is hard, but this is a time that I was patient. It was the first day of school, and it was the end of the day. At the end of the day, there were volleyball tryouts. I wanted to try out but I didn't have my physical. So while everyone was actively playing volleyball, me and @NUM1 other people were sitting and watching for @NUM2 @DATE1! I wasn't very patient then, but @DATE1 on at the end of the tryouts, my mom came to pick me up, and we went straight from there to the sports center's doctors' office. So I could get my physical done. So me and my mom went in, and she had to sign and carefully fill out paperwork because she didn't make me an appointment. So that took about @NUM3 min. Then we waited, and waited, and waited until @NUM4 and @DATE1. If you add that up, it was this @NUM2 @DATE1 of waiting there with nothing to do. I was patient, but my mom definitely wasn't. So finally, they called me in, and they took my mom to a room to wait while they took my height and weight. Then they took me to the room my mom was in, and we waited for @NUM3 min. Then finally, they gave us the paper/physical, and then we left. Practice ended at @NUM7, and we didn't get home until @NUM8! That is a time I was patient.
379	18258	7	3	Once I was patient. I wanted to go play football with my dad, but he didn't want to. So when he was putting his shoes on, every time I would ask him to come play football, he would take his shoe off. Then I had to wait two and a half hours just for him to get one shoe on. When he was putting on the second shoe, I didn't say anything. So, finally, we went out and played football. That's how I learned that if you use your patience, you will be able to do something you want.
380	18259	7	3	A time when someone showed patience was when my mom found out I wrote on the wall. She was very mad at me. Then my sister said she did it too. My mom showed her patience and calmly listened to what we had to say. Then she said we were in a lot of trouble because we should know better. She said that we still had to clean everything for a week. But she was very patient with us. She didn't yell or lose her temper right away. She gave us a chance to explain. That's how someone that I know showed patience.
381	18260	7	3	Patience @CAPS3 represents a sense of tolerance. Having “the patience” means that you can calmly wait, and it will come to you if you just wait patiently. For example, like when you gobble your food down thinking it's going to be stolen, when really, you could have left it there, and yet it would still be there. Patience @CAPS3 also means knowing that everything @CAPS3 is going to be okay and you have time. Having patience to do something @CAPS3 is to take your time, or go at your own pace believing you will finish. Patience @CAPS3 generally refers to how long you can wait to do something, or even put up with something. Patience could also mean how long you can put up with something, like a bully for instance. He or she makes fun of you again and again. But how long, how much patience do you have before you're just pushed off the edge and you can't take it any more! THAT @CAPS1 @CAPS2 is what patience @CAPS3 is about.
382	18261	7	3	“@CAPS1  @PERSON1, it’s @PERSON3. How are you?” “I’m @CAPS5. What’s up? @CAPS27, I'm calling you to ask if you wanna go to @CAPS2 @CAPS3 with me?” “@CAPS4, yeah!” “I haven’t gone in a long time!” “Hold on, lemme ask.” “@CAPS5.” As I explained to her what @CAPS24 is happening. “@CAPS5, my grandma’s gonna come pick you up.” “@CAPS7, what time?” “@CAPS8, @NUM1 o’clock!” “@CAPS5, see ya @CAPS29! Bye!! ( @CAPS10, come) help us pack the cooler.” “@CAPS5.” (Knock & doorbell rings) I fling it open. “ @CAPS12!” @CAPS13, “I missed you so much.” “@CAPS14!” For @CAPS15 two @NUM2 hours straight we played guitar. We kept going until we both passed out. “@CAPS16, girls, time to get ready.” “ @CAPS17, mom, we're up!” We all got ready and we got on the freeway. @PERSON1 & I took goofy pictures, and @CAPS29 fell asleep. With @CAPS12 sleeping on me, I rubbed my @CAPS19 eyes. “@CAPS20, it was? I lost stopped so we all can tell @PERSON3 we're going to @CAPS2 @CAPS3.” I look at my mum. “Are you kidding me?” “@CAPS23.” “The family’s going.” “The whole family?” “@CAPS26, just @PERSON2, @PERSON4, you & me are going!” “What about @CAPS25?” “@CAPS26, she can't go. She has to work.” “That really does suck, mom.” “I know.” “@CAPS27, when are we going?” “We're leaving @DATE1 and coming back that day.” “We're not staying the night?” “@CAPS23, we can't afford it!” “@CAPS29, how did you get @CAPS2 @CAPS3 tickets?” “I won them on a radio station.” “@CAPS32, @CAPS5.” “@CAPS27, can I bring someone?” “Like who?” “I @CAPS35, maybe @CAPS12. Can I call and ask her if she can come?” “@CAPS37, here!!” As I scroll through my mom’s phone, trying to find “@CAPS38 @CAPS39’s” phone number, I hit the send button and it dials. “@CAPS40?” “@CAPS41, this is @PERSON3. Is @CAPS12 there?” “@CAPS43, one second. (@CAPS44!) (Telephone!)” “@CAPS40.”
383	18262	7	3	The time when I showed patience is when I was having to go down a waterslide. It all started when I was in @LOCATION1. I wanted to go swimming at a place called @ORGANIZATION1. The place was so big that you could fit @NUM1 people in it. The time I was patient was when I was going up the stairs to the slide, and everybody rushed in front of me just to go down @NUM2 slides. So I waited about @NUM3 minutes just to go on the fun slide. The reason it took me so long is because you have to walk up @NUM2 flights of stairs within a certain area. So the second time I went up, I ran up the stairs so I could be the first one. So I did, and I still had to wait because there were still people there from the last time. So I waited my turn. That is the time I showed patience. Through this experience, I learned that patience is key even in small situations like waiting for a waterslide.
384	18263	7	3	When I was patient, I was in line at Cedar Point for the @CAPS1. We got to Cedar Point late, so we went to the end of the line. There was a sign halfway through that said “Your wait will be @NUM1 hour.” So we stood in line for an hour. Finally, we got to the front. I was so excited as I was walking up the stairs. I realized I just waited an hour and @NUM2 minutes to do this, and then I rode it. The ride was really thrilling. This experience taught me that being patient can lead to great rewards, like enjoying an exciting ride at the amusement park.
385	18264	7	3	A Time I was patient was the time @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and I went to the @CAPS3 @NUM1 hours early. As we walked up to the front desk, panting from running because we thought we were late, the @ORGANIZATION2 said, “Are you ok!” I said, “@CAPS4, am I late for the appointment for foyce?” “Wow, you're @NUM1 hours early,” she said. “@CAPS2, you pulled me out of @CAPS1 two favorite hours in school to be @NUM1 hours early!” I said, “Sorry. Would you like me to take you back to school?” “@CAPS6, I'm good.” I said. As we waited in the lobby, I was fine with it because I had the coolest game, the @ORGANIZATION1 ball @CAPS8, better than chichi @NUM4 for @CAPS9.S! I just played that until I got bored of it, then I read some weird adult magazine. By the way, I was only @NUM5 when this happened, and now I'm almost @NUM6. Then the @CAPS3 walked out, and I got @CAPS1 shots. That was the time I was patient the most and the longest. Looking back, I'm proud of myself for being patient during that long wait.
386	18265	7	3	@DATE1 one day, I was at the store with my sister and my mom. There were people pushing carts, running into each other and yelling “get out of my way”. That made me mad, and it made everyone else mad too. But like everyone else, I wasn't yelling at the overwhelmed people. It was almost Christmas, and I could see why everyone was getting so mad. We were all just trying to mind our own business. But for some reason, people's actions just made everyone else angry. So that's when patience came in. After all the chaos, we finally got out of the store and went home. That's why you should have patience in situations like these, as it helps keep calm and deal with difficult circumstances.
387	18266	7	3	One day me and my brother went hunting at @CAPS1 oaks. It was about a one and a half mile walk through the woods. When we got set up, the hunt began. We waited patiently but we didn't see anything. However, we weren't going to give up. So after an hour, we saw a flock of turkeys wandering around like penguins. Their feathers started to lose their vibrant color. And as they walked closer, the males' beards were going side to side like a tree on a windy day. After watching them for about @NUM1 minutes, they probably caught our scent and ran away in a hurry. After that, we thought the deer would not come out, but we were wrong. About @NUM2 minutes later, we saw a deer. And we watched it till it came to shooting range. I was looking around other places and I told my brother that there were deer surrounding us. So he looked and he saw them too, and only one of them was a buck. So we watched them as they came closer like a storm getting closer and closer. So my brother drew back his bow. He held his bow back for over @NUM3 minutes; he almost looked like a statue. And my brother waited for it to turn around because its head was facing the other way. Right when it was in perfect view, he shot. The arrow shot out like a bullet coming out of a gun. The arrow didn't hit it; it went about @NUM4 foot away from the deer. The deer heard the arrow launch and ran off into the forest. We waited to hope that there were any other deer coming but we didn't see any. So my brother and I cleaned up our blind carefully. And we lugged everything back to the car slowly. When we got home, everybody was waiting at the door. But we told them that we didn't get one. So me and my brother ate dinner then my whole family sat down to watch a movie, ending our eventful hunting day.
388	18267	7	3	Patience can really help you in life. Sometimes it's the only thing that can keep us sane in stressful situations. Patience is important. Just like how my dog ran away and I'm waiting for her to come back. Every day, I keep an eye out, hoping to see her familiar figure. Sometimes you'll get in a situation where you're waiting for someone, and there is always only one choice, to wait patiently or lose your temper. In such cases, patience allows us to handle the situation calmly and rationally. So, always remember the power of patience in life.
389	18268	7	3	I like building a house or a puzzle. Because it takes time to do puzzles, it requires dedication, hard work, and patience to complete a house. When building a house, you have to lay each brick carefully and plan every step. Similarly, with a puzzle, you need to find the right pieces and fit them together patiently. If you have no patience, then it is harder to complete when you just get bored of it. But if you persevere and stay patient, you will eventually finish the task and enjoy the sense of accomplishment that comes with it.
390	18269	7	3	My dad is a very patient person. He's well - known to be patient. Here is an example, his camera. He waited a whole @NUM1 years just to get one lens for it. He did research, waited for the right deal, and because he was patient, he was able to get a high - quality lens. My mom is very patient too. She waited a whole month just for a pair of slippers. She waited for the perfect style and size, and because she was patient, she got exactly what she wanted. I'm proud to have such patient parents. Which means that I know they are very responsible and that is what I think patience is all about. It's about waiting for the right thing and being responsible in making decisions, and I hope to learn from them and be patient in my own life.
391	18271	7	3	One time I was patient was when I went to @LOCATION1 with my @CAPS1 + cousin. I had to baby - sit my lively cousin @CAPS2 while his room was being packed up because they were making their way back to @LOCATION2. My cousin can be quite a handful sometimes as he always gets his way, throwing little tantrums if things don't go his way. But I was patient and waited until the trip was underway. I didn't complain until I got home and told my mom. Me and my cousin got into lots of petty fights on that vacation, mostly over small things like what to play or where to go. But I still love him. I had to be very patient with my cousin and even sometimes do what he wanted, but I knew his mom was very proud of me. I remember when we went for a walk to a pond to find alligators. But then @CAPS2 suddenly wanted to go to the park. I knew I had to give in (considering that he's @NUM1 and quite immature). But I just went with the flow and we went to the park. That was a time that I had to be patient, and it taught me the value of understanding and tolerance in difficult situations.
392	18272	7	3	Patients is something not everybody has. In order for someone to be patient, you have to understand and tolerate things that might be very hard. I'm one of those people. Patience is a sort of a gift. It takes time to have patience and you can not always be in a hurry. For example, one time I heard someone talking in my basement. So I quietly went down there to see who was in my house. As I was walking, I heard giggling and excitement. I kept on walking slowly until I heard the voices coming from behind a door. I went to open it and I saw all kinds of beautifully - wrapped gifts and I saw two people, my mom and my dad. They quickly hurried up and closed the door and told me to go up stairs. So I ran up stairs to tell my brothers what I saw. They were all excited and started speculating what the gifts were for. The next day went by and I could not wait until @CAPS2 the next day. So I waited patiently, knowing that good things come to those who wait. This experience further taught me the importance of patience in life.
393	18273	7	3	@PERSON1 wanted a dog. She really did. She had been asking her @CAPS1 for a while now. Every time she would ask her @CAPS1, @CAPS1 would reply “You can’t get a dog until you earn it.” @PERSON1 didn’t know how to earn it. She thought about it for a while and she didn’t really know what her @CAPS1 meant. She figured that her @CAPS1 meant that she needed to show her some responsibility. She looked at the clock and it said @NUM1, almost time for dinner. She thought her @CAPS1 was probably working on it, so she walked into the kitchen and there was her @CAPS1 making dinner. @PERSON1 asked a little louder than normal “what’s for dinner?” The answer was steak & mashed potatoes. That was @PERSON1’s favorite. She nodded and said “can’t help!” “why not?” her @CAPS1 questioned. @PERSON1 asked her what she could do and her @CAPS1 said to get the salt and pepper and put it on the cooking steak. Her @CAPS1 felt pretty happy that @PERSON1 was willing to help out. @PERSON1 did what she could then went upstairs to her room. She was hoping her @CAPS1 would get the message. She ate dinner with her @CAPS1 then she went to bed. The next day she ran down the stairs to find her @CAPS1 sitting on the couch. She said quickly “what are we doing today?” her @CAPS1 answered “I was thinking we could just hang around the house.” @PERSON1 was getting impatient as she wanted a dog and she was trying her best to be good. Then finally she lost it and shouted “are we ever gonna get a dog???” her @CAPS1, surprised by @PERSON1, said “well…” @PERSON1 interrupted “@CAPS1 I really want one and I’ve been trying to show you!” her @CAPS1, still a bit taken aback, answered “well if you were more patient I was gonna say maybe we could go look at some.” @PERSON1 felt bad for yelling and realized things will turn out better if she is patient. Later that day her and her @CAPS1 went out and had a good day, and @PERSON1 learned that patience is indeed a virtue.
394	18275	7	3	The time I was patient was when my sister accidentally dropped my phone in kool - aid. I was going to get a new one, but it was depending on my behavior. That means I had to be extra good and patient. Every day for the rest of that week, I made sure to do my chores on time, be polite to my parents, and not cause any trouble. I still didn't get a new phone, so I asked my sister when she was going to buy it. Well since it was her fault, she offered to buy me a new one. She told me that it was coming and I had to be patient. Another week went by, and I was starting to feel really impatient as I missed having my own phone. But I held back my frustration and didn't let it show. The next day my sister took me into the metro pcs store to pick out a new phone. See, by being patient I finally got a new phone, and that's the time I was patient and learned that patience pays off in the end.
395	18276	7	3	When my brother, my dad and my two cousins got out of the car after the @NUM1 - hour drive from @LOCATION1, we knew we would have a blast. I looked up and saw a spectacular view, with roller coasters galore. I saw all these amazing coasters at Cedar Point, the well - known amusement park. In the car we talked excitedly about the coasters. We mentioned the Maverick, the Millennium Force, @NUM2, @CAPS2, and the Mantis. When I walked in, I knew this was going to be fun. Right as we walked in we saw the @CAPS2, but the line was huge and we decided to go back later. As the day went on we went on almost all of the coasters. As we approached the @CAPS4 we saw at least @NUM3 people in line, so there goes our chance to go on the tallest ride. When we arrived at the @CAPS2 the line was even bigger than at the start of the day. We discussed and decided it's not getting any smaller and decided to go on the ride. About an hour later, a @NUM4 - year - old guy was with his mom. On the back of his shirt was a cool fish, so my cousin asked him what it is. He said it was a tropical fish from @LOCATION3. We ended up talking to them for half an hour until we got on the ride. The ride was amazing and definitely deserved the wait. This is how I was patient and learned that waiting leads up to good things, and this amusement park trip was filled with great memories because of it.
396	18277	7	3	A time I had to be patient was when I went to a @ORGANIZATION1. You have to be very patient, especially when it is all sold out. For instance, when I was waiting in line for a shirt, the line snaked through the venue and was really long, so I had to be patient. This took a great deal of patience because the @ORGANIZATION1 was all sold out, and there were only three booths with @CAPS1 - shirts, so I had to wait my turn. At the @ORGANIZATION1, there were many ways we had to be patient, like finding a parking spot and then making our way to our seats through the crowded aisles. When @ORGANIZATION1 took a @NUM1 - minute break, I went to get a pop. All the lines were long. I was waiting in line for about @NUM2 minutes, waiting to get my pop, my cousin's fries, and a pop for my sister. I finally got everything but then forgot my pop. Luckily, the vendor gave me a new one just in case that wasn't mine. I went back to my seat, drank my pop, and watched the show. Everything takes patience, and when you wait, you get everything you need. This is a time I had to be patient, and it taught me the value of waiting.
397	18278	7	3	Being patient is like a jungle cat hunting its prey. It has to stay perfectly still, blending in with the surrounding foliage, to get its prey. It has to be patient too, as it watches and waits for the right moment. Then, after it gets into the right position, it pauses, carefully gauging the distance and the movement of its target. The cat gets its goal by being patient, slowly and steadily approaching until it can make its decisive move. This shows that patience is a powerful tool, just as it is in our own lives.
398	18279	7	3	A time when I had to be patient was at my dance audition. Every year at @ORGANIZATION1 grove college, I audition to help pay for my classes. I was ready and pumped to go dance. There were about @NUM1 people in the dance room, all looking eager and nervous. I worked very hard during the audition and gave it my all. When I left the audition, I felt hopeful. My teachers told me that we would get a letter in the mail telling us how much scholarship money I got. Every day, I waited at the mailbox, my heart pounding with anticipation, hoping my letter would come. A month had passed, and I still didn't get anything. I started to get worried and thought I wouldn't get anything. One day, when I gave up all hope, a letter came in the mail for me. It said that I only got @MONEY3. I was very upset because my classes cost @MONEY1, and @MONEY3 was not a lot of help. I wanted to quit dance, but it was a talent I had that I wanted to keep doing. So I waited until dance started. My teacher told me that there was a mistake. I actually got a scholarship for @MONEY2. My mom was very happy, and so was I. My teacher apologized for the mix - up and for it taking so long for it to come. I learned a skill that year that was, patience can bring rewards to you, but don't give up because it will turn out alright in the end. I also learned that patience is good to learn at an early age because when I get older, a lot of things will get in my way, and I have to be patient so I can overcome all of them. This experience has made me a more patient and resilient person.
399	18280	7	3	One time I went to the doctors. The doctor said to wait in this room with my brother, sister, and mom. She said another doctor will come in. We sat in that small, stuffy room and waited for three hours. My mom was getting more and more mad as the time passed. They forgot about us. The doctor that was supposed to come in went into the wrong room. The worst part was I had to get three shots, and I hate shots. I was getting more and more anxious as we waited. In conclusion, I learned my mom is not that patient, but I tried to stay calm. After the long wait, when it was finally over, I got ice cream. This showed me that patience always has a reward, even if it's just a small treat after a difficult situation.
400	18281	7	3	"There goes another @NUM1 minutes wasted! I knew I should have got here earlier! Ulg! So many people and so little time! Have you ever had to wait @CAPS1 for food? Three days ago, I thought that I should stop at my locker before going to lunch - @CAPS2 @CAPS3! I slammed my grey - coated locker shut with a loud bang and ran for the cafeteria. I sped past a sea of seventh - graders, all urging to get to lunch as fast as they could. I grabbed a tan plate and waited for my @CAPS8 patty. ""What's the hold - up?"" I thought impatiently. I @CAPS7 reached my destination, where the food was supposed to be! I reached out and - wait, where's the food? The food trays were @CAPS4 @CAPS5! The strong aroma of pizza enticed my senses and made my poor little stomach growl with anger! I angrily paced back and forth, muttering, ""Where is the food?"" @CAPS7, a lunch lady announced that she would have to make @CAPS8 @CAPS9 on a sub bun. I bailed to the other line. I gripped the tongs with disappointment and put chips and cheese on my plate. At least I had some food! I plopped down at my table. Another lunch lady came up to me and gave a soft, squishy, warm @CAPS10 @CAPS11 for @CAPS12! She thanked me for my patience. ""I got a cookie! A warm, delicious, @CAPS11,"" I thought. Sometimes waiting can get irritating, but sometimes you @MONTH1 get rewarded, like getting a yummy cookie after a long wait for food."
401	18282	7	3	A time when I was patient was when I had to wait in the waiting room before getting treatment for my broken foot. I was sitting there, waiting for about an hour and a half. It was really boring as everybody seemed to get to go in front of us. Sometimes it is hard to be patient, and my mom and I just sat quietly on the chairs for that long hour and a half. Finally, the nurse said “@CAPS1 @CAPS2”, so I got up and went in. Then we had to wait for the doctor to come in, and that took like a good twenty minutes. All the doctor wanted to know was how I broke my foot. So then we had to wait for the nurse to come back in and put a cast on. And that also took a long time because first they have to carefully put like five layers of cloth on it, then they put like two layers of the cast material on, and then I had to patiently wait for it to dry. So having patience can be hard sometimes, but everybody can learn to have patience and get through such situations.
402	18283	7	3	One day not @CAPS1 very long ago, my brother @PERSON1, had some serious homework troubles. And yes, @CAPS2 is indeed a story about patience. My brother comes home with homework every night, mostly math. One day he came to me looking really frustrated and said he needed help. I asked “on what?”. @CAPS1 he replied “@CAPS2 math homework, it's just too long and I can't do it”. Well, my brother is in fifth grade, and the homework was only fifteen problems long! I told him just to start doing the homework. Around two minutes later, comes another whiny “I need help”. @CAPS1 I decided to help him. It took a lot of patience as I sat there with him for an hour while he worked on it. I checked over his work while he and my mom had a bit of a heated fight. Oh, and @PERSON1 took a shower too. It turned out he got um: one, two, three, no, only two answers right. While I patiently waited for him to get out of the shower, I got a separate piece of paper, carefully copied down the problems, answered them, and got them all right. When @PERSON1 got out of the shower, I hid the answer sheet. He got really mad when I told him that he only got two right. Though with my patient skills, I calmly helped him understand the mistakes and how to solve the problems correctly. At student - led conferences, I was happy to see that he got an A. What a happy ending for a patient - filled paper, showing that patience can truly lead to positive results.
403	18284	7	3	Patience is a lot of things. Patience is used every day in various aspects of our lives. You can be waiting for a check to arrive in the mail, or you could be waiting for a letter from a friend. Sometimes patience can work fast, like when you quickly get the thing you're waiting for, or it can be slow, when you have to wait for a long time. Patience can be used in school, for example, when you're waiting for your turn to present in class, or even in a job, like when you're waiting for a project to get approved. If you wait patiently, good things can happen to you. For a test, you can use patience by waiting a little longer to think about an answer to a question instead of rushing through and not getting it right. Patience can be used in @CAPS1 in experiments, where you have to wait for the results to show up. @CAPS2 could also be used in math to carefully find an answer step by step. When you are building a model, you have to use patience so that it is right. Without patience, the model will likely turn out wrong. That is what patience means to me, and everyone has to use it as it is an important part of our daily life.
404	18285	7	3	Patience is a very important value. To succeed, you definitely need patience. I have used patience in my life when I got my first horse. I needed a great deal of patience with her because she was stubborn, self - centered, and poorly trained. I had to teach her moves at a very slow pace, repeating each movement several times so she could remember how she was supposed to do it. I also needed patience for her because she had just moved to the present home and didn't recognize the surroundings. She was very skittish and nervous at first. I had to take my time to let her get used to the new place. These though, are only some of the ways patience has appeared in my life. Through this experience, I learned that with patience, we can overcome many challenges and build a good relationship with others, whether they are animals or humans.
405	18286	7	3	Sixty nine days ago, @CAPS1 - three miners in Chile got unexpectedly stuck underground. They were stuck a half mile away from the surface, in a dark and dangerous situation. Now, they are safe and sound at home with their families. However, the question is how are they still alive today? The answer is patience. What is it you ask? Patience is a person or people that are understanding and tolerant. When the miners got stuck, they didn't panic or start blaming each other. Instead, they calmly waited till someone could help them. Then @DATE2, after they had been found, the miners were told that they would get out of the hole around @DATE3. Even though @DATE3 was four months away, none of the miners complained or yelled. They all understood the extreme difficulty of getting them out safely. Thankfully on @DATE1, all the miners came out safely one by one. This all took a great deal of patience in order to work out. It took @NUM1 and a half hours to carefully rescue all @CAPS1 - three miners. This shows that patience can be the key to survival and getting through the most difficult situations.
406	18287	7	3	On our way to @CAPS1 point! I'm screaming in my head. It's so crazy! We just took off from Lake Erie. I can see it! It was right there, just a short walking distance away. Oh my gosh, the parking lot we pulled up in led all the way to the stamp station. We got our stamps and then walked up to the medal bars. We stopped, and the security guard said “no”. We found out it only opens at ten, so we waited and waited and waited. More and more people came, and soon it got really crowded. Me and my cousins @PERSON1 and @CAPS2 all went to go play phase title, and we had to wait in line for that too. Finally, @NUM1 time to get into the park. We all crowded up to the fence and squeezed ourselves in. We went and got in line for the Raptor for @NUM2 min. Man, what a long line, but hey, it was so worth it. And yes, patience helps “a lot”. It was a great experience overall, and waiting patiently made it even more rewarding.
407	18288	7	3	It was @DATE1, @NUM1, my brother's birthday. He turned @NUM2, and he was really making me mad because he kept asking my mom for stuff, and she kept saying she didn't have it. Then he would ask my other brother, saying things like “you know I got this money for my baby”. So he would keep pestering people, and it was really getting on my nerves because when somebody says they don't have it, they really don't have it. I didn't say a word; I was quiet because it was his birthday. I know how to be patient when it's something important or special. So I just watched him keep asking and asking. Then I finally said, “Here, you can have my money. It is your birthday, so here you go.” I gave him what he was so angry and insistent about asking for. I had patience because I didn't lash out at him because it was his birthday, and I gave him what he wanted. In the end, seeing his happy face made it all worth it, and I'm glad I was patient.
408	18289	7	3	A time when I was patient. The day I was patient, I had an asthma attack. I was very scared, and to make matters worse, my inhaler was broken. That's definitely not good. So my mom rushed @CAPS2 to the doctors. The doctor gave @CAPS2 a breathing machine, and then I started to feel fine. @CAPS1 gave @CAPS2 a prescription and said, “Use this whenever you feel like you can't breathe again.” I said, “ok”. @CAPS2 and my mom went to @ORGANIZATION1 and dropped off the prescription. We said we would come back in one hour. I went home and fell asleep. Then my mom woke @CAPS2 up and said we had to go pick it up. So we went to @ORGANIZATION1, and they said, “Hold on one moment please.” “Ok,” said my mom. We sat in the car for another hour, waiting and waiting. I was very patient, but my two little sisters were crying because they wanted to go home. That day, my mom was impatient (which is not good), so she was mad. The worker finally said, “@CAPS3, you go. Sorry for the wait.” My mom paid and we left. That day, I was very patient, and it showed me that staying calm in difficult situations can lead to a better outcome.
409	18290	7	3	A time I was patient was when my family and I went to West Virginia. We had to wake up early to get on the road so we wouldn't have to deal with traffic. So we were on the road, and when we got there, they had a nice house. But we had to wait in a long line just to get into a restaurant. And it took them @NUM1 just to get us seated. During the wait, we tried to stay calm and make the most of the situation. Finally, we had a happy dinner. That was a time when I was patient, and it taught me that waiting can lead to enjoyable experiences.
410	18291	7	3	What is patience? Patience is the act of being understanding, tolerating, and experiencing difficulties without complaining. I am going to tell you a little story of what every parent has to go through that requires a lot of patience. My baby brother, @PERSON1, was born @DATE1. Since birth, my mother has dreaded the day of potty training, which she knew would be coming soon. As you know, the price of diapers and pull - ups has gotten pretty expensive. So when @PERSON1 turned @NUM1 years old, we started potty training. Potty training requires a lot of patience because sometimes the child may not go to the potty and may go on themselves. My mom knows this, but she still gets pretty mad when @PERSON1 decides to use the bathroom on himself. At other times, mom becomes very patient because she knows this is all new to him and that he is still a small child. My mom is still working on being patient, but she knows that soon @PERSON1 will be old enough to use the bathroom or the toilet by himself without wearing a pull - up. Many good things can come out of just being patient, like a well - trained child and a more harmonious family environment.
411	18292	7	3	Two years ago my dad had surgery on his leg because he broke it at work while lifting heavy equipment. I had to sit in a waiting room for almost ten hours in a very uncomfortable wooden chair with nothing to do but stare at the blank walls. Every two hours my mom, grandma, grandpa and I would walk out to the car to stretch our tired legs and get some fresh air. After about four hours I got really tired, but didn't fall asleep as I was too worried about my dad. That was the longest I've sat in one place my entire life. At first it was hard to believe it was nine and a half hours as it only seemed like two. Finally, the doctor came out and told us the surgery was successful, and that was a huge relief.
412	18293	7	3	I am patient in a lot of stuff, like when I play board games I am patient. I wait for my turn calmly and don't get annoyed. When I take a test I am patient too. I read each question carefully and don't rush through. I am almost patient in everything. Lots of people are patient too. Some people are not patient at all. Just like some of my friends when we play soccer they're not patient. They just want to take the ball and score without thinking about the team play. One time I was playing at the park with my friends, we were playing soccer and my friend told me to pass the ball right away. He was not patient at all that day. In the end, our impatience led to us losing the game, which shows the importance of patience.
413	18294	7	3	"Patience is the key to tolerating trouble, problems, and helps you to not make tragic mistakes. You need to be patient when you even face a challenge in your life, whether it's a small daily task or a major life event. Without patience, nothing would stop you from rushing into a situation with an unfocused mindset. If you try to deal with something without the necessary amount of patience, you're quite likely to make a crucial mistake and/or degrade your chances of succeeding and reaching your goal(s). In situations such as sports games, arguments, disasters, and many other occurrences, patience will indeed come in handy. When playing sports, being patient will be helpful when you're waiting to get playing time, when your team is behind, and when your teammates aren't doing their correct jobs and responsibilities on the team. Having patience, overall, will most likely help your team execute smoothly, and by respecting and sharing your opinion as well. Ultimately, this will help you sort out the situation a little more smoothly. During a disaster such as a house - fire or when dealing with tornado damage, being patient allows you to sort out all the things that you've lost, and you're able to think clearly about what has just happened. I've experienced a house fire so I know that being patient is a great way to handle and live through such a situation. Overall, I guess what I'm trying to say is that when you're patient you experience difficulties without complaining. Right now, you may not think that this applies to you, but honestly, I can guarantee you that life isn't a ""bundle of roses"" all the time, so sooner or later, you're going to need to use patience. Waiting carefully for things to happen usually isn't human nature but it's indeed a necessity in everyday life. So we all need to recognize the fast - paced importance of patience, so we all can live better lives. We don't need to rush to learn this trait, but we simply need to learn it patiently, and it will surely bring positive changes to our lives."
414	18295	7	3	One day we were in a line at Cedar Point for the Speed Racer. The line was so long that it snaked around multiple times. We had to wait for what seemed like forever under the hot sun. I was losing my patience so my dad told me to go get something to drink and come back to the same spot. I was standing in line waiting for my drink when someone cut in front of me. When I got back to the line, security thought I had cut in and took us back to the end of the line. We were mad and my dad was losing his patience too. We waited for hours till it was finally our turn. We waited that long and the ride was like a couple minutes long. It was such a letdown. We said we will never go back to that ride. That was a time I lost my patience, and it taught me that sometimes waiting in long lines isn't worth it.
415	18296	7	3	The time I was patient with my little brothers! I was baby - sitting them and they wouldn't listen to me or my other sister. They were running around the house, making a mess, and not following any of the rules. I just relaxed and got on the floor and played with them. We played with their toy cars and built block towers. After that, all went well. They became calmer and more cooperative. It was a great reminder that patience can solve a lot of problems when dealing with kids. By being patient, I was able to turn a chaotic situation into a fun and peaceful one.
416	18297	7	3	"Do you ever feel like your head is going to explode? Do you ever want to say something but don't because what you said will make things worse than they are? Well, that's how I felt in this story! Little brothers and sisters make me so mad that I want to explode. The story starts at 5 pm. My brother at the store just got off work and has been complaining how he is sick of walking home by himself. So I was going to surprise him by walking home with him. I just passed the high school and I heard my name being called. So I looked around and I heard my name being called again. The voice kept being called, so I stopped. My sister, Lily, and my friend, Savannah, came up from behind me and stopped. Lily said, ""I didn't want you to walk to get your brother by yourself."" So we kept walking and Savannah and I kept switching on the scooter. The scooter got slower, and slower, and slower because two people were riding. We stopped and pressed the power reset button and began to go again. Then we called my brother and said we didn't see him and it was already 6. He said he's at his friend's house and my mom was coming to get him. We turned around and two minutes later the scooter died. We kept holding the power reset button, but nothing happened. So I ran home to get the bike. There was sweat running down my face and I was breathing non - stop. My legs were numb. Soon as I got to the house, my legs collapsed. I got up and put shorts on, grabbed the bike and ran out the door. Lily and Savannah were already at the party store. Savannah questioned me and asked, ""Why did it take you so long?"" I told her what happened as Lily pushed the bike and Savannah rode on the handlebars. In my head, I was thinking about how long it took me to get there and now I was mad. They came and how I thought I was going to explode because the scooter died. We put the bike and scooter away and walked in the door and dropped. The lesson learned is don't do something unless you're for sure it's happening. I learned that the hard way and I'm never going to do it again."
417	18298	7	3	When my family went to Makiew, we had to wait to get on the boat. We were patient because we knew we had to wait to get on the boat. We had to wait at least 30 minutes for the boat. My little brother didn't start being an obnoxious 5 - year - old; he just waited quietly in line. When we got there, we rode around the island on a bike. Then we did what he wanted to do. While we did that, I was patient. Overall, I think that the trip went pretty good because everybody was patient. This experience showed me that patience can make a trip more enjoyable.
418	18300	7	3	I have to be very patient for a while because my sister is going to have her sweet 16 in June 15th. So it's kinda hard for me to be patient about that because my mom and my sister are planning so much at one time. It gets hard for me to relax while they go out and get stuff for the party. And on top of that, we are taking a trip to Hawaii before her birthday. So we have a lot of planning to do in a month and a half. It's very hard. She has to be patient while watching my mom plan a party and still be able to go on the trip to Hawaii with my family. All my life, I have struggled with being patient, but it's really a challenge to try to be patient during this busy time. However, I know that if I stay patient, everything will turn out well for my sister's special occasion.
419	18301	7	3	My story about patience is when my sister was at the doctors. It was a long day. At first, we went in and it took an hour just for her to get in. And she finally did get in and I was just sitting in the waiting room. I would see people come in and then go out. I saw about 10 people do that. I sat and read magazines while I was waiting. She finally came out. When she came out, the day was pretty much over with then. And that was a very patient day. This experience taught me that patience is needed in situations where we have no control over the waiting time, and it can make the situation more bearable.
420	18302	7	3	"One day when the PlayStation 5 came out, I wanted it so bad. So I asked my mom and she said maybe for Christmas. And guess what? Christmas was coming up. It was December 1st and I couldn't wait. So I went to school and I got through each day. I kept coming to my mom and saying, ""I'm for sure that I will get a PlayStation 5 just like mom."" And that's about the hundredth time I said that to her. She said, ""You have to be patient or I will probably never even get it for you because you have a little brother around and if he hears you saying I want this and that, he's going to think Santa is not real. So be patient."" Well, for the past few days, I started being patient. I had to be patient for a while because it was only December 10th. I went to school and of course it was boring and a waste of time, but I didn't care because I was about to get a PlayStation 5. So I just had to deal with it and be patient at the same time. Well, I know one thing. I am lucky for not asking for a PlayStation 5 for the past few days. I'm being patient. I really can't believe it. I really never been patient anytime except for now when I'm getting something awesome. So now I have only 5 more days until Christmas. So I'm really excited. So I was on a Christmas break on the last 5 days until Christmas. So I played video games to pass the time of being patient. Then the last 2 days, I've been playing outside so that was not a waste of time. Then there were only 2 more days until Christmas and I just played outside until the day was over. On those last two days, I even played outside with my friends on Christmas Eve. Then the day came, Christmas finally. I saw my presents and my mom said, ""Yeah, open them."" I started to see them and once I opened all my presents, I did not see the PlayStation 5, until my mom gave me one present that she was holding and it was the PlayStation 5. Finally, I got it. So now I don't have to be patient anymore. This experience has taught me that patience can lead to great rewards."
421	18303	7	3	@NUM1 @CAPS1 ago, a young kid named @CAPS2 was facing a troublesome problem. This problem was something he deeply wished to keep hidden to himself. He felt as if this problem was going to completely overwhelm him. His problem was that he had to go to the dentist!!! @CAPS2 absolutely hated the fact that they drill into your teeth. He also detested the distinct smell of the dentist office. @CAPS2 had to go in three days, and he was even more scared because he was going by himself this time. He then realized that he couldn't act like such a baby, so he decided to be patient. He patiently waited through the whole two days, and then the day arrived. He woke up early, hopped on his bike, and rode it down to the dentist's. Then he waited a short while before he had to go back to the room where the dentist gives you your check - up. He decided to close his eyes tightly and be patient. After it was over, he went home and felt relieved that patience had seen him through.
422	18304	7	3	Do you know anybody who was and still is patient? In fact, everyone was and most likely still is patient to some extent. Some people learn how to have good patience by observing and learning from an elder or some role model. Being patient can sometimes be an absolute pain! You have to know how to maintain a good attitude even when you are in a very bad mood. Having patience is a great virtue because you will surely be good with kids of all ages. You'll also work very well with moody people. Patience also has to do with listening and respect. You might have a child who doesn't listen very well, so you have to have some patience with them so that they start to listen. If someone doesn't have very good respect for people, it will take patience to work with them so that they can develop good respect! In summary, patience is an essential element in life.
423	18305	7	3	I remember when I was at Luck of Steak House and the lady at the front desk said we had to wait a half - hour before we could sit down. I thought I was going to lose my mind, but my mom calmly said to be patient. So, with about twenty minutes left, I was on the verge of screaming, but I sat firmly on my chair, waiting silently without saying a word. I waited extremely impatiently, my mind in a whirl. With ten minutes left, I was about to explode. I was so hungry and wanted to eat right away, but I still didn't do anything. I didn't even talk or go to the bathroom. @NUM1 minutes left and I was starting to calm down, almost ready to eat. I still didn't say anything or do anything. Finally, we were able to be seated and I was so happy. Then we ordered, and just a few minutes later, our food came out. That was the most patient I have ever been in my life.
424	18306	7	3	Patience is hard. For example, when you walk into a @CAPS1’s office, you must patiently wait your turn to see the @CAPS1. Patience is just another word for “wait”. You have to simply wait to see the @CAPS1. But instead, most people impatiently say “Can't you patiently wait to see the @CAPS1?” In reality, many people struggle with patience. Many people cannot patiently wait to see a @CAPS1. Another example is “@CAPS3”. When families go on a road trip, you often hear @CAPS3 say “Mom, when are we gonna get there?” and that shows a complete lack of patience. That is my weakness too. So, if someone came up to me and said “What is patience?”, I would say “wait”. Wait your turn, wait for the dos, wait for the @CAPS1, and wait for us to get there. Patience is all about waiting calmly in various situations.
425	18307	7	3	A time when I was patient was when I went to the doctors. When I went to the doctors for a check - up, my appointment was scheduled at @TIME1, but we didn't get called until @NUM1. I had to sit in the waiting room for a long time! Finally, when we got into the doctor's room, the nurse took my blood pressure, and then I had to wait another @NUM2 mins for the actual doctor. By the time the doctor actually came in, it was about @NUM3. I got my flu shot and the swine flu shot. When I was all done, it was @NUM4. I was so tired and ready to go home. That's a time when I showed great patience by waiting through all those long intervals at the doctor's office.
426	18308	7	3	"Some people are completely patient. Some people aren't patient at all. But me; I sort of find myself stuck somewhere in the middle. When I hear the word ""patience"", I immediately think of a few things. I think of my cousin @CAPS1 because she's not all that patient. She often gets frustrated easily when things don't go her way. I think of my mom because she tries to be really patient, always calming down in difficult situations. But I mostly think about me. You see, I can be the most patient person in the world, like when I'm building a complex model. But other times, I have no patience at all, such as when I'm waiting in a long queue. I try my hardest to be patient. If it's @CAPS2 @CAPS3, or @CAPS2 I try to be patient. When it's my birthday and I'm waiting for the presents, I try to be patient. When we're going somewhere special, like a theme park, or I'm trying to do my homework and can't solve a problem, I try to be patient too! It's like a @PERCENT1 chance that I will be patient. I think the main reason I can't always be patient is that sometimes I can get irritated very quickly. I guess I just sort of lose my cool. Even though I can lose my cool very easily, I can still be patient at times. When I'm cooking dinner, I can be patient, even though I'm super hungry and the food is taking too long to cook. I think for some people, patience is something you're a natural with, like singing or dancing. But for other people it doesn't come at all. Overall, I think patience is something that everyone should have a little bit of. If you have no patience at all, that means you won't have patience in school. You won't be patient with your boss when you get a job. Don't get me wrong, I know sometimes it might be hard to be patient. Adults and kids/teenagers aren't always patient either. I think we should just try to be as patient as we can, all the time! This way, we can handle various situations better and have more harmonious relationships."
427	18309	7	3	"Patience is not fun but is sometimes necessary. I'm going to tell you how patience is not fun. It was a calm day at school. The sun was shining through the classroom windows, and I was sitting at my desk, waiting for the bell to ring. My friend @CAPS1 was going to finally give me an answer to my question. The question was ""Do you love me?"" I couldn't stop thinking about it. My mind kept wandering, imagining different responses. Ring! Ring! Ring! Finally, I could see @CAPS1. As excited as I was, I rushed out the door. My heart was pounding in my chest. I went to his locker, and he gave me a note. My hands were a bit shaky as I read it. It said ""Possibly maybe I like you."" I was so happy that a big smile spread across my face. Patience is not fun, but I got an answer to my question. Next time you have to be patient, just think good things come to those who wait. So, even though patience can be tough, it's often worth it in the end."
428	18310	7	3	At some point in life, you have to be patient. If you are in a line at the grocery store, waiting to pay for your items, you need to be patient. You have to be patient when waiting for a share to park your car in a crowded parking lot. You have to be patient if something is coming in the middle of an event and you can't wait to see what it is, or you know what it is and you just can't run to get it. When you go to the store and you see something you want, like a shiny new toy, and your mom or dad says they will get it for you for your birthday, then you can't wait for your birthday. Well, I have been there. I love Christmas because you get almost everything you want. When you're about to do something you have been wanting to do forever, like going on a long - awaited vacation, and you're going there for the first time. All of these things require you to be patient. Patience helps us deal with these situations gracefully and makes the eventual reward even more satisfying.
429	18311	7	3	This is the story of a boy who became a prince, and a girl who needed one. This is a story of love, of course. Usually those kinds of stories are. My name is @ORGANIZATION1. Everyone calls me @CAPS1, though I'm empty on the inside, it goes. There's been a lot of sadness in my life. There's gore for a while, like the pain I felt when bad things happened. Mom died when I was just six years old. And in the ten years since then, my @CAPS2 has wasted away. He's always there, in her old chair, looking so lost. Sometimes I hear him cry @CAPS7 night, his sobs breaking my heart. He's useless now, but I'm patient with him. I spend most of my time away from home, reading @CAPS7 in the park, enjoying the fresh air and the quiet. I do odd jobs for some extra cash, like mowing lawns or delivering newspapers, running along the endless sidewalks of our town. I know that it's not just @CAPS2 who I'm waiting on. I need someone to love me too. I keep pushing the thought away but the truth is, I spend all of my time waiting. Waiting pays off though, in sight. One day in the park, a boy walked up to me. He was tall and thin, with short brown hair and bright blue eyes that sparkled like the sky. His name was @CAPS3. He told me he'd seen me here before and asked why I read here instead of home. And that day was the first day with @CAPS3, my prince. I wasn't just @CAPS1 anymore, I was @CAPS1 and @CAPS3. @CAPS3, who saved me from myself. @CAPS3, my other half. @CAPS3, who disappeared three weeks after I met him. He's gone and hasn't showed up since @CAPS7 night. I cry, right there with my @CAPS2. Every day I wait for him in that same park, sitting on the bench where we first talked. I'm patient with him now, too. This is a story about a boy who is a prince, and a girl who waits for him. I never knew there were so many ways to say goodbye. Holding hands, like when mom passed away. Hearing @CAPS2 cry. A quick kiss with @CAPS3. But I know how to be patient. I'm still waiting for a hello, believing that one day he'll come back.
430	18312	7	3	Being patient means that you're understanding and tolerant. I have been patient too. When I went fishing for the first time, I had never caught a fish before. I would sit there on the riverbank, completely still, doing nothing. Not complaining, not saying anything as others around me caught many fish. I felt like a stupid person, watching them reel in their catches while my line remained motionless. But I would sit there and just see as other people caught more fish than I did. As I got older, it was still the same. I felt like shooting myself whenever someone caught another fish. I loathed every time a person caught a fish but I was patient. My dad always said I was going to catch a fish, and I believed him. When I turned nine, I went to a friend's home for a party. He lived by a lake. Everybody except my family brought rods and reels. I didn't have anything to do, so I asked a boy if I could borrow his pole and fish while he was eating. He said yes. So I walked to the lake, took a deep breath, and threw out the line. I saw something big's tail come out of the water. All of a sudden, there was a tremendous tug on the line that almost threw me into the water. I held on tight and reeled in the line bit by bit, making sure it wouldn't break. Finally, I held the fish high over my head in a triumphant manner and beamed like the sun. I had finally got a reward for being patient all these years. This experience taught me that patience can lead to great rewards, and I'll always remember the feeling of that moment.
431	18314	7	3	The four sisters waited in line for the second most exciting ride of their days at Cedar Point. Right behind @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and @CAPS3. The roar of the roller coaster and the screams of its riders zoomed by @CAPS14, and then it started to get quiet again. “I am soon super, duper excited!” @CAPS4, the youngest sister, exclaimed. “I know, me too.” The rest said at almost the same time. Eight eager eyes moved at the same time, watching the same thing. The @CAPS5! There were twists, turns, dives, and hills involved with this serious package deal. “@CAPS6.” “@CAPS10 long has it been?!” asked @PERSON3. “@CAPS7 hour,” @CAPS8, the oldest, replied, putting her long, dark, curly hair into a ponytail. “@CAPS9, young grasshopper,” said @PERSON4, patting the side of @PERSON3's face. “@CAPS10 this one has really got to me.” “@CAPS11!” agreed @PERSON1 with a look of displeasure on her face. “@CAPS12, my guys, look! We're almost to the front!” exclaimed the second oldest @PERSON2. “@CAPS13 me!” said a voice coming from the side. “@CAPS14 you for being patient, but we are experiencing some difficulty with the ride and it will be fixed as soon as we can. Thank you.” “I really hope @CAPS15 finish it soon!” said @PERSON3. All agreed. They waited for about a half @CAPS7 hour before another announcement came on. “@CAPS16 again, thank you for being so patient, but this problem will not be fixed for another @NUM1 hours. Thank you for choosing Cedar Point.” And the voice shut off, and @PERSON1, @PERSON2, and the others decided to go ride the grand swings.
432	18317	7	3	It was the day of central @LOCATION1, and it was after school that I was in the parade with my football team. The line was moving really slowly, and eventually, we were done. Then it was off to go home with my best friend @PERSON1. Well, he invited me over, and I went to his house and played a little. Then we left to go get some food. So when we pulled into @ORGANIZATION1's, there were about @NUM1 cars, and they were all in the drive - through. We sat in the car for about half an hour. But it was lucky because the game didn't start until @NUM2, and it was only @NUM3. So we sat there patiently, ordered our food, and left to go to the football game. And that's a time when I was patient.
433	18318	7	3	Patience is hard. You always want it now, not later. You must stay calm and be peaceful while being patient. Sometimes, people almost forget what they are waiting for, but I always want it now too. I can't stand not having something. If there's a test on @DATE1, I will not be happy if the test changes to @DATE2. I just can't wait that long, and it gives me tension just knowing what's going to happen. If you have patience, it's almost like a gift, just like singing and dancing are gifts. Patience allows us to better handle life's uncertainties and delays.
434	18319	7	3	“it’s where?” The woman asked for the third time. “@CAPS1 down the hall, to the left of the bathrooms,” I said for what had to be the fiftieth time. I grimaced as she walked out of the showroom; she didn't say anything. My dad worked for a small company that produced gift - shop - like knickknacks, like snow globes and the like. He offered me a @DATE1 summer job after my sixth - grade year, helping him out at work. Little did I know that what he was saying meant traveling to @LOCATION1, standing in the middle of the hallway at a huge building, and telling people where his showroom was. When working in the manufacturing and trade industry, you often don't meet the smartest, well - educated people. You really need patience if you want to get anywhere. “@CAPS2 dollars an hour, @CAPS2 dollars an hour.” I muttered to myself as a middle - aged man walked up to me. He read my name tag that had the blue - and - white company logo of Young's Incorporated. “@CAPS3, you're with Young's?” he asked. “Do you know where the showroom is?” I could tell what he was thinking. Why was an adolescent working for a corporation? “@CAPS1 down the hall, to the left of the bathrooms.” I said in a robotic voice. “@CAPS6 isn't it you a little young to be doing this kind of work?” he asked. You were expecting maybe an intern? I thought hastily, but I instead replied with a complacent “@CAPS8, sir.” “@CAPS9 how old are you?” he asked quizzically. “@CAPS11, sir.” I lied. I knew I could pass for a high - schooler, so I knew he'd believe me. I was really wishing that he would move along because I was getting pretty edgy. I was already beginning to imagine what would happen if I grabbed his tie and yanked on it as hard as I could. Doing this all day was not healthy. “Are you getting paid?” Enough to put up with the likes of you. I thought. I took a deep breath and answered, “Yes, sir. But it's not a lot. It's more like volunteer work, really.” Please don't ask any more questions, I thought. He smiled and walked on, “thanks son.” “You're welcome.” I said through partially clenched teeth. I think we'll both agree that I was patient that day. And I hope that that man bought a boatload of stuff from my dad's shop, because if he didn't, I will be very put out. That is the time when I was the most patient.
435	18320	7	3	Patience. When a person is patient, they can wait a thousand years for an answer. Or they are understanding of what the problem is when you are stuck. I always think they are a saint when they have the patience to deal with their wife, children, and job at the same time and keep their cool. That is truly amazing. Patience is when a person is always there when you need help, and just being around them gives you a sense of patience. I think patience means being calm, not losing one's temper, and helping you when you need a little boost of patience. Having patience is a virtue that enriches both the patient person and those around them.
436	18321	7	3	I always have to be extremely patient when I painstakingly put model airplanes together. Sometimes, when the parts are tiny and intricate, I have to ask my dad for help when putting together harder models. Like the complex @CAPS1 - @DATE1 details on the @NUM1 bombers. I also have to be patient when stealthily hunting for rabbits, squirrels, deer and turkey. If I'm not patient, I could miss a good shot or a prime animal. I sometimes have to be patient at school with @CAPS2 and other students. Patience is truly key in these situations.
437	18322	7	3	At a time when I was really eager to go to my favorite store, I woke up early and excitedly told my dad that I wanted to go. He simply said “let's go.” We quickly drove to the store, only to find that it said it was closed. I carefully checked the hours and saw that they were going to open in @NUM1 minutes. My dad and I patiently waited. Well, mostly my dad because he didn't say “let's go” or show any impatience. @NUM2 minutes passed and we still had @NUM3 more minutes to wait. Finally, @NUM3 minutes passed and it was time, but the people that worked there politely said to wait about @NUM3 minutes cause they had to set up things. My dad, like always, was very nice. He calmly waited @NUM3 more minutes, and then we could go in. Now finally @NUM3 minutes passed and we got to go inside and I was extremely @CAPS1 happy. Being patient is the best thing ever as it avoids complaining and makes the experience more rewarding.
438	18324	7	3	It was a nice sunny day outside, in the middle of the @DATE1. The heat was so intense outside, it was like the scorching Sahara desert. “Honey, quickly get your bathing suit on, and some shorts, and get into the car,” my mom shouted out the window. “@CAPS1 mom,” I questioned. “It's a surprise,” she answered. So I quickly did what she told me while constantly wondering where @CAPS9 were going. When @CAPS9 got there, I immediately knew exactly where @CAPS9 were. @STATE1 @CAPS2. I eagerly got out of the car with a huge grin on my face. “@CAPS3 going to go on @CAPS4 @CAPS5, want to come,” I asked my mom. “@CAPS6, sounds like fun,” she replied. When @CAPS9 got to this heart - throbbing roller coaster I looked, and the line was all the way to the end of the sidewalk. “@CAPS7, I don't want to wait mom, it's too long of a line,” I complained. “@CAPS8 patient, sweety @CAPS9'll @CAPS8 on the coaster in no time,” she replied. One hour later… “mom it's taking forever.” I whimpered. “@CAPS9 are the next ones in line,” she replied still smiling. So when the gates opened I was so excited and nervous, I couldn't believe that I waited an hour to get on one ride. “You were very patient,” my mom said with her hair sticking straight up. “@CAPS6 I was, and @CAPS3 proud of that,” I said to myself, realizing patience pays off.
439	18325	7	3	One of the most patient times I have ever had was in downtown @LOCATION1 at one of the greatest, most bustling @CAPS1 places around @CAPS1 poupules! As my dad, my friend and I sat waiting at our table, we were very hungry. It had been @NUM1 minutes since we ordered, but I stayed patient even though I was mad and extremely hungry. I remained indefatigable for my food. Finally, it came and I was completely satisfied, showing that patience leads to good things.
440	18326	7	3	Honestly, I really don't have a lot of patience. I easily get angry at the smallest things. I got this impatient trait all from my dad. Usually, I will get impatient when I'm anxiously waiting for my mom to come out to her car. Sometimes we are leaving in a hurry for dance, sometimes we are going to the mall. Whatever it is, though, if we are late, I completely freak out. Even when I am going to something small like a birthday party, I hate being late for it because everyone is usually there by then and I will feel left out. Sometimes I get impatient because people are really annoying me. For example, when someone is making random, irritating noises and I firmly tell them to stop and they don't, it really wears out my patience. I also can't stand when someone starts poking me for no reason, that really irritates me. Another thing that makes me very impatient is when my parents are lecturing me about something I already know when I'm getting in trouble and I just want them to finish already. Sometimes, it will be for not cleaning my room properly and my mom will be lecturing me, saying things she has told me a million times and it bugs me so much I just want to scream “stop talking”. Other times, it will be for not taking my dishes from my room, bathroom, or hook down to the kitchen. It's just a repeated lecture and I already know everything they are saying, so I don't have much patience for that. I can get very impatient sometimes, but I still have some in me, so if you stay on my good side, it won't wear thin.
441	18327	7	3	"I am writing a story about a time that I was patient. One day on my birthday, on @DATE1, I was over at my dad's house. My dad asked me where I wanted to go for my birthday. I didn't know at first, but then it came to my head. I told him I wanted to go paintball shooting. And he said ok. But before we go, he said, ""Can you cut the grass for me?"" I said ok. So I cut the grass, which took me about @NUM1 hour and @NUM2 minutes. Then I told him I'm done, and he said ok. So I took a shower because I smelt like wet grass. And when I got done taking my shower, I called my friends and cousins to see if they would come, and they said sure. So I asked my dad when we were going to leave to go paintball shooting. He told me it was going to be on a different day. So I called all of my friends and cousins back to tell them it wasn't going to be today. They were ok with it. And my dad said we were going to go before @DATE2 starts, and we have gone. And now until this day, I am still being patient, and I've learned that patience can lead to better experiences."
442	18329	7	3	There are many times in a person's life when someone was being patient. Patience is a very important trait that could lead to its own rewards. I am a dancer at @ORGANIZATION1 of dance. There is a very wide range in age in each dance class. Sometimes we have some trouble learning something as hard as a switch leap, or something as easy as a pirouette. Everyone who is in the class is so patient when these events happen. It might take fifteen minutes for the teacher to correct a footing position, and yet the other dancers remain seated, waiting over so patiently. Patience also occurs while training a dog. Obviously dogs don't speak our language, so they are going to have trouble learning. Yelling at the dog is a sign of not being patient which will not help the dog learn. But by praising the dog or correcting her/him gently, it is a sign of being under control and patient. Eventually by taking up all that time to teach him/her the rules, you will end up with a great dog, all because you were patient! As you can see, being patient brings happiness and comfort to others. Not to mention, it is what is respectful. Like I said, being patient is a very important lesson to learn and one should never forget it, as it enriches both our own lives and those around us.
443	18330	7	3	@PERSON1 is waiting patiently when the class is talking. In the class, when things get noisy, she will clap three times until they stop talking or quiet down. When they quiet down, she would continue teaching. When @PERSON1 is talking, we should be waiting patiently until she is done talking to us. That is how @PERSON1 shows patience, and it sets a good example for all of us in the class.
444	18331	7	3	PATIENT. One time I had to be very patient over at @CAPS1 Barrymores because we went into a line to go on go - karts that required a person to be at least @NUM1 years old or older to go. There were a lot of people in the line, and the wait seemed endless. I also had to be patient on my birthday this year because I knew I was getting cool stuff but I never imagined it would be this cool. I had to wait for the day to open my presents, and the anticipation made the wait a test of my patience. In the end, the experiences taught me that patience often leads to more enjoyable outcomes.
445	18332	7	3	I remember a time when @CAPS3 sister used to go on and on about @CAPS4 cream sundaes and all that. @CAPS3 mom had to drive me around all day because @CAPS3 dad was sick so that meant the “@CAPS4 cream girl” had to come along too! @CAPS3 mom knew she was in for a long day. We were in the car and we drove past a @ORGANIZATION1 and that’s when @CAPS3 little sister decided out loud “I’m hungry I want @CAPS1!!!”. That is what she said, yelling for five minutes straight. That’s when @CAPS3 mom yelled “If you speak another word about @CAPS4 cream you are not getting it!”. @CAPS3 sister then had this face that meant she was about to cry, which was even worse!!! @CAPS3 mom gave her a cookie so she would stay content for a while. We started driving home when we heard a song on the radio. @CAPS3 sister loves to put the word “@CAPS4 cream” in every song so she started squirming while holding her tongue. She stayed that way all afternoon. She didn't speak a word that entire day! So we drove past @ORGANIZATION1 and then she started to cry. She had enough. “I want @CAPS4 cream!!”. We were messing with her, so we went back to @ORGANIZATION1 and got her the thing she wanted most, her “@CAPS4 cream”. She was patient the entire day, she knew it was hard work. @CAPS3 little sister learned an important lesson that day, that “Being patient means good things will come to you”, and this lesson will surely stay with her in the future.
446	18333	7	3	A time I was patient was when I went to get my teeth cleaned at the dentist. After that, I also went to the doctor's. I waited a long three (@NUM1) hours to get my teeth cleaned, and it was really hard. So, I took a book out to read. While I was engrossed in reading the book, about @NUM2 Ω times, I got called to get my teeth cleaned. After that, I went to the doctors to get weighed, have my medicine refilled, and get some shoes. I had to wait for about two (@NUM3) hours before getting called into the room. But then I waited @NUM4 more so they could get the shots ready. So, in total, I waited about five hours and five minutes. After all that time, I finally went to eat some lunch at @ORGANIZATION1. That was all I did that day, and it truly tested my patience.
447	18334	7	3	Loyalty is when individuals firmly stand up for, and whole - heartedly support something. I think everyone should show loyalty in their actions because that means that you truly believe in something and that you have a valid reason to be dedicated and driven to have a purpose. Loyalty means to me not backing down and showing unwavering perseverance. I know a person who is always loyal and stands up for what he believes in. That person is my brother @PERSON1. My brother @PERSON1 is even willing to get into an argument with everybody. My brother is loyal to the “aliens”. I say that because he firmly thinks aliens are real and doesn't care about what anybody else has to say. I tried to convince him millions of times that there is no physical proof that aliens exist. But he keeps saying that “@CAPS1 are proof of aliens.” Moreover, my brother never lies to someone and always will have your back. If anyone says something about you that isn't true, he will defend you. He says, “It's not cool when somebody else talks about another person. All that means is that person has insecurities.” My brother never lets anyone talk about me without saying anything back. One last thing is that my brother stays true to himself. He never tries to be someone he's not. He said, “I tried being someone I'm not and it's not me. I'm a nerd with street smarts. I mean, I still take care of things.” In conclusion, my brother is a loyal person for the simple fact that he stands up for whatever he believes, even if it's about aliens, others, or himself.
448	18335	7	3	This is my story about being patient. I chose to write a story about a time when I was patient. My way of showing that is when I was at a doctors' office and waiting for @NUM1 hours to get a brace for my friend's wrist. First, the setting was in the waiting room and then in an office. There, we had to wait for @NUM1 hours. So, me and my dad were in this waiting room. It was supposed to be a @NUM3 appointment, and the receptionist told us to sit down. There were @NUM4 other people waiting as well. So, I sat down thinking my mom would come soon. At first, everything seemed okay, and it was just the normal waiting process because I was very patient. But my dad, on the other hand, was worried and then fell asleep. As people went by and were called to be seen, many minutes passed. An @CAPS1 hour went by, and I started to feel a bit restless, but I reminded myself that this was for my friend. Since I had made up my mind, I jumped out of my seat, woke my dad up, and went to check on the situation. After a while, the doctor came in, gave me the brace, got it resettled on my friend's wrist, and then we left. That was a story about me being patient at the doctors' office and waiting for a @NUM5 - minute thing. It taught me the value of patience in such situations.
449	18336	7	3	Being patient is good because then you respect that your problem will take time. But when you're impatient, you want to overcome the problem right now or very soon. I remember when my brother was extremely @CAPS1 impatient. My brother @PERSON1 and I were waiting for a new video game to come out, but it was set to come out in @NUM1 days. So, he waited a day, checked the date, and was disappointed. Then he waited another day and checked again, still no game. He wasted @NUM4 days constantly waiting and checking while I focused on school. His grade dropped to a @CAPS2 + and now he's blaming @CAPS3! So, I told him that hard work leads to success. He then tried harder. After that, he was using his time on improving his grades while his game he wants was still a few days away. Now, he's a lot happier because he's being patient, using his time wisely, and keeping himself occupied with more productive things. This shows that patience can lead to better outcomes in the long run.
450	18337	7	3	This is the story about the time I was patient. It was a warm day and I was sitting on the grass with the radio on. As my favorite song ended, I reached to change the program. But when I heard the man say that Usher tickets were on sale, I froze to listen. The tickets were going on sale downtown. I told my mom, and she rushed into the car, and we got there so fast you wouldn't even see us leave. When I got to the line, it was so long it seemed like it would go on forever. I waited and waited; it felt like the line only moved an inch. I waited and still waited, and I began to get mad, but I stood in line. When my long wait was finally over, I began to jump for joy. As I walked up to the counter, the attendant said, “Sorry, we are all sold out.” I couldn't believe it. I began to scream my head out. I did all that waiting for nothing; it was so unfair. And that's the time I was patient for nothing, but it still taught me that sometimes, despite our patience, things don't always go as we hope.
451	18338	7	3	Being Patient by: @PERSON1 A few years ago, I started to horse back ride. I love it so much that I look forward to every riding session. About @NUM1 month ago I ordered new riding boots. This is a time when I definitely had to be patient. Me and my mom went on stake line tack.corn and carefully ordered my new boots, making sure all the details were correct. When they arrived, they were too small so, we sent them back right away. Days and days went by as I waited for my boots. They didn’t come. I had to be patient, even though I was eager to try them out on my next ride. Another day went by and my mom finally called them. They said when you re - ship something, it goes through fourteen - day processing. Both me and my mom had to be patient and wait it out. Weeks went by and still no boots. My mom had gotten a new credit card that week. Another week went by and my mom and I were getting impatient. She called the company again and they said when we tried to change the shipping to your credit card, it said declined. But now the problem is fixed and I’m glad I was patient enough to wait for the boots, because now I’m riding comfortably in my new riding boots, and it was all worth the wait.
452	18339	7	3	A time I was patient was when I was waiting for my mom to pick me up from school at @TIME1. School ends at @NUM1 so I had to wait outside for an hour and a half almost. It was winter at the time so it was about @NUM2 f degrees, a bone - chilling cold. It was very windy too, and the wind was howling. I used my instrument case to block the wind and snow from my face. But that did not help much because I could not feel my face and I saw a clock inside the school and I found I had only been here @NUM3 minutes! The wind and snow was terrible. I was counting the number of teachers and people who left the school, I was so bored. My face was red as a cherry, stinging from the cold. So I started reading to pass time but my fingers started getting cold and I was dreaming of all the hot things in the world. First it was hot chocolate then @DATE1 then it was Florida in @DATE1 on a hot day. But I was staying as patient as I could but it was very hard. I was cold as ice and I dug into my pack to find something warm and I found some gloves to go with my coat and jeans. I read and read with gloves so my fingers did not freeze. Then I see a red car looking like my mom's car and then it passed. A wave of grief swept over me and I could not take any more! But when I stood up a car pulled in and it was my mom. I got my stuff in the car and put the heaters on high and my mom said thanks for being patient. It just goes to show that patience can pay off, even in the coldest of circumstances.
453	18340	7	3	Having a little bit of patience. Do you have patience or know someone who does? Well, that’s exactly what I am going to be talking about in my own way. Once there was a little girl that was very spoiled and wanted what she wanted. There was something about her that nobody knew about. She had patience, a hidden virtue. Everybody always wondered about her; there was something special about her. One day her and her family was going out and she couldn’t wait but you know what? She had patience and didn’t show her eagerness. Also she wanted to go get something from the store, @LOCATION1. She wasn’t like other children, who couldn’t wait and always bothered her parents. She just sat patiently in the backseat. When they left they went to @CAPS1 but they were rich so they went to @CAPS2’s too. She couldn’t wait to leave but you know what got her through? Patience in the store to get that specific thing she wanted. When they got in the store she finally got what she wanted. It was just lip gloss, five pairs of jeans and shirts to go with it. She was nearly ready to go then her mom and dad started looking around, but she had patience. When they got home she was so tired and she went up to her room and went to sleep. And they lived patiently ever after. I made this story to say we have to be patient and wait. That’s how accidents and problems happen when we don’t have patience, and this little girl got everything she wanted, all because she had patience.
454	18341	7	3	I was at the Detroit airport. It was around @NUM1 am, the sky was bright and gloomy but no rain, just a warm breeze blowing gently in my face. My mom, brother and I walked through the tall metal doors and saw everything from gift shops to our destination where we would @NUM2. We got our tickets and headed off into the plane. We went through metal detectors that caught nothing but my leather striped pink and brown belt. I slipped it back on quickly and started walking. When we entered the plane we passed a lot of people I didn’t know. I got the window seat, and there my mom, brother, and I sat in the caramel - colored blue chairs waiting in excitement and fear to fly off into the sunshine state. The anticipation was building as we prepared for take - off, and I knew this journey would be full of new experiences.
455	18342	7	3	Patience is a very important quality in life. In fact one time I had to be very patient because my little cousin who lives in @LOCATION1 had a disorder since birth. It takes her a little longer to get things because she lives in her own little world but it’s not reality. So I was going to teach her how to ride a bike with training wheels. She tried and tried, and even though she still doesn’t know how perfectly today, she’s gotten way better but still has brain problems. So I’m taking her from horrible to better to good then to great. She’s improved over the years. It takes patience because she has a disorder. So you really don’t yell at her cause she’s very emotional and sensitive so you have to be quiet, nice, and have patience. So she will always be stuck with the problem but you can be patient and she will continue to make progress. With patience, small steps can lead to big changes, and that’s what I’ve learned from teaching my cousin.
456	18343	7	3	Yesterday I went to the orthodontist and waited in the cozy waiting room for my check - up. The wait took a little while, but soon it was my turn next. When I got home, my stomach was growling and I felt like I was starving. I waited for dinner to be ready. Even though it was only an hour until it would be ready, that hour seemed like a lifetime. The delicious aroma of the home - cooked meal coming from the kitchen only made my hunger worse. But I sat patiently in the living room and read my favorite book until dinner was done. Afterwards, I was engrossed in watching ghost hunters when my little brothers came in and started to clean up the mess they made with their toys. So I had to pause the show because they can't focus on cleaning when the TV is on. So patiently, I waited for an excruciating 15 minutes until they were done. So overall, I think I was very patient yesterday and it shows I can handle waiting well.
457	18344	7	3	This is the time when I was patient about going to the doctor. It was two days before I had to go to the doctor. My mom had told me I needed three shots. I've never liked shots because they hurt and make you feel sleepy. Usually, I'm not very patient, but this time I was. I had one more day and then I'd be at the doctor's. I experienced why people should have patience and it's actually quite easy to do. Today was my doctor's appointment and I was really scared. When I walked into the clinic, the sterile smell always makes me feel sick and tired. My mom went to sign my name in, and I felt even sicker because I kept worrying about how many shots I'd have to get. My doctor called me, and I was terrified. My mom always told me that it doesn't hurt if you don't look at it. So I went back to the doctor's office, and my doctor told me to get on the scale. I was really nervous. He gave me an hearing test and an eye test. I asked if I had to get any shots, and he said not yet but I might have to. When I got finished with my hearing test, I was done and I realized I was scared for nothing. When I got home, I learned two important lessons: one was not to worry about anything and the other was how to have patience. This is when I was patient about going to the doctor and it was a valuable learning experience.
458	18345	7	3	This Saturday, me, my mom, and my sister all went to Aerosmith's concert. My mom wasn't very excited; she was more there for the family experience. My sister was only excited just to see 'Steven Tyler'. I was very excited just to be going. When we entered the parking lot to the 'Hollywood Bowl Amphitheater', there was a huge line at the door. It took up half the parking lot! But we had to wait in that long line for an hour before we got in. When we got inside and to our seats, it started to rain. Of course, it was an outdoor concert. So by the time the opening act got done, I was completely soaked. Then the crew started setting up the stage for The 'Aerosmith'. We waited another hour and a half for them to finish setting up. My sister and my mom were both getting irritated, but I kept waiting and staying positive. On the bright side, it was an amazing concert and I'm glad I got to have the experience. But next time, I'll be wearing a hat to protect myself from the rain.
459	18346	7	3	"A time when I was patient was when my brother, and sister, and I were told we were going to Disneyland; which is a big deal to us. My siblings and I were fighting in the kitchen about something stupid, of course, when all of a sudden our parents called us out. ""This is great,"" I thought sarcastically. As I was thinking about what punishment we were going to get, my mom broke my train of thought and told us we were going on vacation. ""Is this a punishment?"" I asked. ""What?"" my mom replied. ""I thought we were in trouble,"" I told her. We were going on vacation to Las Vegas and to San Diego. But we had to wait one whole week. Every day my little brother would ask ""when are we going on our trip?"" and every day my mom would say the same thing. ""In one week, in four days, in three days, in two days."" Finally, it was the day to go on our vacation and my parents were proud of me for being very patient for a week waiting to go to Las Vegas. That was a time when I was very patient and it made the vacation even more rewarding."
460	18347	7	3	A time when I was patient was when I was at my dad's office. The office was filled with the sound of typing and phone calls. We were there for an hour. I had to sit quietly in a corner chair and be patient until we left. It was not easy being patient. I had so many things I wanted to say and do, but I had to take an entire hour not saying anything. I just sat there, looking at the pictures on the wall and the papers on the desks. Until my dad finally told me it was time to go. This experience taught me that I can control my impulses and be patient when needed.
461	18348	7	3	My dad can be very patient sometimes. When heís not angry, he takes the time to listen to my problems and offers calm, well - thought - out advice. He'll sit with me for hours if I need to talk, never rushing me to finish my thoughts. His patience is a quality I truly admire.
462	18349	7	3	A time when I was patient was actually a few days ago. I was standing in line at @ORGANIZATION1 store with my mother so we could return a box that didnít work properly. This was the third time we have had to return these boxes due to persistent issues. I had to stand in line for half of an hour and watch nothing but angry customers complaining loudly. Still, it wasn't our turn in line. This one man who was up at the counter was not very patient at all. In fact, when he left, he slammed the door hard and mumbled angry stuff under his breath. Finally, it was our turn and my mom was very patient with the worker, (even though she didnít want to be as she was frustrated). The worker didnít know what was wrong with the box so she gave her a new one and we left. Being patient can bring good things just like this quote I have always liked says ìgood things come to those who waitî. This is very true so remember! Be patient and good things will follow.
463	18350	7	3	Thompson volleyball players, aka @CAPS1 @CAPS2, lost our tournament. We went on @DATE1 at a @CAPS3 restaurant to relax. And you know @PERSON1. She had asked for some chopsticks and the @CAPS1 made us wait for @NUM1 long minutes for chopsticks. So @CAPS4, a volleyball player, asked and she gave everybody some but the adults! We had so much fun chatting and joking around. I had asked for some napkins but we did not get any. I was really mad at the waiter but I had fun and the other players had fun too. Even with the small inconveniences, the gathering was still a great time.
464	18352	7	3	One important skill you need in life is patience. With my new, hard cast on my arm, I couldn't do many things. I was a very active child, regularly participating in soccer, basketball, cross - country, and football. But, with my broken arm, I had to be patient with my sports activities. I couldn't jump into the games right away as I usually did. I followed the doctor's advice and rested. Being patient paid off and my arm healed faster without becoming even more damaged. Then I played sports again after I had my cast cut off. Patience can be rewarding, just if you wait long enough. It allows your body to recover and gives you the chance to get back to doing what you love.
465	18353	7	3	I was waiting for my grandpa to get home. He was gone to an Amish sale to find me a chicken coop for my chickens. I was helping my grandma can in the morning. I was so excited for him to get home. Then I went outside. I was doing work to pass the time. I first cleaned the barn thoroughly. Then I did the cattle work. I fed them, walked them slowly around the pen, then watered them, and then I cleaned the chicken coop. Then I did chicken chores. I collected the eggs carefully, fed them, and I watered them. Then I had some fun. I worked on volleyball, practicing my serves and spikes. Then I practiced hitting and pitching for softball, focusing on my form. Then I worked on shooting hoops, trying different angles. Then I rode the gator for a little while, enjoying the fresh air. Then I went in for a short break. When I came back out I thought what can I do. Then I saw the field. I knew I would do some thrashing. So I got out the slasher, went to the field for thrashing. I loaded the truck carefully. Then when I got back to put the other tractor out and attached the header to do more work. I went out and worked the ground, when I got back I was thinking what am I going to do now, when I heard a tractor and pulling. It was my grandpa. We got in the truck to town to check out the chicken coop he found.
466	18354	7	3	One time when I was playing a football game with my friends, the other team was clearly creaming us. They were making quick passes and scoring easily. But even though we were losing badly, I still managed to stay calm. I encouraged my teammates, telling them to keep their focus. In the end, we turned the tables and ended up beating them, which was a great feeling.
467	18355	7	3	Patience is a hard but good thing to have because patience can help you progress in your life, such as when trying to get a job. One way you would have to be patient when trying to get a job is when the boss is taking his sweet time assessing your presence. You don’t want to get impatient and yell at him and tell him to hurry up because that would surely make you not get the job. So in conclusion, patience is a good life skill to have because it can help us progress in life and achieve our goals.
468	18356	7	3	Just be patient, Lucie said to @CAPS1. I will be done soon. “How soon is soon?” “A while. I will be done filing papers in about an hour, then I will take you to the park.” “An hour? That is such a long time.” “Just go watch TV.” “But I don't want to. Leave me alone or when I get done I won't take you to the park.” “Ok.” So @CAPS1 went and played video games with his little sister @PERSON1 for a while, and made some pizza. Then his friend from school, Ryan, came over and asked if he and his sister wanted to go to the park with him and his mom. So he asked Lucie if he could go to the park with Ryan and she said yes, just be back by five o'clock. He and @PERSON1 had a great time at the park. Ryan's mom got them all ice cream. He learned that being patient is very, very important as it led to this fun experience.
469	18357	7	3	I’ve been to @LOCATION1 @CAPS1 before. My family and I went about a year ago. There were so many rides! We were astounded by how many people were there. The place was bustling with activity. My family and I decided to go on the little rides first. We went on things like the “@CAPS2 trap”, “@CAPS3 star”, and also many water rides. We got a bit wet but had a lot of fun. At the end of the day, my family and I walked in line to the biggest ride there. It was called the “@CAPS4 timbers.” The track was made out of wood, which is what made most of the ride scary. There was a line of probably @NUM1 people. I told my mom I didn't want to wait long. She said “you need patience.” I said “ok fine!” Finally, it was our turn for the ride, and it was pretty fun. After we got off I said “mom, that patience really paid off” as it was an amazing experience.
470	18358	7	3	When I got my bow I was very, very, very excited. Well, I was excited because my older sister @PERSON1 got a bow before me and I thought that it was unfair. I had to wait @NUM1 whole year till I got my bow at @CAPS1 time. My mom and dad hid it in my bedroom in my closet, and I never noticed it before. That is the time when I had to be patient when I had to wait to get my bow. Now almost every day I'm outside shooting it. I practice my aim and enjoy the feeling of using my own bow. Thanks for listening and reading about my patience journey.
471	18361	7	3	Let me get one thing straight – I'm not patient. I mean, I can be patient at times, but mostly I'm not. If there is something coming up, like my birthday, I will not stop talking or thinking about it. By not being patient, I just mean I can't wait. Most of the time, especially when we are going to a boring family house, I can't wait. But I guess there are some situations where I have to try and be patient.
472	18362	7	3	Melted. One day, my sister and I have just woke up one bright morning on @DATE1 at @TIME1. Mom was at my sister's door. The light shined through my sister's curtains and her covers. Mom pushed the door open just a crack and said, “Wake up!” “What time is it?” I got up moaning, “Let me sleep. I'm sleeping.” Mom helped me up and hugged me while I was still half - asleep. I went into the living room. Mom was in the kitchen and got what I thought was a paper hen, but it was actually aluminium. Dazed, I turned on the TV when I didn't know my sister's mom was on the couch. “Honey, go put the clothes in the dryer,” called Mom. “Okay,” I replied, “Do you want to come downstairs too?” “Sure,” he exclaimed. “Great,” I thought in my head. We walked downstairs in the hallway to the laundry room. When we finished putting the clothes in the dryer, I took a deep breath and said, “Do you smell that?” Mom looked frightened and said, “Don't worry, I'm cooking something.” My eyes widened and I ran up the stairs until I reached the landing where the door was. I opened it and Mom pushed me outside. “Fresh air!” we exclaimed. We were back in and crawled through the kitchen. We paused to stare at the fire; we ran towards my sister still on the couch sleeping. We shook her and shook her but she didn't wake up, so I said, “Cover your ears. Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!” “What's wrong with y'all!” my sister yelled. “The stove, fire, it's out of control!” I screamed. Mom stood up, we ran, Mom grabbed a cup of water and poured it on the fire. “I need to teach you how to cook better or until you won't set anything on fire!” I said, and thankfully, the fire was put out.
473	18363	7	3	There are @NUM1 different languages in the world and different dialects of these languages. In all, that is more than @NUM2 different languages. But in each language, patient means the same thing: understanding and tolerant. Everyone has to be patient at one point or another. Let me tell you about one time when I was patient. It was just about one week ago when I got into a fight with my best friend in the world. And later that day, I realized that we were both in the wrong. I sent her e - mails, text messages, and I called her cell phone and home phone at least @NUM3 times, but she didn't answer or reply. I got even more frustrated the more she ignored me. Then I talked to my cousin about it. “You have to be patient with her. This is your first fight,” my cousin told me in a calm voice. So, I waited by the phone to see if she messaged me back without using swear words, and I left her alone at school. Finally, one day she talked to me. She said, “I'm sorry too. Thanks for being patient with me. I've missed hanging out with you. How about we sit together at band?” “I'd like that,” I replied, and finally we made up after five days of fighting. After this experience, I learned that being patient really pays off. So wait your turn to speak, and understand why people say what they say and mean what they mean. Patience is always the key to maintaining good relationships.
474	18364	7	3	The time I was patient is when I was supposed to clean up my house and my mom said she would take me out when she gets back. So I started straightening up, vacuuming, making my bed, cleaning the bathroom, taking the dogs outside, cleaning their kennel, doing the dishes, taking out the trash, and doing the laundry. Once I was done with a lot of the chores, I would watch @CAPS1 play the game or be on the computer. I waited about the whole day. And once she got home, she said, “I forgot, so we're going to get pizza instead.” Although I was a bit disappointed about not going out as planned, I was still okay with getting pizza. It was a small compromise, and I'm glad I was patient through the whole cleaning process.
475	18365	7	3	A time when I was patient was when I was at the doctor's office. I was waiting for my doctor to come out. But he was taking a really long time to come out. I was trying so hard to be patient, to stay calm. I kept looking at the clock, and every minute seemed like an hour. I fidgeted in my seat, but then I reminded myself that the doctor was probably busy with other patients. It was really difficult to stay calm, but I managed to control my impatience. And then the doctor came out and I started to feel better. It was a relief that my wait was finally over, and I realized that being patient in such situations is really important.
476	18366	7	3	One day me and my friend @PERSON1 were at @ORGANIZATION2, a bustling and lively place. We were in the line for the @ORGANIZATION1, an exciting attraction. We eagerly ran up to the line, and we had to wait about a half hour till we got on. The line moved slowly, but the good thing is that me and @PERSON1 were patient. After the thrilling ride we got in line for the @CAPS1! WOW! What a long and winding line. I think we were in that line for at least a hour and a half before we got on. The wait was testing our patience, but you know, me and @PERSON1 are really patient. The @CAPS2 was worth the wait, and we had a great time overall.
477	18367	7	3	One day my dad needed his keys and I had them. His keys were somewhere in my room so I looked everywhere. I rummaged through all the obvious places. After twenty minutes went by I still could not find them but my dad was still patient. I completely destroyed my room looking for his keys. They were not in my dresser, closet, bed, or on my floor. I just had them to unlock the car and now the keys are gone. Then when I went to tell my dad, who was being so patient for a whole hour, I found them in my pocket. I felt really silly but was glad I finally found them, and my dad was relieved too.
478	18368	7	3	"Once upon a time there were two kids. One was named @CAPS1, and he wasn't patient at all. The other kid was named @PERSON1, and he was very patient. They went for a walk in the deep, mysterious woods and got lost. @CAPS1 would not stop complaining non - stop. @PERSON1 told him to stop complaining, but @CAPS1 didn't listen. Until he saw a haunted house. @CAPS1 told @PERSON2 if he wanted to go inside with him. @PERSON1 didn't want to go in so @CAPS1 went in and acted like he got hurt so @PERSON1 ran in there. The door slammed shut and the doorknob fell off. They were really scared as it was pitch - dark. Then the light came on. @CAPS1 said, ""Let's get out of here!"" @PERSON1 said, ""How? The doorknob fell off."" @CAPS1 said, ""I don't know."" They ran through the house but there were no other doors or windows. They were terrified. Then a ghost was coming at them and he said, ""Happy @CAPS7!"" It was their dad. He built the house for them and said all they had to do was push the door open. And they all went home happily, having learned a little about patience and not being too hasty. The end."
479	18369	7	3	Patience. If you are like me, that is nearly impossible. In fact, I can barely wait @NUM1 hours for something. Even the shortest waits seem like an eternity to me. But I still sometimes have patience. Like when I wait for a @CAPS1 party, I can manage to hold my excitement. But this story is different. It was a warm day, even though @DATE1 was almost over. I didn't care though because I was focused on one thing - my @CAPS1. Like most kids, I had waited @NUM2 days until I would get a big pile of presents stocked up in front of me. When I woke up that morning, I knew it was still going to be a while until the party started. I played some sweet video games, trying to pass the time. Played outside in the warm sun and just kind of sat on a crouch until @NUM3. I couldn't believe it was only twelve. To me, it had seemed like hours just ticked away. I had to find something else to do. I decided to go to my friend's place. We played some brutal, tiring football games before I decided to leave. When I got home I dashed to my clock like a deer in headlights. It was @NUM1:27. How, I do not know. I still had a whole hour until my party! The last hour of @MONTH1 have seemed like a whole other year to me, but I'm still alive, right? My friends don't know me to have patience and I don't either. And trust me. I will never be that patient again. Ever, because it was such a struggle.
480	18370	7	3	When I was being patient, I was doing my math @CAPS1, a rather difficult assignment. I couldn't figure it out. On the @DATE1, my aunt didn't help me at all. I almost @CAPS3 quit at that point. But this time I was patient and @CAPS4, and I kept trying. Finally, I @CAPS5 it. I was so proud of myself for not giving up and using patience to solve the problem.
481	18371	7	3	This is a story about a time when I was patient. A time when I was patient is when I was at a local food store waiting for my ordered food. I placed my order, and they took quite a long time to give it to me. I waited so patiently. Other people were getting impatient there, but they still did not give me mine. So I went outside and told my granddad that they were about to give me my food. I told him that because he kept asking me why they were taking so long. So I went back into the food store and asked them why they were taking so long. They said it’s coming in a second. Then I sat down in the food store and saw my friends, @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and @PERSON1, coming into the food store. So we started talking and waiting patiently for our food. My name is @CAPS3. I was born on @DATE1 and was raised in the city of @LOCATION1. I was patient because I did not get angry and I waited. So then they called my name and said my food was ready. Then I got my food and told my friends I’m about to go home. After that, I left. That’s a story about a time when I was patient.
482	18373	7	3	One day I was leisurely looking at a catalog in a store, and my eyes caught a really cool goalkeeper shirt that I really wanted. It had a unique design that just appealed to me right away. So I went to my mom, showing her with excitement what I wanted. She said it was a bit pricy, but that she would get it. The next week seemed extremely long as I was waiting for the shirt. On @DATE1, it finally arrived. It was a beautiful combination of pale yellow, red, blue, and purple. I finally had a goalkeeper jersey to wear to games and make great saves, which I was sure would boost my performance on the field.
483	18374	7	3	A time when I was patient was when I was waiting for my dad to come home from work. I had a package that I got before he left on a three - day trip out of state. I promised myself that I would wait for him to come back before opening it. Those three days felt like an eternity as I was eager to see what was inside the package. But I held my patience. When he finally came back, I got to open it. It was a great feeling to have waited patiently, and it made the moment of opening the package even more special.
484	18375	7	3	A time when I had to be patient was my @NUM1 birthday. Why? Because I was waiting for my phone. Mom kept telling me that I was going to get it on the first of @DATE1. I was so excited and kept checking the time every now and then. But I still didn’t believe her completely. On my birthday, as I was opening presents one by one, I was getting a bit disappointed. But guess what? My last present was my brand - new cell phone and a cool case. Now that is what I call patience. It was all worth the wait as I finally got what I had been longing for.
485	18376	7	3	“Are they here yet?” I said as I paced back and forth impatiently. “Patience, it takes a while to get from the locker all the way down here,” said @CAPS1 calmly. “@CAPS2! @CAPS6 on the camera!” “@CAPS3 got him!” said @PERSON1 excitedly. “@CAPS4’s right behind us.” “@CAPS5, funny guys! You guys better give me back my clothes or I swear I'll @CAPS6 off the camera!” yelled @CAPS7 as @CAPS4 attempted to grab his clothes… and missed. “@CAPS8! My patience has run out, @CAPS7!” I said, taking another picture. “@CAPS10, I think @CAPS3 should put this up on the internet,” I continued. “@CAPS11! You can't @CAPS5 put this on the internet!” “So your going to stop picking on us?” I asked. “@CAPS8!” @CAPS4 said. “@CAPS13, then I’ll just zoom in right here.” “@CAPS13!” @CAPS4 screamed as his towel fell off. So, to show the little respect @CAPS3 had for him, @CAPS3 gave him his clothes, turned around, and walked away, ending this rather chaotic and patience - testing situation.
486	18377	7	3	Crack! I twisted through the air and landed face up with my arm wrapped tightly around me. I felt a throbbing pain as I wobbled to my feet. “What just happened?” I thought to myself. I once again began to feel the tremendous pain shooting through my forearm. I bit my lip as hard as I could to choke back all of the tears from just pouring out like a waterfall. My friends launched toward me, asking me if I was okay as soon as I started holding my arm. “I think I might have broken it,” I replied in between sobs. They rushed to get aid as quickly as possible. I soon found myself in the sick room after making a call to my parents to alert them of what had just happened. I sat there for hours waiting for my parents to come pick me up to go get an X-ray at the children's hospital. They were both at work and were not able to come and get me. As the day dragged on, I became more and more anxious. Finally, the bell rang; it was 5 PM at last. “Bang!” the door swung open. It was my dad, and not far behind him was my mom. 5 PM is when they get out of work. After my mom and dad told me how much they were glad it was nothing more than a broken arm, they immediately rushed me to the hospital. That was my experience of a time I had to be patient. And in the end, it turned out I had a broken arm. In life, there are going to be many situations where you're going to have to be patient. All you can do is take life as it comes at you.
487	18378	7	3	Jenny and Tom were twins, a brother and sister. Every year, a carnival was set up next to their house, filled with exciting games, thrilling rides, and delicious food. One day, Jenny and Tom went to ask their mother, Mrs. Smith, politely for some money to go on the ferris wheel. “Mom, can we each have a dollar to go on the ferris wheel?” asked Jenny. “Sure,” replied mom and handed them two dollars. Jenny and Tom were so excited that they ran straight to the line of the ferris wheel. They waited and waited for an hour, and it was finally their turn. During this time, the man in charge of the ferris wheel had been watching Jenny and Tom patiently wait in line. As Jenny and Tom were about to step into the cart, two mean boys pushed them off to the ground and took their seats. Now, their mama had taught them how to be nice to everyone, and they remembered that, so they got back up and let the boys go. When it was their turn again, the man in charge of the ferris wheel took notice of what had just happened and told them that he was proud of Jenny and Tom and that they would go around the ferris wheel thrice more for their patience. After the ride, they thanked the man and ran happily home to tell their mom what had happened. Their mama was so proud of them and hugged Jenny and Tom tightly. This experience taught them that being kind and patient always pays off.
488	18379	7	3	I was patient when I am hunting because when you have a bow, you can only shoot so far, and you have to wait for the deer to come into a nice, open clearing, not hidden behind brush. I think you have to be a patient person because when a deer comes close and you get your bow ready, your mind starts to play tricks on you. You think it's going to come closer, but then it walks as slow as possible. You just have to stay calm and go with it. And when all that patience finally comes to an end and you get ready to shoot and you hit the deer, then it really pays off. It makes all the waiting worth it, and it gives you a sense of accomplishment.
489	18380	7	3	A time that I was patient was when I was in 3rd grade. It was after my birthday, and I had really wanted those cute pink Adidas shoes. My dad, who was working in New York, said he would get them. But he would have to buy them, send them to grandma's house, and then have my grandma send them to me. He said I would get them sometime after my birthday. So one day, he called and told me he sent them, and I should get them in one week. So I patiently waited for my shoes. After one week, they were not at my house. I didn't want to bug my dad and call him every day about them, so I just patiently waited. After 2 more weeks, I began to worry and get mad. So I called my dad and asked him about the shoes. To my surprise, he said that my grandma was bringing my shoes in an hour. So I was patient and waited one hour, but my shoes still hadn't come. At this point, I just decided they would come when they came, and I would just wait. Finally, I got my shoes the next day, and I was ecstatic. I thanked my dad and wore my shoes the next day, knowing my patience had paid off. This experience taught me that patience is indeed a virtue.
490	18381	7	3	Sometimes I'm patient, and sometimes I'm impatient. But no matter how impatient I am, my dad's even more impatient when it comes to waiting in a big traffic jam. He huffs loudly at the long delay, sighs heavily, and gets extremely impatient. He says things like, “Come on, move!” “Come on!” It's really scary to be with my dad in traffic jams or long lines. His outbursts can make the situation even more tense. But after the long line or traffic jam is over, my dad is himself again, which is a great relief for me. It shows that even though we all have our impatient moments, things will eventually get better, and we should try to stay calm in difficult situations.
491	18383	7	3	A time that I was patient was when I was play - fighting with my little brother in the backyard at @LOCATION1. We were just having some rough - and - tumble fun, but then he accidentally kicked me in the chin. Even though it stung a bit, I promised him that I would not tell on him. Unfortunately, the second time he kicked me, it was harder and busted my chin open. I fell to the ground right in front of all our friends who were there. They all rushed around me like a bunch of bees around a hive full of honey, asking if I was okay. But I still kept my promise and didn't tell on him. That was when I was being patient, showing self - control even in a painful situation.
492	18384	7	3	One time I was told by my big brother that we were going to go on a Michigan adventure. I was so excited and started waiting eagerly for him to come home. Then my dad told me that I should get ready to go. So I quickly packed my shorts and some basic essentials like a small water bottle and a snack. After that, I just sat there in the living room for about half an hour. When he still didn't show up, I called him. He said there was a little delay but we'd still go. Finally, he arrived and we set off for our Michigan adventure.
493	18386	7	3	"@CAPS12's the @CAPS1 of the ninth inning, with the winning @CAPS2 @CAPS3 up to a full @CAPS4 count, the bases @CAPS5 loaded, and two outs. As the pitcher hurled a @NUM1 - mph fast ball right down the center of the strike zone, @CAPS2 swung with all his might and hit his very first grand slam. The crowd exploded with cheers and excitement. As we were about to leave, the announcer said, ""Don't forget, kids! Today and today only, down on the field, the @CAPS8 are signing autographs."" I begged and pleaded with my dad to let us stay, and thankfully, he @CAPS9 @CAPS14 agreed. When I got down there, there was a huge, snaking line. As time slowly ticked away, those minutes seemed like hours. I could see kids getting antsy. I would have lost it if my dad had not said, ""The only way we can stay is if you are patient."" @CAPS12 took forever. All you had to do was look around and you would see kids going nuts. The little ones were crying and throwing tantrums. I could tell I was maybe one of the last five people being patient. Even my dad was getting frustrated. It took @CAPS12 at least two and a half hours to get to the front, but it felt like @NUM2 days. I finally @CAPS14 got the whole team's autograph and I was so happy. I even surprised myself that day. I had no idea that I had it in me to be that patient for two and a half hours. On our way home, my dad stopped at @CAPS15 and got me a frosty. He @CAPS9 said that being patient wasn't so bad. From that @MONTH1 on, I'll be more patient from now and @CAPS16."
494	18387	7	3	One day my mom, my sister, and I were going to the hair salon to get our hair done. When we walked in, there were so many people there chatting animatedly. It was kind of noisy too. The TV was on, playing some random show, the radio was playing soft music, and a bunch of people were talking all at once. When we got there, my mother carefully signed all three of us in on the sign - in sheet. Then we had to sit and wait in the small waiting area. We waited for a long time. I really wanted to leave and come back another day but my mom said we had to wait. As time passed, I got hungry and I was also feeling sleepy. We waited for an hour. I didn't let it bother me, so I turned on my @NUM1 music player and listened to my favorite tunes until it was almost our turn. Then we had to wait another hour, and I got even more hungry but I didn't say anything. So we just sat there, patiently. Finally, we were up next. And we all got our hair done beautifully. Then when we left, we went to a nearby diner to get some food because we were all really hungry. And that was a time I was patient at the hair salon.
495	18388	7	3	"Once upon a time there was a kid named Jack. Jack had a little brother named @PERSON1. @PERSON1 was @NUM1 years old and Jack was @NUM2 years old. Since Jack was a lot older than @PERSON1 and @PERSON1 was his brother, Jack had to watch him a lot. Jack had a lot of patience because he had to watch him every night as his parents worked late. But even so, he still thought his brother was annoying at times. His parents knew that if they paid him, Jack would keep watching him, so he did. But one day, when Jack's little brother @PERSON1 would not stop complaining because he did not get his way, Jack finally got mad. He said, ""If you don't stop whining, then I will not watch you anymore and you'll have to go to day - care."" Since @PERSON1 hated day - care, he stopped right away. Jack was very mad at his brother because @PERSON1 was never usually like this. So Jack wanted to say he was sorry and he did. His brother forgave him. ""I'm sorry that I was making you mad,"" Jack said. ""It's okay,"" his brother said. ""Let's try not to let this happen again,"" Jack said. Then the next day when Jack and his little brother were hanging out after school, everything went well. ""I'm happy that we are not mad at each other because I don't want to go to daycare,"" @PERSON1 said to his brother. ""Yeah, and I don't want you to go because then I will have nothing to do,"" Jack said. From that day on, they got along better and Jack learned to be more patient with his little brother."
496	18389	7	3	There was a time when I went to @ORGANIZATION1, a popular amusement park. We were driving to @ORGANIZATION1, excited for the day ahead, then there was a long line of traffic so we had to wait. So we waited on a bridge for @NUM1 hours! It was like a nightmare coming true. As time passed, we got hungry. We really didn't enjoy just sitting there. But we were there for a long time, about @NUM2 hours, and then we finally got into the park. So we were deciding which roller coaster to go on. We decided to go on the @CAPS1. We looked at the line and it was a @NUM3 hr wait. We got in line. @PERSON1, @PERSON1, and my brother @PERSON1 were complaining a lot. Again it was a nightmare coming true. So my dad and I were fine with the line for the @CAPS2. Actually, it didn't take as long as I thought it would. After the wait we got on the roller coaster. We were laughing and scared at the same time. The coaster was over. I was sad. But it was worth the three - hour wait. Later that day we rode the @CAPS3, the first ever built standing coaster. I was scared again and the wait was @NUM4 hours long. And @PERSON1 and my brother @CAPS4 were dying from the wait. But the wait only felt like an hour long. I was scared of that coaster. But I loved it. It was a lot of fun to ride roller coasters. We left after a while. It was a long day, filled with excitement and patience, and it ended with great memories. The end.
497	18390	7	3	In this story I am waiting for the time when the video game @CAPS1 @CAPS2 was coming out for @CAPS3 @NUM1. The game will be the last game for the company's franchise. I've already pre - ordered it and it's coming. The game looks pretty good, but I don't understand why your main character stays on a plant called @CAPS2 and is the only survivor there, and then the entire group of characters gets bum - rushed by roughly @NUM2 aliens with swords and they chop up your character into tiny pieces with their little toy plastic swords. And the first time I went to buy the game at @CAPS5 @CAPS6 at @NUM3, their parking lot was filled with probably all @NUM4 year olds who live in their mom’s basement. So we waited and got it about @NUM5 week after its official release. We bought it then we started playing and it wasn't the fight game it was supposed to be; it was some weak @PERSON1 game so we completed it in like two minutes. So that shows there's no point in being overly patient when it comes to some games.
498	18391	7	3	When I was in fifth grade I wasn't doing so well in math so my @CAPS1, a kind and dedicated tutor, agreed on helping me study for my upcoming test. So on @DATE1 I got up really early but my mom was running really late getting home from work, and she was the one driving me there. So my @CAPS1 was being really understanding and patient, waiting for me to arrive. So my mom got home, drove me, and we ended up an hour and a half late but my @CAPS1 was still very patient. So we started to help me and I was completely lost. I didn't understand anything she was talking about but she still tried and was very understanding. I got almost every question wrong that she asked me and she still tried to her best ability to help me understand it. She had to spend about @NUM1 hours helping me but she followed through and really helped me. And I actually got an A on that quiz all because of her help and patience with me. I know it must have been hard to work with me for that long without losing her patience with me and I really respect that and I am very grateful to know someone like that. Her patience and dedication truly made a difference in my academic performance.
499	18392	7	3	A time I was patient was @DATE1, @NUM1, @NUM2. I was sitting doing my meap test when my stomach started to hurt. It was an uncomfortable and distracting pain. For about @NUM3 minutes I sat there moving around restlessly. Then I raised my hand to ask to call my mom. When the teacher called on me I asked her and @CAPS3 said “@CAPS1.S @PERSON1 can you take [name] to the office.” And @PERSON1 said ok. Then me and @PERSON1 went to the office and I called my house phone. My sister picked up the phone and I said to her “@CAPS2, let me speak to mama.” @CAPS3 said “hold up.” Then my mom said “it's okay.” I said “mama can you please come pick me up my stomach hurts really bad.” @CAPS3 said “ok” and hung up. I waited about @NUM3 minutes sitting there patiently, tossing and turning from my stomach hurting so bad. Then finally I called again and said “I said moma is you coming” and @CAPS3 said “@CAPS4 on my way.” I said “ok” and hung up. I was sitting there patient and in pain till finally my mom walked through the school doors and signed me out. The @CAPS3 said “come on.” My sister and I were sitting out in the truck waiting to go to the family health center. I sat in the front seat. I was asleep the whole way home then I woken up when we got there. I went in the house, layed on the couch and fell asleep, grateful that my patience had finally paid off and I was in a more comfortable place.
500	18393	7	3	My mum is someone who is patient. One time when I was little, I got gum stuck in my hair. I was crying a lot and moving around wildly as my mom patiently tried to get the gum out of my hair. She kept on telling me to sit still, but she never got mad at me, even if she had really wanted to just stop and make me get it out myself. When she couldn't get it out and said that she would have to cut it out, I had screamed. Yet, with extreme patience, she was somehow able to cut the gum out and still keep my hair looking nice even though I wouldn't sit still. She carefully trimmed around the gum, making sure not to damage too much of my hair. I think my mom is the most patient person that I know, because whenever something happens, she is patient about it. Her patience in such situations shows her love and care for me, and I am truly lucky to have her as my mom.
501	18394	7	3	A time when I was patient was when I was at the dentist's office to get a cavity filled. When we arrived, they informed us that my appointment was actually in another half - hour, but my mom didn't want to leave. I was so bored, and there was a TV on in the waiting area, showing some old reruns. When it finally was my turn, it took the dentist, who is also my family friend, about another hour to get ready. A learning experience is that I learned to be patient when someone takes too long to do something. This incident taught me that patience can make waiting situations more bearable.
502	18395	7	3	"Beep! Beep! Beep! My alarm clock was going off and it was 7:15 am and I already missed the bus! Rushing to get out of bed, I quickly threw on my school uniform. Hoping my brother and sister were downstairs all ready waiting for me. Oh no! They weren't downstairs! Running back up the stairs as fast as if the house was on fire, I went into my brother's room and yelled, ""Jake! Jake! I already missed the bus. I don't want to be late."" Then I rushed right to my sister's room. Yelling the same thing, she quickly got out of bed and started getting dressed. Walking downstairs, thinking everything was going to be fine. I got breakfast ready, a simple bowl of cereal. Then my sister came running down. Grabbing her food, she yelled, ""Jake!"" I looked at the time. It was 7:20 am, only 10 more minutes, so I started gulping down my breakfast. But my brother didn't come down yet. Finishing my breakfast, I went back up the stairs and woke my mom and my brother up. They came downstairs behind me. My brother just took his sweet time eating breakfast. I knew now that we were going to be late. Looking back at the clock it was 7:30 am, only 5 minutes! ""We aren't going to make it"" I said. Finally, everyone hopped in the van and my mom drove us to school. My sister and I were yelling, ""Jake! Floor it!"" My mom ignored us and my brother didn't really care if we were late or not. Then finally, we made it only 3 minutes late. I guess my brother is the only patient one in the house, and this experience showed me how different our attitudes towards time can be."
503	18396	7	3	"There was a kid named Tommy who was always very patient. He always waited for everyone else and he never complained. That morning, Tommy just woke up and so did his five brothers and sisters. They all were trying to get ready for school within an hour. All of the bathrooms were taken up but Tommy didn't complain. Instead, he actually used up that time to neatly clean his room and make his bed. Tommy was a little bit late to school. The strict teacher, Mrs. Smith, said, ""Come here"" and the class said, ""Ooooo!!! Ha! Ha! Tommy is in trouble."" Mrs. Smith said, ""Come here"" and Tommy put his head down and walked slowly as if he was pulling a ton. During lunch, Tommy was at the end of the line. Once Tommy had gotten up there, there was no more food; it was all gone. The kind - hearted lunch lady saw how upset he was and she gave him a special lunch with a sandwich and a piece of fruit. Once Tommy got home, his family threw a ""Patient Party"" for him. Tommy was honored and also very happy. That night was the best for Tommy, and it reinforced that being patient is truly a virtue."
504	18398	7	3	"As my dad always tells me, patience is one of the very big keys to being successful in life. As I mature, I find out more and more that patience is important. I remember a time when I had to display patience for a long period of time. My family and I took a trip to Cedar Point along with my friend. My friend and I could only think about the biggest ride in the park, Millennium Force. ""That ride gave me the most fun, heart - stopping, adrenaline - pumping rush ever. But it would be a while before I could ride it. So we walked and walked through the crowded park, and I began to get tired with each step. After 2 hours of walking, we reached the Millennium Force. I was disappointed to find out it's a 1.5 - hour wait. The sun was blazing hot. I figured the best way to do this was to keep quiet and relax on a nearby bench for a bit. It seems that the more you complain, the longer it takes. And before we knew it, we were about to get on the ride! This experience truly showed me the value of patience in getting what you want."
505	18399	7	3	"One hour and thirty minutes, are you kidding!"" I said as my dad and I got into the line for the ride the ""Maverick"" at Cedar Point. ""That's what the sign says, but it could take longer,"" my dad replied. I said in a disappointed tone, ""I guess we can wait,"" but in my head, I reminded myself, ""You have zero, zilch, none, no patience! Why did I say yeah?"" Right when my thoughts were done, the line moved up a little. That was quick I thought. During that time to the time the line moved again, I had occupied myself by watching people on the roller - coasters and other rides go by with excitement on their faces. The line moved up again. Watching people didn't work this time, so I was thinking of how much fun the Maverick would be to ride, imagining the twists and turns, and other rides I wanted to go on next. Those thoughts lasted half - way in the line. My patience was running out. I started thinking about how close school was, how much I wanted to go back, how I didn't want to go back, what I would miss, and what I was looking forward to. We were almost there, but I was losing patience every second. I started to tap my fingers on the side of my leg nervously. I thought nothing and just tapped my fingers and moved up. We were finally at the front, and I didn't complain once! I got into a seat, and the ride started. At the end, I thought it was really worth it. Now it was time to go on more rides and not complain. That was a time I was patient, and it taught me that patience can lead to great rewards."
506	18401	7	3	"One time I was patient when we were going to @LOCATION1 for one of my baseball tournaments. It is like a @NUM1 hour drive through @LOCATION2 and that's the route we took. I was sitting in the back of the car, and I had an earache, so my ear was hurting a lot, and I had to endure the pain for @NUM1 hours. Another annoyance was that my little brother @PERSON1 was constantly trying to grab my feet. He also took his stuffed animal and started hitting me with it. I would firmly tell him to stop, but he just wouldn't listen. Eventually, I took the stuffed animal to make him stop, and he would yell at me loudly to give it back, so I would. The last challenge was that we had to wait @NUM3 minutes in a long line so we could get back into the @LOCATION3 from @LOCATION2. When we finally reached the front of the line, a guy asked my mom a question. Then he asked my two brothers and me who the two people were in the front seat, and we replied, ""Our mom and dad."" He asked that to ensure we were not being kidnapped. Those are all the reasons why I had to be patient during our @NUM1 hour drive to @ORGANIZATION1 town."
507	18402	7	3	A lot of people practice patience and wait because they don't want to make someone angry or mess up something that others are doing. People always need to be careful about their actions. I, too, am patient sometimes, and it's not that difficult to be patient; it's actually pretty easy. Everyone absolutely knows this, and those patient people out there understand it well, trust me. There are numerous different situations where I've been patient, but I'm not sure which one to choose to write about because there are so many. For example, if @CAPS1 someone is in the bathroom, you should wait patiently. But @CAPS1 if you can't hold it or it's an emergency, you can keep knocking on the door or just use another one. Or if @CAPS1 someone is using the computer, then wait for your turn. However, @CAPS1 if it's been over an hour, you can politely tell that person to get off, not to be mean, but because you also need to use it and have your turn. There's no way you can't be patient for at least @NUM1 or @NUM2 minutes. It's not too hard. It's pretty easy, and everyone knows this too.
508	18403	7	3	I am going to write about a time I was patient. The time I was patient was when I went to Fuzzy's, and it took an unexpectedly long time. It took @NUM1 minutes, and it seemed like it would never end. It was a @ORGANIZATION1. I think the reason why it felt like forever was probably because I hadn't eaten anything all day. There were me, my mom, and my dad. At Fuzzy's, you can also buy ice cream. My stomach was growling and hurting, and I was extremely hungry. I tried to distract myself, but it was tough. Some people have a lot of patience, and others don't. I usually kind of have patience, but this time I was really struggling. Now when I get a @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1, it doesn't seem that long. That is a time I needed patience.
509	18404	7	3	A time when I was patient was at the beginning of the seventh - grade year. It was fourth hour, and the principal made an announcement. The principal said that the sixth graders had taken too long at lunch, causing a delay for our grade. As the rest of the class started complaining loudly, I sat there calmly and patiently. It wasn't really a pleasant experience just sitting there, bored and hungry. I kept fidgeting in my seat, but I managed to keep my cool. Then, after what seemed like an eternity, our grade was finally called down to have lunch. That was the time when I was patient over something.
510	18405	7	3	My mom was patient when she was in line to get her driver's license. It took a whopping three hours to get her driver's license. She was clearly angry, but she managed to stay patient. To make matters worse, the lady who was supposed to give out the driver's licenses took a break. When she came back, my mom had to wait another three hours, and she still remained patient. I was there with her, and I also tried to be patient. However, I really wanted to yell at the lady for taking a break and making us wait for an extra hour. Another time, my mom waited in line under the scorching sun. The heat was burning, and the only thing she did to cool down was to drink some water for about two hours under eighty - one degrees. Despite the discomfort, she was still incredibly patient. My mom's patience in these situations is truly admirable.
511	18406	7	3	"The time I was impatient. On the morning of @DATE1, I groggily rose out of bed, sleepily brushed my teeth, quickly got dressed, and hurriedly ate breakfast. Then, me, my mom, and my brother piled into the car and drove to the doctor's office, which is an hour away from our house. I was not happy because I was extremely tired and just kept thinking about how long I was going to be sitting there, simply waiting for the doctor to say @CAPS2 @CAPS3. But no, I had to sit there, staring blankly at the walls. So now we're here, and I'm just so unhappy to sit and wait because my mom has told me thousands of times, ""You need to stop being so impatient."" Well, I can't help it. Anyway, my mom just signed me in, so I guess I'll just look at the magazines. Boring, boring, boring. They don't even have any interesting magazines. ""Come on,"" I said. My mom said, ""You need to wait. Sure, they will call your name any second."" Well, not any second because it's been about @NUM1 boring minutes. Oh look, it's time for lunch, but no, we have to still just sit here and wait. Gosh, I'm so hungry. Well, finally, the doctor just called my name, and it's time to wait again! In conclusion, there was a time I was impatient. I was impatient waiting at the doctor's, just sitting there. That's why if it has something to do with waiting, ""I'm not interested."
512	18407	7	3	Once upon a time, there were two boys named @ORGANIZATION1 and @PERSON1. @ORGANIZATION1 was obvious and always had to have things his way. He was quite stubborn. @PERSON1, on the other hand, always waited his turn patiently and was willing to share. One day, while watching @CAPS1 TV, they saw a rocket - building kit and excitedly asked their dad if they could get it. His dad called the store and was told that it would take @CAPS2 weeks to arrive. When @ORGANIZATION1 learned it was @CAPS2 weeks, he threw a fit. He stamped his feet and pouted. On the other hand, @PERSON1 calmly said @CAPS3. Dad went to work. Days passed, and @ORGANIZATION1 would always pester dad around because he couldn't wait. @PERSON1 just took it like it was an ordinary day. @ORGANIZATION1 would sit by the window and watch the mailbox with his eyes locked on it. Eventually, the day came. @ORGANIZATION1 ran out and quickly picked his rocket up. In that time, @PERSON1 slowly walked out the door. When the two of them had the rockets in their hands, they opened them up. @ORGANIZATION1 was disappointed because he wanted to play now but first he had to build it. @PERSON1 carefully took his time following the step - by - step instructions, and in no time, his rocket was done. @ORGANIZATION1 just crammed the pieces together, and the rocket came out crooked and broke. @ORGANIZATION1 yelled loudly. @PERSON1 went to @ORGANIZATION1 and told him he would help, and in @NUM1 minutes, they finished. Together they played and had fun. The end.
513	18408	7	3	Lost in @PERSON1 @PERSON1 @CAPS1 was early @DATE1. The leaves were just beginning to change into beautiful hues of red, orange, and yellow and were gently fluttering down above our heads. My mother, sister, a friend of hers, and I piled into the car and drove a few minutes to @ORGANIZATION1, which was literally in our backyard. I had my camera and was very thorough at getting a shot of @CAPS2. I carefully adjusted the settings and looked for the perfect angles. My mother and the others were very patient with me, letting me be slow on the hike. The thing about @PERSON1 is that there aren't very many trail maps, so you can easily become confused or lost. After hiking a long way, we came to a fork in the road where a map was. My mother checked her cell phone and told us we had forty - five minutes until we had to take our new kitten to the vet. I suggested we start heading back so we could get home in time to pick up the kitten and arrive on time, considering the long drive to the vet's. My mother, instead of taking my advice, started us off in the completely different direction. My sister and her friend complained, dragging their feet along the path. For the next mile or so, we continued without finding a map. My sister and I became increasingly frustrated with my mother and with being lost. Because we had gotten lost in the monotonous field and trees, my mother had to get out her dying cell phone and call my father to bring the kitten to the vet. I was really looking forward to taking him, which made me even more stressed. Finally, after another half - hour of walking, we ended up at the exit. I was so happy that I almost kissed the car. @CAPS2 turned out all right, and my mother was always patient with us even when we complained and moaned.
514	18409	7	3	One time I was patient was when I was in science class taking a test. I was patient because I went up to the teacher because I needed help, and so did the kid in front of me. He was standing there, looking a bit confused, trying to explain his problem. It took him a while, but I just stood there quietly and waited. It took him around @NUM1 minutes because he needed help with a lot of things. He was struggling with multiple concepts. The teacher was patiently explaining to him, and I listened intently too. That is the time I was patient.
515	18411	7	3	I have a few friends who sometimes ask me for help on something like school work or homework. Some of them take a while to explain things to. They might stutter or have a hard time expressing their thoughts clearly. I must use patience in order to help them. And I'll be realistic, not everyone has a lot of patience and gets frustrated easily, like me sometimes. There have been times when I've been on the phone for an hour trying to explain homework to one of my friends. I've had to repeat things several times and use different examples. Soon I will once again have to show patience when I tutor for @CAPS1. I know that the students might have various levels of understanding and might ask a lot of questions. To me, patience is one of the most important characteristics someone can have because it allows us to help others effectively and build good relationships.
516	18412	7	3	I am not a very patient person. But when the situation demands it, I can be patient. For example, at my house, we only have one bathroom. I really hate waiting to use it. But I have to wait because I don't want to have an accident, so I will wait patiently. I also have to wait for my bus. I hate waiting as it's so incredibly boring. But patience is a good quality to possess. If we didn't have patience, there would be a lot of deaths from car accidents, murders, and people having nervous breakdowns. My sister is very patient; she can wait in one spot for hours. One time, it was the night before Halloween, and I was all fidgety from waiting until the bell rang so we could go trick - or - treating. She waited calmly while she did her hair, and I complained. That is a clear reason why patience is important. In daily life, we often face situations that require patience, and learning to be patient can make our lives much more peaceful and harmonious.
517	18413	7	3	"Have you ever been to the doctor? Well, on @DATE1, my brother, sister, and I had a doctor's appointment, and we missed school because of it. When we got there, the waiting room was packed with people. So we sat down and waited. We had been waiting for three and a half hours, so I started to get impatient and hungry. I told my mom I was hungry, and everyone agreed with me. So my mom went to the food court to get us some pizza and water. When we were done with our pizza, we waited for another three hours. I started to get really angry because we had been there for a couple of hours. Finally, the nurse called out ""Kimberly"", which is my mom's name, so we stood up. Then she said ""@PERSON1"". I got so impatient that I yelled out and said, ""@CAPS1, it's our turn! We've been waiting here for a long time, and I can't wait @CAPS1 more!"" My mom finally calmed me down, and I said sorry for my rude behavior. When I sat down and started waiting again, just in a second, it was our turn. That's why patience is very important in such situations, as it helps us avoid unnecessary outbursts and makes the waiting process more bearable."
518	18414	7	3	"Patience is one of the most important things in life. Patience means being understanding and tolerant. For example, a kid's mom left for work. She takes @NUM1 hours to complete her work and then comes home. When she finally arrived home, the kid said, ""That was quick."" This simple situation shows what patience is all about. In our daily lives, having patience allows us to better handle the wait for various things, and it makes our relationships and experiences more pleasant. We should all strive to cultivate this valuable quality to lead happier and more fulfilling lives."
519	18415	7	3	For me, I'm not that patient because if someone gets too close to me or any of my friends in an unfriendly way, I will go off on them. You can see that I don't tolerate my friends being picked on by someone they don't even know, or someone I don't know. There was this one time when me and my friends were walking down the hallway at school. This kid seemed to come out of nowhere and started to push my friend around. I immediately asked the kid what his problem was, and he said it was none of my business. Well, you see, he's picking on one of my friends, so I wasn't going to stand by. He stopped picking on my friend and tried to pick on me. But he didn't know that I had my brother and other friends around the corner of the building. So I had the friend who was right next to me go and get them, and he did. When the kid saw them coming, he ran away. This incident shows that sometimes, our lack of patience can be a way to protect our friends, but in general, we should also try to handle such situations more calmly when possible.
520	18416	7	3	One time when I was patient was when my mom's car needed a new battery, and I had to go to school. My mom called her friend who lived down the street to come and give us a boost. We waited for an hour and a half for her. My mom called her back, and she said she couldn't make it because she needed an oil change. After that, we walked to the bus stop for thirty minutes. The bus picked us up and took us to @ORGANIZATION1 and @PERSON1. Then we walked the rest of the way for @NUM1 mile until @PERSON1, where there was another bus that took us to @NUM2 mile and @PERSON1, where my school is. That was a time when I showed patience. Even though the journey to school was full of unexpected delays, being patient helped me get through that difficult morning and still reach school on time. Patience in such situations allows us to adapt to unforeseen circumstances and achieve our goals.
521	18417	7	3	Patience is about waiting for something. For instance, if you're expecting new shoes that will arrive in two weeks, instead of pacing around worriedly all the time, you should remain calm, just like a hound patiently waiting. Take hunting as an example; you sit quietly and wait for a deer to come. If you're impatient, you might go out looking for one. Sometimes, many people can get impatient about something and become ill - tempered. Being patient means understanding why something takes a long time. You have to accept it if it doesn't come on the @DATE1 it's supposed to. One time, I had a @CAPS1 appointment at @TIME1, and my mom and I had to wait until five o'clock. We didn't get angry, just a bit bored. Another time, a friend of mine was waiting for his dad, who didn't come home until the @DATE1. In the end, patience helps us deal with the uncertainties of waiting.
522	18418	7	3	"Patience is when you are calmly waiting for something, someone, or for something to happen. When I was little, I went to the doctor to get a shot. Mom didn't tell me it was for a shot; instead, I was thinking I was just going to go in and come out with a sucker. I was really excited about that sucker. I had asked my mom when I could have a sucker, and she said, ""Wait a little while, be patient."" So, I sat in the waiting area, trying to be patient. I went into the room and got the shot and finally got my sucker. But I was angry with my mom because she knows I hate needles. However, this experience taught me that sometimes patience is needed even when we don't like the outcome."
523	18419	7	3	"A beaker bubbled in @LOCATION1 lab. I could clearly smell the pungent sulfur smell wafting from the beaker. "" @CAPS1 what's going on!"" I yelped across the room. "" @CAPS2 found the cure for the cancer!"" @CAPS3 said as @CAPS3 had a little jubilant dance that @CAPS3 showed off. I am a doctor, and I wasn't so sure at first, but I told him I had a patient with extreme brain cancer. "" @CAPS4 let's go try it out!"" @CAPS3 screamed. As I zoomed to the car and waited while @CAPS3 packed up his lab equipment. After @NUM1 minutes, I was pondering where @CAPS3 could be. I thought to myself, ""@CAPS3's just having a hard time packing up."" So, I turned on the radio and fell asleep. After a couple of hours, I woke up in shock. I had been sleeping @NUM2 ½ hours! I rushed inside to find him holding a ball of fur wrapped in his lab coat. ""I saved this kitten's life with my cure for cancer."" @CAPS3 said out of breath. I was glad I was patient or the kitten would have not lived. Just as I was thinking about how nice it was that @CAPS3 saved the kitten, my pager dinged. @PERSON1, the lady with extreme brain cancer needed our help. @CAPS3 got one vial of his cancer solution and we rushed to the hospital. There I saw @PERSON1 laying there as translucent as light hitting off paper. I quickly got her heart rate down. At this moment, I wasn't sure if she would live. "" @CAPS6 give it to her?"" the mad scientist asked. I made a risky choice. "" @CAPS7, not yet."" I waited five minutes and then poured it in. @PERSON1 came back to life. Even though @PERSON1 couldn't talk, I could tell by her smile that she was very thankful I was patient. Her daughter walked into the room and said, ""Thank you."" I only smiled back, realizing that patience can truly make a difference in saving lives."
524	18421	7	3	I am patient wherever I go, whether it's to the dentist's office, orthodontist, or doctor's office. The first place is the dentist's office. When I have to wait to get my teeth cleaned, I usually sit there and read magazines. The waiting room is often filled with other patients, and the time can seem to drag on. The next place I am patient is at the orthodontist. I sit and wait in the first room and listen to my iPod. After a few minutes, they call me into the second room where I wait a little longer to get my braces tightened. Once I get in the office, I have to wait for the orthodontist to adjust them. Finally, there is the doctor's office. You sit in the big waiting room for a long time and wait for the lady to call you in. If you're getting shots, you have to wait patiently for the doctor to bring them. As you can see, a lot of things in these places take patience, and it's an important quality to have in such situations.
525	18422	7	3	"One day I had to go to the doctors office to get shots. When we got into the doctors office, I had to wait in some really uncomfortable chairs, sitting beside my dad. It was my first time getting shots, and I had no idea how it felt. Since I was little, it was harder for me to have patience. I just wanted the whole thing to be over with. I kept on asking my dad, ""Is the doctor coming yet?"" and my dad would always say, ""Be patient."" It got to the point when my dad was so frustrated that he told me to go play with some toys, which I didn't notice until then. But when I saw those fun - looking toys gleaming in the sunlight filtering through the window, I ran to them. But after a few minutes, it got so boring. The toys didn't hold my interest for long, so I went back and sat down. It was getting so boring that I could hardly stand it! I wanted to scream! But then I didn't want to let my dad know how impatient I was because I wanted him to think I was patient. I was about to yell as loud as I could, but then my doctor came out and said, "" @CAPS1,"" and I was relieved that the doctor finally came to give me shots. But what I didn't know was that I was going to be in horrible pain for a few days. Still, this experience taught me the value of trying to be patient even in difficult waiting situations."
526	18423	7	3	I play hockey. I am a goalie. A good goalie is always patient. On my old hockey team, me and the other goalie faced lots of 1 - on - 1 shots. These 1 - on - 1 situations were intense, with the opposing player bearing down on us. Most of the 1 - on - 1 shots didn’t matter but a few of them did, and they were the hardest to stop. My team had never lost a game but we had a few very close games. In one of the games, the score was 1 to 6 and my team had the lead. It was towards the end of the game and they had a 1 - on - 1 against me. The shooter was skating in from the side and he cut across the middle of the ice. It was tempting to go down but I stayed on my feet. I waited for the shooter to get to a point where he had no place to go and he shot and I stopped it. That was one of the only crucial shots of the game and I stopped it, helping my team secure the win.
527	18424	7	3	“@CAPS1 on hurry up,” my friend said impatiently. “I know, be patient,” I calmly replied. Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant. A patient person endures situations without complaining. One day, we had a basketball game away at a different school. My team and I all went to the bathroom. I was the last one to go into a stall. They all left and one girl stayed behind, waiting for me. Being patient is always a good thing. Have you ever heard something like “Patience is a virtue”? Well, if you don’t get used to being patient, you might miss out on many good things in life.
528	18426	7	3	One time when another person I know was patient was when my friend stood in line for over an hour to get the tickets for the show we're going to see. The line was long and snaked around the venue. This shows patience because my friend did not complain while standing in line, despite the time passing slowly and the crowd getting a bit restless. It was clear that my friend understood the value of waiting to enjoy the show later, and this act of patience was truly admirable.
529	18427	7	3	One time my often - best friend and I went to a theme park. It was so hot outside but the first ride we wanted to go on was called the @CAPS1. The line was super long, it was like going through a maze because of how the ropes were tied up. We stood in the line for about forty - five minutes but it felt like two hours. The sun was beating down on us, and the heat was almost unbearable. But I didn’t really complain about it except for my friend. She kept complaining about how hot it was and how her large feet were tired. But when we finally got there, we started rolling, not knowing what to expect. When we sat down in the roller coaster, it was so much fun. The twists, turns, and drops were exhilarating. I think it was definitely worth waiting for.
530	18428	7	3	A time when I was patient was when I wanted a [specific thing] for my birthday. But I couldn’t get it because my mom had to pay the rent. So I waited patiently and then finally it was my birthday. I didn’t have it but then 1 month went by and it was [a special occasion] and I got it and I was so happy. Another time when I was patient was when I had to babysit my cousin for [a certain amount of time]. And I waited a few weeks for my uncle to give me my money but he did not. So I waited some more and finally, he came to give me my money. But not only did he give me [the agreed amount] he gave me a late fee [a specific amount] and I was happy. And that added up to the money that my mom gave me and it was [a total amount] and I went skating and to the store with my friends. And I spent some of it at [a place] and on [a date] it was really great. Another time when I was patient was when it was 6 days before my birthday and I was leaving a sleepover. I went to go buy everything and it was like the next day was my [a special - numbered] birthday. I did everything I wanted and had so much fun it was like heaven at my house. All these experiences taught me that patience truly pays off.
531	18429	7	3	Patience. Patience is something I have absolutely nothing of! I take after my mom in this area. My mom is probably a little bit worse than me but we are both pretty bad. Sometimes we record TV shows and watch them later just because we don’t want to have to wait through the commercials. Some of the other things I hate to wait through are long lines at the grocery store, people being late for our meet - ups, and just plain old waiting around doing nothing. The longest amount of time I can stay patient for is about five minutes. Any longer than that puts me over the edge. By the way, another thing I can't stand is long car rides when I have nothing to do. I just wish we could have a three - hour drive turn into a three - minute drive but still end up at the same place. I really wish I could have more patience but I don’t know how to get it. I really hope that you have enough patience to get through my story, as I know my impatience might be a bit much to handle.
532	18430	7	3	One time I had to be really patient. It was when I was on my way to Florida to see my family. It took four days to get down there. It would have taken two or three days but we stopped a lot. My dad wanted to go to all of the stores and restaurants on the way. It made me kinda mad because we didn’t need to go to all of them but to my dad we did. On our way, it felt like two weeks of endless stops and slow driving. My uncle Tom called us every five minutes on the way. He kept saying things like “how close are you?”, “when are you going to get here?”, “are you lost?”, and “did you get me some cocoa puffs?” I thought that was really funny. My uncle loves cocoa puffs. I mean I like them too but not that much. When we finally got down there, my legs hurt so bad from sitting in the back of my dad's car. I walked around for two hours to get the feeling back into my legs. In the end, it was all worth it to see my family, but that journey really tested my patience.
533	18432	7	3	The time I was patient was when I went bass fishing with my step - dad. I could not wait for long so I decided to talk to myself or sing silly songs to pass the time. My step - dad said “you set your pole down on a slingshot holder and do whatever”. So I went to walk around, explore the beautiful scenery around the lake, and I was thinking about how I could practice patience. I was about to go check on my pole and I got nothing. So I felt it was okay to take it easy for a while, so I sat and waited and waited. But until that moment, my pole started to jerk around so I quickly reeled it in and caught a large bass. I was so happy. My step - dad said “see, you do got patience”. This experience taught me that with a little distraction and perseverance, I can be patient.
534	18433	7	3	The time I needed patience. We were at the grocery store, Albertsons to be exact. When we first got there, I was excited because we were going to get lots of junk food, but then. We started to get lots of food and it looked really good. I started to have the urge to just eat it all right then. The cart was half - way full. Then we got more stuff and it was so full that we had to get another cart, and I started to get hungry. By the time we were in the meat section, I was starving. My mom said “let me just get a couple of things”. So I waited, and waited until she told me to go to the checkout. All of the lines were so long and I felt like I was about to burst with hunger. Then this little girl walked up to me getting smart. I could not take it, I was about to tell that little girl off. But I had to calm myself down. Then I realized it was our turn and I was so happy. When I got home, mom cooked bacon and I was just ready to go to bed after that long and patience - testing grocery trip.
535	18434	7	3	As I waited at the airport, I gazed at all the people walking by. I pondered these thoughts in my head: “when will dad be here?” How long have I been waiting and what time is it? Wasn't his flight supposed to be here twenty minutes ago? Then suddenly I heard a soft female voice “dad will be here soon, honey don't worry.” I don't understand why my mother told a ten - year - old not to worry; it was in our nature to be anxious. I was about to lose my patience, but then I asked myself “what good does complaining do? It only makes you upset.” As these things ran through my mind, I gained back my patience. An hour later, I felt my mom shaking my shoulder and telling me to wake up. When I opened my eyes, I saw my dad standing in front of me. I ran to him and gave him a hug. “I almost lost my patience,” I said. I'm so glad I stayed patient because if I wasn't, it would've ruined my father's trip. Patience is a good thing to have, you can gain or lose things from it. In this case, I think I gained the joy of a warm reunion with my dad.
536	18435	7	3	"A time I was patient was one time we were at the store and I was extremely excited to go to the toys section. ""We're going to have to go to the groceries first,"" said mom. I was really mad and mom said, ""Be patient. The quicker we do this, the faster we'll get to the toys."" Then we were finally done with the groceries and then we had to go to the clothes section. I was really, really mad. Mom said, ""The quicker we do this, the faster we get to the toys."" Next, I had to try on clothes. ""I hate trying on clothes,"" I said. Then I was extremely excited because we got to go to the toys section. I was extremely happy. I looked and looked, and then mom said, ""I could pick out a toy."" It was extremely hard to choose. I didn't know what to pick till I saw a cool truck. It had big tires, it had flames, and it was green. I asked, ""Please, please?"" And mom said, ""You can get it."" I was extremely happy. And that was a time I was patient."
537	18436	7	3	I was patient getting my gaming system. It took forever to get it. I had to be so patient getting the system. It took me ten months to get it. On my birthday, he and I went to all the GameStops in Tyler to get it. I was in the car for hours to get there. When we went into the first GameStop we looked at, they had one inside. It was in good condition. I got three games for it. And that was the time I was patient. It was really worth the wait as I finally had my desired gaming system with some great games.
538	18438	7	3	"Once upon a time, in a land full of activity, there was a girl named Lily. One day, Lily and her mom were going to watch a movie called ""The Adventure"" from Hollywood. However, when they got to the theater, the tickets were sold out, and so they had to watch another movie. It must've been a bad day because once they got up to the ticket counter, they realized they had forgotten something! Lily and her mom left and went to go eat. They went to a place called ""Tasty Bites"" and got in line to order! They ordered their food, sat back down, and ate. Once they were done, they left and went to try again with the movie. However, when they did, the line was as long as a mile! Lily's mum just told her to be patient and wait. When they were there, they finally got the last ticket available. After that, her mom asked, ""So honey, were you patient?"" When they got home, they plopped on the couch, got a snack, and waited for Lily's sister and dad to get home. Finally, they arrived with a big surprise, and Lily's dad was holding tickets to go see the movie Lily and her mom had just seen! ""We were trying to find you all day,"" said her father. ""We couldn't find you,"" said her sister. Lily and her mom looked at each other and explained, ""We were patient and waited in line and got the last ticket available!"" ""And we won fifty dollars too!"" exclaimed Lily. It was truly an eventful day."
539	18441	7	3	"I am going to talk about what I think patience is. I think patience is about waiting calmly and without complaint. For example, ""You were very patient in line for cotton candy,"" said the clown. You know, something like that when you have to stand in a long line and not get irritated. I know this is a short story, but I hope it gives a clear idea of what patience can be like in a simple situation."
540	18442	7	3	"I remember one day I was waiting in the waiting room in the doctor's office with my mom because I wasn't feeling well. We sat there talking for about ten minutes when my mom said, ""Hey, it's already been ten minutes."" ""I wonder when I will get to go and talk to my doctor,"" I said. ""I don't know, but let's wait a bit longer,"" Mom said. So as we waited and sat patiently, more kids started coming in. I noticed some were young and some were older. I sighed. ""What is taking so long?"" I wondered. Was my doctor even here today? I stared at the wall and looked at the color of it. It was orange. Before I knew it, half an hour passed. My mom was looking at her watch. ""Hey, it's almost 3 o'clock!"" ""Ugh!"" I said, flustered and annoyed. ""Are we just gonna sit here all day?"" I asked. Finally, my question was answered as a nurse said I could finally come back to a room and speak with my doctor about my sickness. ""Thanks for being patient!"" the nurse said, smiling. I smiled back. I had been patient, and it finally paid off as I got to see the doctor."
541	18444	7	3	One day my mom said I could get this cool new toy at the store. But my mom had some other errands to run before we went to the store, so I had to be patient and wait. My mom had to go to her workplace because she forgot an important document. Then she had to stop at the gas station to fill up the car. After taking care of these things, we finally went to the store and I happily got the toy that I wanted.
542	18445	7	3	Patience can come in different ways in life. For one thing, it can reward you handsomely at the end. For example, it can bring a much bigger pay - off if you are patient because the reward would be more significant to you. Another aspect is that it allows you to engage in other meaningful activities in the process. For instance, when you are waiting for something, you can use that time to do something else, and when the time comes, you truly deserve the outcome. Also, being patient might be difficult, but you can manage it if you stay calm. Some people can't wait and just want to rush through things to get them done. My final point is that if you can exercise patience once in your life, the second time becomes easier. The second instance won't be as hard because you'll be more composed. That is how I understand patience.
543	18446	7	3	"When I'm being patient, I behave nicely and I don't complain. I genuinely like to be patient and when I act well, I don't feel frustrated. Sometimes, people have a hard time calming down. And when something takes an eternity, I sometimes mutter ""come on"". I'm always patient at school, at restaurants, and wherever I go. But sometimes, I can't be patient. I don't want people thinking I'm weird for waiting for something. I just need a bit of time, and I try to be patient in lines at the mall and at the fair. The fair sometimes has really long lines. My goal is to be patient in everything, but sometimes things take too long and it's a struggle, yet I still strive to be patient."
544	18448	7	3	"In the writing prompt, I chose to write a story about a time when I was patient. I am going to talk about the time I skipped school to go fishing with my dad and my uncle @PERSON1. I didn't get to sleep in much; I still got up at about the same time I do to go to school. I had to quietly get out of the house before my brother saw me because he wasn't going with us. We quickly got in the car and drove to my uncle @PERSON1's house. When we arrived at his house, my dad began carefully packing all the fishing gear onto the boat. Once we finished that, we hopped in my uncle @PERSON1's old, rusty, red truck. The red paint was chipping all over the truck's body. We started to drive, and my uncle @PERSON1 had to constantly keep an eye on the boat. The boat was extremely small. It just barely managed to fit all of us. It was only about a foot and a half wide and about @NUM1 foot long. It made me a bit scared when we put the boat in the water and started moving. We went through a beautiful, winding river all the way to the back of the @ORGANIZATION1. The area we were on is called @ORGANIZATION1. It is in @LOCATION1. I was patient right when we got there. I initially thought we were going to stand, so I had second thoughts about fishing. It turned out, we just sat there while we fished. We fished for a good @NUM2 hours that day. I was very patient waiting for my bobber to go down so I could set the hook. ""Bite!"" my uncle @PERSON1 said. It means that the bobber is going under the water like a submarine does. We had @NUM2 rods out at once! @NUM4 pike rods, and @NUM1 bluegill rods! I caught the biggest bluegill of the day that day! This day was one of the best days of my life!! That is about the time I had to be patient on the @ORGANIZATION1 for @NUM2 hours straight."
545	18449	7	3	One day I was at the store with my friends. I picked out a delicious slurpee and got in line to buy it. Then an old lady got in line behind me. So, to be nice, I let her go in front of me. After a while, she found out that she was a dollar short. So I kindly gave her a dollar. She turned to me, said thanks, and gave me a mint. After I bought my slurpee, me and my friends had to cross the road. We stood there for @NUM1 to @NUM2 minutes, but it felt like an hour. We finally crossed the road and started walking to my house. On the way, my friend said he had to use the restroom. So we went to the market. We had to wait for what seemed like an hour before he came back out of the market. He told us he got lost inside. We then walked home, and on that day, I learned that it's tough to be patient, but it's also a virtue worth having.
546	18450	7	3	Two summers ago, I volunteered to help out with the kids camp at my local church. I was assigned to assist with the preschoolers for the entire week, and this task demanded a great deal of patience. The preschoolers were extremely excited and rambunctious. They were constantly running around the room and shouting with joy. I had to maintain a calm voice and be patient with the children because losing my temper would only worsen the situation. Later in the week, I was put in charge of a young boy with special needs. He simply couldn't sit still for even a minute! I had to remind him over and over again not to be so loud. He was very determined to get what he wanted, which made it difficult for me to stay calm. Despite the hardship, I managed to remain patient and calm. Eventually, the little boy decided that I was all right and started to behave himself. Now, every time he sees me in the hallway, he says, “hi!” very excitedly. I'm really glad that I stayed patient as it helped build a positive relationship with him.
547	18451	7	3	One day I was at my aunt and uncle's house to celebrate my cousin's birthday. He was turning 10 years old. So we played games on the trampoline outside. It was so much fun jumping up and down. Then we came inside to relax and watch some interesting television shows. After a while, we played with their cute dog. It was so friendly and kept wagging its tail. Then a lot of relatives came over. We went outside for a third time to play some more games. After that, we had to come inside and dress up for dinner. We all sat around the table and ate delicious turkey, baked potatoes, cheesy potatoes, green beans, and squash. The food was pretty good. Then they wanted us to work on a project. It was a small jar with a candle in it. We had to carefully cover it in tissue paper and it used lots of glue. I had to wait patiently as I was the last one to start. So I just sat there and waited. Then finally I got to do my project but I was the only one there sitting at the table doing it. It actually turned out pretty good after all the hard work. Being patient can get you very far in life. You have to be patient in a job, at a restaurant, and in lots of other situations. So remember just be patient and you'll be okay. Being patient will guide you through your whole life as it helps you handle difficult situations calmly.
548	18453	7	3	I am going to write a story about a time that I was patient. When I was eleven, on a cold winter day, my mother was due to have her baby. I couldn't wait as I was so excited to become a big sibling. We went to the doctor's office and we were led into her room. Me and Sarah, my mom's best friend, went to accompany her. When we got into the room, my mother was having strong contractions. She was yelling, screaming in pain and squeezing my dad's hand tightly. I got really scared while she was yelling and I didn't want her to get hurt. I walked out of the room and me and Sarah went to a nearby store to get the baby, a little girl, her first pretty dress. After a while, the baby came home. She was always crying, especially at night. That's when I learned to be patient while holding the baby, gently rocking her to soothe her. Patience is truly a virtue when it comes to taking care of a new - born.
549	18454	7	3	Patience is essential when interacting with others. I learned this during a visit to the dentist's office. This Tuesday morning, I had a dentist appointment, since it had been six months since my last one. As I was sitting in the waiting room, patiently looking through a magazine, a boy came in with a severe toothache. He was holding his cheek and looked really miserable. The dentists decided to treat him first. I completely understand why they made that decision. I could tell that the boy was in a lot of pain. Shortly after the boy went to get treated, an older woman came in with a mysterious pain in her mouth. She was frowning and seemed very uncomfortable. It turned out to be a root canal, and they decided to examine and treat her before me. I also understood that decision as she clearly needed immediate attention. After the woman went to get treated, a little girl came walking in, bragging about her first loose tooth. Her mom said she wanted the little girl's tooth pulled. When the dentist called her back before me, I got really frustrated. The girl was in no pain at all. In fact, she was pretty happy she had a loose tooth, skipping around the waiting room. I didn't think it was fair that I had to wait another 15 minutes so that she could get her tooth pulled. I had to show a lot of patience because my appointment got pushed back over two hours. I thought about how I felt when I lost my first tooth, all excited and full of joy. Then I didn't mind her going in front of me. All in all, patience is a very important trait that people should exhibit on a daily basis. I learned a very important lesson that day: Patience should always be mandatory in our daily lives as it helps us understand others better.
550	18455	7	3	One time my friend began patiently waiting for the teacher while he was talking to another student. She stood there quietly, looking at the teacher with an expectant look on her face. After what seemed like a long time, the teacher was finally done talking with the other student. Then she was able to get the answer to the question that she needed. It was a simple yet great example of how patience can lead to getting what you want. That is a time when my friend showed patience, and it taught me that being patient in such situations is really important as it helps maintain a good relationship with teachers and gets the job done.
551	18456	7	3	Patients is about many things. First, there are different ways to express patience. For instance, some people show it through calmness, while others do so by quietly waiting. Second, people either have patience or they don't. I admit I am one of those people that don't have patience. My mom is always saying, “@CAPS1 your horses.” @CAPS2 I know. I don't have patience so why does she have to tell me I don't? I don't have any patience in grocery shopping. I can't wait to get out, but everyone hates it right? Lines, long and winding lines, man do I hate them. They take forever, wherever you go. Plus it is really nice when you let someone out if they are in a big hurry or something in an emergency. The goodness in you just can't help it when you have a little girl that needs to cut you. So you see, patience can take a toll or some people have no problem with it. It just depends on who you are. Patience has a lot to do with complaining. But not the way you think. When you are patient, you don't complain at all. You just chill and go with the flow of things that are around you. Especially when you are in a difficult situation, it helps to have patient people than non - patient people with you. Well, this talks about patience and how people deal, relate, and chill about it. In the end, patience is a trait that varies from person to person and can greatly affect our daily experiences.
552	18458	7	3	I remember the time I got my new puppy. We had to be patient. We had to be patient because he wasn't fully potty - trained yet and he was extremely crazy. My dog is @CAPS1 and they are known for herding cows. So whenever we used to go outside, he would vigorously bite our shoes. I don't know why it would try to move us but it did. We had to be very patient when we trained him. It took until he was @NUM1 and a half years old to figure out that he wasn't supposed to do that. But now, my dog is still growing into new hobbies. We just have to stay calm and patient and then we are able to train him. It takes a long time for @CAPS2 dog to break his habits, so we must stay patient. This is the time when I was patient. In conclusion, patience is key when it comes to raising and training a puppy.
553	18459	7	3	My mom woke me up early in the morning and said I need to get up and get ready fast. I asked what was the matter and she said we're going to Potter Park Zoo. I @CAPS5ít know why, maybe just a sudden idea. I got all dressed and we hit the road. I wasn't feeling well that morning. We stopped to get Subway breakfast. I didn't eat my sandwich though because my stomach hurt too bad. It seemed like @NUM1 long hours before we finally got there. I was feeling better now. We paid and got a map and started looking at all the awesome animals. I got to see @NUM1 giant wolves, slithering snakes, playful monkeys, majestic lions, cute pekos, tall camels, and a @CAPS1 of other animals. It was so fun! We got to this bird cage that you can go in and the birds are just flying around freely! There was a little boy in there and a bird landed right on the top of his head! @CAPS6 my mom's phone rang. It was my brother. He said he was home because he didn't wanna get up. I could barely hear my mom over the noisy birds. She walked out and stood outside. I followed her. She was saying, “@CAPS2 @CAPS3, because I said so you @CAPS5ít need to go anywhere.” @CAPS4 thing I know she was hanging up. We walked toward the fish building when her phone rang. “@CAPS5ít ever hang up on me again! @CAPS3, I @CAPS5ít need to fight with you! It's going to storm I want you home!” @CAPS6 it starts pouring rain and my mom's still on the phone. I was getting very wet and bored. I really wanted to see the fish. About @NUM3 minutes later, my mom hung up her phone. We walked in soaking wet! My mom smiled at me and said, “@CAPS7 for being so patient!” Even with all the interruptions and the rain, the zoo visit was still a great experience, and patience made it bearable.
554	18460	7	3	The time I was patient is when we had to do mcap tests. I was one of the first ones done, so I had to sit quietly and read. I sat there, turning the pages of my book, and read most of it. It took about an hour for everyone to finish. It was a very long time to just sit and read. I got bored but I sat quiet so people could finish, and so I wouldn't be disruptive. Then when everyone finished, we took a bathroom break. Patience during that test - waiting time was important as it allowed the testing process to go smoothly for everyone.
555	18461	7	3	One opportunity for patience was when I was a little kid. Patience came into play when my mom and my cousin Cindy was talking. My cousin told me when your mom and I are done talking, wait your turn, so I did wait for my turn. When they were deeply talking, I asked my mom if I can go for a bike ride. I told my mom I can ride my bike without training wheels. My mom came up because I was going for surgery. I was waiting for the surgery. The surgery was some kind of procedure. So I was waiting until it was done. It was fun. In the end, waiting patiently for my turn to talk and for the surgery to be over taught me the value of patience at a young age.
556	18463	7	3	I tested my patience when I was waiting for a bus. You know, if you have patience, if you say to yourself at one time, you will know if you have it then. I will be strong and try not to get impatient at some time. You will never be completely patient all the time, of course. I was at a go - kart race. I had to be patient to see the finish. I got impatient, then I had to wait to get food so I could have some time to do what I wanted. So I knew that by that @MONTH1 experience, that's how I got my patience.
557	18464	7	3	There was a time when I was truly patient. The time I was patient was when my cousins @PERSON1, @PERSON2, and @PERSON3 were playing the Wii. And I said, “I'll play after the winner.” My cousin @PERSON2 won, and @PERSON1 didn't give me the controller and she wasn't sharing. I then said she could play one more time, then it's my turn. Instead, she played four more times. I said, “@PERSON1, it's my turn. You played and I didn't.” She said, “It is not your turn.” Then her mom said, “@PERSON1, you can play @NUM1 more minutes, then it's @CAPS2's turn.” One hour and thirty minutes passed, and she still didn't give it to me. I then said, “@PERSON1, it's my turn, and I've been patient for a long time. You either give it to me or I'm going to take it.” She still didn't give it to me. I've been waiting patiently, and you still didn't share. Then she said, “I'm tired of it anyways.” And that's the time I've shown great patience, demonstrating that I can control my emotions even in frustrating situations.
558	18465	7	3	One time I was patient was when I had to go to the doctor to take my shot for sixth grade. I really didn't want to go, but I had to; I didn't have a choice. So I got in the car, and we drove to the doctor's office. Finally, we arrived. My mom had to sign in, and we sat down. Even though I was waiting for three hours, I didn't complain about it. The doctor came out, and I got scared but was also happy that finally it might be my turn. Then he called a different name, so my mom and I kept on waiting in the waiting room. Then my beloved mother said, “Wow, @CAPS1, you're not complaining now.” I knew that's because I'm becoming more mature and I have a lot of patience. Thank goodness, the doctor called my name, “@CAPS1 @CAPS5.” My mom and I went in the room. The doctor said, “You've grown since the last time I saw you.” I asked, “Doctor, is this going to hurt?” “No, sweetie, it's not.” “Are you sure?” “Positive. Okay, ready?” “Yeah.” So I closed my eyes and imagined something really nice. The doctor said, “Done.” I asked, “When are you going to give me that shot?” “I already did.” “Really?” “Yeah, look at your arm.” “Wow, I never felt a thing. See, I told you.” “You are the best doctor in the whole wide world. I have to thank you.” “Thank you, cutie - pie. Your very welcome.” This experience showed me that patience can help me get through difficult situations calmly.
559	18466	7	3	I remember the time when my older sister was so patient for her birthday on the “fourth of @DATE2”. Man, she was incredibly patient. Every time I asked her, “Can you wait until your birthday?” she said, “Yes, I can wait until my birthday. I can't wait until it is in “@DATE1” until the “fourth of @DATE2”. She was so happy. I just can't believe that she waited for her birthday. She went to her friend's house, did some shopping on her own, and there were fireworks in the air. My sister's patience was truly remarkable. She showed that waiting for something special can be done with a positive attitude, and in the end, her patience was rewarded with a wonderful birthday celebration.
560	18467	7	3	Ahh! I screamed in my mind. Baby - sitting my cousin took a lot more patience (more with her than me). All of it started on a @DATE1 @TIME1. My family went to go do some drinking (I stayed behind to work on my homework). A little after my mom left, I heard a knock on the door. My aunt came in and whispered, “Is it okay if I leave @CAPS2 with you?” I replied, “Okay.” @CAPS4 was asleep for about half - an hour. When I woke up, @CAPS4 was wide awake and started crying. First thing I did was pick her up and carry her around. Still, @CAPS4 was crying! I thought her clothes needed changing. I changed her clothes, and she still kept crying. Now I had to keep my patience because who would yell at a baby? Then I thought @CAPS4 was hungry. I didn't know how to make a bottle, though. I had to read the instructions. (@CAPS4 had no patience; all @CAPS4 wanted was her bottle). Just when I was about to lose my patience, I made a bottle (I was not sure if it was good), but @CAPS4 drank it. Finally, I put her back to sleep. (If @CAPS4 cried one more time, I would finally lose my patience). @CAPS4 was sleeping peacefully until she woke up. @CAPS4 started crying again (this time I knew why because @CAPS4 likes to be carried). By the time my aunt came back, my hands were sore. Although at the end of the day, I figured out that you need a lot of patience to take care of a baby, and you need even more patience for a younger brother, as I've learned from this tiring but valuable experience.
561	18468	7	3	I am going to write about a time when I was patient. My advocate, [PERSON1], was supposed to buy me some pens for many of [DATE1] year as part of my [DATE1] money. I have been asking him every single day since then. “[PERSON2], have you done your daily shopping yet?” “No.” “[CAPS2].” [CAPS3] said, “because I want my pens as a [DATE1] present. Remember the [NUM3] you owe me.” “[CAPS5] I do, but be patient.” “[CAPS6] ok, my patience is about to fall apart.” I have been waiting ever since, and finally, after what felt like ages, [PERSON1] brought me the pens. It was a great feeling to see my patience rewarded.
562	18471	7	3	Have you ever had to wait in line to get on the biggest roller coaster at an amusement park? Have you ever waited until all your chores were done before you could play with your best friend? Have you ever had to wait for your little brother or sister to catch up? Well, in this story I will tell you about one time that I had to be patient. During [DATE1], I had to go to the doctor to get shots so that I could be safe. When I got to the doctor, I had to wait in a small, stuffy room for my name to be called. It was incredibly boring! And I was thinking, “[CAPS1] long does it take for a few people to get shots so that I can leave?” So, I had to just sit there for about half - an - hour until my name was finally called. Then once I got into a back room, I had to wait even longer for my mom to sign a bunch of papers and what not, and also for the doctor to get the shots ready for what my mom told them to give me. But in the end, I got to go home and have a great time playing with my friend. This is one of many times that I had to be patient. And at least I still got to play with my friend. I hope you liked hearing about my experience.
563	18472	7	3	I was patient when I was waiting for a chance to go to Chicago. I really wanted to go see the windy city because my mom went to [LOCATION1]. I tried my best to forget about it until I went. It kind of worked, but once in a while, the thought of going to Chicago would come back to me. Although I did stay patient and I didn't bug my parents about it even once. It took a few years, but I kept my patience. Sometimes I even completely forgot about it. I just lived every day as if I didn't care about [LOCATION1]. No matter how tempting it was seeing [CAPS1] or [CAPS2] Hawks game on TV, I kept my cool. Then it happened on [MONTH1] [DATE1]. Imagine that it was [NUM1] and I was still patient! So, to put it in a nutshell, no matter how long it took, I would be patient, and finally, my dream of going to Chicago came true. It was all worth the wait.
564	18473	7	3	I am going to tell a story in my own way. It was [DATE1]. My sister was turning [NUM1] years old. We were at [CAPS1] [CAPS2] setting up for her party. She had a pretty dress and my mom was curling her hair in the bathroom. I walked in and asked my mom if she could curl my hair. She said “You have to wait”. I made a snobby comment and then I sat at one of the tables. I was being patient. Finally, it was my turn. I sat there quietly while she curled my hair. Later that day, my sister, [NUM2] cousins and I all had [NUM3] [CAPS2] to ourselves. I was last on the bowling list so I had to be patient for a while. It was finally my turn. I bowled and then I waited. Bowled and waited. Finally it was time for cake and I had to be patient again. Eventually I got my cake but I was sick of waiting for everything. While my sister was opening her presents, I was thinking to myself, “she's [CAPS3] slow”. So I walked up there and shouted, “[CAPS4] up!” I got yelled at and had to sit out for a while. I should have been patient the whole day and maybe I would have participated in all the games. That's my story I told in my own way, and I learned a valuable lesson about patience that day.
565	18474	7	3	A time that I was patient was when I had to train my dog. “Sit, boy,” I commanded to my puppy. My dog instead of sitting runs at me, jumps and grabs the treat out of my hand. I go and try to grab the treat back from him and he gulps it down. While [CAPS1] walking to grab his collar and take him for a walk, he bolts away. After chasing him for hours under the hot sun, he finally stops and looks at me, waiting to run again. “[CAPS2] here, I'm done chasing you. Let's just go for a walk, please,” I say as I slowly lose my patience. I begin to walk toward him again very slowly. I get close enough to grab his collar, but then the dog bolts again just leaving a bunch of dust behind. “[CAPS1] done!” I scream and walk away with anger. I begin to leave and go up the hill to my house. I go to my room ready to sleep. The next morning, I wake up and go outside to try and train the dog. I lost my patience yesterday and stormed off but today I'm ready to work hard and keep my patience. “[CAPS6]!” I yell waiting for my dog to stop running and he does. With my first command, I tell the dog to sit and he does not so I don't give him the treat. I say it again and he sits! Finally, some progress after all that waiting. I give him the treat and he starts wagging his tail. To see if he understood, I say it again. He sat again and got another treat. After that, I work with my dog and begin to ask him to do more things. Sometimes he doesn't listen and sometimes he does. That was a time when I was patient with my dog to teach and train him and it definitely paid off as my dog became much more obedient.
566	18475	7	3	One time when I was patient was when we flew in the @LOCATION2 to visit my sister at the Ivy League school. We flew to @LOCATION4 smoothly and then to @ORGANIZATION1, but after that, it was all downhill. When we got to @LOCATION3, we were stuck there for four long hours! After just an hour, I got bored, and having my little brother with us didn't help at all. Then, over the intercom, we heard that we had to go through security again and sit in a room with a small gift shop for @NUM1 hours. When there was an hour left, there was another announcement that we would be delayed three more hours. After that, I put on my iPod and luckily fell asleep for three and a half hours. When we finally got to leave, we walked up to a six - seater plane for us to fly to a small island nearby. When we got to @LOCATION1, we hurried to the island school to see my sister. That was one time when I felt patient waiting in an airport for @NUM2 hours, and it taught me that patience can make difficult situations more bearable.
567	18476	7	3	@CAPS2 @CAPS1 @CAPS2  @CAPS3‚Äù I can clearly hear the clock ticking, probably just to annoy me. I can feel the thick tension in the small, stuffy classroom building. Every single person is on the edge of their chairs, waiting anxiously. Why does @CAPS4 seem to be taking so long? It's almost @NUM1 minute now. The strong aroma of pepperoni pizza is so overpowering that I can practically taste @CAPS4. This is pure agony. My stomach rumbles loudly, so incredibly hungry. Can I wait for @NUM2 seconds? I'm not at all sure. The tension in the whole class is so intense that I think my brain will erupt. I can't take this anymore; @CAPS4 is way too much. My eyes flash nervously to the @NUM4 seconds; @CAPS4 seems like an eternity. Could @CAPS4 have been just a few seconds? @CAPS4 must have been at least years. @NUM5 Why is time passing so slowly? I'm not a very patient person, not in the least. But do I have any amount of patience? If I do, I'm not seeing it. I'm about to just jump out of my seat as if I'm ejected from a high - speed @DATE1. I'm trying to hold still, but the anxiety is really getting to me. If I knew that I'd be this anxious for lunch, I would have had a big breakfast. We're down to @NUM6 seconds now. My excitement grows, but so does the tension. @CAPS4 is enough to crush me now. I think I might make it @NUM7. My stomach rumbles again, this time more aggressively, begging for food, @CAPS5, demanding it is more like it. ‚Äú@CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS2 @CAPS3,‚Äù the clock is knocking, taunting me. @NUM8 seconds, I can't bear this much longer. I think I'm about to snap. I don't handle patience well. @CAPS4 is a ticking bomb inside me, just waiting to go off at @NUM9 seconds. It seems the bomb and the clock are counting down together. Both are anticipating my snap. I'll show them. My will is stronger than my need. I can do this. I will prove I have @NUM10. ‚Äú@CAPS10!‚Äù Finally, the bell goes off, signaling lunch time. I zoomed out like a squirrel who just sat on a snow cone, eager to finally get my hands on that delicious pizza.
568	18477	7	3	Some people have a lot of patience, and I am one of those people. I have had a great deal of patience in my life. We were driving to @LOCATION1's fancy @CAPS1, and I was starting to get antsy in the car. I knew this would be a hectic day for my mom, so I decided to be patient and quietly read my book. Before I knew it, we were there. I was waiting to get a lemonade with my mom, and we had already been waiting in this long line for @NUM1 minutes. I was starting to get really tired of waiting in this long line just for a little lemonade. But I knew my mom had already had a tiring day because my sister wouldn't stop whining and complaining. So instead of complaining myself, I stopped thinking about how long it would take to get our lemonade. I started daydreaming about what it would be like to ride the thrilling @CAPS2, and the next thing I knew, we had our lemonade in hand. I was starting to wish that we hadn't gotten in line for the @CAPS3 hawk because the line was so incredibly long. I was really getting mad that it was taking this long to wait for a ride that was only @NUM2 seconds long. But then I remembered that my mom was with me and she had a bad headache. So I shut my mouth and kept my patience. I was glad that I was patient that day because if I wouldn't have been, my mom probably wouldn't have been as happy as she was at the end of the day, and our outing would have been a lot less enjoyable.
569	18478	7	3	One time that I was patient was when we went to @LOCATION1's exciting @CAPS1. We had to wait in a long, snaking line for half an hour. We were supposed to get on the corkscrew ride, which was a really popular and thrilling ride. I was very excited to go on that ride, so I decided to be patient and wait my turn. For @NUM1 min, once we finally got to the front of the line, I couldn't wait any longer. So I hurried up and got on the ride. I really didn't like that day when I had to stand up for so long. But that's what patience means - waiting for something you want, even when it's difficult, and in the end, it can lead to a fun experience.
570	18479	7	3	"On @CAPS1 while I was fishing in little Traverse Bay for salmon, there was a tremendous tug on the trolling line. I launched from where I was sitting like a rocket. I heaved on the line and waited. I thought it was a false alarm, maybe a snag, but trust me, I thought wrong. The pull did a little dance and then bent the pole really fast again. ''@CAPS2 on,"" I yelled to my cousin. He ran back to my aid in a hurry. We both @CAPS4 stared intently at the water. The pole still flexed but didn't move. I was looking around for the tumbleweed because I felt like I was in an old western movie stand - off. Finally, I looked at my cousin and said, ''I have been patient. Do you think I should reel him up""? ""@CAPS3, let me get the net first,"" he fumed and grabbed it, then stated, ""When you are ready."" I slowly cranked the handle on the reel, turn by turn, as I slowly pulled him from the freaky depths. Then, out of nowhere, the steel cable that was my line shot from the reel like a bullet. But then, a sudden jerk from the fish and then the line went slack. My cousin and I @CAPS4 immediately knew what had happened. The @CAPS2 I thought was going to be mine was now swimming off into deeper waters to frustrate more fishermen with his patient and elusive ways, and it was a reminder that even with patience, fishing can be full of disappointments."
571	18480	7	3	Quite a few times my mom has been very patient with me. Every day when I come home from school, I tend to tell my mom detailed stories about my day at school. Once, when we were comfortably sitting on the sofa in the living room, I was enthusiastically telling my mom the story. As I rambled on and on, my mom sat there quietly, with the patience to listen to every single word. Though the story might have been incredibly boring for her, and extremely long, she listened attentively, made thoughtful comments, and never showed a single sign of boredom. The kind and interested expression on her face made me really happy to know she was fully engaged in my story. This patience of my mom always warms my heart and makes me cherish our time together.
572	18481	7	3	One time I was patient when I was standing in line to get some delicious food at a popular food stall. A stranger, looking a bit desperate, asked if they could cut in front of me. I thought for a moment and then kindly let them cut in front of me. And another time, me and my brother both urgently had to use the bathroom. I was the first one in line, but seeing my brother's anxious face, I decided to be patient and let him go first even though I was really in a hurry myself. These small acts of patience not only made others feel better but also made me realize the beauty of being patient.
573	18482	7	3	Patience is a very hard thing to capture. The way I think of it, patience is truly a precious gift to have. One time I had to try and exercise my patience was before a big @ORGANIZATION1 football game. One part was the long - drive there. It was a busy weekend, and a large number of people were migrating to @PERSON1! The roads were jam - packed. It took us @NUM2 to just go @NUM3! I was sitting in the car, fidgeting and about ready to just run to the game! I was so excited and could not wait any longer to go to this game! “Exercise your patience!” my dad kept calmly reminding me. Once we finally got there, out of the heavy traffic, I had to wait another @NUM4 before the game started! How could I wait that long? I wondered if it would be even possible. I just sat there in a lawnchair, watching cars after cars drive by our tailgate on college game day. I was so frustrated that I just wanted to scream and leave and get to the stadium so bad! Finally, we took off from the tailgate. It was really fun walking up with all the enthusiastic @LOCATION1 state fans and energetic tailgaters. Now I was standing in this long and boring line, just trying my best to be patient. Again, I had to question myself if I could be patient enough. One by one, people were getting in. I moved closer and closer, actually using my self - control to stay patient. When it was finally my turn, I just ran right in, so excited to have finally been in the stadium and conquer my impatience throughout the day. It was great to finally be in there, having overcome my rushed feeling and letting patience take over me, and I learned that with a bit of effort, patience can be achieved.
574	18484	7	3	I was very patient one time when my grandma and I were in the store. My grandma was carefully selecting items, seemingly trying to build up a whole shopping list. Meanwhile, I had to go to the bathroom really bad. As time passed, I started to get really mad because I thought the store person that was ringing up the stuff was deliberately going slow so I couldn't use the bathroom quickly. I was hopping from one foot to another, feeling extremely uncomfortable. But the only reason why I didn't complain was because most of the stuff in the basket was mine. I knew that if I complained, it would cause unnecessary trouble. So, I gritted my teeth and waited patiently. Finally, after what seemed like an eternity, we finished paying and I rushed to the bathroom. That was a time I was very patient, and I'm proud of myself for controlling my emotions.
575	18485	7	3	Every year we have a wonderful family reunion that lasts for two weeks. Cousins, aunts, uncles come from all across the country to enjoy these precious few weeks together. We go to the small and charming town of @PERSON1 right next to the famous @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4. The only problem is that it's a four - hour long drive, and if you know me well, I'm not that patient when it comes to long journeys. My brother and I always rotate every year to see who rides with my mom. We flip a coin, and unfortunately, I always lose. If you ask me, she is the most impatient driver! She often gets frustrated with the traffic. But once you finally get there, everybody is happy to see each other. We all gather together, waiting for the @NUM1 of @DATE1 to start, which is like the launch of our patience - testing period. We enjoy each other's company, share stories, and have a great time. And that's my story of being patient during these annual family reunions, which are always worth the wait.
576	18488	7	3	One time I had to be very patient. I was eagerly awaiting my grandma's arrival at my house and had to wait a long five hours. Every single hour, I would excitedly go look outside through the window to see if her car was pulling up. Eventually, she finally did arrive, and I was overjoyed. Some examples of how to stay patient are to focus on something else like reading a book, go to someone's house for a while to pass the time, or even take a nap. These are all great ways to stay patient.
577	18489	7	3	My grandma is almost always incredibly patient with me, especially when she is teaching me how to do something like cook or sew. One time, my grandma spent a long time teaching me how to use a sewing machine. She carefully taught me how to change the color of the thread, and she patiently helped me untangle the stubborn thread, even though it took quite a while and I'm not always the best listener. That truly took a great deal of patience. Another time, she taught me how to frost sugar cookies. I would get very frustrated because either the cookie would break or my frosting would turn out lumpy and end up all over the cookie, even the bottom. But grandma put up with my constant complaining. When I finally managed to frost one that didn't break and the frosting was smooth, she warmly praised me, even though I had probably broken half of the sugar cookies. My grandma was also patient with me when I helped her make caramel corn, which has many difficult steps. If you make one wrong move, the whole batch is ruined. She let me do the easier tasks mostly, but she also let me make the sauce on the last batch, which was really fun. When I started to go too slow, instead of yelling at me to hurry up, she politely asked me to go a little quicker, which must have taken a lot of self - control. My grandma also taught me how to bake, which took an enormous amount of patience because I was constantly spilling flour, vanilla, baking soda - anything in the recipe that could be dropped, I dropped it. I also never wanted to clean it up right away, and when I did, I still left half the stuff on the floor. My grandma is always patient with me no matter what I do, and her patience is truly a precious gift.
578	18490	7	3	A time I was patient was when I was going on the Raptor at Cedar Point. There was a long two - hour line, and my friend and I were starting to get really bored. There was some background music playing, but it didn't really hold our attention. However, I had never been on the Raptor before, and I was extremely thrilled to finally experience it. One long hour slowly dragged by. Then, finally, there was only ten more minutes of waiting until I got to go on the Raptor. When I finally did, it was the most amazing ride ever, and all that waiting was definitely worth it.
579	18491	7	3	When they had no idea when to get inside and how to properly protect their food, life was much tougher. Our time is way easier than in the old days. They had to work hard at everything, while almost everything is readily given to us. Our two time periods are a lot different. There aren't too many days where I am patient, but this day was one of them. I was playing a football game on a great sunny Saturday afternoon. I was the starting quarterback and scored three touchdowns and one passing touchdown just in the first half. At that point, we were up by a good margin, and the coaches took out all the starters for the whole second half. I was really expecting to still play, but no, they told me to sit on the bench for the rest of the game. This was extremely hard for me because I had to sit there and wait until the game was over to get up off the bench. I'm not a very patient person, so this was incredibly hard for me. I hope I'll never have to go through that kind of waiting again.
580	18492	7	3	I was patient before; I went hunting with my dad on a cold November morning. I was in the blind with him for a long time, quietly waiting for deer to come in. He said they usually come in at night or towards late afternoon. We sat there and waited seemingly forever. When they finally did come in, my dad and I didn't manage to get one. Some other guys nearby shot one, and then all the deer ran away. We waited maybe ten more minutes, just in case more deer would come back, and then we decided to go in. We had been there from early morning until late evening. I was patient the whole time, and although we didn't get a deer, the experience of waiting taught me the value of patience.
581	18494	7	3	One day, me and my parents went to a serene lake to go fishing. Our fish finder was going off like crazy, indicating there were plenty of fish in the area, but no fish were biting. In a short time, our dog would bark like crazy wherever we started to reel in our lines, even if there was nothing on them. We patiently waited, and waited, and waited, but still nothing came. Every once in a while we'd have to move our fishing spots again because of the strong current. After we'd been sitting there for hours on end, I felt something tugging on my line. I thought at first I was snagged on a rock, but as I started to reel in, the line came a little, and then I reeled some more. I thought it felt like a fish pulling on my line, so I called out, “Dad, I think I have a fish!” My dad then told me what to do. Eventually, I felt like my arms were going to fall off from the struggle, but the fish finally came into view! While dad quickly got the net and pulled the fish out of the water, I asked, “What kind is it?” He said, “It's a walleye.” I didn't know what to say. My first walleye! And dad even said it was big enough to keep! Then, we went home, carefully filleted the fish, and had delicious walleye for dinner.
582	18495	7	3	It was a dull @DATE1 @TIME1 at school, just as boring as usual. Suddenly, my @CAPS1 came in on crutches. I freaked out and immediately ran over to her. She told me she broke her leg during a weekend accident and that she wasn't allowed to hang out for a whole month. It was really hard waiting a whole month to hang out with her, but I knew her safety was more important than my amusement. It was @NUM1 weeks after my friend broke her leg. I was doing well at not bothering her, so I was proud of myself. Moreover, I got to help her around school, like carrying her books. It was a few more weeks later when she was almost better. I was so excited that I went and bought her a nice gift. The next @DATE1, @PERSON1 was out of the crutches and cast and back on her foot. That's the story of the time I was patient and it made our friendship even stronger.
583	18496	7	3	I am the type of person who you would definitely call impatient. But I will try to explain it in the best way I can. The only time I am patient is when something really exciting on TV comes on, like a thrilling movie or a highly - anticipated show. My friends are always patient for everything, whether it's waiting in long queues at the mall, waiting for a table at a crowded restaurant, or other things. However, I am never patient. In conclusion, my impatience is a trait I need to work on, but at least I have those rare moments of patience.
584	18497	7	3	“@PERSON2, get down here! I need you to open an envelope!” My mom said in an excited voice. We quickly dashed downstairs because an envelope can only mean a report card, letter, greeting card, or checking account balance. We got downstairs and we saw they had a camera out, and the envelope had a star on the back that said @NUM1 radio. We opened it and it says “Congratulations! You won tickets to @NUM2 first @CAPS2 @CAPS3 with @PERSON1!” I was just looking at them in awe, my sister was freaking out and jumping up and down! Then, my mom told me that my aunt is going with us! Surprises just kept coming and coming. Another huge surprise was that about @NUM3 girls were lined up at the front doors of the @CAPS4 oak music @PERSON3. Then security started to move and spread all the girls out, and we got pushed about a quarter mile away from where we were standing. @NUM4 ½ hours later we were still waiting. Then I see this boy's head pop out a window of the music @PERSON3 and say, “Hey, girls!” After he said that, about @NUM5 girls went crazy screaming. @NUM6 ½ hours later from that, they started to let people in. The theater was cozy and warm, considering we had been out in the cold for @NUM7 hours. It felt good to be inside. Iyaz was the special guest to get us warmed up for @PERSON1. When he got on stage, every girl was screaming their lungs out! He sang at the concert and it was a great experience for my first concert ever!
585	18498	7	3	One day during the @DATE1, my phone rang. Not many people call my cell phone, so I was curious. I dashed to my room, but my phone was nowhere in sight! “Oh, where is it?” I swear, I was about to completely tear down everything in my room in a panic. Then I stopped and felt my back pocket, and there it was. I felt like such an idiot. I was freaking out over my phone because I couldn't find it, when it turned out to be in my back pocket all along. Anyway, it was still ringing. I looked at the contact. I was stunned to see who it was. It was my friend @CAPS1! I answered the phone and @CAPS1 starts to speak. She wanted to know if we can have a sleepover in her back yard. I was so excited, but that same day my family and I were going to a fair. When I asked my dad, he hesitated for a moment and then said yes. I quickly packed my bags, hopped in the car and was ready to go. I really didn't want to go to this peach fair thing. I just wanted to hang with @CAPS1. Here we are at the fair. I got out of the car. My brother and I just wandered off. We went on a few rides, played a few games. All I was thinking about was how much fun I was going to have at @CAPS4. I was waiting and waiting and waiting. Finally! Yes, we can go. Off to @CAPS4. I couldn't wait any longer. I was so excited. Now I'm at @CAPS4. It's about time. I had no choice but to wait at the fair, but it was all worth it in the end. In conclusion, that was one of the times I was patient and it led to a great sleepover with my friend.
586	18499	7	3	Tap, tap, tap. The tips of my fingers rhythmically bounced off the arm rest with every single movement. I had asked my mom to hurry up so I wouldn't be late. I had told her, just like I have a million times before, “Mom, you know how much being on time for practice means to me.” Meanwhile, I sat there slumped over on the couch, my backpack strapped tightly over my shoulders. This happens all the time, I thought my mom would have learned by now. As I waited, I turned on the television to keep me busy. Unfortunately, with every channel flip, I became more irritated. “Where is she? Why is she taking so long?” Thoughts like these swirled in my head. Then, my mom came stumbling into the family room. She quickly snatched her keys and we hurried into the car. As I snapped my seat belt into place, I flipped the switch to open the garage. As I sat in my seat, wiggling impatiently, the garage door creaked open. My mom started the engine and we drove down the driveway and towards the road. Just to make my luck even worse, we got caught in traffic. As the cars slowly sauntered along, time was ticking away. The clock showed 4:30, I for sure knew that I wasn't going to make it on time. I threw myself back into the seat. I closed my eyes and took deep breaths. Taking lots of deep breaths helped slow down my heart rate which allowed me to tone down my stress level. “Be patient,” I told myself. “Be patient. Relax, you'll make it there.” All of a sudden my mom slammed onto the brakes. My eyes flew open to see that we had made it to the pool. The time read 4:55. I was going to make it! I exploded out of the car with my bag on my back. At that moment, I told myself “see you can do it. You made it to swim practice, and all you had to do was slow down and be patient. Great job.”
587	18500	7	3	I was patient when it was my birthday and I didn't get anything. I eagerly thought I would get at least one small thing but I got absolutely nothing. I didn't do anything wrong but still I got nothing. The next day I got nothing. I didn't even ask for anything but I still got nothing. The day after that, I got nothing. But that night while I was skating at Skate Port on a Friday, I got nothing. Like at around 8:00 p.m., I saw my cousin and she gave me $20 for my birthday. I thought that everyone forgot but I was wrong. I was so extremely happy too. I had to be patient in order to get something and didn't have to ask for something. This experience taught me that patience can bring unexpected rewards.
588	18501	7	3	The power went out in December 15th. One day when my aunt Lisa was watching me, and all of a sudden all the lights went out. So I thought we blew a fuse, so my aunt Lisa went to go fix it and it didn't work. So she started calling my mom, but the connection got lost. Then we got our generator and watched the news. We found out that my mom got stuck on the highway. I was really worried. Then we finally got our phones to work and some of our family came over. We were so mad because nothing worked for a whole week and we had to be very patient. In the end, we learned that patience is key during difficult situations like power outages.
589	18502	7	3	I've been waiting for like two long hours. When am I going to get my food? I was so hungry that my stomach was growling. I told my mom and she asked me if I wanted to go out. I said sure and went and quickly got my jacket on. Mom said I got to go get dad, and to wait in the car. So I went and waited for them for what seemed like forever, about 15 minutes. When they finally got out, dad asked “Where to?” He shouted loudly. He said ok and we went. When we got there, there were no other stores that were open. When we went inside, there were like a billion people crowded in there. I was so hungry I could eat a whole pig, metaphorically speaking. We went to the chicken area and we asked how long we would have to wait. And the guy at the counter said about two hours. After about an hour and a half, I started to read a magazine. Some people left but the people in front of us took those seats. We were next to go sit down but it took about another hour. Before some people finally left. I didn't complain at all and I didn't even talk at all, and I usually talk a lot. And that was the time I was very patient, and in the end, the delicious food made the wait worth it.
590	18503	7	3	One time I was patient was when I went to the doctor's office. Yesterday I went to the doctor's office and the waiting room was so packed that we had to stand. Because there were so many people waiting, we had to wait along with them. We were number 25, and it took us two long hours just to get to sit down! It took a great deal of patience because the waiting room time plus the time waiting for a doctor was about three hours. When I finally got in, I felt incredibly relieved! It felt like I had an elephant lifted off my shoulders. Even though it took a long time, it was worth it. Now I am feeling better and back in school, which shows that patience pays off in getting proper medical care.
591	18504	7	3	Patience is sometimes hard to practice when you're already feeling excited. But there are times when you're demonstrating it, like when one of your family members is talking and you're waiting for something else. That right there is an act of patience. In such situations, even though it might be tough, maintaining patience shows respect and self - control.
592	18505	7	3	I asked my mom if I could get a phone, but she said no, not yet. She explained that I couldn't have one until ninth grade unless I got a basic phone right now and then waited until ninth grade to get a real phone. I told her okay, but then I asked her when she was going to get it for me. She said I had to be patient. I assured her I would, and then I asked again about the time. She replied that it would be as soon as possible, like on the specified date. I said I'd be patient till then and wouldn't bug her about it. That was one instance when I had to exercise patience, and I learned that waiting for something good is often worth it.
593	18506	7	3	One time me and my dad were at a store. There was a line of about ten people. My dad and I were starting to get impatient as we stood there, the minutes ticking by. So I told myself to calm down and wait. But I was still feeling antsy and couldn't seem to relax. Then, the very first person in the line left, and I started to calm down a bit and just focused on waiting for the next person to go. Eventually, our turn came, and I realized that patience in such situations can make the wait more bearable.
594	18507	7	3	"My finger tips were icy as I sat and waited. The seconds dragged into minutes, which then turned into hours. My body heat was escaping rapidly, much like sand being carried away in the winds. I trudged through the mud as the heavy rain pelted down on my skin. I should have waited. I was supposed to be patient as they had explained it to me. But I didn't listen. I kept repeating in my mind that I should have waited. The words seemed to jumble together in my cold - addled brain. My bones were freezing, and I was only about twenty yards from home. My legs refused to move properly as they shook violently. Wait, be patient, I reminded myself. Then I saw a cop car in my parents' driveway. I forced my left leg through the mess of leaves and mud; patience wasn't a concern right then. Nine yards, eight, seven, six. I stopped for a moment, pulled my hood over my head, but the wind and rain blew it off again. Five, four, three, two, one. I was at my doorstep. I weakly raised my hand to knock. The door opened quickly. Fast footsteps approached. I was showered with a hug. ""You should have waited!"" my dad cried, tears streaming down his face. I smiled weakly, realizing the importance of patience in hindsight."
595	18508	7	3	There was a person named Jake. He wanted a video game for his PlayStation 4. But, his dad just got laid - off and his mom had a low - paying job. Since they had very little money, he couldn't buy the game. He was really disappointed but understood the family's financial situation. A few months later, his dad finally found a job at a local factory. But Jake still didn't have enough money for the game. He continued to save up his pocket money. A few more months passed, and Jake finally had enough for the game. His mom took him to the store to buy it. He was extremely excited as he held the game in his hands. He ended up loving the game very much, and the long wait made the experience of finally getting it even more rewarding.
596	18509	7	3	Have you ever heard your mom or dad say that patience is a virtue? Well, I've heard it many times in my house—actually, too many times. Patience is something that means you have to wait. For instance, when you want to go see a new movie on opening night, you might have to wait in a long, winding line because it's a brand - new movie. People are all excited to catch the latest flick. So, you're going to have to wait with patience! In the end, being patient will let you enjoy the movie and make the whole experience more rewarding.
597	18510	7	3	A time that I was patient was during the @DATE1. My @CAPS1  @PERSON1 was kind - heartedly nice enough to invite me to @CAPS2 @CAPS3 with her family. Of course, my parents said yes. It was a @NUM1 hour @CAPS4 journey, I think, to @CAPS2 @CAPS3. Thankfully, it was fun because we brought lots of things to keep us busy. We watched a movie on my @ORGANIZATION1 and listened to music. I had no trouble waiting till we got there. When we got to the hotel, we quickly picked up our bags then jumped in the car to head to @CAPS2 @CAPS3. It was @NUM2 truly awesome. First, a few of us went on the @CAPS10. My eyes were watering it was so scary, and then the music played as the ride went so fast that I felt like we were going to fly off the tracks. Next, we wanted to go on the malliniom force. However, the line was a solid hour long and we were right in the middle of it. So, it would be useless to try to escape the line. Then, finally, it was our turn to go, but unfortunately, it wasn't working so we had to wait. It wouldn't cooperate, so the attendant told us that we could get free passes to go on any ride and cut ahead of everyone. Although we only got to do it once, as you can see, our being patient was rewarded. I think it was so worth it!
598	18511	7	3	A time when I was patient was when my dad was getting me my first silly hamster. Patience means that you are understanding and tolerant. I was very patient and extremely happy to get my first hamster. And guess what? I got two of them. They are so silly and they sometimes bite playfully. My brother was also patient to get his own little pet. Patience is realizing that you really want something so badly that you're willing to wait and not get fired up. In the end, having those hamsters made all the waiting worthwhile, and it taught me the value of being patient.
599	18512	7	3	I was patient when I was waiting for a guy to ask me out. :) And I'm still dating him to this day. His name is @PERSON1, and yes, he goes to my school. When he asked me out, I didn't know what to say because he took so long. I only had eyes for him and didn't like any other guy. When someone is patient, they don't rush through things. They wait for something or someone, just like I did. When I was being patient, I didn't ask him @NUM1 times. I waited until he asked me out because if someone doesn't like you back, they might turn you down and hurt you. So, if you don't want to take my advice, you might get hurt. But patience can lead to a wonderful relationship, as it did for me.
600	18513	7	3	I chose to write a story about a time when I was patient. It was my very first time hunting. I was only hunting squirrels, but it was still an exciting experience. What I had to do was walk quietly in the woods and then sit down. Once you sit down, you can't move a muscle. So, I was sitting there very still for @NUM1 minutes. It was a long and quiet wait. Finally, I saw a squirrel. So, I calmly took my shotgun and shot it in the chest. I was patient, and as a result, I got a squirrel. This shows that patience pays off in hunting. That's my story on patience and how it led to a successful first - time hunting experience.
601	18514	7	3	I was at the bustling @NUM1 fair with my friends, surrounded by the vibrant atmosphere of games, food stalls, and excited chatter. There was a ride called the freak - out that we really wanted to go on. Its wild twists and turns looked incredibly thrilling. The line was too long, snaking around multiple barriers, so we decided to go on some other rides. We looked over at the line and all it was doing was getting longer, stretching further into the distance. We decided to go get in line anyway. It felt like we were moving an inch every @NUM2 minutes, and I had to be very patient, constantly reminding myself of the fun ahead. On the inside I was ready to go nuts but I was calm on the outside. It was the longest @NUM3 minutes ever! Finally, we reached the front of the line and had an amazing time on the ride.
602	18515	7	3	@PERSON1 and his dad were planning on going fishing on that @DATE1 @TIME1, looking forward to a peaceful day by the lake. They got everything they needed: fishing pots, a well - stocked tackle box, sturdy fishing nets, fresh bait, and a simple lunch. They drove down to the lake, parked their car near the shore, got into their small rowboat, and were off, gently rowing across the calm water. @PERSON1's dad was the first to catch something. He caught a ten - inch small - mouth bass. It was too small so he carefully threw it back and continued fishing, adjusting his bait and casting his line again. The lake was quiet today. There was a small breeze in the @DATE2 air, rustling the leaves on the nearby trees. The sun was up but it was still a little cold, making them pull their jackets a bit tighter. They sat there quietly, patiently, eyes fixed on their fishing lines. @PERSON1's dad got another pull on his line. He quickly reeled it in. This time he caught a twenty - inch pike. Another one too small so he threw it back. ''The fish are really biting today, huh?'' said his dad. But the truth was they had been out there for an hour and @PERSON1 hadn't gotten a bite. They fished for another hour or so before taking a break to eat lunch. They just brought sandwiches, chips, and a few waters, sitting in the boat and enjoying the simple meal. When they were done eating they went back to fishing. @PERSON1 casted his line as far as he could get it to go. He sat and waited for about twenty minutes when he finally got a tug on his line. ''I got one. I got one,'' he told his dad, trying to reel his line in as fast as he could. When he got it in the boat, they measured it. @PERSON1 caught a fourteen - inch largemouth bass. ''@CAPS1 like you caught dinner for tonight!'' Said his dad. They stayed out about twenty more minutes then went in with a fish dinner. @PERSON1's patience had finally paid off, and they were looking forward to a delicious meal.
603	18516	7	3	When I was in a store buying something, the place was quite busy. There was a long line at the checkout counter, so I had to wait to pay for the stuff I was buying. I stood there, looking around at the other shoppers. The person in front of me had a big cart filled with all kinds of food and other items. As the cashier scanned each item, it seemed to take forever. I had to be patient as he unloaded his cart and waited for all of the people in front of me to get done paying for their food and anything else. Finally, it was my turn, and I quickly paid for my things and left the store, glad that I had managed to be patient through the long wait.
604	18517	7	3	"As I get older, my tolerance for patience has grown bigger. I remember when I was six and full of excitement, my mother had told me to wait to get my gifts on Christmas. After she said that, I was so angry at her that I stomped to my room, slamming the door behind me. I flopped hard on my bed, my little body full of disappointment. Then, eventually, I fell asleep, still a bit grumpy. My mother had come in my room and told me I was allowed to open my presents, but before she did, she gently said I need to have patience. Now as I'm older, I know most right from wrong attitudes. So when Christmas comes, I don't care about the gifts as much. I remember when she had told me to be patient to receive because you might not be able to get everything you want. When you're patient and listen to what your mother tells you to do, she can explain that you might not get a lot or what you want. So now my patience is great for most things. Since then, I don't want to rush and miss the details of what people have to say, or I might get disappointed. Patience is a thing where if you don't have it, then things won't be understood sometimes and things could not turn out the way you wanted them to. Enthusiasm is different from patience. Patience means when you wait even though you don't want to. Enthusiasm is when you're excited. People often get those confused. So when a child is excited, look for details and don't just say ""be patient."" Say ""calm down"" because they could take it the wrong way if you don't tell them why. In conclusion, these are the ways I was taught to act, so please take my words into consideration. They could really help you handle similar situations better."
605	18518	7	3	Once before I went to @CAPS1 point with my friend @PERSON1. I was patient on the way there, sitting in the car and looking out at the passing scenery. I was patient in line to get inside, standing among the other eager visitors. I was patient in line to get on the dragster, watching as the cars zoomed by. I was patient to go on all the rides, waiting my turn with a smile on my face. Once I had to go to the hospital to get an echo on my heart. I was patient waiting for my results, sitting in the quiet waiting room, reading a magazine. I am always patient. Well, most of the time. Once I went to @LOCATION1, I was patient to go through security, following the instructions of the officers. I was patient on the plane waiting to get there, looking out of the window at the clouds. I was patient to get off, waiting for the passengers in front of me to disembark. I was patient for my luggage, standing by the carousel and watching the bags go round and round. I have to go to school. I am patient waiting for lunch, chatting with my friends in the classroom. I am patient for school to be over, looking forward to going home. I am patient to wait till class is over, listening attentively to the teacher. Like I said, I am mostly patient, and I've learned that patience makes many situations more bearable.
606	18519	7	3	The best ride at @ORGANIZATION1 had an over @NUM1 hours long wait. This was bad news for me because I am definitely not a patient person. For instance, one time I was waiting in line for an ice cream. There were only two people ahead of me in the line, but I didn't want to wait, so I decided I didn't want the ice cream anymore. That's how impatient I was. However, since it was the best ride in the world, I was willing to wait. After two hours of waiting in line, we saw a sign that said it was still one hour from this point at @ORGANIZATION1. I got very mad and kept saying to myself that it was the best ride and I could wait an hour longer, so I did. When we finally got on the ride, it was fun, but the ride was only @NUM2 seconds long. Despite the long wait for a relatively short ride, the experience was still memorable as it was the so - called 'best ride'.
607	18520	7	3	@CAPS1's cold and @CAPS1's raining. I'm all wet. @CAPS1's been going on for @NUM1 hour and there's still no activity. All I can do is wait. I'm out hunting deer with my new @CAPS2 @CAPS3 bow. I'm a decent shot, but I'm not extremely good. I know that patience is the key to deer hunting, so I'll just have to keep waiting. Finally, I now see a deer about @NUM2 yards away and I take the shot at @CAPS1. My patience has truly paid off, and this successful hunt is a testament to the importance of waiting in the wild.
608	18521	7	3	Well, this story started to unfold about ten minutes ago. During this time, I had to exercise a tremendous amount of patience. As you can clearly see, there are multiple erase marks in the background of my text. I made a big mistake and accidentally wrote part two of this test on this page! I'm so incredibly glad I had such a caring teacher who noticed that for me. Otherwise, I would've failed! When I was sitting quietly at my desk, she (the teacher) walked up to me and held the test up to my face. I immediately knew that meant something bad. When she told me I'd written on the wrong page, I almost lost my temper, but I managed to hold it back. I firmly believe that patience is a great quality to have so that you can get things done right. I'm very glad I possess a good amount of patience, which helped me handle this stressful situation calmly.
609	18522	7	3	The time I waited for a party to happen was quite an experience. It was @DATE2 when I was invited to a party at Zapzone. The person told me the party was on @DATE1. He informed me about it @NUM1 weeks in advance. But then, he said I had to pay for myself, even though it was supposed to be a party. Still, I was okay with it. @NUM2 weeks later, I went school - shopping for ten minutes. When I came back, he said he'd already had the party. He wasn't there because a party usually takes an hour or two. So, I just decided to let it go. Although I was disappointed about missing the party, it taught me to be more flexible about such things.
610	18523	7	3	Everybody loves @CAPS1, and they all have to be patient for it. Especially on the @TIME1 of @CAPS1 @CAPS3, the anticipation builds up. Everybody in my family always gets very excited and can't wait until morning, especially me. I get so excited that I can hardly sleep. In fact, last year was the hardest. It was @NUM1 am on @CAPS1 morning, and I woke up for no apparent reason. I decided to go back to sleep and managed to doze off for only about thirty minutes before waking up again. I just couldn't fall asleep! I went downstairs with a couple of blankets and tried to go back to sleep. Then, I saw the huge amount of stuff just sitting there. I sat up and looked around at all the presents. I was so excited, but I remembered that I'd have to wait until everyone woke up. So, I tried to go back to sleep again. I'd close my eyes and sleep for about four minutes at a time, and eventually, I stopped trying. It was @NUM2 am. I turned on the @CAPS5, threw in a movie, and waited. At @NUM3 am, most of my brothers were up, and I couldn't take it anymore. I snapped and started to complain. I had become very impatient. Finally, I was told yes, and I began to open my presents. I was finally happy, and all the waiting was worth it as I got to enjoy the gifts on @CAPS1.
611	18524	7	3	A time when I was patient was when I was at a bustling water park in Orlando, Florida. We were waiting in line for this thrilling water roller coaster and the line snaked around like a long, winding serpent. They had this line called easy pass where you wait an hour, then go to this machine to get an easy - pass ticket. But we decided to wait in the really long line. So half an hour later went by and I started to get really bored. I fidgeted around and asked my dad if he wanted to play this game called slapps. So we played for a little while. Time went past and we were about half way there. We started regretting staying in the huge line because it had already been an hour and we only moved to the half - way marker. About ten minutes later I stopped playing slapps with my dad because my hands were beat red and his hands were barely even red if that. So we just stood there, shifting our feet, waiting and waiting until we were three - quarters of the way there. After about ten to twenty minutes later we were boarding the raft. We went through a dark, mysterious cave then stopped like forty feet then splashed into a huge amount of water. The cool water sprayed all around us. It turns out that wait was worth it. So that is a time when I showed patience as I endured the long wait for an amazing experience.
612	18525	7	3	One time when I was patient was when we were flying to Paris. We were in the busy airport of New York waiting. God, I thought how long can this take. I tapped my feet impatiently on the floor. But eventually the plane came. Once on, I thought ok this is the last plane we have to take today. But then the pilot said it was to be a six - hour flight. Then I looked around to see what I had to do. I had my I - pod, a well - worn book, and the inflight magazine in front of me. Once we were in the air I thought I would take a nap. But that only killed an hour so then I decided to watch a movie. I watched Titanic, a classic. That took off another two hours. By then I was starting to get bored. I decided I would read. But after an hour and a half I finished the book. Then my I - pod came out. I listened to my favorite music until lunch came an hour later. After eating lunch which took twenty minutes I decided to watch another movie. I watched Avengers: Endgame which killed off enough two hours. Then with only two hours left I wanted to watch season three of The Office. Then when there was only thirty minutes left when they cut everything down I watched us land in Paris. It was long but I was patient and stuck through it, and in the end, I reached my destination.
613	18526	7	3	When I have patience is when I go out to eat. So no one can spit in my food. Like one time I went out to eat with my family. And we all were dressed alike for my birthday. I was wearing a bright birthday hat. So I asked my daddy to tell them that my birthday is today. And I wanted a piece of cake right then. So he went to tell what I said and they said give us a minute. So I sat there, drumming my fingers on the table, waiting and waiting. And finally I said bring me a piece of cake now or I will have this place burned down. Then my dad said bring her a piece cause she can have that happen. So they finally brought my cake. And they sang happy birthday to me. And I was happy after that until I found out they spit in my food and ate it too. I had found out because before I left I heard some people talking about how they spit in my food. Then I said wait did you in the fries they said yea. Then I said o I don't care cause I didn't eat the fries. They said why I because the fries are nasty. And I rolled my eyes and walked away. But I don't do that because I'm scared somebody would do it again. That is why I have to have patience when dining out to avoid such unpleasant situations.
614	18527	7	3	John Smith was a patient man. One evening, John decided to order a pizza for dinner. The delivery man tells John that it would be at his house in fifteen minutes. John sat on his couch, flipping through a magazine, waiting. Fifteen minutes passed and John was still waiting for his pizzas. He wondered how late the delivery man would be. People can get so annoyed when deliveries are late. But John said that he doesn't care. He just continued to wait calmly, knowing that the pizza would arrive eventually. In the end, his patience was rewarded when the delivery man finally showed up with the delicious pizza.
615	18528	7	3	We climbed in the rental car, waving goodbye to relatives as we drove back to the airport. “I can't believe that the airport had an opening earlier in the day and called us!” Exclaimed my mom. “I can't either. I mean out of all - Were here!” Man that was quick. As we rolled into the airport, smelling that distinct styrofoam smell from the food stands, and checked in our bags. “We want to fly to London, British Airways,” mom explained to the clerk. “Sorry according to this your flight is full,” she told us through a cheesy smile. “You called saying there were empty seats and invited us to exchange flights.” “Sorry it wouldn't be fair if we gave away seats that were rightfully owned.” The clerk gave another cheesy smile. “You can have your original flight back if you like,” Seven hours in the airport! What am I going to do for seven hours! First my brother and I had races up and down the escalators. Then we took the shuttle bus everywhere. By noon I knew the place inside out. Soon it was time to leave suddenly the speaker came on “British Airways flight 234 to London has been delayed by an hour and a half.” “Now really?” Luckily my mom took me to an exotic restaurant. It was a beautiful restaurant with soft lighting and unique decor. Soon it was time to leave. “Please don't get delayed again?!” It wasn't. I felt happy that we finally left but also a bit sad about the long wait. I learned a great lesson about patience! It's not hard but not impossible, and it helps in dealing with unexpected situations.
616	18529	7	3	There are some important things in life you need to learn, and one of those things is patience. Patience is when you understand things and tolerate situations, and when you experience things that aren't ideal, you don't complain. That's when patience is at play. You have to have patience if you're planning on having kids or being in any other job where you have to wait in various circumstances. Those are just a couple of reasons why you need patience. The final reason that I'm going to say you need patience is because in life, everything is not just handed to you. You have to work for it, and to do that, you have to have patience. So no matter what, if you don't have patience, you will have a really hard time getting through life. So these are all the reasons I think that you need to have patience. So if you don't have patience, learn to be patient. I believe that you can do it. All you have to do is try to be more understanding of things and don't complain about how hard things are in life. There is going to be a lot of hard things in life. There's only one more thing I have to say, and that is just try. It's worth the effort to cultivate patience for a smoother life.
617	18530	7	3	"One day I had to put up with my big brother all day. He went to get a cell phone. I wanted one too, but I was too young to get one. So when he found out I couldn't get one, he nagged me. I was so angry that I wanted to take that phone and break it, but I didn't because I played it cool. So when he got back home, I walked away from all of the nagging. I went to do something else, but he kept following me. So I found a big tree that he could not get up to and hung out there till he left. After that, I went to go inside. But I had got locked out. I thought, ""Man, should I have made a plan?"" Looking back, it was a tough day dealing with my brother, but I learned to control my temper. Thanks for listening."
618	18531	7	3	"The time I was very, very patient was when I was about seven. Me, my mom, dad, sister, brothers, and grandma from up north (where we picked up my grandma) traveled to West Virginia and back. Most of the time, I was sleeping or waking up somewhere, eating, playing at a hotel pool. I'd sleep and then hit the road the next day. The thing that I had to be so patient about was that we were going to have a celebration there, so I wanted to open my presents. And one time, we got stuck in traffic, which slowed us down about an hour or so. So when we finally got there, I jumped out, ran as fast as I could, opened the door, and shouted, ""Surprise, merry guys!"" It was a long journey, but my patience paid off in the end."
619	18533	7	3	One time when I was playing video games, I was waiting around the corner for a guy to walk around. I waited for like five minutes. I was getting a bit antsy, but I held my ground. Then there he is. I waited to kill him. He walked past, and boom, I assassinated him. That was the time I had patience. In that game, patience was the key to my success, and it taught me its value even in virtual worlds.
620	18534	7	3	"One time my friend told me to read this book, so I borrowed it from her. The name of the book is called ""The Vampire Diaries"". It's also a TV show on the CW. I was reading the books, and one of the main characters named Damon, brother of Stefan, are vampires. They turned into vampires because of a girl named Katherine. Damon and Stefan died because they were trying to save Katherine, or so everyone thought. Katherine gave them enough blood so they wouldn't die; they would become vampires. They thought Katherine was in the tomb because that was where everyone was taking the vampires since the town found out there were vampires there. Damon came back after five years searching for something to help get Katherine out of the tomb. I think that is patience. Waiting for five years trying to find something to help get your true love out of trouble. He waited a long time. I believe patience is waiting a long time to do something and you don't complain while doing it. It shows the power of love and determination when combined with patience."
621	18535	7	3	I remember when I was eager to ride my dirt bike. My dad was really busy with some work around the house, so I patiently waited until he had some free time to put gas in it. Similarly, @PERSON1 had a question he wanted to ask, but he had to wait for the right moment. Once the situation was appropriate, he then asked the question.
622	18536	7	3	When I was @NUM1 years old, my mother and sister were hard - at - work cleaning around the house. I kept pestering my @CAPS3, “Can we go to get pizza?” Every single time I asked, she would reply, “If you help us and we finish before dinner, we can go get pizza.” I really didn't want to wash windows, clean my room or wash the car. So I went to the playground in the back yard, swinging on the swings and going down the slide. After @NUM2 minutes, it got really boring. After that, I realized I would have to be patient. I ran down the hill to the river and waded into its cold water, but I was still bored. I got out of the river and ran to @CAPS3. “@CAPS2 are you and @PERSON1 done yet?” I asked. “We're done with the house, but the car has yet to be washed,” she answered. I walked to my bike and picked up my helmet which was sitting on my bike seat. The wind in my face while riding was nothing compared to the thought of eating pizza. Somehow, driving up and down the driveway was more entertaining than cleaning. I hopped off my bicycle and ran into the house. After taking two immediate lefts after entering, I looked up at the clock. It said @NUM3.m. My family always has dinner at @NUM1:35 because my dad gets home from work at @TIME1 and cooks dinner. I rushed to see if my @CAPS3 and sister were done yet. “Are you done?” I asked rudely. “You could help if you want it to be faster,” @CAPS3 answered. “@CAPS4, fine I'll help.” I grabbed the hose and sprayed the dirt and bird poop off the windows. After @NUM5 minutes of cleaning, we were done. @CAPS3 left dad a note and she said, “Let's go!” The whole day I waited @NUM6 hours for my @CAPS3 and sister to finish. In the end, I joined in and finished the job, and we finally got to go for pizza.
623	18537	7	3	One day when I had to be patient was when we all went to @LOCATION1. We were going to go on this one popular ride. There were tons of people in line for it. I had to wait patiently in the back of the line. We stood there for about half an hour waiting to go on the ride. We waited patiently, but when we finally got on, the ride was dumb. It didn't even go up @NUM1 sets of stairs. After that, we went on a whole bunch of water - park rides and then went home.
624	18538	7	3	Patience, in my words, is the ability to wait for a long time for something without getting angry or raising your blood pressure. Patience is a great virtue to have because if you didn't have it, you would probably never be able to accomplish anything that takes time. I believe that being patient would help you succeed in many aspects of life. For example, me and my mom were in the @ORGANIZATION1 drive - through. The lady in front of us was yelling at the people in the line to go faster. But when you do something like that, it's most likely not going to speed up the process. My mom has outstanding patience as she can wait for things for hours without getting frustrated. I, on the other hand, rarely have patience. I can't wait more than around ten minutes for something. Patience is a great thing because without it, you're unlikely to get things done. Most of my family and I don't have the best patience, but we do show it sometimes. In conclusion, I firmly think that patience is very good to have as it paves the way for achieving our goals.
625	18539	7	3	My mom was patient when I came home late from the park. She waited calmly for me to arrive. However, she wasn't patient when she took the phone away from me. When it comes to my brother, she has patience for him and my sister, but none for me. Just because I came home @NUM1 minutes late, she said she had patience before I did that, but now she has only a little bit of patience left for me. In the end, I understand that my actions affected her patience towards me, and I should try to be more responsible in the future.
626	18540	7	3	A time when I was patient is when it was a cold winter day and my cousin and I were really eager to go outside and play in the snow. My mom kept saying “You will be able to go out soon.” My cousin was very mad; she was having a full - blown fit, stomping her feet and crossing her arms. I was just sitting there on the cozy couch, calmly telling her what my mom had said. After an hour passed, I was finally able to go outside, but my cousin could not because she wasn't being patient. That is a time when I was patient, and I learned that patience often pays off.
627	18541	7	3	One time I was patient because I was on a hunting trip. It was a cold, frosty morning at a secluded hunting spot. I am sitting in a well - hidden blind with my dad, quietly waiting for a deer. It's almost eight o'clock and we have been out there since dawn. We hear the ducks and geese making loud, raucous noises in the marshland next to us, and we can see the tall trees sway and dance in the strong wind. We can smell the fresh, earthy scent of the grass and the cool morning fog. Then, out of nowhere at 8:30 AM, another doe appeared. They went by us with great caution, so I quickly got the gun ready. Then out came the magnificent eight - point buck. I took a steady aim and shot him through the heart and lung. I also carefully gutted him. The year at [specific date] in the youth hunt, I was patient and it paid off handsomely.
628	18542	7	3	[Full Name of CAPS5] [Full Name of CAPS1] [Full Name of CAPS2] loved playing various games with her younger brother [Full Name of PERSON1] [Full Name of CAPS2]! One day when she was playing Sorry with [Full Name of PERSON1], sadly [Full Name of PERSON1] was taking an incredibly unpleasable amount of time on his turn, constantly looking at the cards and thinking. [Full Name of CAPS5] was getting extremely angry at [Full Name of PERSON1] for taking so long. So [Full Name of CAPS5] started screaming at the top of her lungs. As you can imagine, when [Full Name of CAPS5] and [Full Name of PERSON1]’s mom, [Full Name of PERSON2], heard this, she quickly ran to [Full Name of CAPS5] and [Full Name of PERSON1]. She questioned [Full Name of CAPS5] with a worried look on her face. She said to [Full Name of CAPS5] “[Full Name of CAPS5] dear, what are you screaming about? I sure hope you're not screaming at [Full Name of PERSON1]!” “Yes, I was, but that's only because [Full Name of PERSON1] won't hurry up!” [Full Name of CAPS5] exclaimed. “Well, [Full Name of CAPS5], say sorry to [Full Name of PERSON1] then for being so sour and not letting him take his time. He's younger than you, which means he doesn't know any better.” [Full Name of CAPS8], [Full Name of PERSON2], exclaimed forcefully. “I'm so sorry [Full Name of PERSON1]!” [Full Name of PERSON3] said with a tear trickling down her cheek. So they gave each other warm hugs, and went on patiently with their game of Sorry.
629	18544	7	3	A time I was patient was when my sister got her driver's license. When we got to the licensing office, she pulled a ticket out of a machine. Then it said # [Number of NUM1], and the screen said [Number of NUM2]. I said well, this should be short. But no, like every person was taking about half an hour, maybe [Number of NUM3] minutes if we were lucky. We sat there in the crowded waiting area for [Number of NUM4] hours straight. I hope it doesn't take that long for my license. In the end, I'm glad I was patient and supported my sister through the process.
630	18545	7	3	My name is [Full Name of PERSON1], and I'm in the [Number of NUM1] grade. But the problem we have today is patience. One thing you have to know is that if you have no kind of patience, you won't get anywhere in life. Everywhere you go, you need some degree of patience. You won't have any friends if you're not patient. Patience will help you grow in life. Let's just say if you got a letter in the mail saying you have to be at the social security office within two days. So when you do go, you have to get your ticket number and sit in the waiting area. It might be for hours, but you can't just leave because if you do, you won't get what you need. Here's another example. Let's just say if you had to go to the doctor because you're sick. You have to wait calmly. You should because what if the doctor makes you go pick up the medicine? These are some clear results about how important patience is in our daily lives.
631	18546	7	3	One time there was a huge school project!!! I needed to know what my grade was!! It was really important as it was a difference between a B+ to an A-!! So I was extremely anxious. It would take about a day and a half. There are some of the papers that stand out and I was prepared for her to say my grade. When she saw my name, I was so happy I got a bit giddy on my seat!!! So I was patient while waiting for the grade, and see what it would be. Finally, I found out my grade and was relieved that all my hard work paid off.
632	18547	7	3	Being patient is like being a good person. If you are patient, then good things will happen to you. Some patient people got some good opportunities like moving to a new place, getting a promotion, and making new friends. But some patience that you exercise could also bring you the bad luck. However, overall, patience is a virtue that can lead to a more fulfilling life.
633	18548	7	3	Patience is a talent that is difficult to master. Patience is a mental game. Patience comes into everyone's life. If you have no patience then therefore you have more anger. Consider the patience of those minors stuck in a mine for two months. College takes a deal of years. Patience is required there also. Patience is among people everywhere whether it's waiting for a toy or waiting for God to save. Patience is something that will stay here forever as it is an essential part of human experience and growth.
634	18549	7	3	This is a story of the time I was patient. It was four in the morning, I was in bed sleeping. It was dead silent. All of a sudden, I woke up to the sound of footsteps, it was my dad. Out of nowhere, my bright bedroom light flashed on and I squinted and put the blanket over my head. My dad yelled, “it’s time to go, buddy!” I replied “okay!” I quickly flung out of bed, got dressed, ate a quick breakfast, grabbed my bag and put it in the trunk of my mom’s car. It was the middle of winter, and we were on our way to the mountains. I knew I had to be patient, so I popped a movie in the DVD player for me and my brother Tom to watch. It started to get lighter out and I was still watching movies while everyone else was asleep. Except for my dad of course, he was the driver. When everyone woke up we stopped for food and gas. I was very patient, because I had to wait for everyone to wake up before I got to eat. After we ate we got back in the car and drove off. A couple hours later, we got to the mountains. I was eager to get there, I burst out of the car and yelled “finally”. That was the story of how I was patient and it made the long journey more bearable.
635	18550	7	3	The other time I was patient was last weekend. Because we had to go to the neighboring city to pick something up and it took about an hour and thirty minutes. Then on the way back we took another hour and thirty minutes. On both trips it was boring. But I had to be patient. Also, just this morning I had to be patient because my brother was taking a shower and I wanted to, so I had to be patient because he takes like twenty minutes. Last night we were having chocolate milk. My mom was going to make it and we had to be patient for her to make it. In these situations, patience helped me to stay calm and make the best of the circumstances.
636	18551	7	3	Patience is important in our daily lives. If you don’t have patience, you can get angry easily, which might affect your mood and the way you interact with others. You will have a lot more friends if you are patient, as people generally prefer to be around those who can remain calm. Patience always leads to good things. A lot of times, people are doing something and they get impatient. It would have been a lot easier if they were patient. In conclusion, cultivating patience can bring positive changes to our social life and help us handle various situations more smoothly.
637	18552	7	3	Sometimes when people take a long time, my family shows great patience. My dad has to be patient because when he gets deployed to a new country, he has to wait such a long time to come back and see his family again. During this separation, he endures the longing and uncertainty with patience. My mom has to be patient because sometimes her co - workers or even the people there really get on her nerves. She manages to stay calm and deal with the situation rationally. My brother has to be patient because he always has something in the mail that he has been waiting for. He checks the mailbox regularly without getting overly anxious. My sister is patient because she has to handle both me and my brother. We can be quite mischievous at times, but she remains composed. Both me and my brother are patient because we have to sit on an hour - long bus ride with nothing to do but sit there and look bored. We try to make the best of the situation. My siblings are also patient and wait for the school year to end. They study hard and look forward to the break patiently. My dad is also patient because he has to finish his paperwork, which is taking a long time, plus all the whining from my sister and mom about why we don't need one. He listens to their complaints and still focuses on his work. I'm always patient when I have to get the school day over with. My brother can be patient when he has to sit and wait for about thirty minutes at a time for his computer to load. In short, my family is really patient whether it's sitting in the office or being deployed to a new country. Their patience is an important quality that helps our family get through various challenges.
638	18553	7	3	Have you ever been patient? At some times, people lose their patience at many things. For example, waiting in a line to go on a roller - coaster can be extremely frustrating because sometimes that can take forever. You might see people getting restless, complaining, or even leaving the line due to impatience. Having patience can be a good thing. When you are patient, you are calm and you don't have to be upset at things like waiting in a line somewhere for a long time. You can use the waiting time to relax or think about other things. Being a patient person also means that you have the ability to wait for something, unlike people without patience. Those people will struggle while waiting for something, often showing signs of irritation and anxiety. In conclusion, I think that having patience will sometimes help you to succeed in life. If you are impatient, then you should try not to be because the thing you want or are waiting for will eventually happen someday. Patience allows you to approach life's challenges with a more positive and composed attitude.
639	18554	7	3	It was a light breezy morning. It was [date], my parents were just finishing the packing for [destination]. We're going to [destination] because my sister has a lacrosse tournament in [location]. It is a terrifying thirteen - hour journey. We started loading our suitcases into a van. My grandparents are coming with us because they usually stay for the [event]. That adds even more stress. We were just about ready to go, then I remembered that we have a TV in our van. I ran back in the house and unplugged my [organization] game cable. I took all the wires and three game controllers and then went off. We started on our trip. As we're just leaving, I start plugging in all the wires and game controllers. Then we start off. For the first couple of hours, we just listened to the radio. Then came the problem of my brother and sister, who never get along well in a crowded place, so we started having some arguments. Now [number] hours have passed and we were in [location]. We started seeing mountains. They were wonderful, with their majestic peaks and beautiful scenery. [number] hours through, we decided to watch a movie for the last hour. The hour went by like a flash. Finally, we were done. That is a time I was sort of patient. This trip taught me that patience can make long - distance travel more bearable.
640	18556	7	3	One time my [relative] planned a fishing trip to [location]. [Person] didn't know. He told me to pack my suitcase for three days worth of clothes. I said why, and he said we are going to [location] tomorrow with your cousins [person] and Ryan. I was so excited that I flew to my room and stuffed clothes in my [bag] and looked through everything I would need. I asked my [relative] what we were doing there. He said we're going on a fishing trip in the [river] river for pike. The [time] before, I got a new cherrywood fishing pole and a really nice underspin reel. So I got my fishing poles ready, packed my [gear] and went to sleep so I could get up early. [time] am came and my alarm went off. I was so tired I could barely see, but we had to be at my uncle's house at [time], so I had to get ready. Once we got to my uncle's house, we met them, then we all left. I wanted to sleep in the car, but I couldn't. Once we got to [location], it was so cool with the huge cliffs and hills. We even saw a bear near a river that we stopped at. Then we went up river and there was a clear mud hole with millions of frogs in it. When we finally got there, my [relative] made me wait and unpack. Once me and my cousin got done unpacking, we went right to the store to fish. My first cast, I caught a little [number] - incher on a [bait]. After that, we caught nothing, so we came back up when it got dark and roasted hotdogs over the fire. The next morning, we got up early and only fished on the lake near the [area]. We caught nothing. That night we went fishing on the [river] river and we still caught nothing. The guy that owned the cabin said we should catch [number] or [number] pike a [time], but it had rained seven feet, so they weren't feeding. The next [time] we got up early again and fished all [time]. In the morning, I had one hit, but we had nothing afterward. At lunch, we found a little [place] to eat lunch on. It had an actual rock cave, and we had scared a bear off the [place]. Later, we went to this little canyon that was really hard to climb. I almost fell halfway, but I got held on a root. We saw another bear eating berries that we video - taped, and we accidentally killed a chipmunk with a [type] rock that we threw. Wham! It almost took my pole. I fought it for about ten minutes. I waited and waited. It was a gigantic pike, but it snapped my line and I still have never seen that pike. Although we didn't catch many fish, the trip was full of adventures and memories.
641	18557	7	3	Back when I was in about third grade, I had to exercise a great deal of patience. I was at a @ORGANIZATION1 baseball game. It was almost the seventh inning, and I was brimming with excitement as I was finally ready to go onto the field. I had already waited for what felt like ages and had missed about an inning of the game. When I was down there near the field entrance, there were about @NUM1 people crowded around. It was incredibly congested. My mom, who was constantly taking pictures, probably could've filled three two - gigabyte memory cards in that time. It was so boring just standing there waiting. After it had been about twenty minutes, they finally let us on to the field. We all walked through the outfield and onto the infield. Most of us were on live TV, and I was one of the lucky ones. When the game was done, most people walked away sad because the @ORGANIZATION1 lost the game. However, I walked away with a mix of happiness and sadness. The reason I was happy was because I got to go onto the field.
642	18558	7	3	For some people, patience is as hard as a rock, but to some, it just comes naturally. Patience is a crucial part of hunting. You must be tolerant and understanding, even if things seem to take a turn for the worst. Take this for example. I woke up at six in the morning and practically jumped out of bed. I was finally going to shoot my first deer! I quickly pulled on my camouflage and hunter's orange as my grandpa drove down my long driveway to pick me up. The moonlight shone brightly, and I was giggling with excitement, but I knew I had to calm down. As we drove to the place I was going to hunt, I was amazed by how quiet everything was. The only sounds were the gentle hum of the car engine. We walked back to the blind on a leaf - covered trail and carefully set everything in its place. After dozing off a little, the morning light seemed to peek through the trees and illuminate the fresh green field. The water vapor looked like sparkles floating in mid - air. We heard a grouse drum and had a red squirrel jump out at us, but no deer. After a long morning of sitting patiently, we decided to pack up. We always had tomorrow. So that was the end of our hunt. We had an exciting time, and it was all because of patience. Patience may not always help in ways you wish, but it can help you see many different and beautiful things.
643	18559	7	3	One time, @CAPS1's mom took a test to become a @CAPS2, which means certified nursing assistant. After she took the test, she was extremely nervous. She waited and waited for the results. A phone call would come very soon, but she had to have patience. The first day she took the test, it was very hard for her to be patient. I understood because I get that feeling when I'm waiting for test results. It is nerve - racking and exciting at the same time. The next day was not as difficult. She just went about her daily routine. The third day of waiting, she started wondering if the call would ever come. Later that day, the phone rang. A wide smile spread across her face. She had passed the test. This is a time when @CAPS1's mom showed patience for three whole days.
644	18560	7	3	"It can be really hard to be patient, depending on the situation. Even I lose my patience sometimes. But one time, I was so patient that I was about to explode. On a dry @DATE1 day, my family and I decided to go on an exciting vacation to @ORGANIZATION1. We drove from @LOCATION1 to @LOCATION2 and then headed east towards @ORGANIZATION1. After the long and boring road trip, we parked our silver minivan in a five - dollar parking lot right next to the @ORGANIZATION1. First, we went up the @CAPS1 tower, where we saw everything from the incredible height. The view was simply breathtaking. After that, we saw our cousins. I had never even seen them before. As we were looking at the waterfall, my brother said, ""@CAPS2, look at those boats under the waterfall. Dad, can we go on them?"" ""@CAPS3, but first we have to buy tickets,"" replied my dad. We bought the tickets and got in line. ""Why are there so many people?"" I asked. There was about @NUM1 people waiting in line with us. ""@CAPS6, be patient,"" my dad replied. I stood there, looking at all the people in front of us. It seemed like we were never going to get on the boat. I saw people handing out blue rain jackets. After @NUM2 minutes, we still did not get the jackets yet. We were moving as slow as the tectonic plates on the earth. Finally, we got a jacket, but we weren't on a boat yet. My brother was complaining, and my dad started yelling at him. I was still standing there, almost ready to explode. At last, they called us up onto the boat. It was amazing going under the waterfall. We were in the mist. When we came back to shore, we talked about how amazing it was. Being patient has a reward at the end. Even though it is hard to be patient, I still did it, and anyone can. I was patient the whole time in line to get on the boat. Patience can be rewarding."
645	18561	7	3	In third grade, one day was one of the happiest days of my life. It was the day when we were going to get our dog @ORGANIZATION1, and I was excited and as patient as ever. It was a cold winter's day. I was so eager to go to school because I knew that after school, we'd get the dog. I couldn't wait for the school day to end. When I got to school, I couldn't wait to tell everyone that today was the day. When school ended, my mom came to pick up my sister and me from school. We went home and waited patiently in the living room. We were watching @CAPS1 TV, all the while listening intently for the garage door to open. And then we heard it open. We all jumped up and down, running and screaming outside. There she was, @ORGANIZATION1, the best dog in the world. That's the way I was patient on that winter's day, waiting patiently for the best dog in the world.
646	18562	7	3	It was a normal, old, boring day in the @DATE1. The sun was shining dully, and I was just lounging around, not expecting anything exciting. But then, I had just got a call from my sister - in - law. She literally just called me out of the blue and asked if I wanted to go to Cedar Point the next day. I was utterly astonished! I didn't know what to say! At first, I thought she was hiding somewhere nearby, trying to play a prank on me. But when she asked to talk to my mom, I knew she was legit. When she was done talking to my mom, my mom too was in shock. I was so grateful that I could not fall asleep. I ended up waking up at @NUM1 am. I wasn't too fond of waking up so early, but it was totally worth it. It was a long two - hour drive. The car ride was filled with anticipation. But when we got there, we bought our tickets and headed straight for the Mavric. The line was humongous. People were queued up as far as the eye could see, but we waited. Halfway into the line, the ride broke down. I could not believe my eyes. I've wanted to ride that one forever. I was disappointed. We waited patiently for around @NUM2 @NUM3 hours, maybe @NUM4. I was hungry, tired, and cooking in the sun. Once it opened up again, we only had to wait like ½ hour. But all in all, it was worth it. My sister - in - law @PERSON1 was very impressed on how patiently I waited. And we went to the car to get some food. It was the best food I had ever eaten. The rest of the day was tremendous. That was definitely the most patient I was in my entire life. Due to the fact that it was just me and @PERSON1, I think that's why I was so calm. Even though that part of the day kind of sucked, it was still an all - around great time!
647	18563	7	3	This year, mom married my new step - dad. I guess he wanted us to “bond”, so we took up trap shooting. It's pretty much the same thing as skeet shooting. Well, actually, it is the same. Anyway, he used to be a cop and had a shotgun. So, we went out to an open field and tried it. It didn't work out. I missed every single clay target, except one. I only got one bb through the thing. But I was cool with it. I knew I was bad because it was the first time. Then, we tried to hit the target dead - center. I felt shown up. We left that day with only ten hits and an uncountable amount of misses. I was feeling pretty low. Within the next week, we tried again. He launched the bird, and it was almost like in slow motion. I watched it arc through the air. I followed it with the sight at the end of the gun and pulled the trigger. And I watched the bird explode. Haha, I finally did it! We launched another one, and I hit it. I went @NUM1 in a row! It was amazing for someone who missed almost all of them just a few days before. And that's how I learned to be patient. Patience in learning a new skill paid off in the end.
648	18564	7	3	A time when I was patient is when our family goes to @CAPS1 Point. My family and I go to @CAPS1 Point a lot. Usually, the lines are very long. Sometimes, they're over an hour! Once, on my first time on the @CAPS3, the wait was @NUM1 hours. But we were really excited, so we went anyway. We were about @NUM2 hour in, and then they had some technical difficulties. People around us started to grumble, but we just waited. After about @NUM3 min, the line was moving again. When I got to ride it, it was really fun (although it only lasted @NUM4 seconds). A couple of years later, the new ride The @CAPS4 opened up. It looked very fun, but the line didn't look inviting at all. I am not sure how long we waited. People were shifting around, getting impatient. But we held on. When we got to the end and rode the ride, it was amazing. I was glad I had enough patience to wait in those long lines. Patience truly made the experience rewarding.
649	18565	7	3	What is patience? Patience means that you are understanding and tolerant. A patient person experiences difficulties without complaining. Most people are impatient these days. In our fast - paced world, everyone seems to be in a rush. Patience is like waiting. For example, if you are stuck in a traffic jam, sitting in a long line of cars, or maybe you have to wait your turn for something important. Patience is one of the best qualities someone could have. Every year, more people become impatient. @CAPS1 want people to “hurry” or “move faster”. @CAPS1 need to gain patience by taking deep breaths or calming down. I think the world would be more peaceful if everybody had patience. There would be no more conflict. If that happened some day, everybody's lives would be perfect. People would be more understanding of each other, and the world would be a much better place to live in.
650	18566	7	3	@PERSON3 and the @CAPS1 @CAPS2. Vincenta was walking one day on a sunny street. And @CAPS9 saw his friend @PERSON5. “@CAPS3, a - @PERSON3”, said @PERSON5. “@PERSON5, you know to call me @PERSON3”, replied @CAPS4. (@CAPS5 - shen - tay). “@PERSON3, my mami told me to send that @CAPS12 beans get to @PERSON1. Would you do it for me?”, @PERSON5 asked. “Cee, @CAPS21 of @LOCATION2 has each other's backs.” @CAPS6 you @CAPS28! I have to go now! Bye!”, @PERSON5 said as @CAPS9 ran off in a hurry. @PERSON3 walked over to @PERSON2's house and knocked on the door. There was no answer. @CAPS7 @PERSON3 walked over to @LOCATION1's old house. “Abandoned,” @CAPS9 thought. “I know! I'll plant them here!”. @CAPS7 @CAPS9 dug a hole and planted the beans. @NUM1 minutes later, @CAPS9 was still waiting. “@CAPS8!”, @CAPS9 yelled. @PERSON4 was walking by and saw @PERSON3 angered. “@CAPS4, @CAPS14 you a screaming boy? You gonna wake up my papi!”, @CAPS11 exclaimed. “@CAPS12 stupid beans don't grow, @PERSON4.”, @CAPS9 replied. “@CAPS14 do you want to see beans? Go to bed, they'll be there under!”, @CAPS11 told him. “@CAPS16! I am here staying! Eizel will support me on this one. Haven't you heard of that “@CAPS17” guy?”. “@CAPS18, @CAPS19 will see you later @PERSON3.” And @CAPS11 strolled off. The next day, @PERSON5 walked by. “Oh my god! @PERSON3”, @CAPS9 yelled. @PERSON3 woke up and couldn't believe what @CAPS9 saw. The bean stalk had grown right over @LOCATION1's two - story house. “You stink!”. @CAPS20 cavd. All of a sudden, @PERSON3 woke up. It was a dream. @CAPS9 looked at the @CAPS23. “@CAPS24!”, still nothing. A day later, @CAPS9 was still waiting, hungry and tired. @PERSON4 came by again. “@PERSON5 doesn't know, does @CAPS9? Well, @PERSON3 please come inside and forget about the seeds.” “@CAPS16!”, @CAPS9 screamed. “You're just going to anger yourself. “@CAPS16! Go away!”, @CAPS9 screamed. “@CAPS27! I will.” And @CAPS11 stomped off once again. Two @DATE1 of waiting and finally, something popped up. One was alive and lasted @NUM1 minutes then died. The other was just a car bolt. @PERSON3 had been bitten by bugs for the @DATE1 and was swatting at the air. Then @CAPS9 asked himself, “Was it worth it?”. Cee - yes @CAPS28 - friend. In the end, the experience taught @PERSON3 about the uncertainty of waiting and the value of perseverance.
651	18567	7	3	"Being patient is a very hard thing to do. Most people struggle with it, but some are good at it. I am one of those who find it difficult. The most challenging thing I've ever done was waiting in line for three and a half hours just to ride the dragster at Cedar Point. It was an extremely hot and sticky @DATE1 day, and the park was packed. There were flies everywhere, constantly tickling your legs, buzzing in your ear, and even biting you. You could hear the screams from the rides from a mile away. Overweight people were wearing shorts and tank - tops, munching on popcorn. It was brutal! I had ridden every ride except for the dragster. The dragster is that thrilling ride that takes you up to the very top and then shoots you down as fast as a bullet. The only catch was, if you wanted to be in the first cart, which @CAPS3 did, it meant a three and a half - hour wait! ""Can @CAPS3 just go ride the skyscraper again?"" I pleaded. ""@CAPS2! @CAPS3 came all the way to @LOCATION1; @CAPS3 are not going to leave without riding the best, funnest ride! You are going to stand in this line and wait!"" @CAPS1 quickly replied. ""@CAPS5! I never get what I want, do I!"" ""You get everything you want. You can go ride the skyscraper again if you want, but I am staying here! And I feel bad for whoever has to sit by you because they are going to have bruises and scratches all over their arms. Heck, you might pop their eardrum from screaming so much!"" ""Well, I don't wanna put somebody else through that pain, but you, I might!"" By the time @CAPS3 were done arguing, there were only twenty minutes left. @CAPS3 didn't get the front cart, but the wait wasn't even that bad after all."
652	18569	7	3	A time when I was patient was when I was helping a classmate with his science project. We were assigned this project, and he just didn't understand any of it. He would place things in the wrong spots, write down information that had nothing to do with science, and he didn't listen properly. He was trying to do things correctly, but then he lost all of our hard - work! I couldn't believe it. So, we started from scratch, and I guided him more carefully, being very patient with him. After three days, we were almost finished. When he put the final touches on it and presented it, he got an A+ on it. Yes, @CAPS1, he got an A+! It made me feel so good, and I felt rewarded for my hard work and patience. In the end, being patient not only makes you feel good but also the person you help. This was a time when I was patient.
653	18570	7	3	"There once was a little girl named @PERSON2. @CAPS10 was the important girl in the land of Narrative. Narrative was a small land filled with loving and patient people who waited for everything. Every child there was patient, except for @PERSON2. @PERSON2 was an only child living with her mother and @CAPS12. @PERSON2 hated being the only child. So, @PERSON2's mother, named @CAPS3, told her husband @CAPS1 that they should have another child so that @PERSON2 wouldn't be alone. Soon, they told @PERSON2 that @CAPS10 would be having a little brother or sister. @PERSON2 was overjoyed. In fact, she was so happy that @CAPS10 ran up the stairs and started coming up with baby names. Then she ran back down and shared them with her mother, who was rocking in her chair. ""I like Kuven,"" said @CAPS12 as he walked towards the dinner table where @PERSON2 and her mother were sitting. ""Ok,"" said @PERSON2 as she cleaned the table. ""Do you like @CAPS2, @CAPS3, @LOCATION1, @CAPS4, @CAPS5 or @CAPS6?"" said @PERSON2. ""I like @PERSON1,"" said @CAPS12 as he pushed in his chair. ""Me as well,"" said mother as she walked up the stairs towards her bedroom. ""I can't wait till the baby gets here,"" said @PERSON2 on her way up the stairs. The next morning, @PERSON2 woke up early to check if her mother had the baby. ""@CAPS7, you have the baby yet?"" said @PERSON2 as she woke up her mother and @CAPS12. ""@CAPS8,"" said the @CAPS12, ""the baby has to grow inside of mommy, okay."" ""Okay,"" said @PERSON2. @NUM1 months later, @PERSON2 got up very early, screaming, ""Is it here? @CAPS7, has it come?"" ""@CAPS8,"" said the mother, lifting her head over her belly to look at @PERSON2. ""That baby will never come. I hate that thing. I will be lonely forever,"" said @PERSON2 as she walked towards her bedroom. ""Be patient. @CAPS10 will come,"" screamed @CAPS12 from the other room. ""@CAPS10,"" said @PERSON2, ""it's a girl."" @PERSON2 was extremely happy. @NUM1 hour later, ""Oh, oh, oh!"" screamed mother from her bedroom. ""Are you okay, mommy?"" said @PERSON2 as she walked into the room. ""The baby is coming. Call your @CAPS12,"" said mother. ""@PERSON2,"" ""Yes."" ""Mommy is going to have to deliver this baby, okay."" @NUM3 hours later, dad came home, running up the stairs and went into the room to see @PERSON2, his wife, and the new baby @PERSON1 fast asleep. ""Told you if you were patient, @CAPS10 would come,"" said @CAPS12 to himself."
654	18571	7	3	Some stories about when I was patient include waiting for a teacher's help, waiting during my grandma's surgery, waiting for my turn in sports, and waiting for my mom at work. When my grandma had surgery, we sat in the hospital waiting area for three hours. During that time, I played a few rounds of chess with my aunt. We also had some conversations and then went to the gift shop in the hospital. Later, we even took a short trip to the nearby mall. The teacher assigned us homework, and I didn't understand a particular part. The teacher was busy helping another student, so I patiently waited. I skipped that part and came back to it later. By then, the teacher was free to assist me, and I finally understood the homework. My mom took me to her workplace after school because I would have been alone at home. While waiting, I mopped the floor to pass the time. I also rested my head on the table for a bit. I chatted with some of the employees and walked back and forth across the room. These are the instances when I showed patience.
655	18572	7	3	"A time when @CAPS2 dad was patient was when he had an important meeting with his boss. The boss was running late, so @CAPS2 dad sat down and waited. He just sat there, waiting and waiting. @NUM1 hours later, the boss finally showed up and said, ""@CAPS1, you need to wait for another hour because I have to talk to @CAPS2 wife. She says she really needs to speak with me."" @CAPS2 dad replied, ""@CAPS3, but hurry!"" Another hour passed. @CAPS5, the boss returned and said to @CAPS2 dad, ""@CAPS4 for waiting."" @CAPS5, finally, he was done with his meeting. I asked my dad, ""What took you so long?"" He simply said, ""Be patient."" That was the time when @CAPS2 dad demonstrated patience."
656	18573	7	3	"@CAPS1 @CAPS1 my cell phone suddenly buzzes in my pocket. It's Lexa, @CAPS2. I'm really struggling as I don't know if I can ever get over the fight that we had yesterday after she called me some hurtful names. I actually answered the phone once and said, ""I need some time. @CAPS5 be patient."" She definitely isn't listening. So, I finally decide to call her back. She picks up on the first ring. ""@CAPS3, Are you there?"" she sounds desperate, eager to call me the nickname she always has. ""Yes,"" I reply. ""I'm sososososorry, I didn't mean it,"" she pleads. ""I told you I needed time and for you to be patient,"" I say, almost in tears. ""I know but I can't be when I @CAPS5 hurt my best friend,"" she says remorsefully. ""Patience means that you are understanding & tolerant about waiting without complaint,"" I explain. ""@CAPS4."" ""If you'd @CAPS5 try to be patient and @MONTH1 be you wouldn't be complaining,"" I add. ""@CAPS6"" she says and then hangs up. Sure, I think I am so mad that she thinks she can @CAPS5 can and it would be all better. She should've waited. If only she'd been patient, things could have been different."
657	18574	7	3	One day it was me and my mother. We were on our way to the store, but @CAPS1 we had to make a detour and go pick up my big brother from basketball practice. When @CAPS1 we got there, he wasn't outside as we expected. My mother started calling his phone repeatedly, but he wasn't answering. My mother kept calling, getting a bit worried. Finally, my mother said that we were going to wait until he got out. Now that's what I call patience. It shows that sometimes waiting calmly for someone is the right thing to do, even when it's a bit frustrating.
658	18575	7	3	"There once was a time when someone I knew was patient. It was a cold @DATE1 day and I was at school. My teacher was very sick, so we had a substitute. He was a very mean substitute. All of a sudden, a kid started breathing heavily. He clearly needed his inhaler. I quickly told the sub that the kid needed to go get it, but he said no. The person next to me also said the same thing, but she was patient and simply said, ""okay"". @CAPS1 After a short while, the sub finally let the kid go. That was the time a person I know showed great patience, and it made a positive difference in that situation."
659	18576	7	3	"Patient! I was trying to be patient when I was waiting for my football game. It was a @DATE1 @TIME1 and I went to go get my shoulder pads, my helmet, and my pants for football. We woke up @CAPS3 early, thinking though that we were going to be the first ones there. But I thought wrong. There were like @NUM1 people already there. I was freaking out, man, really freaking out! I said to my mom, ""You said we'd be early. You said we'd be the first ones here."" Well, wasn't she totally wrong. I was really mad at her. We ended up being the last people in line. All of the good helmets were gone. Mom said, ""@CAPS1 you need to be patient like the other parents."" @CAPS3 I tried to be patient, but it wasn't working out @CAPS3 well. I was @CAPS3 impatient. I was yelling, saying, ""Come on, we don't have time for you to be sitting around all day. We don't have time to waste like it's Christmas."" @CAPS2 When I got there, I said out loud, ""@CAPS2!"" The people in charge of the football stuff got mad at me. ""@CAPS3"" I said, ""I hope they have my size for my football stuff."" Just as I feared, they didn't. I was @CAPS3 mad. And just what they said, ""Come back tomorrow and we'll have your size."" Well, that's my story. I was kinda patient toward the end, but at the beginning I was yelling. @CAPS3 That shows you if you're not patient, you'll probably won't get what you're waiting all day for. It's a valuable lesson I learned that day."
660	18577	7	3	"My favorite books, now a movie, I have to see it. Twilight Eclipse. Me and my mom were heading to the movie theater and I wouldn't stop talking about the movie. We drove into the parking lot and @CAPS1 there was nowhere to park. My mom was about to leave before I said, ""@CAPS1, there's one, mom."" ""Sweet,"" she replied. Me and my mom had been waiting to see the bloodsucking movie for three months. As we were stepping into the building, we rushed to get the tickets and the food. The movie was going to start at @NUM1. I was going to start saying something, feeling a bit impatient, but I calmed myself down and used patience for three hours straight. I took pictures of me and my mom being funny. We did a bunch of random things like joking around and people - watching to get past the time. It actually helped. The security guard said, ""Stand up time for trivia."" They asked a bunch of questions about the last movie. ""@CAPS2 @CAPS3"" I raised my hand and I answered the question right. I had a choice of getting a free popcorn or a pin. I got the pin. I was so excited. The movie was about to start. After the movie was done, me and my mom headed home and we fell asleep right when we got @CAPS1. This was the story when I used patience, and it made the whole experience more enjoyable."
661	18578	7	3	ì?? Can we watch @ORGANIZATION1.î I looked at the clock on the wall. It was five thirty. ìYouíll have to wait.î I said calmly. ì@CAPS3 doesnít come on till eight.î ì@CAPS1 I wanna watch @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 z @ORGANIZATION1 .î he whined. ìNot again.î I thought to myself. Do we have to go through this every day? Why donít I still have the patience? I walked slowly to my room, knowing I would have to keep him @CAPS2 quiet until eight o'clock. ìKumehnn, @CAPS2 quiet.î I was starting to get mad. ì@CAPS3 doesnít come on until eight, okay.î I managed to hold back my frustration and hoped he would understand.
662	18579	7	3	I am never patient. Whether it's waiting for a delicious dinner to be served or waiting for a friend to show up, I am never patient. The only time I can be patient is when I'm waiting for school to start. I can wait hours, days, weeks, months, even years if I'm waiting for school to start because I'm excited about learning new things. Then also, the thing I can never be patient for is waiting for a friend to call because I always want to do something every second. I will run around the house for hours until a friend calls. And when they do call, I rush right to the phone and answer it right away. I will even sit there and stare at the phone intently, waiting for someone to call. Another thing I can be patient for is waiting for my mom to tell me to clean my room. I will always leave the house and try not to come back till bedtime so I will never have to clean my room. In the end, it seems my patience is very selective.
663	18580	7	3	My cousin was patient when we were waiting in line for the top thrill at Cedar Point. The line almost took @NUM1 hours. My cousin was just simply silent, as usual, and just waiting calmly. I was very impatient. I was tapping my feet rapidly, running around the small area, etc. I was about to die of boredom. My legs ached terribly, I was extremely hungry, and I was too hot under the sun. I just couldnít stand it. She was just standing there quietly, not talking at all. When we started to move forward a bit, I got a little happier but still impatient. After @NUM1 hours, we finally got into the ride. After the ride, I asked my cousin why she was so silent. She said that her mom said for every word one of us said, we have a minute of homework when we come back to @LOCATION1. I was stuck doing homework the next whole week. That's how I learned my lesson to be patient and think before I act.
664	18581	7	3	"Being patient means that when you're in a bad situation you donít complain. Some people arenít very patient and some are very patient. In my eyes, patience is very important. I like to think of myself as sort of patient or I think I am. One time I had to be very patient when my family had to drive fourteen hours to get to @LOCATION1. It was not fun at all. One bad thing about it was that you always had to go to the bathroom. Once you have the privilege to go when you want taken away, then you want it even more. But I kept saying to myself, ""Be patient, weíll stop at the next place."" Another thing was that you were always hungry or thirsty. We only stopped three times, which was not fun. Also, whenever you got food, it was not enough. But I didínt complain. Lastly, you just really want to get there. You couldnít wait for the sandy beaches and the waves. It seemed like we would never get there. It was not the best experience. When we finally got there, I realized that the trip was like a big test of patience and I passed. And actually, it wasnít nearly as bad as the trip back, which made me appreciate my patience even more."
665	18582	7	3	"One day I went to the hospital. The nurses gave me an IV, a CAT scan, and pulled tape off my arm. It hurt so bad but I was patient through all of it. First, when I was getting a CAT scan, I did not want to do it but we had to, so I did it and was very patient. I lay still on the cold table, trying to calm my nerves. Also, when they gave me my IV, they missed my vein so they ripped it out and put it in my other arm. I was very patient for the pain to go down. I took deep breaths and tried to focus on something else. Lastly, when I was done at @NUM1 o'clock pm and started at @NUM1 o'clock am, there was a big piece of tape on my arm for @NUM3 hours. The nurse came and said, ""We can go home now"" and said, ""You can take the tape off now, sweetie."" I said, ""Ok."" I pulled it piece by piece. Then the nurse said, 'Here, let me do it!' She said ""@NUM4, @NUM5, @NUM6"" and pulled it off. It hurt so bad but I was patient and didn't cry or make a fuss. Now you know that I was patient and was hurt all day, and I'm proud of myself for being able to endure it."
666	18583	7	3	I was incredibly patient when my dad said he would get me some @CAPS1. They were @CAPS2 and @CAPS3, and the shoes cost @MONEY1. I asked him a few times about the shoes. He didn't answer, so I knew what to do. I decided to do the dishes and clean my room. I waited for the shoes so badly that I even cleaned stuff that was already clean. After a month of this constant cleaning, I still didn't get the shoes. That's how something went wrong. SCHOOL!!!!!!! I haven't been acting right in school. I finally got my stuff together. Then I got the @CAPS4, and it made me feel a bit better about the whole situation.
667	18584	7	3	"Don't you just love waiting for something to come or happen and when it does you realize it was all worth waiting for? I know I do! Sometimes it's too long of a wait and you just have to be patient. Patience is very important in such situations. I have had to use patience many times before. Recently, I had to use patience to wait for my baby cousin @CAPS1 to be born. I had to wait a long time, @NUM1 weeks to be exact! I was just so excited that I couldn't keep myself together. I would pace around the house and talk about the baby non - stop. Now just yesterday she was born. The wait is over and I feel a great sense of relief. Although, I still have to be patient to see her. But not much longer, only until I get out of school. I have been waiting so long that I can't even stand it! Every day I used to mark it on my calendar with a big red X. I used to tell myself, ""She will be here soon."" But, the days never seemed to go by fast enough. I kept asking my mom, ""How many more days?"" It was pure agony! As the day approached I got more excited. She had gotten a lot of cute clothes from people. I had to be even more patient to even see the clothes on her. I also had to be patient to hold her. Although I did already say a while back that I got to be the first cousin to hold her. Now that she is born and finally here, I get to be the first one to hold her, I can stop counting down, get to see her in her new clothes and can stop bothering my mom. So, all in all patience is important. If you use it, the thing you are waiting for is much better and the experience is more rewarding."
668	18586	7	3	Patience is a kind thing. It's great when people are patient, but still complaining about it is not patience at all. True patience is waiting and being kind while you're doing it. People who lose their patience easily really aren't cool. It's nice when someone waits for you, for example, if you're on the phone talking to someone else, or even on the internet doing something important. It's very polite if you have patience. I don't know the exact definition of it but I'm just gonna guess. I think it's a person waiting patiently and quietly on the other person even if they need to get somewhere urgently. Having patience can make interactions smoother and relationships better.
669	18587	7	3	"Aooooh, when I'm seven I'm going to be able to ride on the hoder hunt; this place is hinting forever, said Alex, the mictiory adventurer. Is this a fun place??? This route... As I was waiting in the long line to ride the ???, I was getting very anxious. This is when my brother said, ""Calm down, we're half - way through."" ""No, I can't. This is a long line,"" replied Alex. ""Well, here's what you do to speed things up. Try to tell the person in front of you the reason and behave nicely or talk with us."" ""Ok?"" replied Alex. So, I started to talk to the person in front of me. We were almost to the ride already. I was getting very excited and talked a lot. I thanked my brother for the information. I managed to find a good reason to pass the time. That's a patient time about me, Alex, and with the help of my brother. It made the waiting a bit more bearable."
670	18588	7	3	"Patience is a quality or characteristic of a person. It is not easy to be patient, but some people are very patient. Especially when you know you want to be mad at someone, but you don't. My older brother was always patient with me, especially the time I look back at and wish I could erase. It was that night I was going to stay at @PERSON2 and @PERSON4, my aunt and uncles. I had always had trouble staying places because I got homesick and cried. That is exactly what happened that night I regret. @PERSON3, @PERSON6, and I were playing games in their room. I couldn't stop thinking of my mom. I told myself over and over ""stiff upper lip."" I had forgotten about her for a while then the feeling came again, so I thought of how much fun I would have tomorrow if I just stayed the night. It didn't work. Tears rolled faster than @CAPS1 falls. ""I want to go home,"" I managed to sniffle. I ran downstairs to tell my older cousin @PERSON1, who was babysitting. After what felt like an eternity, @CAPS3 finally opened her door and brought me upstairs to get the phone. My mom answered and realized it was my voice and said ""What?"" all grouchy. I had sniffled and said ""I want to come home, I miss you."" and sniffled more. ""Someone will pick you up soon. Be packed and ready."" @CAPS3 said and hung up. I sadly told @PERSON3 and @PERSON6 as I packed my little bag and waited on the wooden bench by the door. Soon enough a car came up the driveway and honked. It was @PERSON5. I said bye once more and went out into the cold, windy night and hopped in @LOCATION1's car. ""@CAPS4, didn't you want to stay?"" @PERSON5 asked calmly. ""I don't know."" And it wasn't brought up until I walked through our front door. I already knew my punishment, no more staying the night somewhere for a couple weeks. This experience taught me that I need to work on my patience and ability to be away from home."
671	18590	7	3	I had to be patient many times. I had to be patient when my @CAPS1 broke his ear - drum. I was anxiously waiting for x - rays, all the while also waiting to go on stage. These are some of the times when I had to be patient. When my @CAPS1 broke his ear - drum, I was about five years old. I had to sit with my brother in the cold, quiet waiting room. It felt like an eternity. It was a frosty winter night, and I was in my warm pajamas. I was so bored but extremely worried about my @CAPS1. In @NUM1 grade, I accidentally hit my wrist in a door and then a wall. I ended up in the emergency room for @NUM2 to @NUM3 hours. The medical staff there were very good at their jobs. My mom and I were stuck watching @CAPS4 @CAPS5 on the small TV they had in the corner. It was freezing cold in the waiting room, and I had a bulky @CAPS6 on my wrist. Finally, I was waiting to go on stage for my @NUM1 grade concert. I was incredibly nervous, and my nerves just kept building up. I waited for @NUM5 minutes, but it felt like @NUM5 years. I was sitting next to my good friend, which helped calm me down a little. When we got on stage, I sang my heart out and was really happy I had waited. Those are some of the times when I had to be patient. I am not naturally good at being patient, but I waited and got good results, which shows that patience can be rewarding.
672	18591	7	3	Have you ever been patient? I have, especially this one main time in my life. That one main time in my life was when I was waiting for my dog to have her babies. My dog's name is @CAPS1 Mae. She is a three - year - old, full - blooded pitbull with a shiny coat and a friendly demeanor. It all started when we took @CAPS1 to the @CAPS6 for her early check - up. The @CAPS6 examined her thoroughly and said she was all good. Then, the vet pulled my mom to the side. My heart started pumping faster than ever because usually, when they pull the parents to the side, it means something bad. My mom suddenly screamed and rejoiced with excitement. I ran over to her, and she screamed, “@CAPS3 is going to have babies!” Then I screamed with her in pure delight. We went and got some treats for @CAPS1, called Dixixe, and then we took her to the bark play area. That night, she got her very own delicious steak at supper. The next few months were passing by faster than ever, or at least it seemed that way. Now, @CAPS1 was getting visibly bigger. The @CAPS6 said it should be at least six months until she had the puppies. “It's already been five and a half,” mom said. “She has milk now,” I told my sister, @DATE1. “I wouldn't doubt it,” said @DATE1. Then we went and took @CAPS1 inside for the night. The next day, while I was getting ready for school, my mom said, “Hey sweetheart, I called the @CAPS6, and he said that he wouldn't be surprised if @CAPS1 had her puppies today.” I replied, “Oh cool, but let's not rush @CAPS1. She's going through a lot right now.” Then we said our goodbyes, and I went to the bus stop. The bus ride usually takes about an hour to school, but today it only felt like thirty minutes. The day was going by quickly. Before I knew it, I was home. I walked in the front door, and my mom said, “Oh, you're just in time, honey. @CAPS3 is having her babies!” We both ran into the garage faster than ever. @CAPS1 was lying on a soft blanket. I rushed to her, and she licked my hand gently. I told her, “Everything is going to be alright.” I went inside to get her a bowl of fresh water and some soft food. When I came back out, she already had two puppies. It took about an hour for the other two and then another hour for the last two. Turns out they were all girls. Now we have eight dogs at my house. There's the mom, @CAPS1 Mae, the @CAPS12 @CAPS13, and all eight little girl puppies named Cutie, Bootsier, Tinker, Bella, Harmony, and Melony. I love my dogs, and waiting for the puppies was definitely worth it.
673	18592	7	3	On @DATE1, which was my birthday, we went to go get a cake. I really wanted an ice - cream cake with colorful sprinkles on top. There were over @NUM1 people there at the cake shop, and the line was long. I did not have much patience at that moment. But my mom was calm and patient. It was a nice evening with a playground nearby. So, I went to the playground to play while my mom waited in line. After a while, my mom came to get me. We went to pick up the delicious ice - cream cake, and then we went home to celebrate my birthday. Even though I was impatient at first, in the end, I got my birthday cake, and it was a great day.
674	18593	7	3	Patience can lead to rewards, and @PERSON4 the brown bear learned that @DATE1 when he was in line to get an autograph from @PERSON1. He might have been very frustrated as the line moved slowly, but he just stayed calm and kept looking forward to meeting @PERSON3. One day, @PERSON4 saw a @CAPS1 @CAPS2 headline in a newspaper stand. He put @NUM1 coins in the machine and tried to open the newspaper holder to grab one, but it was jammed. He went into the gas station to tell the people there, but unfortunately, they were not at the counter. He hit the small bell on the top, but nobody came. @PERSON4 was trying his best to be as patient as possible. He then went to a different store and got the newspaper there. The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 headline said that his favorite star, @PERSON2, was going to be in town. He quickly hurried to Buggle Town and saw a line that was @NUM2 long stretching down the street. He was so excited to see @PERSON3. @PERSON4 got to the line at @TIME2 and had been there for @NUM3 hours, and she had only gotten @NUM4 autographs done. This was clearly going to be a long day for @PERSON4. At @NUM5 p.m., @PERSON4 got a hot dog and a soda from the sidewalk food business to keep his energy up. He was still the last person in line, and his patience started to wear down quite a bit. At @TIME3, there were only @NUM6 people, including him, left in the line. He finally got to @PERSON3 at @TIME4. @PERSON3 and her crew then notified @PERSON4 that he won the patience contest. They told him that he gets to see her in concert, gets her phone number, and wins a date with her. He was overjoyed that he had kept himself patient for five hours. @PERSON4 almost lost his cool at @TIME1, but he held on. He knew he would never forget this moment. Also, @PERSON4 ended up being @PERSON3's boyfriend. That is when @PERSON4 learned that patience can truly pay off in the end.
675	18594	7	3	When I was patient, there was a specific time that stands out. There are more and more ways I can be patient when I'm not in a rush to do something. I'm going to tell you a true story about when I was patient and not in a hurry to get things done. On my first day at school, we were having a great time with a bunch of new classmates. And on that first day, we had some schoolwork to do. When we started to work, some of the other students were not patient. I looked around the bright, colorful classroom and started thinking about how I should be patient. “Be patient,” I said to myself. I knew that if I took my time, I could reach a good grade. So, I focused and was patient while doing my work. The next day, I was really excited to see my grade on that work. I had a great feeling. That was the day when I learned that being patient and taking my time can lead to good results. It shows that patience is a valuable quality that can help us achieve our goals.
676	18595	7	3	At a time when I was a patient, I went to @CAPS1 @CAPS2. I was patiently waiting to get on the rollercoaster. For an hour and a half, I stood in the line, watching as the coaster zoomed by, feeling the excitement building. I was also patiently waiting when I had to get something to eat. I queued up at the food stand, looking at the menu options. I was patient when I wanted to get on any of the rides. I knew that the wait was worth it for the thrill. That is a time when I was patient, and I realized that patience can lead to great experiences.
677	18596	7	3	A time when I was patient was last @DATE1. My friend, @CAPS1, took me to Cedar Point in @LOCATION1. The place was so packed that it took five minutes to slowly make our way from the car to the entrance, squeezing through the crowds. As we got in, the place looked amazing! It was almost like a dream, with colorful lights and excited people everywhere. They even had a ride to take you from one part of the park to another. The first ride we went on was the @ORGANIZATION1. We waited, and waited for about ten minutes, and then things got a bit boring as we just stood there. It had been almost fifteen minutes and we weren't even close to the ride! So we waited some more, about ten more minutes, and things got a little faster. At this part, the line was gradually moving a little faster. Finally, it was our turn to ride. We had a yellow car, and you could already feel the adrenaline pumping. After we were strapped in, the person who locks people's seats said “go!” and we took off like a bird. In the end, it was definitely worth being patient as the ride was exhilarating.
678	18597	7	3	Have you ever been a patient? Like at the @CAPS1’s office? Well let me tell you a time I have. One time I was really sick and I started crying because I was in a lot of pain. I was crying for an hour straight, my body aching all over. Then my mom took me to the hospital where she works. When I got out of the car, I somehow stopped crying. I told my mom that I stopped crying but she told me that I had to go see the @CAPS1. When we went in we saw this man being rushed to the @LOCATION1 in a hurry. We went right to the waiting room and all the seats were taken up. When @CAPS1 @PERSON1 came out she asked a man in to see her with his son. That gave us two seats to sit in. After about @CAPS2 minutes she called us in to a medical room. She examined me and I was really scared because I might have pneumonia or a very bad virus. When she came out of her office I was tightly holding my mom’s hand. She came up to us holding a piece of paper and my mom asked what I had. Luckily she said I only had a cold and an ear infection. When we walked out of the patient room, my mom had to pay. She only had to pay about ? @NUM1. We had to go get my medicine, so we walked to the elevator, went to the ground floor, and went into the pharmacy. The pharmacy was so full that I felt like a pancake being squished under another pancake. When we got to the counter, my mom asked for my medicine and she got it along with a big lollipop. When I got home I took some medicine and went to bed. The following day I woke up and about @TIME1 I got to have the lollipop. That was a time when I was patient, and it taught me that waiting can lead to getting better.
679	18598	7	3	One day @CAPS1 was ordering a dress with a pair of shoes and a small accessory. But when she was ordering it, they said it had not yet arrived. “You would have to wait,” Rosy said. “No thank you, I know it will arrive,” said @CAPS1. The next @NUM1 months passed, and finally, the dress had arrived. The magazine company called and said “we are very sorry for the late arrival of your dress. As an apology, we will offer it to you at no charge and thank you for your patience.” @CAPS1 was pleased and she ordered two more dresses, and they arrived the very next day. She was still happy with the outcome, realizing that patience had its rewards.
680	18599	7	3	I am not a patient person. I hate waiting for anything and everything, and I often complain about difficulties with myself and others. I play volleyball on a team for my school. There are a few girls on my team that completely test my patience. I'm sure the other girls on my team feel the same way. These few girls are pretty nice people but volleyball is just not their forte. In practice, one of these girls doesn't even try. She even said so herself that she is going to skip a few practices, and her lazy attitude was driving me mad. Another girl tries pretty hard, but she's boring, controlling, and she thinks she knows absolutely everything there is to know about volleyball. I think she made one over - hand serve in these years of playing volleyball, and she thinks she can do it every time now. She can rarely serve underhand, for crying out loud! This other girl, oh my god I don't even know where to begin on how much of my patience goes into her. She was probably the worst player on the team, and now that she's broken her pinky finger, she could be even worse considering how she hasn't played in about three weeks. But since she's still part of the team, she goes to all of our games and tries to direct us on and tries to act cool but fails miserably. It is actually kind of funny. Now, I knew that these girls need quite a bit of practice, and I know it won't happen overnight. But I guess I'll just have to put up with them and keep being patient as we're all on the same team.
681	18600	7	3	Patience is hard for me. I am simply an impatient person by nature. Patience in my life is a rare occurrence, so I will describe a time that I was patient. “Come on, you can get it this time,” I encouraged myself, my eyes fixed intently on the net. The net was the obstacle standing between me and a successful serve. If the net was shorter, I would be able to get my volleyball serve over with ease. I balanced the white volleyball carefully in the palm of my hand, feeling its smooth texture. I lowered my left arm and raised it again quickly, sending the ball high above my head. I thrust my hand forward with all my might. Thwap! I struck the ball, but it went barrelling into the net, bouncing back with a dull thud. “Oh no,” I thought. “You got this!” my entire team stared at me, their eyes filled with encouragement. Clunk, clunk. I bounce the ball twice, spin it around once in my hand, trying to calm my nerves. I will myself not even to look in the crowd, focusing solely on the task at hand. My hand strikes the ball again, and this time, it flies over the net and smacks into the middle of the court. Since I was patient and didn't give up, I achieved my goal. This taught me one thing. Patience brings victory, and with it, a sense of accomplishment that is truly rewarding.
682	18601	7	3	Patience is something you have to work on. I do not have a lot of patience; I do not like waiting at all as it is not fun. I do not like waiting because being patient is boring, and five minutes feels like twenty minutes. Then when you wait, you start something, and then as soon as you start, it's time. Waiting for a package is the worst. You wait and sit and wait, then you forget about it, and then it comes. One day I was waiting to go to my friend's house. It felt like forever since I've seen her, but it had only been about ten months. I missed her like crazy. We have been planning this visit for weeks, and it was finally the day to get to go over there. Now I was only waiting on my dad to drive me there, and he takes forever. Finally, we got in the truck. We were waiting five minutes, and then he gets settled and drove away. I swear we got stopped at every red light from my house to my friend's house and got stuck behind the slowest drivers, so that made it worse. When we finally got there, I jumped out of the truck, and my friend ran through the door, down the stairs, almost tripping down each one. She practically jumped on me, and we were hugging for like five minutes. That is why I'm not patient as waiting always seems to be filled with unnecessary delays and frustrations.
683	18602	7	3	My story is about a time I was patient. One day I was so excited because it was Halloween, and my friends and I were going trick or treating. I was so impatient for the clock to turn 6 pm because my best friend, Lily, was going to pick me up in her pink convertible, and we would go trick or treating. I was very impatient because it was only 3 pm, so I did my chores thinking time will fly by. Instead of putting dish soap in the dishwasher, I absent - mindedly put grapes in the dishwasher. When the dishwasher was done, I emptied it, and all the dishes smelled like grapes. So I looked at the clock, and it was only 3:30. Then I remembered that my favorite movie was on, so I ran to my room but instead ran into the wall and got knocked out. After 2 hours, I was fine. So I told my mom that I will be patient because I don't want to get knocked out again. On the bright side, I told myself I only have 2 hours and 30 minutes to go. So I went to my room and watched some TV until eleven twenty. So I had an hour to get ready to go trick or treating. But first, before I did my makeup, I went into the kitchen, put all the grape - smelling dishes in the dishwasher, and washed them the right way. Then I put my costume on; I was a bumblebee. Then I put my makeup on, and I looked so cool. Finally, the clock turned to 6. Suddenly I heard a horn; Lily was here. So I got in the car, and we went to pick Cate. I almost forgot to tell you that Lily was a ladybug, Cate was a witch. So then we went trick or treating, and that patience paid off as we had a great time that night.
684	18603	7	3	I remember, just a few days ago, my mother had to get her tooth checked out, and guess what I did? I read a book! Even though it took forever, I was done with my 30 - minute homework. When my mom came back, we got up to leave, and my feet were numb from sitting for so long. So far, my patience was rewarded as we got ice cream. You see, when you are patient, good things can come your way. Sometimes waiting is not easy, but in the end, it can lead to a sweet treat, just like that ice cream. So you could get rewarded if you're just patient, and it makes the waiting a little more bearable.
685	18604	7	3	I must admit there are times when I'm not very patient. But I can still remember the day I learned what patience was. I was 7 years old and I was going to my annual checkup at the doctors office. It was around 9 am on a Monday morning. I was with my mother in the waiting room, when an elderly man came in. He seemed extremely sick, his face pale and drawn, and I remember being really scared. The woman at the front desk came up to us and said it would be a wait. She explained that the man was very ill and could be dying. My mother told me to be patient, but I didn't know what that meant, so she explained it to me. She said, “You have to wait quietly and not complain no matter how long it takes.” I told her I could do it, and sure enough, I could. I sat there quietly, watching as the doctors rushed to attend to the sick man. Patience is a very important thing to me. I feel it is not only for yourself but for the consideration of others. When you complain about having to wait, it is disrespectful to others. And I know other people are patient for me, so I should be for them also. This experience taught me that patience is a virtue that can make the world a better place for everyone.
686	18605	7	3	Being patient isn't that hard if you try. It was a @DATE1 @TIME1 and I was struggling with my math homework. I really needed the teacher's help, but at that moment, the teacher was assisting another student. So, I patiently waited for the teacher to finish. Five minutes passed, and they still weren't done. Realizing I might be stuck for a while, I decided to skip that particularly tricky problem. Ten minutes went by, and they were still occupied. I just sat there, waiting and waiting, trying to stay calm. Then, finally, they were done, and it turned out the wait was only two minutes. I thought, well, I guess I'll give it another try, and if I still don't get it, I'll ask her tomorrow. So, while I was trying to figure it out, the problem just wasn't making sense to me. In the end, I waited until tomorrow to ask her. The next day in class, I asked her about it, and she said that we didn't have to do that one. I laughed and told her I'd spent all yesterday trying to figure it out. That is an example of being patient.
687	18606	7	3	One day, I spent a night over my best friend's house for @NUM1 days and ended up going to school with her. Keep in mind that all of my clothes and shoes were still at her place. I wasn't really able to retrieve my clothes right away because right after school, I went out to eat. I was really angry because I had left my @CAPS1 @CAPS2 shoes there. So, I called her and firmly told her to bring them to school. The next day, I was really looking forward to getting them back. I even comforted her about it, but she said she forgot. I gave her until the @DATE1, but she still didn't give them back. Notice that I was very patient with her, and this was the month of @DATE3. I finally got them back in the month of @DATE2. Finally, she gave them back. You'll never believe it, but I'm still friends with her. Even though my shoes were worn out and dirty, I had to realize that she's a good friend, and I'm a patient person. This experience shows that patience can help maintain friendships.
688	18607	7	3	A time where I was patient was when I had to go to the eye doctor. I was in a real rush because I was running late. It was @NUM1, and @CAPS1's appointment was at @TIME1. I was at least @NUM2 minutes away from the eye - doctor's place. When we finally got there, it was basically @NUM3, so unfortunately, I missed @CAPS1's appointment. I had to wait in the waiting room for a long time. @CAPS1's mother and I sat there patiently, having to wait until all the people who had made their appointments were finished. We waited at least an hour and a half. As I was being patient, I passed the time by talking on the phone and going on the internet. Lastly, I listened to music for the rest of the time until they finally called @CAPS1's name. In conclusion, this is a clear example of a time when I was patient, showing that patience can help in unexpected situations.
689	18608	7	3	"@LOCATION1, @CAPS10 says, ""Sit down. You don't need to be moving around like you're a fly on the wall."" I sit down, but I'm so anxious to get up and move again. ""There's @CAPS1 too many people here. We're never getting in,"" I complain. The line to get my driving test was the longest I'd ever seen. So, I'm thinking to myself that I should get up and move around because I'm not a very patient person. I believe I should be able to move around while I wait, but my friend thinks it's annoying and awkward. ""@LOCATION1, I wonder if they had a vending machine here,"" I say. ""I doubt @CAPS1,"" I proclaim firmly. @CAPS3 glances at me, and I quickly turn away. I get up and walk away. I come back @TIME1, and @CAPS3 is gone. I sit down and talk on the phone for a @CAPS13 @NUM1. I sit there and look at everyone, wondering who to talk to because I'm so bored. I want to get up so badly and move around, but I see @CAPS10 walking in a circle, and plus @CAPS4 has left. I sit and wait. @NUM2 @TIME1 pass, and @CAPS1 is getting close to @NUM3.m. @CAPS1 is @CAPS5 @NUM4, and I'm @NUM5, so I know I'm next. ""@CAPS5 @NUM5, your next,"" I think in my head like ""@CAPS6."" I get up and walk to the teller. ""@CAPS7 you for your patience. Now, @CAPS12, can I help you?"" I look at her and say, ""@CAPS8 I would like a driving test please."" When I get my paper to go in, I initially think to myself that I wasn't patient because @CAPS1 seemed like I was there for like a gazillion hours. But then I think again and realize that @CAPS8 @CAPS11 I was patient; it was probably @CAPS3's absence that made me impatient because I had no one to goof off with. So, @CAPS11 @CAPS10 @CAPS11. I @CAPS6 was patient for what felt like forever, but I did @CAPS13 because I was ready to leave. ""@CAPS12 was wait?"" the driver - ad teacher says. @CAPS13 I felt patient enough to be there for about @NUM7 hours. This is the time I never knew but now know I was patient enough to wait, and it helped me finally get my chance for the driving test."
690	18609	7	3	Patience is about waiting for something and not complaining about it. When you are patient, you calmly wait for something without letting your annoyance show. If you are waiting for something and you start to complain, that clearly means you don't have much patience. It isn't really good to lack patience because impatience can lead to stress and missed opportunities. Some people do not have patience at all, and if they don't, it can cause problems in their daily lives. If you do have patience, that is a great quality, but even some people with good patience can still sometimes complain when faced with a long wait. And that is what patience is. Having patience allows us to handle difficult situations more gracefully and can lead to better outcomes in the long run.
691	18610	7	3	A time I had to be patient was at the doctor's office. The tick - tock of the clock was so annoying as its hands went around and around. It was incredibly boring. I started to say the ABC's forwards and backwards. Every time a doctor came out, they did not call me. I just sat there with absolutely nothing to do. I tried to fall asleep, but that didn't work. I then tried to watch TV, but the only thing on was some uninteresting @CAPS1 @CAPS2. Finally, after two long hours, they called me in. This experience taught me the importance of patience in waiting situations.
692	18611	7	3	Oh, a time when me and my mom had to be patient is when we had to sit and wait for my mom to get her tags because it was her birthday that day. So it all started that morning. We woke up, ate a simple breakfast of cereal and toast, took our showers, put on our clean clothes, did our hair neatly, and brushed our teeth. By the time we finished all that, it was about @NUM1. Then, after we did all of that, we left. We drove and drove, passing through small towns and long stretches of road. When we finally got to @CAPS1, it was our @NUM2, and we were both very hungry. So we stopped at Burger King and grabbed some quick meals. That was the day I had to be patient, and it made me realize how patience is needed during long - distance errands.
693	18612	7	3	Before, when I had to go to the doctor, I had to wait forty long minutes in the waiting room. So I just took out my @CAPS1 and started playing. I was playing Mario Kart, trying to race against the computer opponents. But after a while, I got bored. There were only so many races I could play. So I just leaned back in my chair and fell asleep. My mom gently woke me up because it was finally time for my appointment. So we went in, the doctor checked me over, and then we went home. Then we had to wait another twenty minutes for my dad to get home from work. During this time, I learned that patience is key in waiting for various things in life.
694	18613	7	3	Last month, I had to go get a root canal. I was very nervous as I knew it was a dental procedure that could be painful. I arrived at the dentist office, half - scared to death by the thought of the pain. There were two people in front of me, so I had to sit and wait in the waiting area. This waiting made me even more scared as my mind kept imagining the pain. Finally, the time had come for me to go with the dentist. I took a deep breath and was patient the whole time during the procedure. After it was done, I was fine; it didn't even hurt as much as I thought it would. When I got home, I was exhausted and fell asleep. However, I woke up in pain later. My tooth felt like it was on fire. I never complained though. When my mom was trying to hurry and get my medicine, I didn't yell at her to hurry or cry. This was the time that I was patient, and I'm proud of how I handled the situation.
695	18614	7	3	This story is how I have been patient waiting for my birthday in three days. I have been patient by constantly thinking about what I might get for my birthday, even though it bugs me really bad! The anticipation is killing me. Also, I've been patient because I'm having a sleepover with all my close friends. It seems like the days are passing so slowly. At my sleepover, there is going to be delicious cake and ice cream! I keep saying “@CAPS1!” in my head. I've also been patient because I'm turning twelve, which I think means I should be more mature and patient. Then the day after my sleepover, my mom, me, and my brother are going to the mall and then to the movies, and I get a hundred dollars to spend at the mall! It is very hard being patient to do all these fun things. Finally, I've been patient by not asking everyone if they are coming to my sleepover. Some girls forget to ask their parents, and it bugs me because there is only two days left. This story showed how I have been patient waiting for my birthday in three days! But you have to be patient to do fun things, and I have learned this just recently. I'm looking forward to making these birthday days memorable.
696	18615	7	3	When I was little, we went to @ORGANIZATION1. I was finally big enough to go on the newest @CAPS1 @CAPS2! When we walked up to the line, we noticed the large crowd there. The line seemed to stretch on forever, looking as if it were five miles long! My mom asked me if I wanted to keep waiting in the huge line or come back next time when there were fewer people. This was what I had been eagerly waiting for! I wasn't going to miss this opportunity. I told her I wanted to keep going, and so we continued walking forward. It felt like an eternity, taking what seemed like two days to reach the top. My mom and I showed great patience! So we waited, and waited, and waited. Finally, we were at the top. Then we came down. It had truly been worth the wait! We were so patient throughout. I will always cherish the memory of all the fun I had that day and the great sense of accomplishment. I never realized I could be so patient, and that my mom and I could wait for such a long time.
697	18616	7	3	Buzz, buzz! @CAPS8 I hear “@CAPS1 your phone is @CAPS2.” So I got up and checked it. There were @NUM1 missed calls. I looked to see who they were from, and @NUM2 of them were all from @CAPS6 dad. I immediately felt that something was wrong. I called him back, and I heard “@CAPS1 get ready, grandm @CAPS4 I'm coming to get you.” I said, “It's @NUM3 @CAPS5. Are you nuts?” At this time, I was at a family member's house. @CAPS8 @CAPS6 dad said, “@PERSON2 was in a bad car crash.” My heart dropped, and I started crying. He said, “Get your stuff together, and I will call you back with more info.” I hung up the phone. @CAPS6 aunt was awake and came into the room. I told her what I knew. I was gathering my things, trying not to wake anyone else up. While waiting for the call, a flood of thoughts went through my mind. I wondered what had happened to him, if he would be okay, and if he was going to die. @CAPS8 I heard beep beep. I said good - bye and ran out. Running made me think of even more things, like how badly he was hurt, what he was driving, and what he was doing out. I got in the car and bombarded @CAPS6 grandma with questions, asking her where mom was, where @LOCATION1 was, where @CAPS7 was, and if they were okay. I also wondered when I would see him. All I knew was that I had to be patient. @CAPS8 When I got the call, I asked @CAPS6 dad, “What happened? What did he hit? Who called @NUM4? Where do we go?” The first thing that came out of @CAPS6 dad's mouth was, “Calm down. I can't come home, but @PERSON1 will be there. I want you to stay with him, okay?” “Yes, dad, I will,” I said, and then I added, “Dad, I love you.” “I love you too,” he replied. The worst part of my life at that moment was waiting for @PERSON1. @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 were like my dad's stand - ins when my dad wasn't home. I knew I would be fine with @PERSON1. I wondered how he would act seeing his best friend in that state. @PERSON2 and @PERSON1 are firefighters. I couldn't help but wonder if they knew who had helped @PERSON2. I knew he was always there for me. Waiting was hard, but I had to be patient. I remember closing my eyes and wishing it was all a dream. Now I heard the beep and got ready. I got to go in, and @PERSON1 was right behind me. As I walked in, I saw all the glass on him. @CAPS8 Dayna said, “Look who is here.” He opened his eyes wide when he saw me. @CAPS8 @PERSON2 said, “@PERSON1 come here.” @PERSON1 went over. @PERSON2 said, “Thank you for taking care of my little sister. I love you, man.” That was the time in my life when I had to be extremely patient to see my brother. I didn't care how he looked as long as he was okay.
698	18617	7	3	There is this type of patience I often rely on, and I call it hunting patience. On @DATE1, my dad and I were hunting in @LOCATION1, @CAPS1. We settled into our stands overlooking a @NUM1 - yard bean field. Not even @NUM2 hours later, two does walked in from our left. They were gradually approaching @CAPS2. I was about to draw my bow when I glanced around and saw my dad waiting for @CAPS2 to take a shot. But then, in the forest corner of our field, I spotted a big six - point buck standing completely still. I decided to be patient and see if the buck would come closer. I noticed a deer move into my blind spot where I couldn't see it. I worried that it might leave, just like that buck last year that disappeared from my blind spot. I waited for @NUM3 minutes. Just when I thought he had left, I saw him again, coming straight towards us. It was at @NUM4 yards, then @NUM5 yards, and then @NUM6 yards, and it stopped. I looked at my dad and nodded to signal him to shoot. He understood, drew back his bow, and let the arrow fly. The arrow sailed smoothly into the deer, and at that moment, I knew that thanks to our patience, we would have some delicious meat for dinner tonight. We would also have a party to celebrate the good days of hunting.
699	18618	7	3	It was a bright, sunny day, and I was engrossed in playing with my play - doe. Finally, after an hour of careful fixing and building, I finished making my tower. I stared at it in sheer amazement. I was extremely proud of myself. I took out a piece of play - doe and shaped it into the “@CAPS1”. I placed it on the top of the tower. Well, my five minutes of pure amazement were almost over. @CAPS2! I looked up and was shocked to see that my tower was in ruins. I looked in front of me and saw my neighbor. I angrily asked him why he did that. He nonchalantly replied that it was fun. I told him, “It's fun for you, but not for me. It took me an hour to finish it.” Fortunately, I was patient. He looked down guiltily and said, “@CAPS3 sorry for what I did.” I told him it was all right and suggested, “How about if we build it again, but this time make it even better?” He agreed, and we both immediately set to work. This shows how important patience is. If I hadn't been patient, the problem could have escalated. And that's the end of this story.
700	18619	7	3	Once in @NUM1 grade, my teacher @PERSON1 said, “Asked us to get an A.M.P out.” @CAPS1 We all did as she said and quietly started to work. All of a sudden, I was on my last problem, and I thought, “Man, I'm already at the end.” @CAPS1 When I started to work on it, I was completely @CAPS1 confused. This problem seemed like it was from seventh - grade work. @CAPS1 I raised my hand and waited. @PERSON1 noticed my hand and told me to continue with my math. But I told her, “I can't go on. I'm on my last problem.” @CAPS2 @PERSON1 then went on to help all the other students, and I just kept waiting. Finally, after she had assisted eight other people, she came to help me. She patiently showed me how to do the problem, and I was able to figure it out. That was a time when I patiently waited for the help I needed.
701	18620	7	3	Well, one sunny day I was casually flipping through channels on the TV when I saw a really awesome commercial on the amazing xbox @NUM1. The commercial clearly said it would be out in @NUM2 weeks. “@NUM2 weeks,” I thought to myself, “well, that’s going to take forever.” So I just sat there and waited and waited and waited. Out of boredom, I glanced at the clock. It said @NUM4. “I said,” @CAPS1 “only been @NUM5 minutes.” So I decided to start playing a game and gradually I forgot about the xbox @NUM1. Suddenly, my dad came in and said that we were going shopping to get my x - box. I was like, “wow, did the time fly by.” I guess if you don’t think about it and just be patient, it will be over in no time. This experience taught me that patience can make waiting more bearable.
702	18621	7	3	One sunny day, my sister had a volleyball tournament. It was a big - deal tournament that lasts all day. I just arrived at the venue at the worst time and was waiting warily for... well, for something to happen. I knew I couldn't complain because if I did, I would get in trouble. So I just had to be patient. I've become very patient now because she has a lot of these tournaments. When the tournaments are finally over, my mom usually rewards me for being good the whole time. As you can see, being patient is hard, but it's a very important trait to have as it helps maintain harmony in the family and makes the waiting period more manageable.
703	18622	7	3	This is my story about patience. I go to the doctors every @NUM1 months with my brothers and my sister. The whole process takes about @NUM2 to @NUM3 hours. When the doctor starts asking my brothers questions, as soon as he says something, I'm already coming up with my answer. Then it's my turn, but before my turn, @NUM4 people see the doctor. During that time, I was really patient. I sat there quietly, waiting for my chance. Then it took the doctor @NUM5 minutes for my turn to be done and over with. After that, he has to talk to my mom, which also takes some time. When we go to the doctor or dentist, we have to be really patient because it takes time for the doctor or dentist to do what they need to do. Patience in these situations ensures that we get proper medical attention.
704	18624	7	3	Once on @DATE1 break, my family and I went on an exciting trip to @LOCATION1. While we were at @LOCATION1, we went to a huge and very popular water park. My two sisters and I really wanted to go there, so we convinced my parents to take us. A few days later, we finally made it to the water park. We rented a locker, quickly changed our clothing, and then started eagerly looking for waterslides. Right as we walked into the park, there was a huge, sunken ship that looked really cool. On the very top of the ship, there were zip - lines! We all got really excited and ran to the ship. But then we realized that there was a line. It wasn't a short line; it was a giant line. We must have been standing there for @NUM1 minutes waiting. We chatted, watched other people having fun on the zip - line, and tried to pass the time. Eventually, it came my turn. I grabbed the handle tightly and kicked off the ground. I was flying through the air and had almost reached the end when it slowed to a stop. I let go and fell into a pool with a splash. The wait was totally worth it as the experience was amazing, and it taught me that patience can lead to great rewards.
705	18626	7	3	“Patience is a virtue.” You might often hear that phrase if you dislike waiting on things for a long period of time. Here’s a question for my audience: what is patience? Do you know? Well, in this essay, I'm going to discuss patience and how it affects our lives. In this fast - paced day and age, it’s very hard to come across someone with a decent amount of patience. Due to all the “@CAPS1” services and goods such as pizza delivery in @NUM1 minute, wash & dry acts, people have begun to lose patience. They expect everything to be instant. What our generation has yet to realize is that we need that patience to get good jobs and earn nice amounts of money. In a work environment, patience is required to handle complex tasks and difficult clients. Another reason people need patience is for their family. If you lack patience, you won't be able to deal with your young and immature family members. For example, I have no patience whatsoever, so I can't deal with anyone younger than @NUM1 years old. That will affect me in a very negative way, like causing conflicts within the family. Those are the pros and cons of having patience. Thank you for reading my essay, and I hope it makes you think about the importance of patience in your own life.
706	18627	7	3	One time when I was patient is when I was a little kid and my mom said we were going on a trip to visit my cousins in @CAPS1 @CAPS2. As a little kid, I was brimming with excitement at the thought of taking my very first plane ride. The anticipation built up as we made our way to the airport and boarded the plane. When we finally got to @LOCATION1, I was practically jumping with joy. As soon as we arrived, I eagerly asked my mom if I could go swimming when we got to the hotel. She gently told me to just be patient. So, when we reached the hotel, I tried my best to be patient. I sat in the room for a while, but then I just couldn't wait anymore. So, I quickly put on my trunks and went swimming with my cousin. And that was a time when I was patient for something, even though it was a bit of a struggle at the end.
707	18628	7	3	I am going to be writing about a time when I was patient. Me and my family went to Cedar Point. There was this amazing ride called the @CAPS1, which was known as the best and highest roller coaster at Cedar Point. So, we got in line, and it was incredibly long. We knew we had to wait @NUM1 to get on the ride because the line was snaking all the way back. I was feeling really hungry and thirsty, so I had my uncle, who wasn't getting on the ride, go get me some pop, elephant ears, and some chips. While I was patiently waiting, my other family members were not being very patient at all. I was the only one who managed to stay calm. As @NUM2 passed, we were still stuck in the line, and my family started fussing and complaining. After @NUM3 hours, they were getting even madder. Then, when @NUM4 hours had come, we were finally starting to be able to see the roller coaster and people getting on and off. So, finally, we got on the ride, and we really enjoyed it. Then, I had to explain to my family how patient I was and how impatient they had been. It just goes to show that patience can really pay off.
708	18629	7	3	One day there was a man who was not patient at all. He firmly thought that everything he wanted would come to him right away. His name was @PERSON1. @PERSON1 was used to getting what he desired without much waiting. However, he soon realized that not everything came right when he wanted it. One day, he saw a house for sale. It was a really beautiful and well - maintained house that he immediately fell in love with. But the people living in the house weren't done moving everything out of the house. At first, @PERSON1 got really mad because he wanted to move in right away. But then, he took a step back and discovered that patience is key. He understood that when it was the right time to move in, he would. So, from that point on, he made a conscious effort to be patient in all aspects of his life and was always patient for the rest of his life, learning that good things come to those who wait.
709	18630	7	3	This is a time I was patient. It was a @DATE1 @TIME1 on my birthday. We had @NUM1 boys at my house, and we all were eager to play Xbox. (@ORGANIZATION1.core @NUM2). But we only had @NUM3 controllers. As we all knew the rule, I let my guests know about it. They all started playing, and they played for @NUM4 minutes! I had to wait for what felt like ages to get my turn to play my own game. Throughout @MONTH1, I sat there waiting. I was so lucky that I managed to be patient. I really hated sitting there doing nothing; it got me so mad. Plus, after a while, they didn't seem to want to stop playing. So, I asked my friends @CAPS1 and @PERSON1 if they would play with me. They said yes. But after waiting @NUM5 minutes, then nobody wanted to play anymore. It made me feel really bad because it was my birthday, and I thought they could play a little longer. But I felt good that I stayed patient and didn't lose my temper. This is a time I stayed patient, and I learned that patience can help keep friendships intact.
710	18631	7	3	The clock is ticking down, and everyone is waiting, tense and ready, as if about to burst into a frenzy. A never - before - seen @CAPS1 situation has arisen. The @NUM1 explosive device is planted at the white @ORGANIZATION1. Patience is absolutely key because with this @CAPS1, anybody that attempts to defuse this @CAPS1 except during the last minute of the count - down to certain destruction will detonate this explosive. The alpha @NUM2 @CAPS1 squad is waiting, their eyes fixed on the clock, waiting for the right time. @NUM3 minutes left, the tension in the air is palpable. @NUM4 minutes left, everyone is holding their breath. @NUM5 minutes left, the anxiety is mounting. @NUM6 minute. “@CAPS2, @CAPS2!” yelled @PERSON1, the leader of the saved. “This is our only chance to save the white @ORGANIZATION1.” Time is running out, and @NUM7 seconds of pressure are riding on our shoulders. The fate of the white @ORGANIZATION1 is in our hands. The enemies are calling in infantry. Just as all hope is lost, “I got it!” I exclaimed. All that was left was to take action and let the army do the work. We rushed to the van with our shields out, pushing through the enemy defenses. Suddenly, we heard a strong noise and noticed a charge on the bottom of the van. We ran for our lives as our night - equipped van exploded to pieces right behind us. We lay low, patiently waiting for the patrol to walk by. We just needed to cross the field to the army helicopter and we'd be home free. We sprinted across the field, our hearts pounding, and victory is ours. A sense of accomplishment and greatness rushes through me, and I realize that patience was the key to our success.
711	18632	7	3	It was @CAPS1 @CAPS2. I was up late, sitting on the couch watching TV. I kept waiting and waiting for @CAPS1. I was being really patient and not pouting at all because I really wanted @LOCATION1 to come to my house. They were playing @CAPS1 tv shows on the screen, and it was making me extremely excited. It felt like my heart was about to burst, but I still kept being patient. Then my mom came in and said it was time to go to bed. I went to my room because I wanted @LOCATION1 to come to my house. But the only problem was that I couldn't fall asleep. So I quietly got out of bed and went to the kitchen to get a glass of water. After that, I tiptoed back to the living room and turned on the TV quietly. By accident, I fell asleep on the couch. Next thing I knew, it was @CAPS1. The time had gone by so fast that it felt like it was @CAPS1 in @NUM1 minutes. Because I was patient, it all worked out in the end.
712	18633	7	3	I have been patient many times, and here are a few of those instances. First, I was patient for my friend. We had planned to walk to school together. He told me he'd be ready in one minute, but in reality, it took him more like twenty minutes. I stood there, waiting patiently, looking around the neighborhood. We ended up rushing to school and barely made it to first hour. Another way I was patient was when my mom and I went to go get my new shoes from @ORGANIZATION1. When we were at the store, the man behind the counter went to the back to get the shoes. He walked back there and took about a half - an hour. I waited quietly, looking at the other shoes on display. But it was definitely worth it when I finally got to try on my new shoes. These are only a few ways I was patient, and I'm glad I could show patience in these situations.
713	18634	7	3	Patience is like waiting for something and not getting angry or shouting out. Imagine if no one had patience; everything would be a complete mess. Picture this: you're at the store, and there's a long line at the register. Without patience, people would be pushing and fighting to get to the front of the line. But knowing that most people have patience, that kind of chaos would not happen. Since the people have patience, the world has a sense of order. People wait their turn calmly, and things run smoothly. So if you think about it, patience is truly a good thing that keeps our daily lives in an organized state.
714	18635	7	3	A time when I was patient was on the city bus so that me and my mom could go to Walmart. We went to the bus stop and waited for @NUM1 hours. It was a bit cold outside, and we kept looking down the street for the bus. Before we got on the bus, we had to pay a @MONEY1 each at the fare box. Then we asked the bus driver for a transfer very nicely. After that, we hopped on the bus and sat down. We had to transfer to another bus, so we got off at the right stop and waited again for the next bus. Once we got on the second bus, we finally reached Walmart. We went inside and did our shopping. Then we waited at the bus stop near Walmart till the bus came back. After another @NUM1 hours of waiting, the bus finally arrived. We got on the bus and rode back. Then we got off the bus at the corner and walked slowly back to the house, tired but satisfied with our shopping trip.
715	18636	7	3	Just before @DATE2 break, in the fourth grade, there was a @CAPS1 party at my neighborís house. My parents and I were invited, and since we didnít have any other plans, we decided to go to the party. When we walked into the house, the party was spectacular! There were stockings neatly hung over the fireplace, with little tags on them. Green and red streamers were everywhere, fluttering in the gentle air. In the living room, there was a huge @CAPS1 tree, its branches full of shiny ornaments. Under the @CAPS1 tree, there was a large pile of presents - each one carefully placed for the children. My neighbor saw me staring longingly at the presents, so he walked over, bent down, picked up a present, and handed it to me. The present was a rectangular shape, wrapped in blue gift wrap that was beautifully decorated with snowflakes. On the front was my name written in bold marker. I was about to open my present when my neighbor gently told me to wait. He said that if I opened it now, I would only get one gift. If I waited until @CAPS1 morning to open it, I would get two gifts. I didnít understand it at first, but he said I soon would. @CAPS1 was a week away! How in the world was I supposed to wait until then? Of course I wanted two gifts, so I told my neighbor I would wait. Deep down inside though, I had this strong urge to tear the present right open. The days dragged on. I kept looking at the calendar, counting the days. Why was the week going by so slowly? As @CAPS1 drew near, I grew more and more impatient. I almost opened my present three days before @CAPS1, but I held myself back. Finally, on the twenty - fifth of @DATE1, I was able to open my present. Instead of quickly unwrapping it like I originally planned to, I slowly and carefully tore the paper away… and found a lovely velvet diary with golden boarders. Inside was a note: Not only have you earned yourself a new diary, you now have the gift of patience. Now I understood that the real gift was the patience I had learned to develop.
716	18637	7	3	"This is the time when I was patient. One cold @DATE1 day I was engrossed in playing my @CAPS1 @NUM1 game. I told my mum I wanted a new game, because my current games were kinda old and starting to lose their charm. My mum said ""@CAPS3 sweetie just be patient"". I was patient for a whole month. My brother asked my mom for a new game and he got it the very next day. My sister wanted a curling machine and she got that too. So I just kept waiting and I remained patient. My dad came back from @LOCATION1, and I asked him. I said, ""dad can you get me a new @CAPS1 @NUM1 game?"" ""@CAPS3 honey but I can't get it now. You just have to be patient."" ""ugh okay!"" I hollered. To the next day, my dad had already gotten what my brother and sister wanted, and I was the only one for whom my dad and mom hadn't gotten my game yet. So I still waited, and waited until my dad finally took me to the video store. I was so happy even though my sister and brother had gotten what they wanted. I still got my game. Waiting is not that hard; it just takes patience. That's how patience helps you accomplish what you want."
717	18638	7	3	To me patience means that you are ready to wait a long time to do something. I was somewhat patient when I was delayed at an airport and then the flight was canceled. It was not very fun because I didn't eat all afternoon and my stomach was growling. But I was happy because I had my ds to keep me occupied. The story was we went to @LOCATION1 on the @NUM1 for a much - awaited vacation to Disney Land. It was snowing heavily when we reached the airport. We had to hurry through the long check - in line and the strict security. When we got to the boarding gate we looked for where we had to board. I saw that our flight was delayed, which meant we had to stay here in the noisy airport. At least I saw that we were going to new @LOCATION2 first then to @LOCATION1 but I stayed patient. Well, that's the day I stayed very, very patient, and I learned that patience can make difficult situations more bearable.
718	18639	7	3	"I was patient for @DATE1 @CAPS1 @DATE1 presents. It was almost @DATE1 @CAPS1 @DATE1 and I kept eagerly asking for @DATE1 presents, but @DATE1 mom kept saying no. It was getting closer and closer to the special day and I kept pestering, until @DATE1 mom said be patient you will get them don't worry. But of course I had a hard time being patient as I was extremely excited. Finally, it was the @DATE1 and I couldn't wait but I had to. Before @DATE1 I went to bed I asked once more and again she said no. The next @DATE1 came and I went to school. I was so happy because today was @DATE1 @DATE1 and I was going to get presents. When I got home, @DATE1 mom was waiting with a delicious - looking cake and a present. She said ""there are more "". That was the time I tried being patient, and I realized that patience rewards you in the end."
719	18640	7	3	"@CAPS2 was a dark, sorrowful night. We went to go pick up some subway for my family. Boom, a strike of lightning flashed and @CAPS1 everything went dark. The manager came out and calmly said, ""everybody be calm"". She and the staff used navy blue flashlights. We couldn't get to our car because @CAPS2 was raining and thundering so violently that we were scared we were going to get shocked. So we waited. My tummy growled. ""I'm hungry"". So me and my grandmother asked if we could still get our subs made because we had some light. The manager said ""okay"". She told the worker to get back to work. @NUM1 minutes later the manager started passing out subs, chips, soda, and cookies. It was @NUM2 pm. We all ate and drank. I felt so sleepy and fell asleep. We all woke up the next morning with the sun shining brightly. So we all walked out to our cars, smelling like bread and meat. That was the best patient day of my life, as it taught me that patience can turn a bad situation into a memorable one."
720	18641	7	3	I ride a beautiful paint horse named @CAPS1. She has one striking blue eye and one warm brown eye. One side of her is completely white and the other side has lovely brown patches that make her look unique. @CAPS1 is a plump horse, and she absolutely loves treats! When I am putting tack on her, she gets excited because she knows that she will get treats, but she has to wait until I put her bridle on and until she takes her bit, then she can have her treat. Since I am a new rider I make mistakes quite frequently. Sometimes I pull on the reins too hard or sit in an awkward position. So @CAPS1 has to be patient with me when I ride her. When I make mistakes or I upset @CAPS1 she is patient most of the time, only giving a little nudge now and then. I try my best and so does @CAPS1, but I'm nowhere near being the perfect rider so @CAPS1 has to put up with me. After @CAPS1 and I are done riding I untack and brush her gently. After I'm done my instructor tells me to get @CAPS1 a treat. @CAPS1 watches me walk down the long row of stalls, and patiently waits with her ears perked up until I come back with her treat. Once she's done with her treat I let her out into the paddock to play with her friends. @CAPS1 then runs to her friends after taking a long drink of water, and doesn't have to be patient anymore for a while. This shows that patience is a two - way street, and our patience with each other makes our rides enjoyable.
721	18642	7	3	A time I had to be patient was when we went to @LOCATION2. It was a @NUM1 hour flight with a two-hour layover in @LOCATION1. The airport in @LOCATION1 was bustling with people, and the long wait was really hard for me because I was extremely excited and really wanted to go to @LOCATION2. During the layover, to pass the time, I listened to my iPod, enjoying my favorite tunes, and used my MacBook Pro to get on Facebook. It really helped me be patient because it took my mind off @LOCATION2. Before I knew it, we were in @LOCATION2. When we arrived, my patience paid off because I got to swim on the beautiful beaches and party in @LOCATION2 for @DATE1 break @DATE2. That is my story about a time I was patient, and it taught me the value of patience in reaching my desired destination.
722	18643	7	3	There were @NUM1 girls, and their mom was gay. She took them to a motel for the middle child's birthday. At first, it was all good. Then, the mom's girlfriend, Cathy, and my mom @CAPS1 went out to go get presents for @CAPS2. So, it was just the quietest @CAPS3 middle @CAPS2 baby meme situation. Well, they left and left @CAPS4 and the girls at the motel. They came back @NUM2 hours later. As @CAPS1 was walking back to get us, I noticed she wasn't in the van. So, I started crying when she told us that Cathy got taken to jail and we had no money, no way to get around, and we didn't know anyone. So, we had to go to this gas station. Me and my sister were sitting on the curb, shivering in the cold, and my mom went across the street to use the pay phone. We had to wait patiently in the cold winter. Finally, @NUM3 really nice ladies saw us sitting on the cold curb and helped us out. That shows how I moved to Bangor from Southhaven, and it was a tough but memorable experience.
723	18644	7	3	A time when I was patient was when I was waiting in the hospital. One time, my grandma went to the hospital for passing out and not breathing. When we got to the hospital, we were told we couldn't go and see her for a long time. My mom, brother, cousins, and uncle were just sitting there in the waiting area, waiting very patiently. The next day came, and we still couldn't see her, which was both sad and scary for all of us. My uncle took us to get something to eat while my mom stayed at the hospital. When we came back to the hospital, my mom was very upset because we still couldn't see her at all. Finally, the doctor came out and said we could see her. When we got into the room, she was sitting up, smiling weakly. My mom told her that it took forever for us to see her. My granny said the doctor told her it wasn't a really big deal. We stayed at the hospital for like @NUM1 more hours and then we left, but my mom stayed to keep an eye on her. In conclusion, I've told you when I was patient at the hospital. Even though we were really anxious and wanted to run in to see her, we didn't and we stayed very calm. This experience taught me the importance of patience in difficult situations.
724	18645	7	3	Being patient is a good thing. Sometimes I'm impatient, and sometimes I'm not, but it's definitely better to be patient. My cousin is very patient. So, when I tell her to wait and be patient, she will wait as long as needed without any complaint. My other cousins often tell me to be patient. I'll just be waiting for a while, and then I'll ask them to hurry. They always tell me to learn to be patient. My patient cousin was trying to teach me how to be patient, and we practiced together. Through these efforts, now I can stay patient for a longer time. This improvement in my patience has made my interactions with others more pleasant and has helped me handle various situations better.
725	18646	7	3	"I was in class waiting. I knew that the time I was looking forward to would come soon. The time was almost here, but I was still waiting for the first class to end, which was math. Personally, I didn't like math all that much, so unfortunately, I had to wait through it. Only @NUM1 more minutes and I was home free. The time finally came, and I was really happy. @PERSON1 said, ""@CAPS1 put your folder away, @CAPS2!"" I put it away faster than I can say supercalifragilisticexpialidocious. Then, in his voice, he said, ""You can go to lunch."" I hurried and was determined to be the first one there. I almost thought I wasn't patient enough during that long math class, but I was. I rushed there as fast as I could, thinking I was home free. When I realized there was a figure in front of me, I said, ""no."" I was defeated by a girl! I was devastated. That is my story, and I'm sticking to it, and it reminds me that sometimes, even when you're patient and eager, things don't always go as planned."
726	18647	7	3	When most people think of patience, they often immediately think of waiting. But that’s only half of it. True patience is waiting without complaining, just like when I went to the @ORGANIZATION1. It was about a five - hour drive. I know that doesn't seem like a huge amount of time, but I really dread the @CAPS1 corridor. I just can't stand them, pure and simple. During the long drive, the car was quiet, and there was nothing much to do but look out of the window. But me and my brother didn't complain, mainly because the night before, our mom said that if two of us complained, we'd have to sit with her in the hotel room the whole time. Isn't that scary? So, after what felt like ages, we finally got there. The week we spent there was really fun. We ate delicious food, played exciting games, and went to an awesome museum. But on the ride back, it was another trial of patience, even more so because we got in an accident. Despite the set - back, we managed to stay calm and wait for things to get sorted out. In the end, this experience taught me that patience truly means enduring difficult situations without losing our cool.
727	18648	7	3	In @DATE1, my dad had a business trip in @CAPS1 Disneyland. We excitedly got to the park and rode some thrilling rides. My dad then had to leave for a meeting, so he bid us goodbye and went. After a while, I saw something really cool, space @CAPS2. I was so eager to try it that I immediately got in line. As I stood there, I saw a sign that said @NUM1 hours until lift - off! My mom was completely shocked by the long wait, so we decided to leave. I was extremely disappointed at that moment. We came back the next day, and the wait was still @NUM2 hours. Undeterred, we got in line and just kept waiting. After @NUM3 minutes, I started to get really bored. I asked my mom if we could leave, but the line was so big that it was impossible to get out. After hours that seemed like an eternity, we finally got to the front. But then, my sister said she wanted to leave! My mom got out of line with my sister, but I decided to stay. I waited all by myself for @NUM4 minutes, and finally, I got on the coaster! It was an incredibly fun ride, and I even got a fast - pass for @NUM5 other rides! In the end, my patience paid off, showing me that waiting can lead to great rewards.
728	18649	7	3	It was late @DATE1 when my @CAPS1 event was and I was going to @CAPS2 point for my @CAPS1. We took an incredibly long time to drive there. I was sitting all alone in the back seat, with no one to talk to except my phone. The silence in the car was a bit suffocating. So, after what felt like forever, we finally got there, having wasted all my patience just being in the car. After we got in, we went on the @CAPS4 @NUM1 @CAPS5. We had to wait to ride a @NUM1 - minute ride. It was worth it in the end, but still, @NUM1 hours is a huge amount of time. So, I was just standing there waiting. Then we got off the ride and went on the @CAPS6 @NUM4 @CAPS5 line for the @NUM5 second ride. All the rides there were at least 1 - @NUM1 hours long. Except for one ride, the @CAPS7. We got there before the crowd came in. So, the wait was only @NUM7 minutes. And by the time we got on the ride and reached the top of the hill, there was probably a short line. So, we really lucked out on that one. But by the time the park closed and we got to our car, there was a huge traffic jam. That was the last test of my patience. We were in line to leave the park for another hour and a half. We just waited and waited, and finally, the line started to move. Once we got through the park and out of it, the road we had to take was closed because of a car accident. So, we had to take this huge detour that added an hour to our time because of the traffic. By the time we got to our hotel, I didn't have one drop of patience left. I felt like I was going to blow up, but I didn't. I acted very patient throughout the whole day, and it was a good thing I have a lot of patience. This experience made me realize how important it is to stay calm in difficult situations.
729	18650	7	3	A time when I was patient was when I went to @CAPS1 point with @CAPS6 family and @CAPS6 friend @LOCATION1. We had a great time riding some rides. Then @CAPS6 sister said, “Can we ride the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 again?” I replied, “Sure,” even though it was our fifth time riding the ride. @CAPS6 sister and I then went and stood in line for the ride. I said, “We should ride in the front row.” @CAPS4 agreed and said, “We should.” So, we made our way to the front row, and the line was really packed. We patiently waited for about twenty minutes or so when suddenly, someone threw up on another cart. It was a really unpleasant sight. The employees had to clean up the barf, which took another twenty minutes. We just kept waiting and waiting until they finally let us on. After the ride, I exclaimed, “Who would barf on a ride like @CAPS7?” @CAPS6 dad replied, “I don't know.” That day is a day that I remember for @CAPS6 patience because I waited forty to sixty minutes for a ride that wasn't really worth the wait. However, what was truly worth the wait was seeing the big smile on @CAPS6 sister’s face and hearing her happy laughter. It made all the waiting worthwhile, showing me that patience can bring joy to others.
730	18651	7	3	I know a lot of patient people, and I have had many experiences that have to do with patience. My friend, @PERSON1, is usually impatient. Whenever she is waiting for something, she texts me saying, “@CAPS1!” or, “@CAPS2 onnn!” It's quite a common occurrence. But one day, she was actually very patient. My family, @PERSON1, and I were going to the zoo one @DATE1 @TIME1. We were really excited about the trip. We brought snacks and packed everything the day before, making sure we had everything we needed. We were going to pick @PERSON1 up from her house and then head to the zoo. But my mom slept in and she still had to take a shower! She said we would pick up @PERSON1 on the way to the zoo around @NUM1 am, and it was already @NUM2 am. We were running really late, and I thought @PERSON1 was going to get mad. Fortunately, @PERSON1 wasn't mad at all! She was very understanding and said that it was okay. Usually, she would say something like, “@CAPS4, where are you? Why are you taking so long?” But this time, she didn't say any of that. We ended up going to the zoo around noon, and the whole day was filled with fun and joy! We saw all kinds of amazing animals. This experience with @PERSON1 showed me that people can surprise us with their patience, and it also made the day at the zoo even more special. I have had experiences with many patient people, and this particular experience turned out to be really fun, highlighting the importance of patience in making our outings enjoyable.
731	18652	7	3	"I think patience is all about waiting for something you eagerly want to happen or desperately don't want to happen. Sometimes, patience hits unexpectedly, uninspected. Specifically at Cedar Point, you need a great deal of patience. Beep! Beep! I whacked my alarm clock with all my might, hoping the annoying thing would finally turn off. But on @DATE1, I was going to Cedar Point, and I simply couldn't wait. So, I got up, took a refreshing shower, and ate a delicious breakfast. My mom had made scrumptious blueberry muffins. I had packed all of my clothes a week early because I was so incredibly excited. I loaded my clothes into the car, along with my brother, sister, mom, and dad, so we could get going quicker. The car ride wasn't that great because it was three long hours. However, we had a TV in our car, so it didn't seem as long as it normally would because we were occupied, making it like a shorter car ride for my brother, sister, and me. When we arrived at the hotel, it was amazing because it was like @NUM1 stories high. And we also had to use the elevator to reach our room on the @NUM2 floor. My sister was amazed by all of the stuffed animals and wanted to buy those furry things, but she couldn't. My mom woke us up, saying, ""Come on, the rides open in about @NUM3 min, and we've got to be there."" So, I sprang out of bed, racing around like I had fire on my butt, trying to find my clothes. Eventually, I found all of my clothes and rushed to get my shoes on the other side of the bed. By the time we were all up, dressed, and showered, the rides had been operating for an hour. So, we walked over to the gate and headed for the one ride called ""Millennium Force."" The sign said @NUM4 hours wait. ""Sorry, the ride has just started because of difficulties with the seatbelts and other technical difficulties. Sorry."" So, my mom said, ""Wait here. This ride is really fun."" So, we waited and waited. I had no patience left. Then she said, ""I'll buy you a hot dog after this."" So, I waited, and the ride was a blast. @NUM1 hours at the park was fun, but we had to go tomorrow. And I got my hot dog. That was my story of being patient at Cedar Point when all you want to do is have fun. Sometimes, you've got to be patient to get what you want."
732	18653	7	3	"One hot @DATE1 day, my family and I decided to visit @ORGANIZATION1. There was a brand - new ride open called ""Shoot the Rapids."" It was a tall, brown water ride featuring a long tunnel and two steep hills. As we walked over to check how long the wait was, the sign indicated a @NUM1 hour wait. We all really had our hearts set on going on it, so we decided to be patient and wait. When we joined the line, it was about @NUM2 degrees outside, and we were all sweating profusely. To make matters worse, there was this incredibly annoying little boy constantly chatting with me about some kind of food or something. It was truly irritating. We were about half - way through the line when my nerves started to kick in. I was really scared, but I knew I had to be brave and just endure it. About @NUM3 later, we were only @NUM4 people away from the ride. My heart was pounding so hard, and my knees were shaking uncontrollably. I thought I was going to faint. Then, all of a sudden, the ride broke down. We had to wait another @NUM5. As time slowly passed, we finally got on the water ride. I immediately regretted it. I screamed and cried throughout the ride, but I'm glad I didn't chicken out. That was a time when I had patience, and although I initially regretted it, it was an experience I'm still glad I had."
733	18654	7	3	"One time, I had to be really patient when my grandma told me there was something exciting in the mail for me. I was so over - the - moon excited. I waited and waited, day after day, but nothing showed up. Then, I started getting impatient. I was fidgeting around and constantly checking the mailbox. My grandma said, "" @CAPS1, keep waiting. It will come soon."" So, I followed my grandma's advice and tried to be patient. The next day, a big, bulky package finally arrived. I was so elated that it was finally here. My uncle had sent all my sisters and me some brand - new, stylish sneakers. Also, we all got @NUM1 players. I was so happy that my patience had finally paid off. It was truly worth the wait."
734	18655	7	3	"One day when I was in third grade on @DATE1, my mom was driving me to school. She said, ""When I pick you up today, I have a wonderful surprise for you at home."" @CAPS1, that whole day I had to be patient, but it was killing me. I just couldn't wait to get home and see what it was. I even briefly thought about pretending I was sick and going home, but I decided to just calm myself down and be patient. I kept telling myself that the school day would be over soon. At @NUM1, I left school, and my mom picked me up. I told her I was @CAPS1 excited to see what she had for me and also proudly told her I had been patient the whole school day! Finally, we got home, and she told me to ""go to my room."" I said, ""Okay."" When I got inside, I saw a little, cute, black puppy. I was so happy. I got a dog! I said, ""Thank you, mom. Thank you so much, dad."" I ended up naming her ""Choie."" This experience taught me that patience can lead to wonderful surprises."
735	18656	7	3	"Being patient is a very hard and difficult thing to do sometimes, but we have to go through it. Being the one who is patient usually pays off in the end. We were on our way to the airport, and me and my two younger brothers were extremely excited and couldn't wait to get to @LOCATION1. We arrived at the airport, thinking we would get right on the airplane. But when we got there, we found out we had to wait @NUM1 hours until the plane left and we'd be on our way to @LOCATION1. So, we decided to play the games we had brought with us. We were being very patient, trying to pass the time. Finally, it was time for us to get on the plane. We walked through the long, narrow tube that leads to the airplane door. We sat in our seats, buckled up, and were ready for takeoff. We heard the pilot speak into the speakers, ""I'm very sorry, but there is a severe thunderstorm appearing on the radar. We @MONTH1 not proceed until it clears up."" ""@CAPS1!?"" "" @CAPS2 long will it take?"" asked my mom. ""About five hours,"" the pilot said. It was a good thing we had brought our @CAPS3 player, so that would keep us occupied for about two hours. For the rest of the time, we played, took short naps, and just waited patiently. The flight attendant came up to us and said that since we had been very patient for the whole five hours, even my three - year - old brother, she would reward us with five @ORGANIZATION1 world pass tickets for my family. In conclusion, when you are patient, no matter @CAPS2 hard it is, you will maybe get rewarded just like my family did."
736	18657	7	3	Patient is a truly great virtue. It precisely means to be understanding and calm in various situations. Sometimes, people can endure difficulties and pain and still manage to stay calm, showing remarkable self - control. Any time when your brother or sister annoys you, you remain patient and never lash back. “Wake up already!!” shouted my brother. “I'm awake!” I hollered back. I took in a huge gulp of air and let it out with a long sigh. “I'm so bored!” my brother shouted right in my face. “Can we start walking?” I was counting past ten in my mind to keep calm and then finally spoke, “Okay”. I got my coat off the rack, followed by my little brother. We walked outside, and right when we stepped out, we saw my mom coming to give me a chore. “You'll have to cut the grass today and rake the leaves,” she said calmly. “After that, you can walk your little brother.” “Alright,” I replied, though I was completely furious on the inside. I tried to keep calm, but that didn't last long. “Hey! Come over and play!” my brother's friend said cheerfully. “Can you come over and play?” he asked my brother. My brother looked up at me, and I was closing my eyes, barely holding it together. I stammered and walked back home. I grabbed the lawn mower, and right when I was about to turn it on - “Hey, get inside and start your homework... Then, you can go out!” “One, two... There...” I counted silently. I walked with a fake grin on my face. On the other hand... “Take out the trash!” “One hundred seventy - five...” I kept counting. I ran downstairs, grabbed the trash, and walked to the trash can. As I dropped the garbage inside, I tried to put myself in a happy place. Suddenly! I sped inside to see what had happened. It turned out my sister broke my Xbox in a fit because she wanted to play. If I get past 100 in counting in my brain, I'm going to explode! I thought. I held my little sister and gave her to my mom. “She broke my Xbox!” I repeated. “Calm down, your dad will fix it,” my mom said calmly. “Go and get your brother,” she added. “Okay...” I speed - walked down to my brother's friend's house and told him I had to get my brother. “Alright...” My brother's friend shouted, “Your brother is here to get you.” “Let's go!” I urged. I managed to stay silent and patient. We walked back home, and I threw myself on my bed. “What a boring day!” I spoke to myself. “I don't think I'll ever be this patient in my life again!!” And I smacked my head on the pillow and said, “Enough is enough!” and went to bed. Wow! What a day! Patience means to be understanding and calm. Patience is great. I tried and learned a powerful lesson. Always try to be patient. My life is way better when I always try to stay patient and never hit my brother or sister even though they get me really mad sometimes. The world would be better if everyone would just stay patient. People have to try to succeed, as it's a very, very famous and true phrase.
737	18658	7	3	It's like when you're waiting in a long line at the grocery store. That's a clear example of patience. You stand there, watching the minutes tick by, and yet you remain calm. Or like when you keep on raising your hand in class, eager to answer a question. The teacher keeps on saying, “Do your work,” and you patiently follow her instruction. But if you keep raising your hand again, she might say, “If you do that again, you will go to the principal's office.” That's when a teacher loses her patience. In both these situations, we can see how patience is a valuable quality, and its absence can lead to negative consequences.
738	18659	7	3	I am writing about a time when I was patient. The time I was patient is when it was the first week of football. We went downtown to Subway before the game to grab a quick bite. I was the first one in line, looking forward to getting my favorite sub. But then, other people started to join. Only one person cut in front of me at first, but then others followed suit, and I soon became the last one in line. It felt like an eternity standing in that line! I watched as people in front of me ordered their food, chatting and laughing. Finally, I was up next. I got my sub, which was a delicious combination. It had turkey, fresh lettuce, tangy pickles, sweet banana peppers, crisp cucumbers, and great French spinach. Standing in that line taught me something valuable. Being patient really pays off. By the time I got back, it had been over 30 minutes. I sighed in relief. We were all pumped for our first game. We played against Starta and tied the game. Even though it was a tie, it was still a great day, and that patience in the Subway line was all worth it.
739	18660	7	3	One after school, I was walking home with my friends from school. As usual, knowing me, I wanted something to eat. So, I told my friends to come in at Wendy's (it's a well - known fast food restaurant). When we walked in, the place was extremely crowded. There were people everywhere, chatting and waiting for their orders. I waited in line. After about 15 minutes, my friends said, “Dude, let's go.” I replied, “I'll meet you guys outside.” “Alright,” they said. About 10 more minutes later, it was my turn to order. I ordered a double stack burger and some crispy fries. To my pleasant surprise, I got a free milkshake for my patience. The cashier asked, “What kind would you like?” I said, “Strawberry.” And it was totally free! I went outside and told my friends, “I got this for free.” Then they said, “Ooooooh.” That's when we all walked home, with me feeling happy about my patience being rewarded.
740	18661	7	3	About 2 weeks ago, I ordered a book series at Barnes & Noble online. I had to be very patient, as it felt like an entire year of waiting. This book series was not like any other. These books are my absolute favorite; they're called the Harry Potter series. I have read the series 3 times and I am still as eager as ever to read them again. But, I had to wait to get them. I was trying to be patient, but it was really hard. I kept checking the tracking number and the estimated arrival time. The mailing date said it would arrive in less than 24 hours. However, I had to wait for 3 days before it finally came. When I had almost forgotten about them, they arrived at my doorstep! Being patient is a good quality that people can have. So, if you are patient, you will probably get what you want, just like I got my beloved book series in the end.
741	18662	7	3	A time that I was patient was when I took my first @CAPS1 test this year. The test, which covered a wide range of topics, was not too hard, but not easy either. I carefully answered each question and finished it with about one and a half hours left. For that long hour and a half, I had nothing to do but just sit perfectly still and silent in the quiet test - room. Sitting still and quiet for even five minutes is hard for a @NUM1 year old, imagine @NUM2 minutes! At first, I was fidgeting in my seat, my legs restless. Then, my neck started to hurt, so I gently layed my head down on the desk. I closed my eyes and just layed there perfectly quiet and still, trying to ignore the passing time. Soon enough, the time flew by and the @CAPS2.E.A.P was over (done for the day). I was very proud of myself for being patient and calm during those @NUM2 minutes, as it showed I could control my restlessness.
742	18663	7	3	Hi my name is @PERSON1 and Iím going to tell you a story about how one time I was patient. I clearly remember when I had to be patient. It was Christmas day. There were tons and tons of presents under the beautifully - decorated tree. There were tiny ones all the way to huge ones, wrapped in colorful papers with shiny bows. But I couldnít even peek at them because my mom and dad were still not up. I was so excited that I wanted to go into my momís and dadís room and wake them up right away. But I decided, no, Iíd give them some breakfast in bed, so when I wake them up they can hurry up and eat so I can open my presents. I carefully prepared a simple breakfast and carried it to their room. After my mom and dad were done eating, I finally got to open my presents, and all that patience was worth it.
743	18664	7	3	Patient is when you are tolerant and understanding. Many people @CAPS4ít have patience, while others do. I am sort of in the middle, but hereís a time I had to be very patient. It was a bright and sunny @DATE2 @TIME1. The sun was shining like thereís no tomorrow, casting a warm glow over the neighborhood. Too bad I couldnít play outside. I was too busy kicking back on the couch, eating popcorn, and watching a big football event on TV. I thought this win could give me bragging rights, so I figured I needed some hope and patience. ì@CAPS1î ,my brother yelled all happy and right in my face. ì @CAPS2 @CAPS2 loser, lions are winning and steelers are losing ìhe added, with a big grin. ì@CAPS4ít get too happy, thereís still plenty of time left.î I replied, with a worried look on my face. I was afraid that I ëd lose, but taking deep breaths in and out, I remained very patient. The clock was winding down. It was the beginning of the @DATE1. The score was @NUM1 to @NUM2, with the lions in the lead. I was still a bit worried, but I never lost hope. As the game was coming to an end, the @DATE1 back for the Steelers made an awesome pass and @CAPS1 I screamed, dancing and jumping around in excitement. I told my brother, ìwho is the loser now, huh?î wow all it took was patience, and hopeî I told myself. Patience can mean a lot. Not only did I learn that me and my brother can get a little competitive but if you just wait and tolerate whatís happening around you, youíll end up getting rewarded!
744	18666	7	3	I guess you could say that patience is one of my strong talents. I go through many things that involve patience and I get through them without getting annoyed. Everyone knows that the worst place to be patient in is church services. During the service, you stand up, then kneel down, then stand again, then sit, and it just goes on and on. It seems to last forever. I know that there are a lot of kids that aren't as patient as me. Some of them have @CAPS2 @CAPS3 of other distractions that make them impatient while others are just naturally fidgety. I know some people who are like that; they really can't sit still. I know that most of those people struggle in school and I feel bad for them. There are times that I start to feel impatient when there are other people around who are impatient. It's the worst when I get impatient with them and I get frustrated because no matter how many times I tell them to stop tapping their pencil or stop complaining, they just donít stop. I guess what Iím saying is that everybody is different. Some people are quiet and calm, but some people are hyperactive while others are more studious. It's no different with patience. Each person has their own level of it.
745	18667	7	3	There was a fish named @CAPS1. @CAPS6 live around the @CAPS2 archipelago, a dangerous place for fish that couldn't slow down quickly, filled with sharp rocks and strong currents. Luckily, @CAPS1 was the legendary slow - moving cod that all it does is float slowly. Yesterday, @CAPS1 caught two small fish and gave them to his wife as a loving gesture. Today, all of a sudden, all the fish were in the desert, a place that @CAPS1 absolutely despises. Using his patience, @CAPS6 waits quietly for something to jump out. Suddenly, @CAPS6 sees a big chunk of meat on something shiny, perhaps a piece of metal. It was too far away to grab, though. @CAPS6 slowly swam back home to his wife. The next day, @CAPS6 went to the current and saw the floating meat again. @CAPS6 lunged for it and started chewing when something sharp stabbed him. It was a hook! @CAPS1 started pulling fiercely, the line taut. When @CAPS6 heard a snap, he realized something had broken. When @CAPS6 tugged again, @CAPS6 fell into the current. @CAPS6 was finally free! @CAPS6 also realized the current felt pretty nice, carrying him along gently. @CAPS6 ate a couple of small fish and then took a short nap. When @CAPS6 woke up, @CAPS6 saw a big ugly fish standing on two fins. @CAPS1 couldn't breathe properly and @CAPS6 was in a bad situation. Then @CAPS6 snapped at one of the fins of the other fish in a last - ditch effort and then died, ending its eventful journey.
746	18668	7	3	In sports you always have to be patient. Like if you're not making any shots during a fast - paced game or someone is getting the best of you in a one - on - one situation. If you're patient and keep working hard, focusing on your form and strategy, sooner or later you will make these shots or get the best of that player. @PERSON1 was very patient in his basketball career. At @PERSON2 high where he went to high school, he wasn't the biggest, fastest, the strongest, or even the best in terms of raw talent, but he was patient. When he was a @CAPS1 in high school, he tried out for the varsity, but didn't make it. He was so upset with himself and the coaches because he felt like he had trained hard and should've made the team. His mom went to him and told him not to give up. Unlike most kids, @PERSON1 didn't quit or tell himself that he wasn't good enough. He stayed patient and kept working hard on his dribbling, shooting, and defense. All that work paid off because the next year he made the team. He went on to go @LOCATION1. He won a championship there with a game - winning shot, a moment of glory that made all his patience worthwhile. He went on to get drafted by the @CAPS2 in the @ORGANIZATION1 draft. The @CAPS3’s were one of the worst teams in the @ORGANIZATION1. It took a couple of years for @PERSON1 to win his first @ORGANIZATION1 championship. During his first couple of seasons, @PERSON1 stayed calm and focused, and went on to win five more championships. In his last one, @PERSON1 was getting older and he knew he would be tested. They made it to the finals. The @CAPS2 were getting tired though. They went down in the series @NUM1. @PERSON1 and the @CAPS2 kept pushing and kept fighting. Finally, the @CAPS2 won their sixth @ORGANIZATION1 championship. @PERSON1 was put in some tough situations, but he stayed patient and played like an all - star, proving that patience in sports can lead to great success.
747	18669	7	3	The day I was patient was at camp, and I was on an obstacle course. The person in front of me was taking a long time to go up the steep ladder section, so I had to be patient as I watched them struggle. When I got up and went through the first challenging obstacle, which was a narrow balance beam, he was waiting on the platform. I had to wait until they took him down using the safety ropes. Then I finally got to go out. When I got half - way through the obstacle course, they told me I had to be patient and wait until all the people got off that small platform. It took a couple of minutes as they carefully descended one by one. But then I finally got to continue my run on the course. That was the day I had to be patient, and it taught me that patience is necessary even in fun activities like camp obstacle courses.
748	18670	7	3	My mom is a very patient woman. She shows it by helping my brother @PERSON1 with his homework. @PERSON1 hates every thing about doing his homework. He hates doing his math, especially the complicated word problems, reading those long and boring passages, but most of all he hates spelling, with its tricky rules and exceptions. When my mom is helping him with all three of those things, she shows patience because since he hates all of those homework assignments, he doesn't always do them without a fit. When he does throw a fit, yelling and slamming his books, she is very patient with him. She calmly sits him down, explains the concepts again, and works on it with him until he is done. That is how my mom shows patience, and it's an important lesson for me to see how to handle difficult situations with calmness and perseverance.
749	18671	7	3	Waiting to be the best. Music is pretty much my life. I love the way a song can make you feel, whether it's a soaring ballad that makes you feel emotional or an upbeat pop song that makes you want to dance. I love how walking a line on the @ORGANIZATION1, like a musical stage, can change your day. As a young musician, all I can ever think about is music. I had reached my @NUM1 instrument @CAPS1, @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS2, @ORGANIZATION1. The only instrument my family owns that I can't play is the bass. So when my @ORGANIZATION2 broke, I took Mr. Groth up on his need for a @CAPS3 in @CAPS4 band. I studied my butt off, spending hours each day learning the art of the bass @ORGANIZATION1, carefully reading the clef and learning the notes one by one. I was waiting for my ranking to increase and for my memorization skills to improve. I quickly fell in love with the instrument. I soon became better, and it seemed each week I got better and better, mastering new riffs and techniques. I had easily fell in love with the deep, rich sounds it made, and I had found I loved it way more than the @ORGANIZATION2. Sure, it will take time to become a pro, but I learned it's worth it, as the journey of learning this new instrument is as rewarding as the destination of being a great bass player.
750	18672	7	3	When I first saw my puppy, @CAPS3 were at @ORGANIZATION2. The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 brought over some dogs to be rescued. @CAPS3 saw all six dogs. The second one I saw, I knew he was going to be mine. He had these big, innocent eyes that just drew me in. So @CAPS3 got him out. The lady said that he's scared and he gets carsick, but I didn't care. He was my favorite. @CAPS3 said @CAPS3 wanted him, so she told us to go to the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and tell them @CAPS3 wanted @CAPS4. So @CAPS3 raced to the @CAPS1 @CAPS2, and on the way there @CAPS3 thought of names. My dad came up with the name @CAPS6. @CAPS3 liked it, so that was his name. I had to wait a whole week before I could take him home, but as long as I got my puppy, I was fine. @CAPS3 got him a toy when @CAPS3 went back to see him. I had it with me every night, knowing I was closer and closer to getting him. The day finally came. @CAPS3 told my brother @CAPS3 were going fishing since he didn't know @CAPS3 were getting a dog. But once @CAPS3 there, I ran inside to go see him. @CAPS3 took him home. He was afraid of everything, even the rustling leaves outside. But now, @CAPS7, he loves chasing leaves and playing in the snow. And every night I tell @CAPS6 it's bed time, and I sleep with my wonderful @ORGANIZATION1. Because if you want something bad enough, patience is the key, and it led me to this wonderful furry friend.
751	18674	7	3	My dad has a girlfriend named @PERSON1. She has two kids, one that is seven years old, and one that is four years old. The oldest one is @PERSON2, and @CAPS1 loves to skateboard with a lot of enthusiasm. The youngest one is @LOCATION1. @CAPS1 is kind of a spaz, and if you jumped out of an airplane, @CAPS1 would too without a second thought. This one day @PERSON2 and I were going to go skateboarding at a local park. @PERSON3 wanted to come, but @CAPS1 didn't even know how to ride a skateboard. @PERSON2 went over to the park, and when we got there, @CAPS1 realized @CAPS1 didn't have his skateboard. I had to let him use my skateboard. I didn't have a problem with him using it; it's just that I didn't get to use it during that time, but it was okay as he was excited to try.
752	18675	7	3	"I believe that patience means that you are understanding and tolerant, and a patient person experiences difficulties without complaining. This story is about the time I was patient with my little brother. As the alarm went off, I mumbled ""Five more minutes"" after about fifteen more steps from the alarm clock. I jumped out of bed remembering that I was babysitting my little brother. I looked at the unappetizing breakfast on my plate and thought to myself, as I tried to swallow the rock - hard breakfast. I quickly took a shower and got dressed into jeans and a t - shirt. At the time @PERSON1 was about two years old. He could walk, but it was hard for anyone to be patient with him because of all the messes that he has created. But he was so cute that it was extremely hard to stay mad at him. When I heard the sound of a car entering our driveway, I knew we were about to meet... When @CAPS3 came in the house, I went up to where he sat, dressed him, and he looked like an adorable baby. I brought him to the kitchen and made some snacks which were much lighter than my usual breakfast. Crunch crunch went the colorful snacks under... As we played outside. After the game, we played with cars for a while. Then it was dinner time. We had some food, and before we knew it, it was night time. I sat him in the bath and then went to go get something. When I came back, the whole bathroom was wet with warm bath water. When I dried him and dressed him, @CAPS3 was not in the tub. I managed to calm him down and helped him get ready for bed. This experience really tested my patience, but I'm glad I was able to be patient with my little brother."
753	18676	7	3	"I have been a patient man in my life. An example is when I wanted to see @LOCATION1, there was a long @CAPS1 line. I was in the mall, and from where @LOCATION1 was, the line went all the way to the street. It was @NUM1, and my bedtime is @NUM2, so I had to hurry up. My sister and I ran to the back of the line where me and our parents were. They saved us a spot in line. It was already @NUM3 after @NUM4, and the line didn't even move. I was so mad, tapping my foot impatiently. Every @NUM5, the line would scoot a bit. When I was about to leave, the line just started moving up like a well - organized army. @CAPS2, that's when I started getting excited. All I wanted to ask him was to get me an airsoft gun and a pony. The reason why is because I would ride the pony and shoot people who crossed my path. That would have been the life. @CAPS2, that's all I wanted to do. And I think @LOCATION1 would give me a good airsoft gun because @DATE1 can come earlier than expected. As I was talking to my friends about what was next. We went up. I asked him what I wanted, and he said ""You'll shoot your eye out, kid."" @CAPS2, that's when I got mad because I had to be so patient. That is the last time I'm going to visit @LOCATION1 at the mall as it was just too much of a hassle."
754	18677	7	3	A time when I was patient was when I was at my football game. The defense had possession, and I was waiting to go back in. I was standing on the sidelines, eager to get back into the action. Then finally my friend @PERSON1 intercepted the ball, and the offense, including me, ran onto the field. They had me run it up the middle, and I scored. Then we passed it for the two - point conversion, and it came to me. It was high, and I tipped it, then it came right down in my hands, and I got it. But then I had to wait again because the defense was getting back in. Then it was half - time. I am the kick returner, and we got the ball. As I got the kick, I returned it all the way for a touchdown. It was really cool because my team was cheering, and I broke a lot of tackles. Then it was the @DATE1. The other team was doing some plays, and finally my teammate swatted the pass, and one of my teammates jumped on it, and we had the ball. Then our full - back got a pass and got the game - winning touchdown. That's a time when I had to be patient, waiting on the sidelines and then making the most of my opportunities when they came.
755	18678	7	3	The definition of patience is, when someone is in a car and is going on a long - distance trip, and you don't ask to stop constantly or keep asking and asking where you are going. You just sit back and enjoy the journey. An example of patience is when you are at a store, and someone is in front of you with a whopping overload of stuff in their cart, and you don't get mad at the person. You just wait your turn calmly. Also, if you are teaching something to somebody, and they keep messing it up, and you don't get mad and you keep trying to teach them, that's patience. Another example of patience is if someone has @CAPS1, and they have a hard time paying attention, and you don't get frustrated with them, then you are patient with that person. Also, if the person just walks off and doesn't pay you any mind, and you still try to teach or show them something, that's a sign of patience. Sometimes patience is important because, if you maybe want to have a job as a therapist, you need a lot of patience. Those are some definitions of patience, and it's a virtue that can make our lives and the lives of those around us much easier.
756	18680	7	3	Patience. What is patience? Patience is waiting for something calmly, without getting overly anxious or frustrated. It's waiting for the right time to propose marriage, with a well - thought - out plan and a beautiful ring, or ask her on a date, perhaps to a place she's always wanted to go. Life is going to be hard unless you're patient. You need to be patient when getting a job, waiting for the right opportunity, going through multiple interviews, and dealing with the uncertainty of the hiring process. In the end, patience allows us to make better decisions and achieve more fulfilling outcomes.
757	18681	7	3	This is a writing piece on how I had to be patient to get a fanominal bowl of ice cream. My grandparents had just picked my brother and I up from our cozy little house to go get ice cream at Cold Stone. I had never gone to Cold Stone before, but my friends raved about it, saying the ice cream was rich and delicious. So I eagerly asked my grandparents if we could go. I was amped, imagining all the different flavors I could try. When we arrived at our destination, the line was huge. It was shaped like a long, winding snake, stretching all the way to the door. The sign said “30 minutes wait.” I was disappointed. I was about to leave when I saw it. The peanut butter ice cream. It was sitting there, looking so creamy and inviting, staring me right in my face. So I talked to my grandparents and said we could stay. When we finally got to the front of the line, I ordered peanut butter ice cream. It was time to send my taste buds on vacation. It was fantastic ice cream. It was so smooth, melting in my mouth with every bite. I was thinking to myself how I was glad that I was patient to enjoy that amazing ice cream. That was the time I had to be patient to go get a fanominal ice cream bowl, and it was definitely worth the wait.
758	18682	7	3	Patient means that you are understanding and tolerant. A patient person experiences difficulties without complaining. There was a time when I was patient. Being patient is difficult to do, but I did it before. “Dude, this isn't even moving,” my brother and his friend obviously weren't being patient. “Hello, man, can you walk any slower?” “Sure, I can if you want me to,” a nice man said in a kind, friendly voice. “Are you that dumb? I wasn't for real. I'll cut you just because of your stupidity,” my friend said, trying to act all tough. My friend was only a year older than me (13) and he thinks he's all big and can do anything he wants. “Hey, little man, you can't cut me. I was waiting in line forever,” that nice man said to my friend. “Well, too bad.” While my brother's friend was making a ruckus, I was waiting patiently in line even though the line was barely moving. Inside, I wanted to rush things, but unlike some people, I have patience and can wait. After my brother's friend cut that man and didn't get punished, he decided to cut hundreds of people. All those people were mad, very, very mad at my friend, but not one did anything besides say, “Don't cut me,” and that didn't really help. Until my friend cut the 20th person. That person was a young, pretty girl with beautiful blue eyes and such pretty blond hair. Her name was Lily. “Hey, police man, this young, little boy just cut me and everyone else,” Lily said. While I was waiting there patiently, my friend got kicked out of the whole park. “Next in line, please.” “That's me... Wow. That was the best roller coaster I had ever been on. Being patient is hard, but it can be rewarding. I also learned that being patient takes a lot of understanding and tolerance. Now, you know you get the best when you're patient and the worst when you're not.
759	18683	7	3	A kid in my school, Jake, has had a crush on my best friend, Mycaela, for who knows how long. He has asked her out about fifty times, each time with a nervous smile and a bouquet of flowers. She likes him as a friend but nothing more. She has dated many guys since Jake first asked her out, going on fancy dinners and fun movie dates. Mycaela can be a little boy - obsessed. In fact, she is now dating a boy who I asked out two days ago. Sorry, off - topic. Anyway, Jake is always very patient, hoping Mycaela will come around someday. He follows her around school, helps her with her books, and is always there to listen. It's been almost two years with him “stalking” her in a friendly way, and she still hasn't come around. I just think that Jake is very patient and he is a great kid. His patience shows his true character, and even if he doesn't get the girl, he'll surely find someone who appreciates him.
760	18684	7	3	One time I was patient when my mom was on the phone with my dad for about at least three hours. We were in the car on our way to my grandma's house. I was watching my dog, a cute little beagle, on my lap for the first hour. The dog was wagging its tail and looking up at me with big, innocent eyes. The second hour I was sleeping, curled up in the back seat. The third hour I was watching a movie on my phone, but by this time I had to go to the bathroom really bad. I tried to hold it in, shifting in my seat uncomfortably. Then by the last hour and a half, I was literally tearing up I had to go so bad. By the time my mom got off the phone, we were at my aunt's house. I literally ran in and ran into the bathroom and then I was fine. This experience taught me that patience can be difficult, especially when you're in discomfort, but it can lead to relief and a better outcome.
761	18685	7	3	Im @PERSON1 and a year ago I was a foster kid. Life as a foster kid often demands a great deal of patience, and I had to have patience for a lot of things. First of all, my foster parents got divorced while they still had kids in their care. This situation was chaotic, and I had to have patience waiting till my foster mom found a suitable home to move to. It was a stressful time as we were in limbo. Secondly, I wasn’t told when I could go home to my biological family. I had to wait till all the legal and administrative processes were over. It was like being in a long - drawn - out suspense. Finally, they told me after a year and a half that I could go home to my mom within a week. I quickly packed my few belongings and waited with a mix of excitement and anxiety. I had to have patience with everyone around me, including the social workers and the new arrangements. It was hard, extremely hard, mind - crazy hard. It actually took two weeks and a day to finally get home. And on top of all that, I had to move all my stuff home and unpack. To this day, I am still unpacking, slowly making this new place truly mine. Being a foster child takes a lot of patience. I learned that through this challenging experience.
762	18686	7	3	There was a new restaurant opening in town! He had heard a lot of buzz about it and really wanted to go, so his family decided to give it a try. It had opened @NUM1 minutes ago. They naively didn’t think there was going to be a long line. They got there and at first, they didn’t see any cars in the drive - thru. They drove through the drive - through which started at the back of the restaurant. Then they saw about @NUM2 cars lined up. He was really mad as his hopes of a quick meal were dashed. They were about to leave and then there were @NUM3 cars behind them, blocking their way out, so they reluctantly stayed in line. Since it was a new restaurant, everyone was taking their time to pick their food very slowly. The staff in the kitchen were also making the food at a snail’s pace. Then people started yelling, “@CAPS1 up,” and they were also honking their horns. But he was the only one who wasn’t honking his horn. They were waiting for @NUM2 minutes and @NUM1 minutes had gone by. He was starving and his stomach was growling, but he still was being very patient. He usually is not a patient person. He was very excited to eat at the new restaurant at the beginning. When it was finally his turn, the cashier said, “@CAPS2 you for being very patient.” By the time they got their food, it had taken @NUM6 hour. And to his disappointment, the food wasn’t even good! He showed a lot of patience that day. He didn’t honk his car horn and he wasn’t yelling. He had stayed in the car for @NUM6 hour and was starving. It is indeed a great thing to have patience, even in frustrating situations like this.
763	18688	7	3	This is a story about patience. Patience is when someone gives you an older or specific job to do. Then you do the job or order with no @CAPS1 asked, even if you don't want to do it. Last week, my mom told me to clean the living room. The living room was in a real mess, with toys scattered everywhere, dirty dishes on the coffee table, and dust on every surface. Even though it was hard work and I really didn't feel like doing it, I still started the task. It was unfair in my opinion because I had other things I wanted to do, like play video games or hang out with friends. But I knew that showing patience and following my mom's order was the right thing to do. In the end, I learned that being patient and doing what's asked of us, even when it's difficult, can bring a sense of accomplishment.
764	18689	7	3	Patience is a very important virtue. It is valued in at least these @NUM1 aspects of life: success and friendship. In the realm of friendship, if you do not possess patience, no one will want to be your friend. Friends have different paces, quirks, and needs. You have to have patience with your friends when they are going through tough times, when they take longer to make decisions, or when they share their problems. I know this from personal experience. Once, a friend was going through a breakup and needed someone to listen. I patiently sat with them for hours, and our friendship grew stronger. In order to succeed in life in general, you must have patience. Whether it is waiting for the bus on a cold morning or waiting for a response from a job interview after pouring your heart into the application, patience matters. Success often doesn't come overnight; it requires waiting, persevering, and being patient through the process. So, in conclusion, I think that patience is a very, very important thing to have as it enriches our relationships and paves the way for our achievements.
765	18690	7	3	I believe patience is important for many reasons. One reason is that without patience, you wouldn't be able to wait for anything. In our daily lives, waiting is inevitable. For example, you wouldn't be able to wait in line at the grocery store, at the bank, or at the amusement park. It would lead to chaos and a lot of frustration. My second reason for patience being important is that without it, people would complain every day because you use patience every single day. Consider situations like waiting to buy a ticket for a concert or waiting to get gas at a busy station. You have to wait your turn to get what you need. If you don't have patience, you'll be constantly annoyed and make the experience unpleasant for yourself and others. Lastly, patience is important because without it, you wouldn't be able to read. Books sometimes take a while to read, especially those with complex plots or deep ideas. You wouldn't want to take the time to finish it if you lack patience. Reading is a great source of knowledge and entertainment, and patience allows us to fully enjoy it. That's exactly why I believe patience is important as it makes our daily lives more bearable and enriches our experiences.
766	18691	7	3	One time I went to a colorful and lively carnival with my dad. The air was filled with the sounds of laughter and the smell of delicious snacks. We had an absolute blast while we were there, exploring all the different stalls and attractions. I kept on winning prizes at the games they had, feeling like a champion. I thought to myself “nothing will get in my way”. Well, I was wrong. Everyone has their own level of patience. Mine is low, but this one time I was surprisingly tolerant and kept calm. As we were at the carnival, I saw this new and exciting ride. Everyone was lined up in anticipation to see what it was. When I got in line, I was all pumped up and ready to go on. Until, someone rudely got in front of me. That’s when I began to get impatient. This is not going to be good. I waited and waited as the line slowly inched forward. It seemed like an eternity, like an hour, but it was only @NUM1 minutes. People kept on going ahead of me, as if they did not see me standing there patiently. So did more people. It got to the point where I was about to say a really rude remark. As I was about to blurt out the rude things on my mind, I quickly held myself back. I remembered that I wanted my dad to be proud of me. So, as it was finally my turn to go on, I finally did something good. I was so proud of myself on how I did not say anything. When the ride was over, I quickly went to my dad. I was so proud of myself on how I was tolerant. People going ahead of me wasn’t so bad after all. It looks like I can do something positive. If they thought they were gonna get to me, they were right in a way. But, they were wrong if they thought I was gonna say something. I realized that patience can really pay off and make me a better person.
767	18693	7	3	Every day in my life, I must be patient when dealing with difficult things. I must be most patient when I am playing or watching sports. Every weekend, my brother plays in a competitive football league and it can be quite tiring. I have to sit for almost two hours for the games to be over, and my parents make me watch the game. My favorite sport is football and since I am a first baseman and an outfielder, I have to wait patiently for the ball to be hit so that I can help the team. I also have to be patient during the MEAP test because it is a long session and I must wait until everyone is completely done. As you can see, I am very patient and have to be in many situations. Patience is truly a virtue that helps me in various aspects of my life, whether it's at a game or during an important test.
768	18694	7	3	Freezing cold and all I could do was wait, and wait, and wait. The wind was biting through my clothes. What I was waiting for was the @CAPS1 @DATE1 for @CAPS2 to start. I had friends with me but they mostly talked with themselves, leaving me and my friend @PERSON1. Her dirty blond hair whipped her face violently, and @CAPS7 hunched her back against the strong wind. My yellow lab, @LOCATION1, tugged hard on his leash and @PERSON1, being the one holding the leash, stumbled sideways. “Are you sure you don’t want me to take him?” I ask for the tenth time. “@CAPS4, I got it!” @CAPS7 says happily. I was cold, bored, and hungry, but at least I didn’t have my arm being pulled off. “Are you sure?” I felt so bad, @LOCATION1 was my dog, I should be holding him. Which was @CAPS4 an easy task. “@CAPS5!” @CAPS7 says lightly, “I got it!” @LOCATION1 pulls her again and @CAPS7 falls into me. I catch her, and @CAPS7 mumbles a sorry. I was hesitant, but I still think I should take him. All day I’ve been complaining. I was joking about our luck with the weather partly, but mostly, I just wanted to start a conversation. “I think my hands are numb” I say as I jam them into my pockets. “@CAPS6, at least it’s not raining, like the weather man said,” @CAPS7 smiles, and I smile back. A voice booms out of the speaker, “@CAPS8 walkers. Let’s get moving!” I glare at @PERSON1 and ask one more time, “Do you want me to take him!” @CAPS7 pats my back and says slowly, “I got it.” In the end, I realized that @PERSON1 was being really brave and I should trust her.
769	18695	7	3	A time I was patient was when I had to baby - sit my little cousin. He was just a cute little baby, so I knew that if he started crying, or got upset, I couldn't get frustrated with him because he's a baby. There were times when he would start crying for no apparent reason and I just wanted to scream out of annoyance. However, I knew I couldn't and that I just had to be patient with him. I also knew that I couldn't get upset or angry because it might make it even worse for him. So, I had to be patient and wait for him to stop crying and for me to calm down before I could go anywhere near him. I was understanding and tolerant and I didn't lose my patience. Practicing that skill is very important in life. I am proud of myself for being able to keep my composure in crazy or chaotic situations like that, and not losing my cool or patience, with him or anyone else. It made me realize that patience can really make a difference in taking care of others.
770	18696	7	3	Ugh, what is taking the gym teacher so long? @PERSON1 whined. “It's been hours!” “It's only been @NUM1 minutes,” @PERSON2 said. “Come on, it has felt like its been a couple of hours,” @PERSON1 said. “Well, you just have to have a little patience,” @CAPS5 explained. “No way,” @PERSON1 said. “You sit here and have your so - called patience, I'll be putting my bag on the stage.” As @PERSON1 got up, everybody tried to tell him to sit down but all he did was ignore them. “Man, just sit down and have patience,” @PERSON2 said. “No, I've been waiting too long. I'm bored, I'm tired and my feet hurt!” @PERSON1 yelled as he was walking behind the stage. “You're gonna get in trouble,” @PERSON2 said, looking down. “Who was just yelling?” yelled the gym teacher with an angry face. The gym teacher looked to his right and saw @PERSON1 behind stage and said “We couldn't play basketball but @PERSON1 messed it up for everybody.” Because nobody played because @PERSON1 didn't have any patience. I hope today he'll have a little more patience hopefully, so that we can all enjoy the gym class.
771	18697	7	3	I woke up early before school started and began getting ready. I quickly grabbed all my necessary stuff and walked out of the house. When I got to school, I started hanging out with my friends, and it had been a good day so far. At around @NUM1, the @NUM2 hour class was over, and we went to lunch. I wasn't hungry, and I wanted to go with my friend @CAPS1. She wanted to eat, so I patiently waited for her. After that, we went outside. When we go outside, we like to do back walkovers, handstands, backbends, front handsprings, cartwheels, and other similar acrobatic moves. After the bell rang in @NUM3 hour, it was recess. I wasn't feeling good as I was hungry. I just wanted to go home and grab something to eat, but we still had to wait till recess was over. Then we had to ride the bus for about an hour. When I finally got home, I didn't feel well. My dad asked me what was the matter, and I told him I was hungry. It was around @NUM4, and he said we had to wait until mom got home. My mom gets home at @TIME1. I had to wait patiently for @NUM5 hours. I realized it was okay to wait because the dinner was delicious. If I had eaten something else before dinner, I probably would not have eaten any of my dinner. And that was a story with @NUM6 examples of me having to be patient.
772	18698	7	3	There haven't been many times when I was patient, but I'm going to tell you about when I was patient. One time when I was patient was when I was riding home on the bus. My bus driver @PERSON1 made me sit in the back because she said I talked too much and that I wasn't allowed to talk the whole ride home. It was really hard at first as I'm quite talkative, but then I took out my homework and started doing it. Doing homework gave me something to focus on. That was one time I was patient, but not the only time. Another time when I was patient was when I was standing in line for a roller - coaster at Cedar Point. The sign at the beginning of the line said that it was a @NUM1 hour wait. We didn't care because it was my friend's and my favorite ride. It wasn't so bad because it's all worth it when you finally ride the ride. Those were times I was patient, but I've had to wait patiently even longer than that! Patience is indeed a virtue that I've learned to appreciate through these experiences.
773	18700	7	3	Hi, my name is @LOCATION1 @DATE1, and this is the time I was patient when waiting to go to a friend's house. Savannah's dad is a firefighter, and he had to put out a fire, so he could not pick me up until the next afternoon. I was really sad because I had been looking forward to this visit. It was the middle of @DATE2, and I haven't seen Savannah in @NUM1 months. I tried to keep myself busy throughout the day, but I still kept thinking about going to her place. That day I learned that patience is a way of life people have to live with, and this is the time I had to live with it. Even though it was tough waiting, it made the time I finally spent with Savannah even more special.
774	18701	7	3	There I was at @CAPS1 @CAPS2 on a @DATE1, standing in the blazing sun. The heat was almost unbearable, and I could feel the sweat drip off my face. I looked ahead and estimated that there was at least two hours left for standing in line for the roller coaster, the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5. The @CAPS7 were silent because they were getting irritable. All of a sudden, this guy screamed, “@CAPS6 up!” People in line started screaming at each other except for me. I didn't want to yell because it would get @CAPS7 worked up even more. An hour later, everybody chilled out. Then I looked ahead. We were almost to the front. I wiped the sweat off my face and smiled. Then I said, “@CAPS8 hoo!” @CAPS7 looked at me like I was from a different planet. “What?” my mom asked. “We're almost to the front!” I replied. Then we were next to go on the ride. When we entered the ride, I quickly fastened my seatbelt. Next, the ride took off! The breeze felt so good against my face. When the ride ended, I said, “I knew patience would pay off.” That is the time I had to have patience, and it truly was a rewarding experience.
775	18702	7	3	It was blistering hot, and it had already been an hour in line. “When can we go?” I asked in a moaning voice. My parents replied, “Just be patient; we're almost at the front.” So, that's what I did. My body was aching from walking around all day, but that wasn't going to stop me from enjoying all these rides. Ten more minutes had passed, and I began to get extremely thirsty. My @CAPS3 and sister wanted to go get a drink with me while my mum held our stuff in line. We made it to the booth. “I'll take water,” I said, feeling relieved. I said thank you as I grabbed the ice - cold water from his hands. As we all started walking back towards the line, I spotted a bright colorful shirt that said, “@CAPS2.” I couldn't help but ask, “@CAPS3, can I please get this shirt?” “We still have to wait a little bit longer in the line if we go back,” he responded, “but let's hurry up so your mom doesn't get impatient.” After I got the shirt, we walked back in the line. Thank goodness we were the second ones up. “All aboard the mummy ride,” the person controlling the ride explained. We walked on. Being patient paid off because I had a feeling this ride was going to be a blast, and it surely was an amazing experience.
776	18703	7	3	ëí@CAPS1íí My name is @CAPS2, and this is a story about the time I was patient. Once when I was eight years old, my mom said that she would take me to the fair that day. So, after a delicious lunch, we went to the fair. I was extremely excited as I wanted to ride the biggest ride there. However, we had to wait in line for it. The line was very long, snaking around the fairground like a giant serpent. So, I had to be patient to get on the ride. I did not want to wait in line, and for half of the time in line, I was complaining. But then I realized the line was not that long compared to some others I'd seen, and I knew I had to be patient. I am glad I was patient because the ride was loads of fun. That day, I learned that it was good to be patient. I told my mom I will never be impatient again. That was the story of the time I had to be patient at the fair.
777	18704	7	3	Being patient is a good thing to have. Let me tell you a time I was patient. Once, I had a dentist's appointment. I arrived at the dental clinic at @NUM1 am, and my appointment was at @NUM2 am. Me and my dad sat in the quiet waiting room and waited until @NUM2. My tooth was really hurting, throbbing with each passing minute. I didn't have anything to do. I couldn't read the magazines as they were old and uninteresting, and they didn't have a TV or anything to distract me. I was really hungry because I didn't have any breakfast due to the toothache. By @NUM4 am, I was still in the waiting room. I thought I couldn't do it anymore. It was so boring until I remembered I had a @CAPS2 @CAPS3.S in my pocket. So, I took it out and started to play it. Time went past fast as I got engrossed in the game. That's the time I was patient, and I learned that finding a distraction can help in being patient.
778	18705	7	3	Patience is the thing I'm mainly going to tell you about, a time when I was patient and how I did stuff to make myself patient. One day, my dad and I went to the hospital to get a hip replacement. We had to sit and wait in the waiting room for @CAPS2 @NUM1 hour. I was wondering why we had to wait @CAPS2 all the time and when our turn would come. Well, the staff kept telling us to wait @NUM1 more hour. Anyway, I was in pain; my mouth and chest hurt. After two hours, I touched my chest and felt a strange sensation. I was sure I'd rather be riding a @CAPS1. Then, after that, when we had counted the circling tiles on the floor for @CAPS2 @NUM3 minutes, I noted that I remembered there were over @NUM4 tiles. I didn't complain yet, at least. After I counted the circling tiles, I played a game with my dad. I won, and we ate up @NUM5 minutes. For the rest of the time, I played my @CAPS3. I played @ORGANIZATION1 and the game. It occupied me for a while, and then I managed to be patient. After @NUM6 more hours, it was time to go home. My dad and I were tired beyond help. I didn't complain once, and that is the time I was patient, and I learned that finding ways to pass the time can help in being patient.
779	18706	7	3	Patience is truly the hardest thing, and nobody really understands that fully. It's hard for me because I'm on punishment for not doing what I was supposed to do. So, I have to be patient and wait it out until the punishment is over. I know that being patient is important, like waiting for the perfect moment for a team to act. From my past experiences, I've learned the value of patience. So, while I'm on punishment, I'm just waiting it out, knowing that my time will come. I can't speed up the process; if I could, I would. But for now, I have to wait. I've been on punishment for quite a while, but I can just be patient. I know it's hard at first, but most people have to do it because rushing is most likely not the way to achieve what you want. Patience also helps in making better decisions and can save you time in the long run. Patience is also a good thing to have because you can wait for certain things like money, nice clothes, stylish shoes, a comfortable home, delicious food, cute animals (pets), a good job, a proper education, a reliable car (transportation), and things of that sort. Because if you rush everything, you might not get it the way you were supposed to, but waiting and being patient can get you exactly what you want and exactly how you want it to be. So, I'll keep being patient and wait for my time to shine.
780	18707	7	3	As I sit in the waiting room at @ORGANIZATION1ís @CAPS1 @CAPS2, waiting and waiting for my grandpa to come to the recovery room, my mind is filled with worry. I think to myself, what if something went wrong during the surgery or what if he doesn't make it through. Then I say to my @CAPS3, “Can we see grandpa now?” She said, “@CAPS4, just be patient. Everything will be just fine if you sit back, relax, and for heaven's sakes, be patient!” “Okay,” I say to my @CAPS3. After an hour passed, I was getting restless. So, I thought to myself and repeated, “Calm and patient, calm and patient.” Then this kind - looking lady came out to the waiting room and said, “The surgery was a little longer than we expected, but everything went perfectly fine. However, he will be staying in the hospital for a week and a half at the most.” Which was perfectly fine with me as long as he was okay. I was eager to get out of this boring hospital. As soon as I said that, my mom said as soon as grandpa gets to the recovery room, we will go see him, and then we will leave. Finally, after what seemed like an eternity, grandpa was in the recovery room. We went to see him, and seeing his peaceful face made all the waiting worth it. I learned that patience in difficult times can lead to relief and happiness.
781	18708	7	3	A time when I had patience was when I was waiting in the car to get to @LOCATION2. From my house to @LOCATION1 and then to @LOCATION2, it's about @NUM1 hours away. So I had to sit in a cramped car for @NUM1 long hours. The only things to do were listen to your iPod and sleep. However, I didn't do either of those things. As you can tell, it would take a great deal of patience to wait in a motionless car for @NUM1 hours. After an hour had passed, it would have felt like @NUM4 hours if you weren't doing anything. By that time, I was so bored that I was ready to mess with my sister who was sleeping soundly. I knew I couldn't do that though. Now was the time to think of something to do. I pulled out my phone and started texting people, but no one answered my messages. I tried looking out the window at the passing scenery, but that made me sleepy. Getting there took an eternity. Finally, @NUM1 hours passed and we made it to @LOCATION2. This was a time when I had to exercise patience and it taught me the value of waiting.
782	18709	7	3	"I was off, I was off to the car show, the Rama car show to be exact. @CAPS3 @CAPS1 got to see a whole bunch of cool old cars, and @CAPS1 also got to see some really vintage ones. Some cars were old and rusty, showing years of wear and tear, and some were new and state - of - the - art, shining brightly under the lights. @CAPS4 @CAPS1 saw a sign. It read come see chip foose! So @CAPS1 went and looked around with excitement. ""@CAPS1 found him!"" I exclaimed. ""@CAPS2"" @CAPS8 brother yelled. ""@CAPS3 is!"" @CAPS4 @CAPS1 went and looked at the end of the long line. It was @CAPS5! So @CAPS1 figured the crowd would die down after a half an hour. @CAPS1 were very wrong. It was still @CAPS5! The line @CAPS1 thought was big was nothing compared to the line now, so @CAPS1 had to wait, and wait, and wait patiently. @CAPS8 brother got to the point where he was so restless that he could run a mile if he didn't, he was going to explode with energy. So I had to go walk around with him. I was relieved because standing and doing nothing for @NUM1 hours gets boring real fast. I was getting to the point where I had to get up and walk around or I was going to fall asleep. So I went for a walk with him. @CAPS1 got back and I sat back down and @CAPS1 waited, and waited, and waited and waited. @CAPS4 @CAPS1 heard ""stop!"" ""The body behind these people have to go and come back after the break."" said @CAPS7, the security guard. @CAPS1 were the last people. The people in front of us was a nerdy couple who seemed to have no life outside of this show. @CAPS8 brother started to cry because he didn't get Foose's autograph. The kind nerdy couple said, ""here, have our spot. @CAPS1 have all day and you @CAPS2 like you really wanted this autograph."" @CAPS8 brother replied, ""sniff, @CAPS9 won't it!!"" @CAPS1 got it after 51/@NUM1 hours of waiting and waiting and waiting and feeling like we were dying of boredom. That was the time I had to be patient and it was a test of my perseverance."
783	18710	7	3	Patients are people who have been injured in some kind of way and are in the hospital trying or are getting better. I was a patient once because I was sick for a very long time. I had a high fever and was feeling extremely weak. So my mom took me to the hospital and I got a shot. The shot was a bit painful, but I endured it. On our way out of the hospital, I was still feeling dizzy. I blacked out and hit my chin on the door with a loud thud. So we had to stay there for about an hour. The doctor checked me again to make sure I was okay. That was the only time that I was in the hospital being a patient, and it made me realize how vulnerable one can feel in a hospital setting.
784	18711	7	3	I was patient when I was at home yesterday watching the movie called @CAPS1. The movie had an engaging plot and great special effects. So I waited for a long time until the food was ready. I was so interested in the movie that I couldn't get my eyes off the TV because the movie was so good. I was so engrossed that I almost forgot about my hunger. But then, when I was really hungry, I finally got to eat. After that, I had a second plate. However, after that second plate, I was too full to eat the rest of my food. And I didn't complain that I was still a bit hungry. Instead, I just focused on enjoying the rest of the movie. This experience showed me that I could be patient even when my basic need of hunger was involved.
785	18712	7	3	"Being patient is when someone could be busy and it's just better to be patient while the other person is done. I am going to write about a time when someone I know was being patient. Well, on one morning, my mom had just got out of work. When she came home, I told my mum that I really wanted to go over to my friend's house. But my mom just kept on saying to wait. So I had to wait, and I did my best to be calm. My mom wasn't even done with her post - work tasks still. So I told her if I could go walking to my friend's house. But she said no and that I had to be patient till she was done. My dad was leaving for his work in the afternoon, so I had an idea. I told my dad if he could drop me off at my friend's house and then he could leave for his work. So I went to tell him. But guess what, he said no because he was already late. I looked at the time and yeah, he was already late. So I decided to just be patient because my mom was almost done and my dad was already leaving. So I just sat down and watched TV while waiting for my mom to finish. My mum had gone inside the room and so I got up and asked if she was done and she said ""yes"". I so excitedly yelled, ""so you are taking me?"" And she did. I was so happy that I rushed to the car. And so we went, and I went to my friend's house and my mom had left. That was the day I got to go to my friend's house just by being patient, and it taught me that patience often pays off."
786	18713	7	3	I think patience is the ability to calmly be quiet and wait at the same time. For instance, patience is required for everyday tasks like waiting in a long line for lunch, patiently waiting for someone to pick you up, and quietly waiting for your doctor to examine you. I need to use patience almost @NUM1 times a day. First, I need to be patient as my mom drives me to school, sitting quietly in the car. I also have to be patient for the class assignment to be passed out, for the long - drawn - out class to be over, for the lunch break to start, and for the night to come etc. I often hear people say that patience is a virtue. I didn't even know what that means, but if I'm patient, I'll probably find out. So my conclusion is, patience is required in daily life, and people use it every single day. I think patience is a wonderful gift and I truly enjoy having it.
787	18714	7	3	"ON @DATE2, I finally understood what my mom was saying to @CAPS1. She told @CAPS1 that she couldn't get @CAPS1 anything for @CAPS2 because she had a pile of bills to pay. She thought that she wasn't doing a lot for @CAPS1, but I told her I was fine with what I got. I just wanted to be around her for @CAPS2, but she didn't understand that she was doing well on her own. My father was not helping her take care of us. My mom had to take care of her @NUM1 kids, herself, and @NUM2 of them were his. But my daddy would always say, ""I know if he had it, he would give to @CAPS1."" But being @CAPS1, I didn't want to hear his stuff because it was all lies. My mom had to find two jobs to keep up with everything. Then when @DATE1 came, everything was okay until @DATE1 when my grandma passed away. My mom, auntie, and uncle @PERSON1 all had to make money for all her stuff. She looked pretty at the funeral. Everything went well, but even now, we still cry and think about her. Then that was a time I didn't have patience because it was too hard to think she was gone. So my mom and the others tell @CAPS1 that I need to learn to understand she's in a better place with some of her loved ones. But to this day, I can't understand the meaning of when someone says they are gone. But @CAPS6 is not forgotten."
788	18715	7	3	The time I was patient. One day we were on our way to @ORGANIZATION1. Our trip was only supposed to be three hours long, but one of the cars that was following us had a flat tire as something slashed it. We had an hour to wait before they would get their tire fixed and catch up with us. They had to navigate through the heavy traffic and long - lasting stoplights. We waited at a gas station, and after a while, they caught up. Everyone used the restrooms, which took fifteen minutes. The restrooms were so gross that it took a bit of time to make them somewhat appropriate for use. There were three cars with five to six people in each, which took up more time. After we were all done, we piled back into each vehicle and got back on the road to @ORGANIZATION1. We were passing all the signs that said “@ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1” and “@ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 up ahead”. And even when we finally got there, I saw this huge, digital sign that played music and said “@CAPS1 to. @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1”! We were finally there! We were extremely excited and had the time of our lives!!! By: unica @CAPS2. Armstrong.
789	18716	7	3	“@PERSON1, lets go! This line is taking too long!” “@CAPS1 @PERSON2, just be patient!” “@CAPS2?” asked @PERSON2. “@CAPS3 @NUM1,” replied. “@CAPS4 @CAPS2?” “You have never heard of patience?” “@CAPS1” “@CAPS6, you're trying to tell me that out of all these thirteen years you have never heard of patience?” “@CAPS1” “@CAPS6, you're really trying to say that out of all these thirteen years you have never heard of patience?” “@CAPS9,” @PERSON2 replied in a very confused voice. “@CAPS10 @CAPS12, well, patience is when... Wow, I never knew patience would be @CAPS6 hard to explain.” “@CAPS11, now do you get why I don't know!” “I got it!” he yelled as he snapped his fingers. Some people in the line were staring at them. Their faces turned red with embarrassment. But @PERSON1 ignored that fact and said, “@CAPS12 @CAPS6, patience is like when you wait a long time, but you don't care that you've waited a long time, and in the end, because you waited patiently, you get what you wanted.” @CAPS6 @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 waited and waited in line. Soon enough, they were up next. “@CAPS14 tickets to @CAPS15 @CAPS16, where can I look, please?” @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 said excitedly. “@CAPS17, ummm, hold on one sec while I open a new package of tickets,” the ticket booth man told them. @PERSON2 glared at @PERSON1 and then said, “@CAPS12 @CAPS19 @CAPS20 @CAPS21: We've been in this line for twenty minutes and now I have to wait more?” “@CAPS23, you go kids. That's @CAPS14 dollars please.” @PERSON2 was embarrassed but yet happy he got his tickets. @PERSON1 said, “@CAPS11, you waited and got what you wanted. That's called patience.” @CAPS6 @PERSON2 and @PERSON1 sat down in the movie theater and watched a great movie. If they weren't patient, they would have never gotten to enjoy their new favorite movie.
790	18717	7	3	Patience plays a key role in life. If you are not patient, you will live an unhappy life full of stress. Almost everything in life calls for patience. If you are not patient, you will most likely mess something up, like your job if you are not patient with your boss or co - workers. I often have a hard time being patient with my mom and dad. Sometimes, I just can't stand my parents' long - winded talks anymore and I lose my temper, becoming impatient with them. And that usually makes things worse for me. I do love my brother, but he can get really annoying, just like most little brothers and sisters do. When my brother gets on my nerves, I become very impatient with him. Sometimes, I'll get so mad and impatient that I just lose it and beat on him. And I always end up being the bad guy because of my lack of patience. Now that I am older, I realize how important it is to be patient with people. It makes life a whole lot easier and more fun with the people I'm around every day. That is why when you are patient, you will get your way, but when you are impatient because you are trying to get your way, it will never happen. In conclusion, cultivating patience is essential for a happy and successful life.
791	18718	7	3	The time I was patient was when my friend was coming over. I was extremely excited as we had planned to have a great time together. But I waited and waited, constantly checking the clock. Finally, she finally arrived. That's about it, and it was all worth the wait to catch up with her.
792	18719	7	3	I was patient when I had to wait for my grandpa in the emergency room. He has a heart condition, and his health hasn't been doing very well. My grandpa is in and out of the ER frequently. Every day, he has to go see his doctor to check up on his heart. That is why I have to be patient during these difficult times. It's tough, but I know it's necessary for his well - being.
793	18720	7	3	Patience is a thing that you develop when you are calm and fully relaxed. I have been patient every single day in school. I show patience when interacting with my teachers, listening attentively to their instructions. I have also been patient with kids at school who like to pick on people and tease them. I have patience on some days, but on others, it means something is going wrong and that I don't have any more left. I truly like having patience because it makes you feel relaxed and at peace. Patience is a great thing that you can possess. I think patience increases your life span. Many people in the world don't have much patience, and I believe that decreases their life span. I don't think if I didn't have any patience, I would be in school right now because some kids just have problems, they don't have patience, and they end up getting bad grades and facing other issues.
794	18721	7	3	In this narrative essay, I will write about three different times when I had to be patient. Such as waiting to get out of school on a holiday. I was so eager to leave and start my break. And when I had to wait until my mom woke up to go to the mall so I could get my game. I was really looking forward to playing it. Another thing I had to wait for was to get my finals results. All these times I had to be understanding. One day, I was very anxious to get out of school on a Friday. And to make it worse, the clock was moving incredibly slowly, and I had a well - planned schedule for my day. When one thought passed by, another set in, thinking about how I could make the time pass faster. I was about to get a call home, but the teacher's announcement saved me. And I had to be understanding about that moment. Another time I had to be understanding was when I had to wait until my mom woke up so I could go to the mall. See, what had happened was I got good grades last year on my report, and a new game was coming out, so I wanted it. My mom was asleep, and it was almost impossible to wake her up because she went to the club the night before. And that was the time I had to be patient, and it taught me a valuable lesson.
795	18722	7	3	I'm currently writing my comic book, and I haven't begun drawing it yet. Here is a major scene in the first book. “@CAPS1, @LOCATION1, are we there yet?” @CAPS2 asked with great curiosity. “@CAPS3, not yet,” @PERSON1 replied with a distinct sound of fear in her voice. They were lost, really, truly lost. “Are we there yet?” little @CAPS2 asked again. “@CAPS3, @CAPS2, you'll just have to be patient,” @ORGANIZATION1 said, becoming annoyed very quickly. So they walked for hours, but still there was no sign of the castle. Little @CAPS2 was eager to meet the queen, for she had always imagined the queen as a kind, patient, and beautiful woman. @ORGANIZATION1 could tell that @CAPS2 was tired. Lifting her on her shoulders, she said to @CAPS2, “Look if you can spot the castle from here, @CAPS2.” After a few long, patient minutes, @CAPS2 finally saw the castle. “I see it, I see it!” she said with a big smile. Jumping off of @ORGANIZATION1's shoulder, she bolted down the narrow pathway. Because she had waited, she was as excited as ever. Not only because she had found the castle but because she learned how to be patient, which would surely serve her well in future adventures.
796	18723	7	3	A time I was patient was when I got my braces. I was extremely nervous as I had heard many stories about the discomfort and the long process, so it was really hard to be patient. I waited in the waiting area quietly for about fifteen minutes, constantly fidgeting with my fingers out of anxiety. Then the assistant called me in. First, she gently told me in detail what she was going to do, reassuring me throughout. Second, she carefully took an x - ray of my teeth, making sure the position was correct. Third, she precisely put metal bonds with a really strong glue on the back of my teeth, and I could feel the strange sensation. Fourth, @PERSON1 skillfully put the brackets on with really strong glue. Then the assistant carefully put the wire between the brackets and metal hands. Finally, she asked me what color I wanted for the elastics, and after I made my choice, she put them on and I was free to go. The whole process took two hours, and I had to sit still in a dental chair for that long. I had to muster a lot of patience; it was tough, but I managed to do it. That is the time I had patience and showed self - control.
797	18724	7	3	“So @CAPS1, what do you want for your @DATE1?” “A @NUM1.” “@CAPS1 else do you want?” “A @NUM1.” I have been longing for a play station @NUM3 for such a long time. It’s my thirteenth @DATE1, and I have never wanted something more desperately. All my friends had it. Whenever I went over to their house, we played day and night without a break. I really wanted one... I wanted one so much, dad. The only problem was that it cost @MONEY1, and I already had a @MONEY2 @DATE1 party planned. All together, it would be a @MONEY3 @DATE1 expense. So my mom and I decided on an agreement: if I pay @MONEY4, then she will pay the other half. From that day on, I eagerly asked everyone for money as a gift for my @DATE1. I didn't want any other presents; I had my eyes firmly set on the prize. Usually, you have a family party where all the relatives come over, give you your present, and celebrate. I knew that's where I would get my @MONEY4. Everything seemed perfect; I had it all carefully planned out. Have the family party a couple of days after @DATE1 and then go buy my @NUM1! I didn't mind waiting two or three days. I figured I could live with that. “Hey mom, when are we having the family party?” “@DATE2.” At that moment, there was steam practically coming out of my ears. I could feel my face burning up as if I was putting my head in a blazing fire. You @MONTH1 not realize it, but @DATE2 is a whole month away from my @DATE1. If waiting @NUM5 days isn't being patient, then I don't know what is. From this day on, I still haven't gotten my @NUM1, but two days from now, I'll be holding a stack of cash in my hands and heading to Gamertop. If I had to wait any longer, I probably wouldn't have been able to stand it. I'm not very patient, but I've tried my best in this situation.
798	18725	7	3	A time I was patient was at my friend's cousin's birthday party. I was patient because the whole entire time that we were at the party, I was anxiously waiting for an answer from my parents and my friend's parents to see if me and my friend could have a sleepover. So during that time that my friends and I waited, we colored a couple of dinosaur pictures with bright and vivid colors. Then we watched an interesting movie together, laughing and getting engrossed in the story. After that, we ate a delicious dinner with various dishes. We played in the basement, running around and having a great time. Then we went into the garage and ate cake and ice cream, savoring every bite. We decorated and painted our dance tool boxes with creativity. We colored some more pictures, trying out different styles. We also watched my friend's cousin open his presents and celebrated with him. Then it started getting dark outside, so we tried to take a little nap, but it was hard with a whole bunch of kids screaming and making noise. Soon enough, it was time for my friend to go. Then my parents said that we could have a sleepover, but unfortunately, my friend's mom said not tonight because my friend has a volleyball game in the @TIME1. It felt like I waited for nothing. But then I realized that when you're patient, you get what you want more often, even if it doesn't happen right away.
799	18726	7	3	Being patient is important, as I've learned before from experience. Once, I chose to babysit my cousins @PERSON1 and @PERSON3. @PERSON1 is eight years old, and @PERSON3 is six years old. I had to watch them for three hours all by myself. I was able to call my @CAPS1 @PERSON2 anytime I was in need of help, but if I did call, I wouldn't get paid. The deal was to be paid twenty dollars if I could handle @PERSON1 and @PERSON3. This is how I was able to do so. I arrived at my @CAPS1's house at about one thirty on the dot. @PERSON1 and @PERSON3 had just gotten back from a friend's birthday party, where they surely devoured a ton of sugary foods, like @CAPS2, delicious cake, and creamy ice cream. I could tell they were hyper as soon as I walked in the door when they greeted me with extremely bubbly attitudes, jumping up and down. My @CAPS1 left, and I was stuck with them. @PERSON1 wanted to play on his play station. But @PERSON3 wanted to play box @NUM1. I began to get irritated when they started to argue loudly over what to do. I was about to call @PERSON2 when I decided that being a little more patient was well worth getting paid. So to settle their contradiction, I spent some time looking and found a game that we could all play and enjoy together. After playing the game for two hours, we went into their back yard. @PERSON1 and @PERSON3 played tag while I watched closely. However, @PERSON3 being the unfair one denied that @PERSON1 had tagged him, and began to throw a tantrum. I was really frustrated at their behavior immediately and picked up the phone. But then I decided that, with only one hour left, I could handle them. So I told them that we could play hide - and - seek instead, and even though I would normally loathe being the seeker, I told them that only I would count so they wouldn't fight. Finally, @PERSON2 came home and I got paid the money I had earned. That day, I learned that being patient always has its rewards, and it was a valuable lesson in self - control.
800	18727	7	3	Patience essentially is being polite by waiting for someone or something. It is truly polite to be patient. If you're not patient, it means you're practically being mean because you are judging someone or making them do something really fast. For example, if you are waiting in line for a ride at a carnival or something, then if you are patient, you're being nice to other people by not trying to hurry or causing a commotion. You stand quietly, respecting the order. On the other hand, if you are impatient and standing in line, you would be mean to other people. You might say things like “Hurry up! I want to be on that ride” or “Hurry up and start the ride already.” That's a clear example of impatience. If you are a patient person, people will probably like you because you are easy to get along with and understanding. If you are impatient, then you will probably have a hard time getting along with somebody as you may come across as demanding and inconsiderate. In conclusion, cultivating patience is an important quality that can improve our relationships and social interactions.
801	18729	7	3	There are lots of times that I have been patient. One time I was taking the @CAPS1 test. We had a very long time allotted for the different parts of the test. I was always done early, so I couldn't go on to the next part. Also, we couldn't talk or get out of our seats. I really wanted to go on to the next part because I had so much time left and nothing to do. Everyone in the class also got done early. Since we couldn't talk, we just sat and waited for the testing time to be over. I think everyone wanted to go to the next part, but nobody complained or said anything. We had to do this for a few days every year. Every year I'm always patient. That's a story about when I'm patient, showing that patience can be exercised even in mundane testing situations.
802	18730	7	3	@NUM1 Patience is when you understand a situation and you don't complain. A person who is patient is someone who can wait calmly and doesn't fidget every two seconds. A person like that can succeed in life. @NUM2 @CAPS1! @PERSON2 was getting closer. First @PERSON6 then @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS4, @PERSON7. She was coming down my row next. This was an even more nerve - wracking moment. I kept thinking, when is someone going to pinch me so I wake up. @NUM3 “@PERSON5.” @PERSON3 said with a disappointed force, “@CAPS2 did a poor set on this fest. I think you should get on.” In my mind, I was praying for her not to say the dreaded word. She responded, “@CAPS3.” When I got home, my mom read the letter and agreed with it. Why did I have to fall into this history? Next week, the outcome came. We sat down. She was about to say something, so I took a deep breath. You have to be patient and no complaining. I nodded my head with a smile so big that it looked like my lips were about to fall off. @NUM4 A few weeks later. I got a little better every day. Her name was @PERSON4. She was very nice and thoughtful. She told me I was progressing by waiting and seeing the results. Finally, the hundred - point mark came. I was nervous but confident at the same time. That test is going to be a milestone for me! A week later, @PERSON1 passed @PERSON6, @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS4 and @PERSON7. A smile on her face, “Good job @PERSON5, you got an A -.” It was hard in the beginning, but I was patient and I got a good grade. @NUM5 Wait and don't nag and see the results at the end. Patience helped me because I know in the future to be tolerant. A person who is patient is a person who can accomplish a goal, as I've proven through this experience.
803	18731	7	3	A time I was patient was at the barber shop. My sister, my niece, and I were going to the barber shop at @NUM1. I was looking forward to getting my hair cut by an official barber. There were quite a few people ahead of me in the queue. I waited all the way to @NUM2 to finally get my turn for the hair cut. That was a time I was patient, and it shows that patience can be rewarded with a well - done haircut.
804	18732	7	3	A time I was patient is now @DATE1. The reason is because I am waiting for @CAPS1's new phone. See, in @DATE2, I accidentally spilled orange juice on @CAPS1's phone. Everybody would call me weird and irresponsible. At first, @CAPS1's phone was fine and everything seemed alright. Then one day, @CAPS1's speaker stopped working. I couldn't call anyone or listen to music. @CAPS1's heart sank. I quickly ran to @CAPS1's dad and told him about @CAPS1's problem. He first laughed and shook his head. Then he grabbed @CAPS1's phone to test it. After he disconnected it, it did not work, and his face showed shock. He then asked me how that happened. Now at the time, I was so stunned that I couldn't figure it out. Then the image of me spilling the orange juice came to mind. Something told me to keep this from @CAPS1's dad, but I told him anyway, and he laughed. I looked at him with a “why are you laughing, dad” expression. He said “You are going to have to wait until I get the money.” @CAPS1's face was calm, but here I am still waiting for the phone, showing that patience is needed in such unfortunate situations.
805	18733	7	3	@PERSON1 was your average fourteen - year - old. @CAPS5 had a @CAPS1, @CAPS2 and an annoying eight - year - old brother named @PERSON2. It seems @CAPS9's parents weren't that creative with names. It was the beginning of school and @CAPS9's @CAPS3 had to take @LOCATION1 clothes shopping. The problem is @CAPS5 was made to go in. @CAPS5 wouldn't complain for a month. Oh, @CAPS11, did @CAPS5 have to be in this situation! Sigh. Oh well, too late now. @PERSON1 thought here @CAPS5 was, in the boys' department helping @CAPS9's @CAPS1 pick out clothes for @ORGANIZATION1. Out of the corner of @CAPS5's eye, @CAPS5 saw something more interesting. Daring to get a better look, @CAPS5 gasped. @CAPS5 could fail to have @CAPS6 some guys for the school since @CAPS9 was picking out clothes in the boys' department! I stared. @CAPS5 needed to go to the girls' bathroom and stay there until @CAPS9 were to get @CAPS9. The whole situation was awkward. “@CAPS8 for being so understanding,” @CAPS9's @CAPS1 said. “I know that was hard for you and @CAPS8 for not complaining.” “@PERSON1 what,” @CAPS8, @CAPS10. “@CAPS11 being patient is a good thing,” @CAPS5 thought as @CAPS5 got out of the class, realizing that patience can help in uncomfortable social situations.
806	18734	7	3	When I was at a small, cozy shop browsing through the shelves, I unexpectedly found my friend from @LOCATION1. He immediately walked up to me and started to talk to me about a patient. He seemed quite enthusiastic about sharing this topic. Then he began to explain to me what that patient's condition was all about and how the illness started to be produced. After that, he told me a detailed story about that patient. I was attentively learning about the story, and it was quite an eye - opening experience.
807	18736	7	3	Every day in our daily lives, I have to be patient, and actually, every one of us has to be patient. But have you ever had to be patient for a sibling? If so, then you know exactly how I felt when my sister didn't want to go outside for her own personal reasons. The other day, I was earnestly trying to get my sister to go outside with me because we have a special willow tree that we often play around. Well, I was getting off - topic. Since she kept stubbornly refusing to get out and exercise, I had to result to telling my mother. You can imagine she wasn't too happy. My sister brought a book along. We set off, and then we got to a certain point in the middle of my neighborhood and went separate ways. Of course, I didn't like this and had to wait at a friend's house until she realized I wasn't going to follow her. So I've been annoyed with having to be patient, but they always say it's a virtue, so I guess I'm okay with that.
808	18737	7	3	Patience, I understand, is the ability to be calm and tolerant. Patient people often experience difficulty when faced with certain situations. Today, patience means something very important to us. There's a situation where Samh is in front of us today. She is doing a task that seems to be taking a long time. But she's been at it for an hour. Even though it's taking so long, we need to be patient. In the end, patience will surely pay off.
809	18738	7	3	One time when I was patient was when a highly anticipated new video game was coming out. I excitedly asked my dad @CAPS1 if we could pre - order it, but he firmly said no and that I would have to wait until @CAPS2. So I patiently waited until @CAPS2, and unfortunately, I still didn't get the game. I decided not to say anything about the game. Then it was my birthday, and when I opened my last gift, it was the video game! I was so extremely excited that I gave my parents @CAPS4 hugs and then me and my brother went to play it right away. It really showed me that patience can be rewarded.
810	18739	7	3	When you have patience, you are calmer, more peaceful, and happier. It's like when your birthday is next week. You might be so eager that you don't want to wait for it and get mad because you want your presents today, not next week. But you simply can't have them right away. So, if you get mad and start to hit things, then you won't have good behavior. Then you'll make your parents angry, and they might even take some of your gifts back to the store. That is not patience. That is impatience when you get mad just because you can't get what you want right at that moment. In contrast, having patience will bring more positive outcomes in the end.
811	18740	7	3	"The key for a long road trip is to be patient. This is important because it actually makes the trip go faster. Here is a story about how I had really great patience. We were loading up for a three - hour drive to the exciting @CAPS1 water park in @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2. Everyone is in and ready to go, except of course my parents. They went inside to check on everything, got detailed directions, called my uncle to see if @CAPS3 was ready, and all this time us kids are sitting in the hot car waiting. Of course my brother @CAPS2 was getting antsy and couldn't stop fidgeting around until @CAPS3 finally couldn't take it anymore. ""That's it!"" @CAPS3 exclaimed, ""I'm going in to get them!"" @CAPS3 was the least patient of us all. Even my two little sisters had more patience than @CAPS3. Which tells you a lot. Tyler comes out @NUM1 minutes later and tells us they're coming. WRONG! They didn't come out for another @NUM2 minutes which made my brother mad. ""@CAPS4 took you so long?"" @CAPS3 asked. ""@CAPS5 had to make sure uncle @PERSON1 was fully ready to leave."" my dad answered. As soon as @CAPS5 got going everyone fell asleep except for my dad who was driving. So no one really did much. At least @CAPS5 were all patient, except for my brother @CAPS3 who's still like that now. Patience truly is a virtue on long road trips, as this experience clearly showed."
812	18741	7	3	Being patient is one of the many things children are taught while growing up. As they mature, they use these life lessons and life guidances when they need them. I can't tell you how many times my mother firmly told me to be patient. It was a daily reminder while I was growing up. I gradually learned though, and realized how truly important being patient is. If you're being impatient, you have to understand that the people are most likely trying their hardest to finish what they are doing for your sake. I truly found the meaning of this word when I was seven years old at the mall. Although I had experienced this importance and knew I had to wait earlier in my life, it didn't mean I was content and patient. We were shopping in my favorite store at the time called trendy @CAPS1 @CAPS2. I had gotten a mountain of clothes as well as my sister @PERSON1 who was @NUM1. A dressing room had finally opened after the long wait of about @NUM2 minutes. Suddenly a dressing room opened, and @ORGANIZATION1 quickly raced in it. I was crying because I was in line before her, and it was so unfair. She cut me anyways. I was the one who waited @NUM2 minutes. After her long fashion show with my mom for about @NUM4 minutes, I was done. I really wanted to try on my clothes. I knocked on the door, and she told me she would move it along. So I waited another @NUM5 minutes and she was out. It was a reward for my patience that got me into the dressing room. I count that day as a reminder that whether it's a long or short wait, you will get what you want in the long run. So be patient, and good things will come your way like karma - what comes around, goes around. The lesson of patience learned that day still stays with me.
813	18742	7	3	I was very patient last time I went to the doctors. @CAPS1 and my brother @CAPS2 had to wait outside in the rather crowded waiting room until they called us in for our shots. Everybody else was getting to go ahead of us and we just patiently sat there. It got really boring sitting in there with nothing much to do but we stayed patient. After about two or three hours, we were not as patient as we were a couple of hours ago. The wait was starting to get on our nerves. So we decided to go up to the front desk and politely ask what was going on. We found out that we forgot to sign in and so once we quickly did that, we got in. This experience taught me that sometimes patience is needed even when things seem to be going wrong, and a simple oversight can cause a long wait.
814	18743	7	3	Being patient is about waiting your turn and being calm. You don't complain about waiting like... being patient throughout the day and waiting for school to get out. Not complaining about school being too long or faking sick just to go home or faking pinkeye... etc. You must wait for school to get out. Being Patient isn't just about waiting for something to get over; it can be about waiting in lines, waiting to use something... etc. Not all people are patient. I'm not a very patient person when it comes to getting home on time! I don't like waiting for people or @CAPS2 or food! I'm very patient when it comes to shots or anything to do with doctors. Patience varies from person to person and situation to situation, but learning to be patient in different aspects of life is an important skill.
815	18744	7	3	"It was one cold @DATE1 morning in Wisconsin on the last day of deer hunting. I got up and dressed. My dad and friend were all sitting down to have a hearty breakfast. We had delicious pancakes and cold milk. Outside it was about @NUM1 degrees, so we bundled up and headed out. It was kind of scary in the woods at night because we don't know what's out there or who's out there. But after we got in the stand, all my fears went away. After @NUM2 hours in the stand my dad tells me ""@CAPS1 time to get back and eat."" ""Not right now,"" I said. ""@CAPS1,"" said my dad. ""Then I guess I'll see you later."" So after he came back it was right around @NUM3 when out of the thick brush came the magnificent buck I was waiting for. So I brought my gun up steadily and shot. He went right down. I have never been so proud in my life. The patience I showed during that long wait was finally rewarded."
816	18745	7	3	"Patience, if you are a patient person, you are not only tolerant but also truly understanding in various situations. There was a time I was very patient. ""@CAPS1 can @CAPS3 go yet!?"" I asked impatiently. ""@CAPS2,"" she replied calmly, ""@CAPS3 need to buy all of your school supplies."" I always didn't like back - to - school shopping. That would mean going with @CAPS1 to a crowded store for @NUM1 hours, trying to find the right clothes, notebooks with the perfect designs, pencils of the right thickness, binders of the right size, and pens that wrote smoothly. ""@CAPS4 I really have to go too?"" I whined. ""@CAPS5 patient ok?"" she gently reminded. ""@CAPS6,"" I replied reluctantly. Every time I had to get clothes or pencils, I forced myself to be more patient. Whenever I had to wait for @CAPS1, I just sat there quietly, I just sat down and waited. And surprisingly, the day seemed to go by a lot faster. @CAPS7 had been @NUM1 hours but @CAPS7 only felt like twenty minutes. When @CAPS3 left, I realized that patience had made the experience bearable. I wouldn't wait till next year, I wanted to go shopping all over again!"
817	18747	7	3	When you are patient, you are calm and composed, without complaining even when things don't go as quickly as you'd like. You are understanding and tolerant of delays and difficulties. And when you are patient with something, you are steady with it and persevere through the challenges. Because if you are nervous, you lack patience. Patience gives you a lot of time to handle things properly. And you remain very calm and steady, so that's what it means to be patient. A patient person experiences difficulties but endures them gracefully. And when a patient person is waiting to get something and they do not know when it will arrive, that is the essence of patience. And when you are patient, you stay calm, and if you can maintain this calmness, you'll find that many problems can be solved more easily. In conclusion, patience is a valuable virtue that helps us navigate through life's uncertainties.
818	18748	7	3	Patience, having patience means you don't complain about things that take long amounts of time. You are tolerant, or understanding, able to see the bigger picture. Some reasons why you should @CAPS7 patience are things like waiting in long queues. You @CAPS7 @CAPS8 wait in an extremely long line at a busy supermarket, and the whole time you are waiting you say things like, “@CAPS1, this takes @CAPS5.” Or, “@CAPS1, when @CAPS3 @CAPS6 leave.” “@CAPS3ít @CAPS6 just @CAPS9?” Your @CAPS1 would be thinking, “@CAPS4 my gosh would you just stop talking?” Or she would just want @CAPS8 scream out of frustration. So your @CAPS1 probably wouldn't ever want @CAPS8 take you somewhere that involved waiting ever again because she knows that you are @CAPS8 impatient @CAPS8 handle it. Some reasons why maybe you wouldn't want @CAPS8 be patient or you would want @CAPS8 be impatient could be like if you had a meeting with your teacher and if you were late then you would @CAPS7 a bad first impression. So your @CAPS1 is taking @CAPS5 talking on the phone so you keep saying, “@CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8 @CAPS9, @CAPS1 @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8 @CAPS9!” And you wait very impatiently, fidgeting and sighing. Although, patience is basically like a kind, gentle way of waiting. Even though on the inside, you're picturing yourself screaming at someone who you're waiting on. Where on the outside, you are patiently waiting, with a calm expression. So, having patience is a good thing. Try it sometimes; just don't let your feelings on the inside tear apart what is happening on the outside. In the end, patience can save us from many awkward and unpleasant situations.
819	18749	7	3	Patience is when you are waiting on something. When you rush, that's not being patient. When you are being patient, you don't rush, you take things at a steady pace. @CAPS1's another meaning of patience is when you stay calm, that's being patient, staying away from getting angry. Some people say they are losing @CAPS1 patience, that means that @CAPS1 is about to get angry. Those are the meanings of patience. There was a time I was being patient. I waited for @CAPS2 to come. I waited, I waited, I waited. I didn't rush even though I was eager. They say @CAPS2 is @CAPS4's birthday, and I was excited to celebrate. In the bible it says be patient, and I followed that advice. It wasn't no telling when @CAPS2 was coming, but I still waited. Finally! @CAPS2 came, and the wait was worth it. This experience taught me the true value of patience.
820	18750	7	3	A time when I was patient was when @CAPS1 came. And I was getting really hungry, my stomach was growling. So I went inside and asked politely, “When is dinner @CAPS2?” And @CAPS3 replied that it would be ready in an hour. I knew I had to be patient. Instead of complaining, I decided to find something to do to pass the time. I picked up a book and started reading. Before I knew it, the hour had passed, and dinner was ready. This small act of patience made the wait much more bearable, and I learned that being patient can turn a potentially frustrating situation into a calm one.
821	18751	7	3	Being patient is a valve that can control our emotions and actions. Here is a story about being patient. Once upon a time, there was a little girl named @PERSON1. She lived with her uncle named @ORGANIZATION1 in a small cottage near the woods. One day @PERSON1 decided to go out and play. She told her uncle she would be in the woods that day and not to worry about her. @ORGANIZATION1, with a concerned look on his face, tells her to be careful and to watch out for the wicked witch. @PERSON1 skips off to the woods, humming a little tune. When @PERSON1 got to the woods, she walks straight to her favorite place, the tree fort her uncle built for her about a year ago. The tree fort was hidden among the tall trees, with a small ladder leading up to it. When she got there she climbed up to the top and opened the door. Waiting inside for her was not what she expected at all. There sat the wicked witch, with her long black hair and a menacing smile. When @PERSON1 didn’t return home that night, the uncle started to worry. He searched and searched for her but found nothing. He tried to be patient but it was hard, as he paced back and forth in the cottage. The next day @PERSON1’s uncle got arrested because the police thought that he had kidnapped @PERSON1. He had to be patient yet again, sitting in the cold jail cell. In the end the police found the witch and @PERSON1 too and @PERSON1’s uncle’s patience paid off, he was free. From that day @ORGANIZATION1 had even more respect for the power of patience. This is a time when uncle @ORGANIZATION1 is patient and learned that patience can bring good results.
822	18752	7	3	This week I have been very patient. I really wanted a Wii, that popular gaming console everyone was talking about, and no one would buy me one. So I saved up my money for so long, putting aside every bit of allowance and money from doing small chores. Then I had to wait what felt like weeks, which was actually @NUM1 days (@NUM2 week). I was counting down the days on a small calendar I made, which just made it feel longer. So I decided to tell myself I didn’t want it so I wasn’t anxious to get it. That kind of worked, as I tried to focus on other things like reading books and playing outside. But when I got it to tell you the truth it isn’t as fun as I thought it would be. It just goes to show that sometimes the anticipation can be greater than the actual thing, but at least I learned the value of patience.
823	18753	7	3	In my opinion, I am a very impatient person. Whenever I ask someone to stop doing something, they’d better stop it on the spot or else I get really annoyed. For example, if someone is making a loud noise when I’m trying to concentrate, I can’t stand it. Also, I am not one of those kids who waits for dinner patiently. I snack my way to it, grabbing a few cookies or a piece of fruit whenever I feel hungry. And when I am at school, I just can’t stand listening to the teacher’s instructions for hours on end. That reminds me, my teacher is driving me crazy! He has absolutely no patience in any way, shape or form. If we make one noise, he immediately goes on a rampage, raising his voice and scolding us. Overall I think people need more patience these days. Patience can help us get along better with others and make our lives more peaceful.
824	18754	7	3	Patience is a very good thing that I and a lot of people lack. One person that does not lack patience is the head coach of the @LOCATION1 @ORGANIZATION4, @PERSON1. @PERSON1 has been very patient for the past couple years. He did not try to make his team be better than they were overnight. He just had them try their best, encouraging them during every practice and game, and see what the end result was. The @ORGANIZATION4 ended up going @NUM1 that year and by getting the second worst record in the national @ORGANIZATION3 they got the second pick in the twenty - ten @ORGANIZATION6 draft. In that draft the @ORGANIZATION4 took @ORGANIZATION5, an outstanding defensive lineman out of the @ORGANIZATION2. He was known for his strength and quickness on the field. The @ORGANIZATION4 other pick was a fast running back named @CAPS1 @CAPS2 out of the @ORGANIZATION1. @PERSON1's team is so good this year because of @PERSON1's patience with his team and his understanding of his player's talents. His patience allowed the team to grow and develop at their own pace, leading to their current success.
825	18756	7	3	Who likes being patient? It’s so boring. Pretty much all it does is waste your time. But we all know it’s good to be patient and to have patience. I am not a really patient person but there are lots of times where I have had to be patient. When I was @NUM1 years old I lived in @LOCATION1 with a family of six not including me. The house was always full of noise and activity. I really liked video games and I have @NUM2 older brothers and @NUM2 younger sisters. We only had one video game station, which was the GameCube. Also we only had one controller. It was really hard to be patient to wait your turn because my older brothers always got to play first and they would never get off. They would sit there for hours, ignoring our pleas to let us play. But there was this one time that was harder than all the others. I got a brand new video game called @PERSON1 Bros and couldn’t wait to play it. The game had amazing graphics and exciting gameplay. But when I got home my brothers snatched it out of my hands and ran upstairs to play it. I was really sad and mad, but I didn’t complain. I just sat right behind the door of the room they were in, listening to the sounds of the game. I sat there with tears in my eyes. I felt empty but I still didn’t complain. I ended up sitting there for @NUM4 hours. Finally my brother opened the door and said I could come in. Not in a very nice way but I got to play. I remember to this day how hard it was but after, it was worth it. So sometimes when you have to wait to do something you really really want to do and you can’t do it just be patient and it will pay off. Patience can turn a frustrating situation into a rewarding one.
826	18757	7	3	"A time that I showed patience is when my sister accidentally broke my brand - new futon. It was the very day that I had just gotten it. I was comfortably settled in the living room, engrossed in a movie, when all of a sudden I heard ""@CAPS1, @CAPS1, @CAPS1, thump, crack!"" Alarmed, I quickly ran upstairs to find out what had happened. There I saw my sister on the bed, looking quite scared, and my other sister standing there as pale as a ghost. I showed patience by taking a deep breath and not yelling at them. I knew they hadn't done it on purpose. I soon got another futon that isn't broken, and now my sisters know not to mess around with things that can break! And that is my story on how I showed patience once!"
827	18758	7	3	"One day when I was walking outside, I spotted a snake lying on a big, flat rock. I was both excited and a bit scared. I immediately yelled for my big brother who was busy playing his video game in the house. He shouted back, ""Hold on! I need to beat this level!"" But the snake seemed to be getting restless. So I kept urging him, ""Come on! It might leave!"" Finally, after what felt like ten long minutes, he came out of the house and stared at what was in my hand. He asked me, ""Why do you have a snake?"" I replied, ""I saw it. It's so cool!"" He liked it too and then we carefully let it go back into the wild. This experience taught me that sometimes it's worth waiting for things to work out."
828	18759	7	3	"One night, when me, @CAPS1 and @CAPS9 sister, @PERSON1, were sound asleep. Our parents were quietly sitting at the computer. Usually, @CAPS4 don't stay up that late. So I just assumed that @CAPS2 was doing some important work - related task. In the morning, when we woke up, @CAPS9 mom and @CAPS2 were standing in the kitchen, beaming with smiles on their faces. @CAPS2 was holding something behind his back. ""I wonder what it could be…"" I thought to myself. I asked @CAPS9 mom ""What's going on?!"" @CAPS4 said nothing, but @CAPS9 @CAPS2 slowly brought up a document from behind his back and presented it to us. The bold heading on the document said ""@CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8."" @CAPS9 parents were smirking as @CAPS9 sister and I stared at each other in utter amazement. As if we were reading each other's minds, we both knew right away that we were going on a cruise! I grinned excitedly and looked at the dates on the paper. ""@DATE2 @NUM1 - @DATE2,"" it said. Today was @DATE1. I said to @CAPS9 @CAPS2 ""That's like, two months away!!!"" ""@CAPS10,"" @CAPS9 @CAPS2 said, ""you must be patient."" Just like normal kids would, I said ""@CAPS12…"" @CAPS9 @CAPS2 understood my disappointment and said ""Good things come to those who wait."" I nodded contently. I knew that I was going to have to endure the two - month wait and be patient. The first couple of weeks felt like months to us. We were extremely anxious, as you would expect. But as time passed, it got easier to be patient. I was able to focus on other things besides the cruise. On <@NUM2 @NUM1, @DATE3</@CAPS15>, the time finally came for us to head to the airport and board a plane for the cruise. ""That quick! It went by that quick! I'm so excited, @CAPS2!"" I said when we were boarding the plane. ""I'm proud of you, son. You were patient!"" That's the time of how I learned to be patient! As @CAPS9 @CAPS2 says, ""Good things will come to those who wait."
829	18760	7	3	I'm going to tell you a time when I was patient. A time I was patient was when I had my heart set on getting the new game Halo Reach. I had to pre - order it with my own hard - earned money. So I started doing a bunch of odd jobs. I cut the lawn at my house every weekend, and then I also offered to cut other people's lawns for two dollars each. I did this for about two months. At the end of those two months, I ended up with three hundred dollars. I was so excited when I pre - ordered the game. But they told me I had to wait for three weeks. It was really hard to wait, but I did just that. During the waiting period, I used some of the leftover money to buy a few other small things. Finally, the game came in the mail. That's a time I used patience to wait for something, and it was definitely worth it!
830	18761	7	3	"Once there was a girl. She was very impatient until she was taught how to be patient. One day @PERSON1 was going to get her driver's licence. She was so eager and was extremely excited to be able to drive on her own. When @PERSON1 got to the licence place, she saw that there was a long line of people waiting. She estimated that about @NUM1 people were there. ""Why did there have to be so many people here?"" she thought to herself. After about @NUM2 minutes of waiting, she got really mad because only one person got their licence in that time period. She threw a big fit right there at the licence place. ""Ughh! I was supposed to get my licence today, not wait around for a bunch of experienced adults to get their licence renewed!"" she started blabbering. ""Why do you guys take so long! You are so slow!"" Then she went home and started talking to her friend @CAPS3 on the cell phone. ""There were so many people. I am never going to get my licence @CAPS3!""   ""@PERSON1 just calm down. Stop being so impatient.""  ""But the line was so long and..."" @PERSON2 cut @PERSON1 off. ""If you keep running home crying, you will never get your license. The line for a driver licence is always that long. I had to wait @NUM2 hours to get mine."" ""@CAPS6 five hours!"" ""@CAPS7, but I took @NUM4 hours with me so I wouldn't be bored. Take your phone with you."" ""@CAPS8,"" @PERSON1 replied. The next day she went back to the licence place, and this time she took her phone and a book with her. While she waited, she texted her friend, browsed the internet, and read her book for her school book project. She kept moving forward in the line, and she didn't even realize how much time had passed. @PERSON1 waited for @NUM5 hours that day, but she only thought it was @NUM4 because she was preoccupied. @PERSON1 felt great when she finally got her licence. She was the second one in school to get her licence (after @PERSON2). ""Thank you, @PERSON2, you taught me how to be patient and calm down."" ""No problem, it's the least I could do for my best friend."
831	18762	7	3	Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant, able to see things from others' perspectives and put up with inconveniences. A patient person experiences difficulties without complaining, remaining calm and composed. One time when I was patient is when my parents did not know it was a half - day at school. One day in elementary school, we had a half - day, but the school hadn't informed the parents about it. After school, I waited in the parking lot for close to @NUM1 minutes, standing there patiently, waiting for my parents to pick me up. I was starting to think my parents weren't coming until a kind teacher noticed me and asked me what I was doing. After I explained my situation, the teacher kindly let me call my parents. My dad apologized over the phone, and then he went to get me. After that, I could finally go home. This experience taught me that patience can help us get through unexpected situations.
832	18763	7	3	I've been patient plenty of times, but when I ordered a new game console, that is when I truly had to be patient. My dad and I were excited to get a game console that was expected to be delivered to our porch in two weeks. For me, those two weeks felt like a lifetime. Every day, I would think about the console and how much fun I'd have with it. But I knew I had to keep patient. Throughout those fourteen days, I didn't let my eagerness turn into complaints, and neither did my dad. We just waited calmly. When it finally came, I opened the box with great excitement. It was definitely worth the wait. That is a time when it was necessary to have patience and to not complain, as patience led to a wonderful reward.
833	18764	7	3	A time when I was patient is when I was at the festival. I wanted to get something to eat, and the line at the food stalls was really big. People were standing in a long queue, waiting for their turn. Another time is when I wanted to get on a ride. The line was incredibly large. It was for the @CAPS1, @LOCATION1, @CAPS2 pirate ship, the swing. There were so many people waiting to experience the thrill of the swing. Also, there was a line to play this basketball game, and it was big too. I stood in those lines without getting frustrated, patiently waiting for my turn to enjoy the food, the ride, and the game. In the end, I got to have a great time at the festival, and it showed me that patience can lead to enjoyment.
834	18765	7	3	Have you ever had enough patience to deal with @NUM1 screaming kids? I can proudly say that I can. It all started when my uncle Steve and @CAPS1 @PERSON1 decided to move to @LOCATION1. They needed a lot of help, so my @CAPS1 @DATE1 decided to take all five of her kids and my sister and I down to @LOCATION1 to assist them. The only problem was there were @NUM2 kids and only @NUM3 of her to take care of us. So we packed up all of our bags and headed out. My @CAPS1 @DATE1 has an expedition car, so all @NUM2 of us could fit. But it didn't take long for everybody to get uncomfortable. The car was full, and everyone started to feel squished in and get really hot. So all of the @NUM1 kids started fighting, pushing and arguing with each other. My @CAPS1 @DATE1 got real stressed real fast. I thank god that there was at least a @CAPS5.V in that car. But I was sitting in the front, so I didn't get to watch the chaos in the back. After about @NUM1 hours, I'd had enough. My legs were getting all cramped up, and the constant motion of the car was making me dizzy. By now, we had been driving about @NUM7 hours, only having one rest stop. It was dark out now. We were the only ones on the road at the moment. I sank lower in my seat, trying to get more comfortable. Then @CAPS6. Everybody screamed, even my @CAPS1 @DATE1. At first, I thought we got into a car accident, but when I opened my eyes, I was alive. We had hit a deer. It slid across the hood of the car! Finally, after about @NUM8 hours, we reached @LOCATION2@NUM9. It was @NUM10 in the morning! I ended up surprising myself with how much patience I had during this long and difficult journey. After that, I don't think that I want to go on a road - trip again, but I'm glad I learned the power of patience.
835	18766	7	3	Patience is when you have problems and don't complain. It's about keeping a calm attitude even in difficult situations. You need patience at an amusement park to wait in all the lines. People are queuing up for the exciting rides, and instead of getting irritated, a patient person just waits their turn. Patience is also not complaining about being bored on a long car ride. When you're stuck in a car for hours, with nothing much to do, patience helps you stay calm. You need to be patient to fish. Sitting by the water, waiting for a fish to bite, can be a long and quiet process. But if you're patient, it can be rewarding. And it can save others headaches too. If you're patient, you won't spread your negative emotions to those around you. You won't always be stressed if you are patient. So you should always be patient, as it can make your life so much easier. Long lines won't seem so long, and fishing is very rewarding for those with patience. In conclusion, patience is a virtue that can bring peace and rewards in many aspects of life.
836	18767	7	3	Patient day. I vividly remember the time when I was extremely patient for a cool toy car. Four long days I hate to wait for a whole four days. Each day it truly felt like I was locked up in jail. So I was getting mad each day, and in my frustration, I was slapping people in the face. It was so funny at that moment, but then my strict dad was mad at me. Then my mom put me on punishment. Then a couple of days later, I was doing really good in school. So my mom was so proud of me. Then she bought me a lot of stuff. Later that Christmas day, we had delicious turkey and ranch dressing. Then I opened my presents. I got the toy car, a cool action figure, monster truck cars, shoes, and all of Organization1’s blue, red, and any collars you can think of. So that is why I was patient for that toy. I was so happy, and my kind - hearted uncle stopped by and gave me 20 dollars. Then he took me ice skating and told me to wear these skinny tights. But it all worked out for me at the end. I got everything I wanted, and I want to have a long - lasting touch with that 20 dollars. It felt like I was rich on Christmas day, and I learned that patience really pays off.
837	18768	7	3	"One day, there was this girl in town who really wanted to go school shopping. In town, she had to wait because her mother said in town, she didn't get her money now. In town, she'd get it later in the week. Her mom said, ""Wait until later."" The girl did not know that her new stuff was up in her room. So when her mom got back, the girl had said, ""Where are we going to go?"" Her mom said, ""Go get your jacket upstairs in your room."" The girl went upstairs to get her jacket. When she went up in her room, she saw new clothes and five pairs of new shoes. The girl had let out a scream and then came downstairs and told her mom, ""Thank you."" Her mom said, ""You're welcome."" Her mom said, ""I told you I was going to get your stuff."" And the girl said, ""You just have to wait patiently,"" realizing the value of patience."
838	18769	7	3	Patience is a calm feeling that you get when you experience a difficult task and do your very best to overcome it without constantly complaining about the task. For example, like when you're trying to get paint out of a tube and then you squeeze it, but it won't come out. You keep trying hard, applying more pressure and adjusting your grip, until you figure out that it is gone. Then you go get a new bottle to start using. I sincerely wish that more people were patient. Then we wouldn't have to listen to constant complaining, and the world would be a more pleasant place.
839	18770	7	3	A time when I had to be patient was when I had to babysit my little brothers and my two cousins. This was going to take a great deal of patience. One day I got a phone call from my aunt. She said she needed a reliable sitter for my two - year - old and seven - year - old cousins. She said she would pay me if I would take care of them. So I said sure. I didn't know what I was getting myself into. A couple of days later, my mom (at home) said it turned out pretty good for me after all. I learned that with patience, even a challenging babysitting job can go smoothly.
840	18771	7	3	Patience is probably one of the hardest things to do in the world. One time I remember when I was patient was when my family and I went to Cedar Point. When we went to Cedar Point, we all were excitedly ready to ride the magnum, which we never got to ride the last time we were there. So we were planning on riding that first. We got in line. After a little while, we had to wait for the heavy rain to stop. The wait was an hour and fifteen minutes. So I decided that I would be a little more patient and not utter a single complaint. Although, not being able to sit down after a long while gets kind of painfully uncomfortable, but I still never complained. A little while later, I actually started forgetting I was in line because the staff started letting more of us on. I guess not complaining works because my whole family was in a great mood after we got off the ride. So I decided to learn how to be a little more patient with people because of how well everything worked out until we got to the bumper cars, where I realized patience is a skill I need to keep practicing.
841	18772	7	3	Waiting at the grand @LOCATION1 double doors of the fravential, I am greeted by a man in a sharp suit. “Welcome to the fravsthat,” the man says politely. As soon as we enter, we can walk further to the spacious area in front of us. “When does the show start?” I ask excitedly. “It's @CAPS2 till about @NUM1,” my mom replies. Eight thirty was about an hour away, and we couldn't sit down due to the large crowd ahead of us. @NUM2 minutes pass by, and @CAPS2 only one person is admitted into the show. Even the elegant music playing in the background can't fully mask the crowd's uproar. Another @NUM3 minutes pass, and our seats finally await us. Walking down the well - lit walkway, I ease into seat @NUM4 as the show begins.
842	18773	7	3	Being patient is sometimes a difficult character trait to possess. Patience is a good one to have too, as it can help you in a lot of diverse situations. If you have patience, you won't get nervous or overly anxious about something. I was patient when I had to wait a week for a birthday present my friend @PERSON1 was getting me. I didn't think about the present that much, so the anticipation didn't really get to me. I knew the present was going to be really cool, which made being patient a little bit harder. However, I was still able to keep the thought of it off my mind. I had to make sure I didn't think about it, so I wouldn't beg my friend to know what it was, because that would be impatient. If you're impatient, people might get annoyed because you'll always ask questions and get on their nerves. Patience is good to have in friendships, so you don't become mean to them or anyone else. It's also not good to be impatient with your family. If you're patient, you can work things out better, stay more on task, and remain focused. In the end, patience truly is a virtue that enriches our relationships and daily lives.
843	18774	7	3	When you're at a store or the doctor's office or anywhere where you have to wait for something, you always have to have patience, or you will never be able to do anything. I remember when I was at the store with my mom. We had to wait in this long, slow - moving line just to buy a few groceries. But if we didn't have patience, we would have put our stuff back and gone back home. Since we did have patience, we got to buy our stuff. That's why, if you don't have patience, you won't be able to do anything you want to do. Patience allows us to navigate through life's little inconveniences and achieve our goals.
844	18775	7	3	Here's a story about a time when I was patient. So the story begins at Art Prize, and I loved to see the beautiful art there. But I was dying to see the winning picture for Art Prize. My parents told me to wait until we all saw the rest of the amazing art at Art Prize. So I sighed and replied, “Ok, we can see the rest of the Art Prize things first.” While we were looking at the art, the whole time I was thinking about the winning piece. That is all I thought about. A little bit later, I was thinking of what a blessing it is to be here at Art Prize. So I cheered up and decided patience is good. And if you wait for something for a while, it all of a sudden seems more valuable. A couple of hours later, I started to head to the car, and my mom interrupted and said, “Hey, don't you want to see the winning piece of art?” “Oh yes, I forgot,” I replied. Thankfully, there is not a line now, so when we went to see it, there was no line. It was the most amazing thing I have ever seen. It was a picture of sergeants drawn out of just a pencil. That day I learned that patience is important because that way it was worth the wait to see something that you like. Patience truly enhances our appreciation of the things we desire.
845	18776	7	3	A time when someone else I knew was patient was when I was trying to have a sleepover with my friend @CAPS1. My parents ordered pizza for me and my two brothers because they went out for their anniversary dinner. It was around @NUM1 pm when they left, and we just started digging into the delicious deep - dish @CAPS2's pizza. Halfway through dinner, I got a text from my next - door neighbor, who is my best friend, asking if I wanted to have a sleepover. I replied saying that my parents are out, they'll be back in a few hours, I'll ask later. Finally, around @NUM2 pm, my parents came home, and I asked about the sleepover. She said, “I don't know,” and walked away. About an hour later, I got my answer. It was a yes! I texted @CAPS1 and said that I could. She replied, “Finally!” Then I had to go pack. I went to my room and got everything I would need for a sleepover. I was just about to walk out the door when my mom shouted from upstairs, “Hold on! I need you to take the dogs out before you leave!” I dropped everything, put the leashes on the dogs, and stood outside in the pouring rain waiting for them to finish up. When they were done, I grabbed my stuff and ran out the door before she made me do something else. When I got to @CAPS7's house, she opened the door and let me in. I said, “Sorry it took so long. Thanks for being so patient!” Her patience made it possible for us to have a great sleepover.
846	18777	7	3	"I don't have a moment when I'm patient, so today I'm going to write about how impatient I am. I think one day I was in a long line at the store (@ORGANIZATION1). It was a hot day, and I was eager to get back to my cool and spacious house to relax and unwind. You all know how old people are; they walk slowly and talk too much. As you may have noticed, @NUM1 of those people were in front of me. He was taking ages to take out his wallet and chatting non - stop. So I said, ""You know what, I'll just go to another @ORGANIZATION1 and get me a slushy right now. I can't deal with this slowness on a humid day"" and then I left. This incident clearly shows my lack of patience, and I realize I need to work on it."
847	18778	7	3	"Being patient can sometimes be extremely hard, especially when whatever you're being patient about is really distracting and painful. This is the story of how I had to be patient when I fell outside and hurt myself. One day, my brother and I were playing outside. We were having fun throwing water balloons at each other. I was already soaked from head to toe, but we still kept playing. Suddenly, I heard a buzzing sound by my ear. I turned around and saw a huge bee next to me. I was only @NUM1 years old and very much afraid of bees. I turned and ran down the driveway and kept going around the house, thinking that the bee was still following me. I was starting to get tired, so I tripped and fell, scraping off a good amount of skin in the process. I immediately began to cry when I saw blood oozing from the wound. I rushed inside to tell my mom. ""@CAPS1! I fell!"" I managed to scream between sobs. ""@CAPS2, my gosh! Let me go find some band - aids,"" my mother replied. The pain was intolerable for my little body. I kept silently crying, but I knew I had to be patient while my mom went to look for bandages. Just like @DATE1 when I had wasted a bunch of band - aids by plastering them across my own face. I had to be patient and wait for a long time until my mother finally found the bandages. ""I found them!"" my mom said while running down the hallway where I was sitting. ""@CAPS3, thank you for being so patient,"" @CAPS4 stuck the band - aids across the cut on my leg and then gave me a lollipop. I knew I had been a good girl by being patient, and this experience taught me the value of patience in difficult times."
848	18779	7	3	Yo! I'm the narrator – you know the dude that tells the story. Well, I'm gonna tell you a story about patience. Ok, so, there was this armadillo. His name is @CAPS1. Now @CAPS1 is no ordinary armadillo. @CAPS1 was an armadillo without a shell. All the other armadillos made fun of him and told him to get a shell. So @CAPS1, being the smart armadillo he is, thought about this idea and decided to make a shell of his own. @CAPS1 went to the junk yard to look for things to help him make his shell. He carefully selected a lot of lightweight metal and then took it home. He melted it down and started the long and meticulous process of metal - smithing his shell. When his shell was finally complete, he tried it on and it fit nice and snug. The next day he went to school, and everyone was so impressed as it was super shiny. @CAPS1 was no longer made fun of. @CAPS1 had to be patient to make his shell, and his patience paid off in the end.
849	18780	7	3	Being patient is a very difficult thing to do. Many people can't be patient. For example, my brother. If he orders something online or is waiting for dinner, be prepared; he always has to be whiny about when he's going to get what he wants. I'm not like that. I actually have patience. For example, I needed shoes, so I searched the internet to see if I could get a good deal. I was searching on the @ORGANIZATION1 store when I saw these really good shoes. I asked my dad if I could order them online. So the next day, my mom ordered them online. I was so excited; I waited and waited. After three days, I missed my school bus. My mom had to go to college and she couldn't drop me off. So I stayed home alone. I found out that my dad was coming home that exact day and the house was a mess. So I started cleaning. My mom came home and saw a box laying on the front porch. She picked it up and opened the box and saw my shoes were in there! I went to go welcome her and I saw my shoes lying there. I jumped up in excitement and put them on, and it was a perfect fit. My mom came in the room and said they were supposed to arrive on @DATE1, but since you were patient, they came early. This shows that patience can bring unexpected rewards.
850	18781	7	3	"I have never been a “patient” person. But this girl I know, @PERSON1, she is always patient. Like the time I was scared to go sledding down the hill and I wouldn't go down the hill. I kept saying, ""I'm not going down the hill."" About @NUM1 minutes later, she was still patient. She said, ""@CAPS2, I'll go down first. Then will you go down?"" I said yes, so she went down and then I went down. And on the day of last year's dance, I was taking so long to get dressed. We were all already late, yet she was so very patient. I was so surprised. I think she has a surplus of patience. I hope some of it rubs off on me because I need some, and as soon as possible, and a lot of it too because I bet I'm the only person in the world without patience. Wow! I really need to learn from her example and try to become a more patient person."
851	18782	7	3	One rainy day, my dad's leg was bothering him quite a bit. He took some medicine, but unfortunately, that didn't work. So, we took him to the hospital in Coro. The doctors there looked carefully at his leg and then told us that we had to go to the hospital in Covent Hospital at @LOCATION1. So, we quickly got on our way to @LOCATION1. When we arrived at the hospital, there were like @NUM1 people in the waiting room. My dad showed great patience as he waited. When it was finally our turn to go into the room, my dad had to get X - rays. He still had enough patience to wait and see what was wrong with his leg. When he found out what the issue was, he had to wait even longer to see if he had to get surgery on his legs. Well, after all that waiting and having so much patience, he finally had to go through the surgery. He had enough calmness and patience to go through the whole surgical process. It's a really good thing that my dad had all that patience because now his legs are all better. I really didn't think my dad had enough patience before, but he proved me wrong.
852	18783	7	3	I am being patient throughout this year for @CAPS1 so that I can get some @CAPS2. I was previously buying @CAPS2, but now I can't buy any more because @CAPS1 is coming up soon. That's why I have to be patient. If I keep getting overly excited, the time will seem to pass even more slowly. Every day requires patience. Sometimes, I can hardly wait to get out of school so that I can go and play. I'm always making an effort to be patient because there's one holiday after another, and each one gets more exciting. Every kid tries, but being patient is one of the most difficult things to do. The way I stay patient is that I act like nothing exciting is even coming up. In the end, I know that by being patient, I'll enjoy @CAPS1 and the @CAPS2 even more.
853	18784	7	3	Today was Thanksgiving. We had to drive up to a certain place to visit my cousins. The car was burning a lot of fuel on this @NUM1 - long trip. But having patience was really hard. I even wished I had a plane ticket to get there faster. Along the way, I saw some cool things. We drove for a while to get out there. Then we turned off the highway and finally reached our destination. We were with our family. We sat down, caught up with each other, and we gave gifts. We also cooked a turkey and had a great meal together. Spending time with family on Thanksgiving made all the patience during the long drive worth it.
854	18785	7	3	On my way to @STATE1, I was very patient because I had to wait for the buses. I also had to wait at some stops. At some of those stops, there were @NUM1 buses. It took a while for the right bus to come. I was so tired that when the right bus finally arrived, I fell asleep right away. Even though the waiting was tiring, I knew that patience would get me to @STATE1 safely.
855	18786	7	3	"Today was the final day of tryouts. It was the deciding day. The tryouts were over, and I patiently waited for the @CAPS2 to hand out the envelopes to all @NUM1 girls. I really didn't know if I could handle the suspense. ""@CAPS1 until you've left the building to open your envelope,"" @CAPS2 @PERSON1 said firmly. ""@CAPS3's only fair. If everyone opens them in here, then people who don't make the team will be sad and bummed while the girls who did would be jumping for joy, which would make the girls who didn't make @CAPS3 feel even more bummed and left out. Be patient and @CAPS1 until you leave the building."" She called my name. I nervously came up and grabbed my envelope. She dismissed us. Some girls couldn't wait and opened their envelopes right away. But, unfortunately, they didn't make @CAPS3. It was like karma. I waited until I got outside. I could barely contain my excitement. I really needed to know, but I had to @CAPS1. Patience isn't always an easy thing. Finally, I opened my envelope. I made the team! I was so excited and I was really glad I had the patience to @CAPS1 and be pleasantly surprised. This experience taught me that patience can lead to great rewards."
856	18787	7	3	It was my family vacation, and we were going to a special @CAPS1 point. We were staying in a truly magical hotel. It was incredibly beautiful; you could see a real, cascading waterfall, and it was like a slice of heaven. We were in this huge room that had a @NUM1 - sized huge bathroom and big, comfortable @CAPS2. Then, as I looked out of the window, I could see a roller - coaster and all kinds of exciting rides. But they had this new ride called the @CAPS3 breaker: it was @NUM2 hundred feet tall, as big as the Statue of Liberty, and it picked you up, dropped you @NUM2 hundred feet, and twisted like a wild tornado. It moved from side to side. Me and my mom and dad went there, and we wanted to ride. But there were @NUM4 people waiting in line. My parents wanted to ride a different ride, but I wanted to ride this one. So I got in line and waited. I knew I had to be patient, but after @NUM1 hours passed, I started to lose my patience. There was only @NUM6 people in front of me. Finally, it was my turn. I got on it. First, it lifted me up @NUM7 hundred feet and dropped me, spun me around, and twisted me until I got tired. Finally, I got off it. You could see me crying, but it was not a bad cry; it was a good cry. So that was the time I was patient, and it was an unforgettable part of our vacation.
857	18788	7	3	I stood in the elevator, tapping my foot impatiently as smooth jazz music hummed out of the speakers above me. Eventually, the all - too - familiar click was heard, and the smooth metal doors slid open to reveal a well - furnished hallway with many other people waiting @CAPS6 their turn of departure on the (it seems something is missing here, perhaps a tram or something). I slipped out, trying not to be trampled by the massive crowd. Then, there was silence. My footsteps echoed off the polished floor as I searched @CAPS6 room @NUM1. Finally finding my destination, I opened the door and stepped inside where many other squirmy children were waiting. I removed my coat and hung it on a nearby hook, trying not to draw too much attention to myself. I continued by searching through the magazine section. Torn - up @CAPS1 magazines and delicately handled Sports Illustrated were flipped through until I found an interesting - looking article on swimming. With magazines under my arm, I chose a seat in the far corner to wait in. Minutes passed, and I could tell that the child next to me was becoming impatient fast. He tapped his mother's jacket repeatedly and asked the same thing he did @NUM2 minutes ago, “ @CAPS2 how much longer?” The mother checked her watch and in a slightly annoyed tone replied, “not much longer now dear.” Hearing this, the little boy slumped back in his seat and jammed his thumb into his mouth to keep him occupied. I rolled my eyes but couldn't help but crack a smile at his actions. Somewhere across the room, a girl about my age frowned as @CAPS5 texted on her cellphone. After a quick glance at the clock, @CAPS5 scowled and continued. Just then, the glass door slid open and a woman with a homemade perm and tired eyes stepped out. Across the waiting room, patients looked up at her, their eyes full of anticipation and hope. “ @PERSON1, the doctor is ready to see you now.” Hearing this, I avoided the angry glares from other patients and followed her out the door. “You know it's funny,” @CAPS5 said while snapping her gum. “Among someone so young, you were the most patient person out there!” I merely nodded my head and grinned because I understand that patient people experience difficulties without complaining, and I am very grateful that I'm a patient person. This experience in the waiting room was a good reminder of the value of patience.
858	18789	7	3	One day my brother, my mom, and I were going to the doctor's because my brother was sick. When we got to the doctor's office and sat in the waiting area, they called my mom and brother. So I had to stay. My mom told me it would only take two minutes. Guess what? She was wrong. It took her two hours to come back. So while I was waiting patiently, I texted my aunt and friends. I also played some simple games on my phone. I actually brought my @CAPS1 with me, which helped pass the time. So I waited and waited. I was so bored that I went outside for some fresh air. Then, when I got tired, I just sat there quietly. Finally, they came out. Guess what my mom said? “How are you, sweety?” Then my mum told me my brother was sick. I was so patient that we got to eat at @ORGANIZATION1 after that. After spending @NUM1 minutes there, I was so tired that I just wanted to go home and sleep. I realized that being patient is not that hard. It's actually a good quality to have, and I'm glad I was patient at the clinic. This experience taught me that patience can lead to small rewards and a sense of self - satisfaction.
859	18790	7	3	Patience is when you get in a long line at the grocery store or when you are waiting for a new video game. That happened to me when I was on the great journey to California. I had to stand in six very long lines for up to @NUM1 hours. It took forever to get on the plane. When we finally got there, we were hungry, so we had to wait in line for @NUM2 minutes. When we were finally up to get our food, we were starving. We ate quickly and then went to a friend's house. We stayed there for an hour, and it started to get boring, but I had patience and waited. Turns out it was not so bad after all. Being patient is an important thing in life. Whether you are or aren't patient is up to you. That week was all about patience and lines, lots of both. It was a long day. Sadly, we had to leave after that day, which meant more patience. First, we had to go to Houston, Texas, then @ORGANIZATION1. Then we had to drive @NUM3 hours to get home. When we got home, we were so tired that we just crashed. We passed the story to my friends and family, and it became a good example of how patience can get you through difficult situations.
860	18791	7	3	To be considered patient, you must be tolerant and understanding, and you cannot complain. I love babysitting my little cousin, especially when they are still infants. This @DATE1, I went to my cousin's house to watch her daughter @CAPS1í @PERSON1 for about three hours. I was getting paid fifty dollars, and I couldn't wait. When I got to their house, @NUM1 was sleeping, and I woke her up as soon as her mom left. As soon as I did that, I figured it was a bad idea. She started screaming at the top of her lungs. I picked her up gently, rocked her slowly, played simple games with her, put her in the swing, and even tried to feed her, but nothing worked. I was so upset that I felt like screaming myself. The baby cried for an hour and a half and wouldn't hush. Then I said, “ @NUM1, what's the matter?” As soon as I spoke, there was a moment of silence; she had stopped crying. At that moment, I realized I was being patient because I stayed somewhat calm, and I didn't complain to @CAPS1í@CAPS4's mom. This experience showed me that patience is truly tested in difficult situations, and I'm proud that I was able to stay patient while taking care of the baby.
861	18792	7	3	"Every year since I learned about @LOCATION1 and presents, now that I think about it, they never said you'd have to wait months until @CAPS1 came around. I love @CAPS1 but once a year or so, @CAPS2 is patient enough to wait until @DATE1 arrives. The first @DATE2 of @DATE1 told me @CAPS1 was coming, along with all the decorating, carolling, and the wistful feeling of @CAPS1 joy. I usually try to pass the time by having snowball wars with my cousins in the cold, powdery snow. I still feel the temptation trying to rush time, making me anxious and finding it grueling to wait so long, but @CAPS2 remains patient and tries to let the temptation go away. When @CAPS1 eve came, I feel grateful I made it this long with patience because @CAPS2 is just like my parents and can't wait for anything that takes months. Then it comes around as slow as possible and then leaves quicker than I could think how fast it left. Just like the saying ""time flies"" when having fun, but in the end, the memories of @CAPS1 are truly precious."
862	18793	7	3	"Once when I was a little boy, about seven years old, I was extremely patient about an @CAPS1 toy I wanted. Ever since the @CAPS3 @ORGANIZATION1 bender was on television and in stories, I was crazy about them and I still am today. The @CAPS4 @CAPS5, the only person in the @CAPS1 world who can master all four elements - @CAPS7, @LOCATION1, @CAPS8, @ORGANIZATION1. Now I can write you a whole entire book about the @CAPS1. So I saw a @CAPS1 set on TV, and I eagerly asked my mom if she could buy it. And she said when she gets the money, but until then no. Of course, I was really upset. So I was waiting, counting the days until they went by. Then finally, that very @CAPS12 came, and you know what that means. "" @CAPS11 @CAPS12"" - the @CAPS12 has arrived, the @CAPS12 when I get my toy. But I didn't know that she only got two hundred dollars, so I had to wait another week. I was so upset that I ran up the stairs, locked my door, and cried myself to sleep. My birthday was coming up. I was so upset that I forgot all about the @CAPS12, and when my birthday arrived, can you guess what? I finally got the best of all - the @CAPS4. And my mom said that all that patience I showed got me what I wanted, proving that patience truly pays off."
863	18794	7	3	Patience is like when you're waiting for something and you don't complain that it's taking too long. Instead, you're just sitting there quietly, waiting calmly. Here is an example. One time I was waiting to go get a check - up at the doctor's. I was sitting in the waiting room, quietly reading a magazine about interesting travel destinations. There were other people around, some fidgeting and others chatting, but I just sat there, focused on the magazine. This is a clear example of being patient. In the end, patience allows us to handle waiting situations with grace and a calm mind.
864	18795	7	3	"One day a kid named @CAPS4 was going to school. He was going to turn in a paper for math, and he did his best to get it ready. During @CAPS1 class, @CAPS4 was doing a chapter sketch, trying to understand the new concepts. His teacher called him over. The teacher said, ""Do you have a page of a story that was due a month ago?"" @CAPS4 said ""no"". The teacher asked ""why"", and the kid said ""because I have been going to a basketball tournament, which took up a lot of my time."" The teacher said ""you have to tell me tomorrow."" The next day, the kid was at @CAPS1 class. @CAPS4 said ""I'm really sorry I don't have my paper."" The teacher asked ""why"", and he replied ""because my grampa died, and I was dealing with the family matters."" The teacher said ""okay, tomorrow."" Finally, the kid got his paper done, showing that sometimes things take time but can still be accomplished."
865	18796	7	3	I have been patient lots of times in my life, but this time was really hard to be patient because I was so excited about building my room. We had been planning it for a while now and started on a @DATE1 after school was over. We worked hard that day and got like half of it done, hammering the nails and fitting the wooden planks together. But then, we couldn't work on it again for a week because my brother, sister, dad, and mom all had either work commitments or some important family events. So I had to wait a week just to work on it again. It was really hard to be patient this time though because I had been waiting to do this for a while. Every day felt like an eternity. After a week finally passed, it seemed like a month, but now I could finish my work and I was so excited. A few days later, we finally finished the walls and painted them a beautiful blue and gold for the University of @CAPS1. All that was left to do was to put in the finishing touches, like arranging my dad's hand - me - down furniture. Then it was ready to sleep in. I was so happy that we had finally finished my room and I could sleep in it, enjoying the fruits of our patience and hard work.
866	18797	7	3	One time that I was patient was when I was saving up to buy a game. The name of the game was Halo Reach. I had to wait @NUM1 weeks until I could get it. During those weeks, I really wanted to play it right away, but I was patient by waiting the whole time and not asking over and over again. Finally, when the @NUM1 weeks were up, I was able to buy the game and had a great time playing it. This experience taught me the value of patience.
867	18798	7	3	"The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 a few days after @CAPS18 began to run. @CAPS3, a small, anxious, chestnut - colored foal, saw her @CAPS5 plowing a large oval and covering it with what looked like dust. ""What's @CAPS4's @CAPS5 doing, @CAPS6?"" asked a very curious @CAPS3. ""@CAPS9's plowing,"" replied @CAPS10 @CAPS11, the young horses' @CAPS17. ""@CAPS12's going to be in a race called the @ORGANIZATION1 next year and that's how @CAPS18 will practice."" ""I want to race!"" hollered @CAPS3 excitedly. ""Patience my darling, you're not even a filly!"" replied @CAPS10 @CAPS11 conclusively. And so @CAPS3 waited patiently for weeks. When @CAPS18 could, @CAPS18 ran the track at night. @CAPS18 carefully counted her times and gradually @CAPS18 got faster and stronger. Two years later, @CAPS3 was the champion for @NUM1 years in a row. ""@CAPS17 was right! Patience is the key!"" @CAPS18 claimed, realizing the power of patience."
868	18799	7	3	"@CAPS1, have you bought @CAPS10 yet?"" I yelled across the room. ""@CAPS2, not yet. Let's get @CAPS10 @CAPS4,"" my dad said back to me. I was buying a scooter on the internet and @CAPS10 was being shipped from @LOCATION1. The website said the scooter will get here in five to eight business days. ""Yes!"" I yelled as I bought @CAPS10. ""@CAPS4, all that's left to do is wait."" The next morning, I woke up at six am to catch the bus to school. During all my classes, all I could think about was the scooters. ""Patience, @CAPS5 - patience,"" I thought. After school, I would go to the local country store until @NUM1 when my parents would pick me up. Five business days finally came. ""I can't wait any more!"" I yelled. After the country store, my mom drove me home and I sprinted to the mail box. ""Darn @CAPS10!"" I said. ""@CAPS6, yeah, the website tried to charge our credit card extra money so we had to cancel @CAPS10."" ""It's okay, @CAPS5,"" my mom said. ""Let's buy you a new one."" ""@CAPS8,"" and the new scooter finally arrives three business days later. ""It's about time!"" I said with joy, happy that my patience had finally paid off."
869	18800	7	3	One time when I was at @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I had to wait about @NUM1 hours to go on the Top Thrill Dragster. I was so patient because it was my first time ever going on the dragster. Me and my dad were waiting and waiting in the long line. We watched as other people got on and off the ride, and my excitement grew. When we finally got to the front of the line, I was so scared that I was going to pee my pants. When we got on the roller - coaster, I said that I didn't want to go. So my dad asked if my son could get off the roller - coaster, but they said when you get on there is no getting off. So I had to ride it. And when I did, I was initially terrified, but then I found it incredibly thrilling. I wanted to go on it over and over again. Even though it was a @NUM2 - second ride, it was the best thing that I had ever waited for in my life so far. This experience truly showed me that patience can lead to amazing rewards.
870	18801	7	3	It was a test of patience waiting to go to @CAPS1. It went through @NUM1 appointments. I was so excited and had to wait patiently while doing many other activities in the meantime. There were times when the ladies around me were impatient, but I tried to stay calm. Sometimes, I would hear parents yelling things like “at me and you go against systems. I will have to be patient.” I knew I had to be patient and do all the night - time work. In the process, I hoped to get a @CAPS2. As the days passed, I continued with all the tasks, just like in @LOCATION1’s meat - packing area where one has to be methodical. Sitting through it all, I endured the long wait. Finally, after all the waiting, I was able to go to @CAPS1, and it was worth the patience I had shown.
871	18802	7	3	Do you know someone who is patient? I do. My mom is very patient with us kids. When I just blow my top over the smallest things, my mom is still as cool as a cucumber. All the time, my little brother does things that make me so mad that I can't stand it. He might mess up my things or make too much noise. But she barely ever gets like that. Even when my grandma died, which was a really tough time for all of us, she stayed cool and composed. Two of my aunts just broke down that week. They were really sad and emotional. But they're good now. Every day, little things don't make her very uptight. When my sister makes her mad, my sister always regrets it later. I want to punch her when she makes mom mad because it wears off on me and she gets cranky. So as you can see, my mom keeps her patience so well, and it's really inspiring.
872	18803	7	3	My friend was waiting for @NUM1 hours to talk to my dad. My dad was busy fixing his @CAPS1, which seemed to be giving him a hard time. He was waiting, waiting, and waiting quietly till he fixed it. I was really wondering what the question was that my friend wanted to ask. He was sitting inside, comfortably watching TV while waiting for him to be finished. Then my dad was finally done, so my friend asked if we could ride the @CAPS1. My dad said yes. My friend was being really patient throughout the whole process, and it showed his good character.
873	18804	7	3	Being patient is a good thing because if you are, then when you're in some rough time in life, it helps you a lot. Patient people can handle it by bringing something to do, like a book or a game. They could wait there for three hours and not be heard complaining. There are some people that can't wait there for three hours. There are even some people that can't wait there for ten minutes. These people get mad at that and they will just give up easily. But after all, among those people that can and can't be patient, people can't just quit. Some people wait there for one hour and will just blow up. And then there are people that can't do it but they try their best. So all you have to do is find anything to do if you can't be patient, and gradually you'll get better at it.
874	18805	7	3	“@CAPS1, are we there yet?” I keep asking over and over again. “@CAPS2 but almost,” he replied. Today we are going to @LOCATION1 adventures and I am so excited! I've been looking forward to this trip for a long time. After I asked my @CAPS1 when we would be there, about @NUM1 minutes later we finally arrived at @LOCATION1 adventures! The line to get our tickets was long but not too long. Once we got them we went to go look for a lock to put all of our stuff in! The line for that wasn't long so we did that fast! We were now all hungry, so we went to go eat! When we got into the restaurant, the lines to order were very long! We had to stand there for a while. Ok, so now that we are all done eating, it was time to ride some awesome rides! “@CAPS3, man!” is what I would keep saying when the lines to the rides were super long! But so far I have been a very patient girl! But, ok say I had to go change my clothes to go into the water park and change back or go to the restroom. Man, these lines were super long too! Now that the day is almost done, and the park will be closing, my family and I are in the gift shop. We were in there for about @NUM1 minutes walking around. When we were done and we were ready to check out, the check - out line wasn't long at all! Finally, there was a line that wasn't long! All that day I was a very patient girl, and it made the whole day more enjoyable.
875	18806	7	3	A time that I was patient was when my friend and I were at @ORGANIZATION1 vacation. I was having a blast exploring the place. My family didn't come because they don't like roller coasters. We decided to ride the @CAPS1. It looked like a really long wait as there were so many people in line. After an hour and a half of waiting, it started to rain. It was just sprinkling at first but it was enough so they had to close some rides, including the @CAPS1. We were a bit disappointed but we really wanted to ride so we waited under a shelter until the rain stopped. After another hour, a lot of people left because of the rain, so we were at the front of the line. My friend and I got front row seats and had a lot of fun screaming and laughing on the ride. It was worth waiting @NUM1 and a half hours for it, and we even went on it twice. This experience taught me the value of patience.
876	18807	7	3	A time when I was patient was when I was in the fifth grade and I had to wait to play football till this year. I was really eager to get on the field and show my skills, but I knew I had to be patient. I waited for a long time without doing anything rash, just biding my time. Finally, the opportunity came, and it made the wait all the more worthwhile. That patience taught me the value of waiting for the right moment.
877	18808	7	3	Do you know what patience is? Have you ever been patient? Well, being patient is something you truly need in life. I’m going to tell you a little bit more about being patient. In many aspects of daily life, patience is a big thing. Patience is something we need when we go shopping, standing in long queues at the checkout, or when you're in the car stuck in traffic. You must be patient when you are in the car because if you don’t, then you could easily get into an accident. Patience has many positive qualities. If you aren’t patient when you are in a public place, then you are going to become annoying to those around you. When there are long lines or something and you're not patient, people are going to get very frustrated and annoyed with you. Moreover, being patient is important in family life too. If you have kids and you're impatient, then you're going to teach your kids to be impatient. That’s not a good thing at all. As you can see, I have told you as much as I can about patience, and it's clear that it's an essential virtue in life.
878	18809	7	3	A time when my parents were patient was when I wouldn’t eat my dinner. One night, my dad made chop suey for dinner. I didn't like chop suey at all! The strong, unappealing smell of it immediately made me gag! But, my dad loves chop suey so he makes it all the time! We all sat down to eat. I ate a potato and my dad gave me a whole scoop of chop suey. “I’m not gonna eat it.” I said firmly. “I hate chop suey.” My dad sat patiently at the table, calmly waiting for me to eat what was on my plate. “Fine,” I said, “I’ll pick the meat out of it.” I took the fork and stirred the chop suey around, carefully looking for the meat. After I ate all the meat, I said, “Now I am done.” My dad laughed at my stubbornness. “Eat the vegetables out of it.” My dad said. “Oh no! I hate celery!” I whined. After a half - hour of this war of wills, my dad won. I really wanted to leave the table but he was very patient with me. I ended up eating the chop suey and finally leaving the table. That was when my dad was very patient, and his patience helped me learn to face things I didn't like.
879	18810	7	3	One time when I was being very patient was when I was with my grandparents. We were supposed to be going to some adventures and my grandma said she wanted me and my cousins to be ready by a certain time so we wouldn’t get there that late. So the next day we got to her house right there at 9 o'clock like she said. When we arrived, we had found out that she had overslept and we all looked at one another, knowing that it was going to take a long time. So I said, “That’s ok, we can wait.” and we all went into her house and patiently waited until everyone was ready. As we were walking out, I noticed that my grandparents were carrying suitcases and I asked, “Why do you guys carry suitcases?” My grandma then told us that we were going to spend the night in a hotel so we would be even closer to the adventures. So she drove all of us back to our houses to get our toothbrushes and an extra pair of clothes. After that, we were on our way to the hotel and ready to go to the adventures the next morning. Even though the start was delayed, my patience made the whole trip possible.
880	18811	7	3	One time I had to be patient was when I went to a small town with my mom, dad, as well as my sister and my grandma. My cousins live in that small town so we were going to visit them. We had to drive five hours in a small Colt with five people. The car was cramped, and we were all really excited, so we had to be patient on the car ride there. When I first found out that we were going, I was really happy and I knew I would have to be very patient during this long journey. We had to drive the whole day then get a motel to stay in. Then we had to drive till about 8 p.m. and we finally reached my great - aunt's lake house, my grandma's sister. It was so much fun getting to see them again! But then came more need for patience on the trip home. We were all sad to leave but we had a great time. The trip home felt shorter than the trip there but still long. When we got home, everyone of us was tired and tired of being in the car, but we were glad we didn’t have to drive another hour home like my grandma. That was a time when I had to be patient, and it was a memorable experience that taught me the importance of patience during long - distance travel.
881	18812	7	3	This is a story about a time I was patient. It was a pitch - black night, and all of a sudden, a wire from my braces popped out of place. The thin wire was sticking uncomfortably out of my mouth, and there was absolutely nothing I could do about it. I had to wait for my mom to get home and help me, but I was really scared. However, I managed to stay patient. I sat there quietly, keeping my eyes on the door, waiting until my mom finally got there. Then we carefully got the wire out. After that, my mom told me I had been very patient, and I was proud of myself.
882	18813	7	3	Be patient. A day when I had to be patient was on my birthday. I was eagerly waiting for my dad to give me some money so I could go to the movies. I waited all day until 4 o'clock. When he finally agreed, I got 20 dollars. It was worth being patient because if I would have been impatient and kept pestering him, he would probably have lowered the price, and it would have been my fault. Also, another time I had to be patient was when I asked my mother to pick me up from football practice. We waited for a while, and I was the last one left. I was standing under a tree when it was raining and there was lightning. I couldn't put on my helmet as it would have attracted lightning. Being patient in these situations taught me that rushing doesn't always lead to good results. So if you're in that type of situation, just don't rush for future benefits.
883	18814	7	3	What exactly is patience? Patience means to wait calmly for something. One of the times that I had to be patient was when I wanted my ears pierced. For four long years, I tried everything - I begged my mom with puppy - dog eyes, pleaded with her constantly, and even cleaned the whole house in hopes of convincing her, but it still didn't work. My mom said I have to be 13 before I can get my ears pierced. So instead of annoying her further, I sat back and stayed patient. By showing this patience, I got my mom to change the age to twelve. So all I have to do is wait until my soccer season is finished and find a good place, and she'll take me. Patience really helps in many different ways, and I encourage you to try being patient when you want something, because it will all fall into place in the end.
884	18815	7	3	"Sometimes being patient is hard, but I've had to do it a lot of times. One time in particular was very life - changing for me. It was my favorite day of the year, my birthday. I've always waited for this day long and hard every year until it comes. I got up really early, full of excitement, to see my presents, but there were none. My mom was just sitting on the couch, watching TV like nothing was important. I said to her, ""Mom, where are my presents?"" All she said back was, ""Honey, why are you up this early?"" Disappointed, I just went back to sleep. When I woke up again, still nothing happened. So I just waited patiently in my room, looking out the window from time to time, until something happened, but still nothing. Eventually, I went downstairs and played video games until 2 o'clock, just waiting for someone to say ""happy birthday"", yet nothing. So I just acted like it was a normal day until 6 pm when I went in the basement. There was a surprise birthday party for me with presents and friends and everything. I was really glad I was patient. I got a great party, and now I'm patient every day because I know good things come to those who wait."
885	18816	7	3	Last summer, I went with some friends to the Christian Rock Festival. The festival is all about Christian rock music. The part that sticks out the most is seeing my favorite Christian rock band, MercyMe. They played a bunch of new and energetic songs and had a lot of amazing guitar solos that really got the crowd pumped up. I bought one of their CDs, and it was truly amazing. The part that made me patient was the long line that my friend Jake and I had to wait in to get autographs. The line almost stretched out of the gate into the parking lot. The bad part was we were pretty much at the very end of it. Even though the wait was long, the girl behind us was super nice, and we ended up having great conversations and making a new friend. When we finally got to the front, the long wait was all worth it. All of the band members were super nice, and I gave their lead singer Bart my lucky bracelet as a token of my appreciation. That was the time I was patient, and it taught me that patience can lead to wonderful experiences.
886	18817	7	3	One time there were two twin chipmunks. Their names were @PERSON1 and A.J. @PERSON1 always had patience, while A.J. not so much. One sunny day with a cool breeze, A.J. decided he wanted to go on a trip with @PERSON1. So they carefully packed up their camping gear and headed farther into the woods. It was around dusk when they reached the place they wanted to be. So they tried to build a fire. @PERSON1 started gathering dry firewood and tried to start the fire the way their mom and dad had taught them. As I said in the first part, A.J. has no patience, so he kept on trying. But after a while, he stopped. He would hit the rocks together once and when it didn't start, @PERSON1 tried. In @NUM1 minute, he got it started. A.J. didn't care and he got the acorns and started cooking. But every time he'd only leave them on for @NUM2 seconds. So he tried and tried, and finally he just stopped. Well, it took @PERSON1 @NUM2 minutes. A.J. was really mad now, so they went to bed. When @PERSON1 woke up in the morning, he found A.J. cooking breakfast. A.J finally learned to be patient, and they had a great rest of the trip together.
887	18818	7	3	My head was in the sky. It was mine. The ticket I'd been desperately dying for was actually mine. I was going to see three days of @ORGANIZATION1 and breaking @CAPS1 with my own eyes! Only one thing was bad. The concert was @NUM1 days away. So soon but oh so far. For three days (no fun intended!), I silently whined and whined, but only in my head. I didn't want to annoy my father after all he did just spend loads of money on me! After those three days, I was okay. I still promised myself I wouldn't break my rule of no complaining. I couldn't tell if the week went fast or slow. All I knew was I couldn't wait any longer. Soon enough, it was @DATE1, and my two favorite bands and a band I loved almost as much called flipleaf, would be in @LOCATION1 tonight. The day slowly crawled. I wanted to explode with excitement. All I could think was what would happen later today. Every second my heart pounced until I got in my dad's car at @NUM2. Cool clothes, snacks, tickets? Check. @NUM1 days of no complaining? CHECK! We listened to the three bands we would be seeing all the way to @LOCATION1. I thought my heart had gone back to normal but with each beat of life, it got louder and louder and almost in time to the pound of their bass drums. As we passed a limo with one window open, I swear I saw the singer of breaking @CAPS1. (@CAPS3 @CAPS4) feiceps. I saw the limo just as we entered @LOCATION1. No more than ten minutes later we pulled into the parking building for the @PERSON1. I got a glimpse of the long line of people waiting to get in. I reached into my bottle of patience, and pulled out the small scraps of what I had left. The enormous tunnels where the lines were, were gray and dull. We had to walk for a mile to get to the end of the line, and the line seemed to be made up of snails, but before I knew it, I was in. I had yet to complain. I was proud of my patience, and the concert turned out to be amazing.
888	18819	7	3	"One day I was being really patient. I was baby - sitting and it was going great until the kids started fighting! It was my two little brothers, of course. They were hitting, kicking, and the youngest one was biting. So I calmly told them to stop. They did for a while and then started again over a shiny toy. So I went back to their room and firmly told them to stop again. So they stopped for good until my little brother @PERSON1 started to copy everything everybody said. So I said, ""Stop or you'll go to your room."" So he stopped and everybody was well - behaved for the rest of the night until mom and dad got home. Now that's a whole different story. But overall, that's the time I was patient with my little brothers and sisters, and it made me realize I could handle difficult situations."
889	18820	7	3	"A time when I was very patient was last year. My auntie said she was taking me to a basketball game. So the next day, when I woke up, I woke up too early. My aunt never told me what time she was coming. So I got ready at @NUM1 am, putting on my favorite basketball - related clothes. So at @NUM2 am I called her but she didn't answer. So then I just was watching TV and playing my video game to pass the time. Then around @NUM3 pm my aunt called back saying she had to go to the store. So now my frustration started to build up. I wanted to call her back and ask her questions like where are you going and how long you're gonna be gone. But I was trying to be patient. Now at @NUM4 my mom said, ""Let's go!"" Now I was really getting mad because I was not expecting to leave with my mom. So me and my mom got home at around @NUM5 pm. Now I was really angry because she had not even called since we were gone. So I called her and she said she's coming down the street. I was so happy. So later on that day I had fun with my cousins and aunt at the basketball game, and my patience finally paid off."
890	18821	7	3	"@CAPS1, when can we open presents?"" I asked. ""@CAPS2 we get back from church,"" she replied. It was our typical @DATE1 schedule. We would make @CAPS3 eve dinner all day, go to the @CAPS3 eve service, have grandparents for dinner, then all the kids get to open one present, then go to bed for about one hour, get up, and open more presents. ""Amen,"" our pastor concluded the service. ""Can we go now, @CAPS1?"" I blubbered. ""@CAPS6,"" she said. After we ate dinner, I felt like I had ants in my pants. I was so excited. Time seemed to go by so slowly. It felt like I was @NUM1 years old before my grandparents left. Finally, we were all gathered around the beautifully decorated @CAPS3 tree. Just as I was about to open my present, all it was was a sleeping bag. Then my dad said, ""You can all sleep on the floor in @LOCATION1 room, but be sure you go to bed."" As I was laying on the floor, while my sister was sound asleep, I was thinking, I wonder what I'll get for @CAPS3. I eventually fell asleep. The next morning at @NUM2, I jumped out of bed, woke my sister up, and ran into my parents' room to wake them up. I was thinking finally we get to open presents. That was a time where I had to be very patient. But it was all paid off in the end when I opened all the wonderful presents."
891	18822	7	3	Patience is about waiting and having the perseverance for the stuff you want. For example, if I want anything, patience means that you have to wait before you get it. So, patience implies that you have to wait in a good manner. This ability to wait calmly is an important quality that helps us in many situations of life.
892	18823	7	3	Once I was taking a long test. The test was really long, and it was scheduled for two and a half hours. I was done early, finishing with an hour and a half to spare. My friend finished within five minutes of me. After we were done, me and my friend had to wait a long time. I started reading a book but finished it quickly. Then, I had to wait another hour before I could actually do something else. Remember to bring something to do while you're being patient. If you have nothing to do, just wait quietly. Patience is a good quality as it can be used when waiting for something or someone, and it helps us handle such situations gracefully.
893	18824	7	3	One day I asked my parents if I could buy this game that I really wanted. They asked me how much it was, and I said that I did not know. So, they said that we would go to the store and see how much it cost. When we got there, we found out that it was @MONEY2. I asked if I could buy it, and they said maybe after a while. I started begging, but they still said @CAPS1. When I went home, I went to sleep. The next morning, I was at home watching @CAPS2.V and saw a commercial about the game. It said that the game was still @MONEY1. I was eager to get it. When we went to the mall, we saw that it was @MONEY3, and so I finally got to buy it. This experience taught me that sometimes patience pays off in getting what we want.
894	18825	7	3	Everyone is patient one time in their life. I remember I was extremely patient one day when I was ten years old. It was all because of popcorn. A small little popcorn kernel got caught in my throat. That was an agonizing day, but I was very patient. One day, about two years ago when I was ten, after going to a movie, I swallowed a popcorn kernel. I remember eating one last piece of popcorn from the popcorn box and then throwing the box away. Right as soon as I walked out the door after eating that popcorn piece, it started to bother me. My mom and I walked into the Target nearby to get some supplies and do some errands. I started to get really thirsty because of the popcorn kernel. I asked my mom if she would buy me a drink as I was so thirsty, but she said she only had a credit card. That meant she could buy her things but not a pop. I understood her situation. So, I just tried not to think about it, which was very hard. Soon we pulled up to our next stop, the bank. My mom needed to get some money to pay off my tennis instructor. I asked her if she could please hurry because the popcorn kernel and the lack of a drink was hurting me. She said she was going as fast as she could and that we were only a few minutes away from home. I knew that we were more like fifteen minutes away, not just a few, but I didn't argue. The kernel and thirst were starting to get to me. It felt like it had been three hours, but it had only been fifteen minutes by the time we finally got home. I threw the door open and ran inside to get some water. I ran, opened the fridge, opened a bottle of water, and gulped the whole thing down. Then I went outside to help my mom bring in the supplies and things and then drank more water with a smile. In conclusion, we all learn to be patient sometimes. I was patient to get home and drink some water, and when it finally happened, I was really happy. Patience helps us through difficult moments.
895	18826	7	3	There have only been a few times in my life where I really had to be patient, but the one I can remember the most was when I was at the @LOCATION1 airport. My parents and I were waiting at our terminal for our flight to @LOCATION2. We'd been waiting about @NUM1 minutes when we heard an announcement. “Something has gone wrong with the plane, but it should be fixed in about an hour.” We eventually found out that the back door had been slammed too hard, which broke one of the parts. They needed a new part so the emergency slide would work. An hour of waiting sounded okay at first. But then there was another announcement: “I'm sorry, but we cannot get the part right away. The wait will be a minimum of @NUM2 hours.” This sounded worse, but I kept calm while my mom was well freaking out. Three hours had passed, then four, and then @CAPS4. My laptop and my iPod ran out of power, so I was just fiddling with my fingers. Then we heard “It turns out we cannot get the part until tomorrow morning.” A big “ughhh” swept across the terminal. But luckily, we received a free night at a hotel until the flight. The wait was exhausting, but we all had patience, so we got through it. Patience in such situations helps us deal with unexpected delays and difficulties.
896	18827	7	3	A couple of days ago when I was at cheer practice, a lot of drama was going around our team. It was fifteen days before the competition, and the pressure was high. Everybody was yelling at someone. There was so much yelling and talking back to our coaches that no one could understand what we were supposed to be doing. The side I was on for the pom routine in our second formation wasn't in the diagonal line we were supposed to be in and wasn't getting to the kickline in time because the people on the other side were pushing us. So, we had to walk a lot farther than they did. @LOCATION1 (one of our coaches' daughters) was yelling at the side I'm on for not getting to the kickline in time, even though she's the one pushing us farther down so we can't get there. Then she started yelling at @PERSON1, saying it was all her fault. So then @PERSON2 said to @LOCATION1, “@LOCATION1, stop blaming everyone else for everything. You aren't perfect at everything either, and you're the ones pushing us over so we can't get to the kickline in time.” @LOCATION1 didn't know what to say, but she said, “@CAPS1 up @PERSON2! That isn't true.” Even though you could tell that she knew it was true because next time we did the kickline, she didn't move closer to the center; she moved farther, and @PERSON3 got to her spot not really on time but just a couple of seconds after she was supposed to. I thought that @PERSON2 was being loyal to @PERSON1 even though @PERSON1 might not be one of her best friends. They still are friends, just not best friends. This incident showed that in a team, we should support each other instead of shifting blame.
897	18829	7	3	A time when I was patient was when I wanted to go outside and enjoy the fresh air, and my sister also wanted to go but she wasn't ready. She had to get her hair done and put some clothes on. I waited patiently and didn't say a word. I really didn't want to wait, but I did. I was eager to go outside, and since my sister wanted to go too, I waited on her. I walked out the door quietly, but then my sister yelled, “I want to go. Wait!” I went back in the house and waited for her to first find some clothes. So she went upstairs and rummaged through her closet to find some. She put her clothes on and then she had to look for her shoes. She searched the whole house and then finally found them in the corner. So we were about to walk out, and I said, “Girl, what's wrong with your hair?” surprised. She felt her head and said, “Oh, I forgot.” So we went back in the house, and I tried to put her hair in a ponytail, but it wouldn't fit. So I let her do something, and she couldn't. So I parted her hair and put it in two ponytails. Then we went outside. That's a time when I waited patiently on my sister, and it taught me that patience can strengthen our relationship.
898	18830	7	3	When I was getting ready to leave my uncle's ranch, I was waiting patiently for my dad to get back so he could help my brother put the @NUM1 on to the trailer. It had been @NUM2 hours, and my dad still hadn't come back yet. I was having a difficult time taking my @NUM3 off the trailer because it was too heavy, and my dad was still riding his @NUM3 somewhere on the ranch. When my dad finally got back, my brother went to go ride his @NUM3. I was having a very difficult time trying to get everything organized and leave, but finally, my mom and sister wanted to leave too, so they finally helped me. With their help, we were able to load everything up quickly and start our journey home. This experience made me realize that sometimes waiting patiently pays off, and teamwork can make difficult tasks easier.
899	18831	7	3	It was @DATE1 in @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2. My cousin, @LOCATION3, and I were going up the street to the carnival they were having. We were looking forward to a fun - filled day. When we got there, it was raining, and only one of the rides was open. So we sat around under a small shelter, chatting and waiting till all of them were open. We went on all of them, but I wouldn't go on one. It was called the Freak Out. There were lights flickering and loud, intense music playing. We were in the line for it, but I got out. @CAPS4 said, “Why did you get out of line?” “I am scared,” I replied. “I want to go on it though,” @CAPS4 said. “@CAPS1, can you wait till later?” I asked. We waited for an hour. I sat on the bench, feeling a bit left out, and @CAPS4 said, “@CAPS1, can we go on the ride now?” “@CAPS2, let's @CAPS1,” I said, even though my heart was pounding so hard I could hear it. That's when @CAPS4 said, “I'll wait.” “@CAPS3, let's get it over with,” I finally said. @CAPS4 was really nice to wait till I was ready to go on. In conclusion, my cousin is the nicest for waiting. On the up side, I love that ride now, and it was all thanks to my cousin's patience.
900	18832	7	3	Have you ever been patient before? Well, I have. I was sitting there in a nice, warm, and cozy seat, exhausted and dozing off, waiting for them to call @PERSON1. The name @PERSON1 kept going through my mind like a broken record, @PERSON1, @PERSON1, @PERSON1, but nothing ever happened. So I just sat there waiting patiently. My mom was sitting next to me, quietly reading an Avon magazine that she had picked up from the small, round wooden table centered right in the middle of the silent orthodontist's office. I kept asking myself things like, “I wonder what they're gonna do today. I wonder if I'll get my expander off or what about my top braces?” Then I started to stare at the office ladies typing away on their computers, the clicking of the keys adding to the background noise. The sound of metal tools was ringing in my ear, coming from the back room, making me a bit nervous. A girl walked out, and then I heard “@CAPS1”. I was excited and nervous at the same time, but I was proud because I had sat there the whole time patiently. This experience taught me that patience is a virtue, especially when waiting for something important.
901	18833	7	3	ëPatienceí  @CAPS1 were on our way to the big city, to go to a very special baseball game. Can you guess what game? Itís the ì@LOCATION1 tigers,î at the @CAPS3 stadium. ì@CAPS1 were so excited, it was the first time @CAPS1 had ever been in @LOCATION1. ì@CAPS5 much longer till @CAPS1 get there?î I asked. ìAbout @NUM1 hour, why?î my mom replied. ìBecause it's so boring sitting here for four hours straight.î ìI know, but you have to be patient.î ìFine,î I thought in my head. ìI wonder how long I could be patient for.î I just thought for a moment. Then a minute passed, then boom! I was out cold: for two hours I slept. Then I woke up just as @CAPS1 hit traffic. I asked ìare @CAPS1 there yet?î ìHope so,î my dad said. So I sat there waiting patiently. About @NUM2 min later I asked if @CAPS1 could turn on the radio. ìSure,î my mom said. @CAPS1 sat there for about @NUM3 min. Then @CAPS1 finally started moving. I tried not to be annoying, thinking about what I was going to do when I got to the game. I was thinking maybe Iíll get a bit expensive snack. But by the time I thought anything else I heard ìwe're here!î ìYay!î I screamed. So @CAPS1 got out of the car and walked about a @NUM4 of a mile to the ticket booth. As @CAPS1 were walking up I thought ìI guess all it does take is patience.î
902	18834	7	3	Two weeks ago, me and my family went to Six Flags, for Fright Fest. The lines were going to be long and I would never be patient, I hate being patient. We went on @LOCATION1 city @CAPS1 first. The line was only ten minutes. Then we went on the Superman, that one was a little longer. Me and my sister got permission to leave and go on the Riper. Then there was the Perisa wooden rollercoaster that goes off the track a lot. We waited @NUM1 minutes between each stop. We finally got to where we board the coaster. People with these flash passes kept coming. The flash pass takes you to the front of the line. When we finally got to the front of the line, my patience was wearing thin. The roller coaster went off the track. It was a @NUM2 mile coaster but a thrilling one. That is the time I was patient. It turned out to be a really fun experience in the end.
903	18835	7	3	One day, last year I had to be really patient. My mom had told the family that we would be going to Six Flags soon. I was filled with excitement and I couldnít wait, so I asked her when and she said she didnít know yet. This made me upset because last time she said that about going somewhere, we ended up not going. The only thing that I knew for sure was that it had to be on a @DATE1 because she works during the week. I was just happy that school was finally out so I didnít have to worry about homework. So I waited until @DATE2 and then asked my mom if we could go that @DATE1. She said no because we would have to plan it more and that we couldnít randomly go one @DATE1. That @DATE1 I bugged her every day until she finally started planning it. The first thing she did was look at her work schedule to make sure she didnít have any meetings or projects for the coming @DATE1. My stomach dropped when she told me that she had stuff to do, so she kept looking at her schedule. The next free @DATE1 she had was two weeks away. I was okay with it though because thatís better than nothing. Throughout the next two weeks I saved money up for Six Flags. When the two weeks were finally over, I had about @MONEY1 saved up and I was practically bouncing off the walls because I was so excited. I think that was the most patient I have ever been, and it was all worth it in the end.
904	18836	7	3	Patience is waiting without complaining to do something you want to do. When I was at an outdoor mall with my mom, two older sisters, younger brother, niece, and dog, I waited patiently to go to the @ORGANIZATION1 store to try out the iPad. When I did, I realized that the iPad is awesome! Afterward, we went to get ice cream. My little brother got a root beer flavored slushie, my niece, dog, and I got vanilla ice cream. After I finished my ice cream, I put the container on the ground and let my dog lick the rest from the bottom. We had spent @NUM1 hours there! What a surprise! Then we went home, with me still thinking about how cool the iPad was and how patience had allowed me to have that experience.
905	18837	7	3	One time when @PERSON1 was patient was when @CAPS1 & I taught him how to pitch. @PERSON1 easily developed a nice windup and delivery but the arm angle was off. But this didnít stop him. @CAPS1 asked him if he wanted to stop but @PERSON1 said ìno!î As time went on, @PERSON1 started to get better and better. He now enjoys throwing @NUM1 mph fastball at a catcher. On days that heís inaccurate, he doesn't give up. He keeps trying and doesn't whine. @PERSON1 is now the number two starter in the rotation. Thanks to some self - discipline and patience, @PERSON1 has achieved this great position in the team, and it shows that patience truly pays off.
906	18839	7	3	"One of the many times I was patient was when my mom, my dad and I went to a restaurant. We ordered our food and found a table. We were sitting there waiting patiently for the food. I asked my mom ""How much longer is it going to take?"" She said ""you have to be patient and wait"". And then a little after that, our food was done. It was totally worth it as the delicious meal made the wait all worthwhile."
907	18840	7	3	About three or four times I was patient; it was when I was five and it was my birthday. My grandmother went shopping for me and I had to be patient and wait for her to come back with my presents. I sat in my room, looking at the empty spot where the presents would soon be. The other time was when I was 8 and it was Christmas day. I was up super early and ready to be patient once again and wait for my dad to wake up so I could open my presents. I lay in bed, trying to contain my excitement. Then the other time was when my friend had to do something so I had to be patient again. I sat on the bench, watching the people go by until he got back. This will conclude my being patient paper, showing that patience is a virtue I've learned to practice in different situations.
908	18841	7	3	"The time I was patient was when we went to the beach. ""Mom!"" I exclaimed. ""It's time to go! I'm packed and ready to go."" Mom and I were in the house packing everyone's things. It was a beautiful sunny day in Florida and it was also Mom's step - dad's birthday. ""Honey, you need to be patient okay. We have a long drive. Do you have everything you need?"" I got to work gathering things. I had to get coloring materials, the portable CD player, etc. I carefully thought about what else we needed until Mom's stomach growled. It sounded like a bear protecting its cubs, fierce and starving. Then I remembered, ding, I thought in my head, food that's what I need to get. So I rushed into the kitchen like a race car trying to win a race. I packed turkey sandwiches, pb&j sandwiches, chips - salt and vinegar, sour cream and onion (crunchy) and jalapeno cheddar (yum). Now I have everything I thought, ""Let's go."" I told Mom and again I rushed out the door. ""Got the address?"" asked Mom's father. ""Yes, I got it."" As we started to go, Mom's sister fell asleep. She was sleeping like a rock the whole way there although, I don't think rocks snore. After 3 hours of being awake in the car, I thought maybe I should try to sleep, but the excitement was rushing so fast I could feel it. Then I fell asleep. I thought I would be able to stay awake the whole way but it was marked impossible. Finally, Mom's step - father yelled ""Wake up!!"" I was so tired when I woke up. ""Are we there yet?"" was the first thing that came out of my mouth. ""Yeah"" and, of course, the first thing I did was jump up and out of the car! ""Wait!"" Mom shouted. I paused as if I was a character in a video game and the player pressed pause. ""You can take in some of the bags."" ""Fine"" I said with a scowl on my face. ""Remember you have to be patient"" As I took in the bag, there it was - the condo of my dreams and the first thing I did was sleep, ending our long but exciting journey."
909	18842	7	3	"Being patient isn't always that easy. In fact, last year was one year where I had to sit in a car with 3 rude, screaming and crying kids for 5 hours. Last year I was so excited to see my great - aunt Dawn in California with my grandpa. My grandpa is fun to talk to, but later I found out my 3 younger cousins were coming. This was going to be a long car ride. We packed our things in the car. I brought my iPod and a book, while my cousins brought some loud, noisy and flashy toys they bought just for the ride. As we started heading for California, I turned my iPod on and found out it only had 10% battery left. Half - way there I was almost dead of boredom, while the kids were just settling down. When I was sure they were asleep I decided to join them. WACK! I awoke with a sudden slap to the face. ""We're here!"" my cousin exclaimed. Finally, I said to myself as I was still waking up with a sore and stiff neck. After we were done visiting my great - aunt, it was about 4 hours later and my cousins were all asleep again. I knew it was going to be a nice and peaceful ride home, making up for the long and noisy journey there."
910	18843	7	3	"@CAPS1 be @CAPS3! It will be here soon, don't worry,"" @CAPS2 said calmly. A patient person experiences difficulties without complaining. Well, over these few days (which feels like an eternity) I have not been this so - called ""@CAPS3"" person. Halloween was coming in a few days and my costume still didn't come in the mail. I've been waiting and waiting but @CAPS5 @CAPS1 too long! For the fifth time I watch the little red hand on the clock go around slowly. They said it would come @DATE1 but it didn't. ""I've been sitting here since ten o'clock. Where is the @CAPS4 track!"" I scream in frustration. Then I glance at the clock @NUM1. What! It feels like an hour! How can someone bear to wait this long! ""@CAPS5 coming,"" I say to myself in a hopeful tone. A few hours later I see a little white @CAPS6 - @CAPS7 truck wander along the street. (@CAPS8 that's it!) I lean forward to gaze. Nope, it keeps going past. I sigh then drag myself down the steps. ""@CAPS10!"" I sob in agony, ""why does this feeling consume me like this?"" I stroll to the kitchen and a brown box is on the counter. I get giddy as I take giant sneaky steps to it. ""@CAPS5 here! @CAPS5 here!"" I yelp as I hop up and down. Finally! I open the box to find my amazing Halloween costume, making all the waiting worth it."
911	18844	7	3	"There was a day when I was being extremely patient and I was so nice. This girl was in a state of such agitation that she was really getting on my nerves. She pushed me and started hitting me. So, I simply let her go in front of me. We were in @CAPS1, and there were a lot of people there. A lady said, ""Stop pushing her."" Then we went into the class. I raised my hand, and she said, ""Be patient."" I replied, ""I am being patient, so shut up, please."" But she didn't shut up. Another time I raised my hand, and the teacher called on me. As a result, she got mad at me. This experience showed me that sometimes being patient doesn't always make others appreciate it."
912	18845	7	3	I am going to write about the time that I was patient. One day, after my family and I returned from church, I asked my mom if she could make breakfast. However, she didn't answer me because she was on the phone with my grandma, and my grandma loves to talk a great deal. It was so frustrating. For example, I kept pacing back and forth restlessly in the kitchen but then I decided to just sit down quietly. After an hour of patiently waiting, my mom and grandma finally said goodbye and hung up the phone. At last, I got my breakfast. This incident taught me that patience is indeed a virtue when dealing with such situations.
913	18847	7	3	"One day, it was about @NUM1 o'clock. My mom woke me, my brother, and my dad to get ready. I don't know exactly what we were getting ready for, but we got on the road as soon as we could. I fell back asleep in the car while we were on the highway. I woke up from a big jolt when the driver hit the brakes hard. When I looked up, we were in a long line of cars. ""Where are we?"" I asked. ""Six Flags,"" replied my brother. I could hear impatient people all around me. They were shouting and yelling as people tried to pay their way into the park. It seemed like we were moving faster than most of the impatient people, and we were one of the first people to get in. That was the most impatient group of people I'd ever seen, and it made me realize the importance of staying calm in such situations."
914	18848	7	3	"Pg @NUM1: Hearing her crying! I just desperately wanted to get out of the car and walk home. There were @NUM2 of us crammed into a suburban, all smushed together so tightly that we couldn't even move our arms. I felt like I was locked in jail with heavy chains on me. It was @NUM3 o'clock in the morning, and I saw a big sign that clearly read ""Welcome to @CAPS2."" So at that point, we only had about an hour or so left of the journey. I was so excited. We finally reached our destination, Key West. It was the longest trip of my life! But I tried my hardest to stay patient and just wait. In the long run, I realized that it didn't matter because I had a whole weekend of enjoying the waves and a temperature of @NUM4∞@CAPS3 degrees ahead of me. When I thought about how long it took to get here, I didn't even want to think about how long it would take to get home! But I know I have the patience to make it back home. This trip tested my patience but also rewarded me with a great vacation."
915	18849	7	3	A time when I was patient was just yesterday. I had just finished part @NUM1 of the test and I was extremely anxious. I really wanted to get up and move around, but we were taking the @CAPS1 exam, so I couldn't. Instead, I entertained myself in any possible way. I pretended to be a singer, running songs through my head repeatedly. I even started twiddling my thumbs. Finally, she let us get up and talk. I was sitting next to some of my friends, so I started talking to them. Somehow, we got into a conversation about Dungeons and Dragons. They kept asking me what class they would be and what those classes were. Anyway, I kept trying to talk, but I kept getting interrupted. So I just relaxed and patiently waited for my turn. Finally, it was my turn to talk, but then we had to go to lunch, so I never did get to say what my class was. This experience clearly shows that there are times when we have to be patient and wait for our chance to express ourselves.
916	18851	7	3	Have you ever got annoyed because someone kept saying be patient? I have and I'm gonna tell you about the time I was patient. One time I was on my way to a particular destination (@LOCATION1), the plane ride wasn't as bad as what I'm gonna tell you. When I got to a border area related to @PERSON1, I had to pass through @PERSON1's border. It was extremely hot!!! I think the temperature hit @NUM2 degrees. I had to wait in this small room with about @NUM3 people, and they had no air - conditioning. All of us were waiting for the bus to come, and after @NUM4 hours a bus arrived. I was getting on as about @NUM5 people came barging in front, so I missed that bus. Then I waited again for a bus and after @NUM6 hours a bus arrives again. I was trying to get on then again I got pushed out of the way. So I missed that bus. I was really frustrated and so did my family. Another thing I got frustrated at was there were thousands of flies all over the place. I waited after @NUM4 more hours a bus arrives but my little brother was in the bathroom, so I missed that bus. My mom was telling me to calm down and be patient. I stayed patient until the @NUM8 th bus came, I got on but the bus didn't go where I was supposed to. I had to go back to the same place I was in, but again my mom says stay patient. One of the officers over at the place saw how long I was waiting. Once the next bus arrived after @NUM9 hours and @NUM10 minutes he held everybody else up and let me and my family get on, and told the driver “take them by themselves”. I had the bus to ourselves, and you know what it was all worth it as I finally reached my intended journey.
917	18852	7	3	There was a time when I had to wait on handling my personal business. My sisters and I came into the house and one of them went to handle her personal business while I was being patient to not barge in and knock hard on the door. Telling her (@ORGANIZATION1 or @CAPS1) to finish up in whatever she was doing. By the way @ORGANIZATION1 is @NUM1 years old and @CAPS1 is @NUM2 years old. I had waited and waited, being very patient not to be impatiently saying “finish up”. I really had to handle my personal business, something like that. It felt good to be very patient rather than being an impatient person because think about when if you really have to handle something in the bathroom or restroom, people will think you are a rude person instead of a patient one. Anyway, they might talk about it to anyone they know as a bad thing when they are just talking about anything. In the end, this is not a time where we can't wait patiently for others. Patience in such situations shows our good - mannered side.
918	18853	7	3	Patience in @MONTH1 may seem easy but, however, it can be hard. Waiting in line, waiting for @CAPS1 etc. all requires patience. Everyone, no matter how young or old has patience just like I did when I was in @NUM1 grade. Each day I wonder if it's a dream or a nightmare. Everyday when I was in @NUM1 grade I always wanted something that would change my life eternally. After @NUM3 year that wish would finally come true. I was very patient waiting for our letter to be granted or denied. Before I knew it my mom, dad, and I were on a plane headed straight for China. There we would see the great wall, the magnificent forbidden city, and @LOCATION1 not to mention our main purpose to adopt a little sister. I had no idea what I was in for. I was patient for @NUM4 weeks then we went to the lobby and she was with her caregiver along with all the other families waiting for their child too. I couldn't believe we were the @NUM5 ones to receive our gift from China. BIG SURPRISE! The moment my mom tried to take her she started wailing, pinching, kicking, and who knows what else. After an hour or so she calmed down and she calmly played with her toys and such. That night we went out for dinner at @ORGANIZATION1. My dad ordered a milkshake and he let her have some of it that was also a treat. He did not get it back until the glass was empty. We soon learned that she would be a roller - coaster with her ups and downs. She loved cake and ice cream and wanted dad only. It was dad's dream come true. In conclusion, you will use patience everyday no matter how big or small. Patience will work its way into your life no matter how hard it is. Everyone has patience, the question is, “will you use it?” and when used, it can bring wonderful rewards.
919	18854	7	3	A person I know that's patient is my dad. He is very patient. Like one time we were in the drive - through at McDonald's. As soon as we pulled up the lady was like just one second and then we ended up sitting there for @NUM1 minutes. I was seeing myself getting out of the car and going in the restaurant and ordering my food but my dad he just sat there, adjusting the car's settings until the lady came back. I was so mad that the lady made us sit there for @NUM2 minutes, but then I was happy cause I got my food. Then when we were leaving, my dad said see that's why patience pays off. I got my double cheeseburger and my large ice tea with chocolate chip cookies. My dad taught me a valuable lesson that impatience only brings nothing but drama and not happiness. By being patient, we can avoid unnecessary stress and still get what we want.
920	18855	7	3	The time I had to be patient was when I had to wait in line to ride “shoot the @CAPS1” at @CAPS2 point. First, @CAPS2 point was fun but waiting in line took patience. We had to wait in line for about a half hour. Some people kept leaving because it was too long of a wait. I had to stay patient if I wanted to ride the ride. Second, I was extremely excited to ride the roller - coaster so I stayed in line. Staying patient was a little hard when people were pushing and cutting in line but it was worth it when I got to ride. As you can see sometimes it's good to stay patient because when you get to do something fun it's definitely worth it. When people push you, you just have to stay calm and be patient. In the end, the patience I showed allowed me to enjoy the thrilling ride and made the whole experience more memorable.
921	18856	7	3	I'm always extremely patient. I'm really, truly patient until my birthday. Then, when I get presents, I don't need to be patient anymore because I've waited a whole year for those presents. And then I wait for @CAPS1 because it's only about a month away from my birthday. This year, I'm being patient until @CAPS1 because I already know what I'm getting. But that's pretty much all I'm patient for; for just about nothing else am I patient.
922	18857	7	3	Patience means being understanding and tolerant, showing empathy towards others' situations and being able to endure delays calmly. I find patience difficult to come by, just like many other people. Some people are graced with the gift of patience. Those people find it easy to wait, even when it's the night the finale of your favorite book series comes out. “@CAPS1 @CAPS2” the clock taunted me by moving slower than ever. Why @CAPS10 wasn't back yet I didn't know. All I knew was that something very bad was going to happen that night. It must have been the unbearable heat getting to me because when the door slammed shut, @CAPS10 argued that @CAPS4'd only been gone for five fast minutes. I didn't believe her, but we climbed into the car and drove down the twisty, turning road. We had timed our car ride perfectly to see red lights at every stoplight. It was like the lights were mad at us. We also got stuck behind every slow person with no way to get around them. Just as I had a scream budding inside me, we saw a green light and cruised into @LOCATION1. Coming up on @CAPS8 right came the book store and @CAPS8 jitters became more uncontrollable. I bounced up and down like I was on a trampoline and stopped the split second I saw the line in front of us. “@CAPS3!” I shouted, “I don't have any patience left to wait in this monstrosity of a line. It was like the whole town was in on making me as annoyed as possible. I lugged the lawn chairs from our van to wait in line. “Flop” I fell into the black chair and waited. This was going to be a long night. “@NUM1 minutes till midnight” @CAPS8 @CAPS10 explained to me. “That's impossible” I told her. “You can make it.” @CAPS4 was right, @NUM1 minutes wasn't that long of a wait. I breathed in the smell of coffee coming from inside and listened to the hum of chatter among the people. The @NUM1 minutes would be over soon, and for the first time that night I was patient. “@CAPS5” the seatbelt went into place and I cracked open the final book of the @CAPS6 @CAPS7 trilogy. What will happen? How is it going to end? @CAPS8 mind was full of questions. “@CAPS9 was that wait really that bad?” @CAPS10 asked. “I guess not” I answered sheepishly. “Being patient paid off” @CAPS10 lectured. I didn't reply; I was already reading a mile a minute. I learned that being patient really does pay off and not complaining makes life a lot easier. Patience is understanding and now that I'm a little better at being patient, things will be a lot better.
923	18858	7	3	One time I was patient because the teacher had to tell me something important. So I waited by the door, shifting my weight from one foot to the other. But then she had to go to the office, so I had to wait some more. When the teacher came back, she told me thanks for being patient. Patience really means you have to be able to wait calmly. Some kids don't have patience; they get so mad. For example, there were @NUM1 kids in one group and we were playing a game. They would get so mad because they didn't get called on a lot. But the game was random; you pick a stick and whoever's stick it was went. So being patient means you have to be able to wait without getting angry or frustrated.
924	18859	7	3	Patience is the quality of someone who likes waiting for someone or something. It's an essential part of life. I sometimes don't have patience, but I should. Without patience, you won't achieve certain things because in life, there are times when you have to wait, and that is why you should cultivate patience. By having patience, we can handle difficult situations better and enjoy a more peaceful life.
925	18860	7	3	“@CAPS1 go!” I yelled excitedly while running to the entrance of @CAPS2 @CAPS3. “@CAPS4 a minute, you got to @CAPS4 for your friend,” my mom said calmly. As I stopped to @CAPS4 for my mom, my best friend @PERSON1 and @CAPS5 brother @PERSON2, I started to kick the rocks to keep me occupied, watching them scatter across the ground. Once they finally caught up to me, we walked into the huge theme park, looking around in awe at the bright lights and colorful attractions. “@CAPS1 go to the top @CAPS7 @CAPS8,” I said hysterically, practically jumping up and down with anticipation. “@CAPS9, we can go on it, but me and @PERSON1 are staying in the back,” my mom said firmly. “@CAPS10 because me and @PERSON3 are going in the front row!” @PERSON2 yelled enthusiastically. As we started to walk to the line, it said that it would be a @NUM1 minute wait for us to go. After we got in line, I thought to myself, wow, this is a long line. It wasn't that much longer before we finally got to the rollercoaster ride. “@CAPS11!” the belt buckle sounded when we all got in the rollercoaster. “@CAPS12!” everybody said when we took off. After that, I told myself that I can be patient and that waiting was worth it for the amazing experience.
926	18861	7	3	@PERSON2 and I went to the store. @CAPS1 was picking up some marshmallows and chocolate to make s'mores. @CAPS1 was walking around the store when @CAPS1 came upon a huge bunch of people looking to buy stuff for s'mores. So @PERSON2 and I went in the line. @CAPS1 sat there for at least fifty minutes waiting for marshmallows and chocolate; but @CAPS1 came out with two marshmallows and two chocolate packs. I asked her, “@PERSON2, why do you have two?” @CAPS1 said that when I waited, they were getting rid of them so they gave me two for the price of one. I smiled and we left the store. Thank you! When we went back to the car, we told @CAPS2, our other sister, “@PERSON1,” that we got two. @NUM1 said something. @CAPS2, our sister, snickered. We went back into @PERSON2’s car and put the bag in the trunk where one other thing was, and then took off. We got home and @PERSON1 ate three, I ate two, and @PERSON2 ate five. @CAPS1 joined us. Thank you.
927	18862	7	3	Today I'm going to write about a friend of mine who is very patient. My friend's name is @CAPS1 @CAPS2. She is a very patient and pleasant girl. @CAPS1 is so patient that when I told her to hold on for a second, there I came back an hour later and she was still there. She is absolutely the most patient and the most awesome girl I know! On tests (like @CAPS3.E.A.P), she always takes her time. And she uses her time wisely (ha ha, and her last name is @CAPS2). At the @ORGANIZATION1, she doesn't wait in a long line for a corn dog. Now I'm starting to think that @CAPS1 enjoys waiting. I love having @CAPS1 around because she doesn't mind waiting for me when I have to do something. Having a patient friend like @CAPS1 makes my life easier and more enjoyable.
928	18863	7	3	Patience is understanding and tolerance, experiencing different things without complaining. I will tell you about a time when I was patient. “I'm gonna tell your mom that you broke the hole in the wall,” @CAPS1 said. “You don't buy me this,” @CAPS2 yelled. That is an example of blackmail, one of the many things you have to be patient with in your life. @CAPS2 is a six - year - old girl that I baby - sit. One day she was at my house. We were playing a game that involved kicking a shoe into a wall. When it was my turn, I kicked the shoe into the wall literally. My mom came home and I told her the boys did that. Of course, she believed me. But the one thing I had to deal with was that there was a witness. The six - year - old that can't keep a secret. I told her not to tell my mom because if she did, I would get in big trouble and she would not be able to come over anymore. We went to the store and she discovered the glory of blackmail. She said she would tell my mom if I didn't buy her ice - cream. It was a long day. I refused to buy her ice - cream so she told my mom. My mom didn't care. In the end, I was patient through this whole ordeal and learned that patience can help deal with difficult situations.
929	18864	7	3	Applause filled the building after the first dance ended. I was backstage with my dance team going over the routine for the third time. Backstage was cold and crowded, and I was already sweaty after one practice! This was my first dance recital and I thought the whole thing would take an hour. I was wrong. I soon found out that we were the last to perform and it was at least five hours long. “@CAPS1, how many more dances?” and “what dance are we on?” were what everyone had on their mind or was saying. Every hour felt like a day! I had so many emotions going on: excited, bored, and nervous. Then finally it was our turn to get on stage. I was so relieved after all that waiting that it was finally our turn! I did twirls and jumps and leaps and had a great time! I had an amazing time dancing. Great things take patience, and this experience truly taught me the value of waiting patiently for something wonderful.
930	18865	7	3	One boring old rainy afternoon, I asked my mom to take me to a place called Modern. If you don't know what that is, I'll tell you. Well, Modern is a place I love it. It has everything I love, a skate park, money - related activities (like a snack bar maybe), and other cool stuff. I went there with my mom. I told her she doesn't have to stay but she insisted she stayed. So she stood there while I skated for @NUM1 hour, and watched me, cheered me on, and even got me a new board. My mom is the most patient person I have ever met. Her patience allowed me to have a great time at Modern, and I'm really grateful to have such a patient mom in my life.
931	18868	7	3	"Being patient is a great trait to have. When you are patient, you are respected by others. That is why I have a lot of respect for my teacher, @PERSON1. @PERSON1 is a very patient person. If you didn't understand something, she will work through it with you until you understand, even if it takes a couple of weeks. One time, she was teaching us how to add negative numbers and I didn't understand. She worked with me until I understood. She was very patient. Let me tell you what happened. ""Class, today we are going to add negative numbers,"" she said. ""This is going to be a breeze,"" I thought silently to myself. Little did I know I would not know what to do at all and my teacher was going to have to be very patient with me. When my teacher was done explaining the rules to adding negative numbers, I was already lost. ""Here are some sample problems that everyone needs to try,"" said my teacher. A few minutes later, she went to every student and checked their answers. When she got to me, she had a worried expression on her face. ""Is everything all right? You didn't do your sample problems,"" she asked me. ""I don't understand,"" I replied. My teacher fell silent for a moment and then she said, ""Come see me after class."" So I waited until the end of the day and then went to see her. ""I noticed you were having trouble with math today,"" said my teacher. ""We're gonna fix that."" My teacher sat down with me and explained what to do in steps. After about twenty minutes of her explaining to me how to do it, I finally began to pick it up. A few minutes later, I was doing it. ""You can go now,"" said my teacher. ""You now understand it better than the other students."" ""Thanks for being so patient with me,"" I said before I left. My teacher just smiled. That was a time when my teacher was very patient with me. And I am glad that she was, as it really helped me learn."
932	18870	7	3	"Whistle, whistle, that was the sound of the soccer refs blowing their whistle for subs. (I was playing defense.) The coach was calling my name to take me off. When I got off the field, I got my water bottle and sat on the bench. I sat there for a while, subbed in until finally I asked my coach if I could go in. His response was, ""You just got off."" In my mind, I was thinking that I had been off for almost ten minutes now, how could I have just come off. So I waited a few more minutes to ask again. When he finally put me in, when I got on the field, I realized I was on the side that the ball had barely touched all game. I played for around five minutes then got subbed again. I was on the bench even longer this time. I was losing my patience. I asked my coach if I could go back in, he said sure. When the game was over, I realized why my coach benched me so much of the game because he likes @LOCATION1 wolverines and I was wearing a state tattoo on my face. This is a time I was patient, and although it was tough, I learned the importance of following the coach's decisions."
933	18871	7	3	This is a time when I was patient. A time when I was patient was when my mom went to go buy me a new pair of shoes. My mom was buying me some new pair of shoes because I haven't had a new pair of shoes in months. I was very patient knowing that my mom would get me a new pair of shoes. I know when my mom has some money, and I need something new, she gets it. I was waiting patiently for my mom, sitting quietly in my room, looking at the empty shoe rack. I had confidence that my mom would buy me the shoes. Then I heard a knock on the door, I opened the door, and it was my mom standing there with my new pair of shoes. I was really happy, and it made me realize that being patient can lead to good things.
934	18872	7	3	"Real @CAPS3 was one of the fastest runners in @LOCATION1. No one could catch him, beat him in a race, or even sneak up on him. This made him very impatient. Even when his friends and family spoke to him, it seemed like they were speaking in slow motion to him. ""How...are...You...doing?"" they would say. @CAPS3 was furious with the fact that no one was as fast as he was. So he ran away. He ran as fast as possible. It only took him @NUM1 minutes and he was already in @LOCATION2. In @LOCATION2, he found that people didn't walk as fast as he could. But that didn't stop them from talking slowly. ""For sure, where can I find...nement @CAPS6?"" he asked. The @CAPS7 responded, ""Turn...first...you...best..."" @CAPS3 screamed. He had to believe that no one was as fast as he was. So he just had to be patient and try to understand them. Eventually, he learned that patience could help him get along better with others in this new place."
935	18873	7	3	"Ah, patience. I know a lot of people have trouble being patient. Let me tell you a story about me being patient. I remember when last year when I was @NUM1, @CAPS1 went on a trip up @CAPS2 to go fishing for a week. It was a two - hour drive straight. I was really excited. @CAPS1 left at exactly six that morning. I was happier than a lark to go on this trip as @CAPS1 hit the highway. I was so excited that I was fidgeting in my seat. I was ready to get out. My dad said, ""Don't worry bud, we will get there soon. Let's calm down, okay buddy."" I was quite restless at first but then I tried to relax the rest of the way. I was just waiting to see what our camp site looked like, waiting patiently. Finally, @CAPS1 finally got there. That was when I learned to be patient, and it made the start of our fishing trip even more enjoyable."
936	18874	7	3	@PERSON1 is a young boy with a bladder as small as that of a squirrel. He's waiting in line for the bathroom at the super @CAPS1. The line seems to move at a snail's pace, but @PERSON1 said to himself, ''patience, something good always comes from being patient''. So he waited patiently for his turn. @PERSON1 was right in the middle of the line, standing behind five people. Ahead of him, there were six people all doing the pee - pee dance, clearly in a hurry. Since he learned to be polite in school, he kindly let the six people go ahead of him. Ten minutes later, @PERSON1 finally entered the bathroom, and to his surprise, he found a one - hundred - dollar bill on the floor. @PERSON1 knew more about the 'finders keepers' rule than being overly polite in this situation, so he took it. From this experience, @PERSON1 learned that being polite and patient is indeed the right thing to do, and sometimes, it has its sweet rewards.
937	18875	7	3	One time I had to be patient was when me and three other of my close friends were hanging out at school one sunny day. We were extremely bored, so we all decided to head over to the track and run a mile. Since it's a relay race, the rules were clear: one person goes to run a mile, then the second person starts once the first person is done. After that, the third person takes their turn after the second person finishes their mile. Finally, it was my turn to run a mile because I was the fastest among us at running a mile. As I had to wait until the very end, I had to exercise patience. I watched my friends run, cheering them on, and then finally, it was my time to dash around the track. This experience taught me the value of patience in a group activity.
938	18876	7	3	Patience is a virtue that not all of us naturally possess. It is hard to learn the art of patience, but it is even more difficult to master it completely. There is always a good time to use your patience, whether it's in daily life when waiting in a long queue, or in more challenging situations like dealing with difficult people. By exercising patience, we can avoid unnecessary stress and make wiser decisions. In the end, learning and mastering patience can lead to a more peaceful and fulfilling life.
939	18877	7	3	When I went to the @CAPS1 conly @ORGANIZATION2 for the youth group at my church, I took some of my friends along. In the maze, we had to go as a group. There were @CAPS2 people in each group, and my group consisted of me, my dad, @PERSON1, and @CAPS3. @ORGANIZATION1 and @CAPS4 were in the group behind us. Half - way through the @CAPS5 @ORGANIZATION2, there was a guy chasing us with a chain saw, creating a tense and scary atmosphere. Then, @PERSON1 accidentally smacked my glasses off my face. So, we had to stop that part of the @ORGANIZATION2 to find my glasses. Just before we found them, my friends in the @CAPS6 group came and had to wait @NUM1 minutes, which seemed like an eternity. As a result, they didn't get the chance to get chased by the guy with the chainsaw. This made for an interesting and somewhat unexpected experience in the maze.
940	18878	7	3	My story about being patient is the time I had to wait in line for @NUM1 hour and @NUM2 minutes to get on the, ì@CAPS1 of @CAPS2î, which is this really cool and thrilling ride. As soon as I got in line, I knew it would be a long wait, so the first thing I did was try to strike up a conversation with the people around me. I politely said ìhiî to the couple in front of me. We started chatting, and it turns out that they had come down south from @PERSON1, @LOCATION1, which is really close to @LOCATION2 where I live. It seemed so weird being in @LOCATION3 and meeting people who lived right across our town. As we talked about our hometowns and shared stories, time seemed to fly by. Before I knew it, we were getting strapped in our seats, and with a rush of excitement, away we goooooo. This wait in line taught me that patience can be made more bearable by making connections with others.
941	18879	7	3	You @MONTH1 have surely heard before: patience is a virtue. If you don’t know already, being patient means you are understanding and tolerant, able to calmly handle difficult situations. The opposite of this is probably having a temper, or having a @CAPS1 very short time before you get @CAPS1 extremely angry. I firmly believe having patience in life is @CAPS1 incredibly important, and I make a conscious effort to have patience every day. I believe that life is a marathon, not a sprint, and by this I mean if something takes time, you have lots. I related life to sports because I am a @CAPS1 really good athlete. I play football, which also requires lots of patience. When I make a good pass and my receiver drops it, I remember to have patience with him, just as my coach did with me when I made mistakes. Football is a team game, and we all have to have patience with each other. Although sports are a great example, patience goes much further than that. You must have patience with yourself before you can have patience with others. And what do I mean by that? Whether you’re a kid or an adult, you must forgive yourself when you do wrong. If you come in late for work, you must brush it off and say to yourself, “@CAPS2, don’t do it again.” Make sure that you forget about everything but what you just said. And once again I go back to sports. If you lose a game, you look at the film, realize what you did wrong, and don’t make those mistakes again. Then, you forget about the loss and concentrate on winning the next game. I believe patience is one of the most important virtues a person can have, as it helps us navigate through life's challenges with grace and resilience.
942	18880	7	3	"Have you ever been patient or been told you're patient? Patience is a @NUM1 - year - old girl who is always told how patient she @CAPS1 is. This is one of many stories about patience being very patient. One sunny day, patience really wanted to go to the most amazing amusement park in Juancey. So her mom started to look it up on the internet. It took her mom two weeks to get everything ready. She had the amusement park picked out, the money to go, and the hotel they were going to stay at @TIME1. The whole time, patience said nothing and just waited quietly without asking her mom if she had everything planned yet or if she was still taking her to the amusement park. When they got to the hotel, Patience's mom had to get the room key, get to their room, unpack, and get dressed to go. The whole time, Patience didn't say a word. When they finally got to the amusement park, there was a long, long line to get tickets so they had to wait for two hours. The whole time, patience did not complain at all. They finally got their tickets and picked the biggest roller coaster to go on first. But there was a long, long line for that too. Patience told her mom she really wanted to go on this ride and wanted to wait in line. Her mom said ""ok"" and they waited for an hour until they got to go on it. But all the waiting was worth it. Patience was patient through all the waiting and in the end went on all the roller coasters and had a great deal of fun. That is Patience's story of being patient. I hope you liked it, as it shows the rewards of being patient."
943	18881	7	3	A time when I was patient is when I play volleyball. I'm patient when I play volleyball because when you don't score points, you don't get to serve. One game, we weren't doing so well and I really wanted to serve because my overhand serve was doing great that day. Everybody got to serve except me during that match. I watched as my teammates took their turns, but I never let my eagerness show. In the end, our team ended up winning. I never complained one time about not being able to serve. Everybody cheered and chanted because we won by two points. This experience taught me that patience in team sports can lead to collective success, and sometimes, waiting your turn is the best way to contribute to the team.
944	18882	7	3	That's gotta hurt! Every time you have to wait. If you have ever played a contact sport, you know that you get hurt, have to wait for it to get better, and then you can play again. When I sprained my ankle, it hurt a great deal. After I sprained it, I had to go to the doctor. As always, you have to wait forever at the doctor's office, but sometimes it's worth it. Once I got in, the nurse asked me a few questions and then I had to wait even more. It was so frustrating @CAPS1! But at least you eventually find out what's wrong. After the doctors came in, they had to take x - rays which took a while to develop. But I finally got them back and discovered it was only a sprain. After it got all better, my football coach said that I will only be a backup in the game because he doesn't want my ankle to get hurt again. But at the end of the @DATE1 game, he let me play! I guess that's what I got for waiting patiently all game. It shows that patience can often lead to unexpected rewards in sports.
945	18883	7	3	One stormy day, me and my brother were playing soccer in our house. The rain was pounding on the windows as we had a great time. My brother kicked the ball in the air and did a scissors kick. The ball hit my mom’s lamp and broke the bulb. Glass scattered everywhere. She asked me and I said that it was my brother. My mom said that I should fix the lamp. It was really hard as the pieces kept falling off every time I tried to put them together. It took me a great deal of patience to fix it. I carefully picked up each piece, trying not to cut myself. Finally, I managed to fix it. The lamp was shining again. Patience is always good. Being patient helps us solve problems and avoid unnecessary stress, as I learned from this experience of fixing the broken lamp.
946	18884	7	3	"Once upon a time there was a princess named @PERSON1. She was a nice princess, but one day she felt extremely hungry. However, she didn't feel like getting her food herself, so she told her maid to fetch it. But the maid was taking a shower at that time. So @PERSON1 had to wait patiently. She sat in her room, and it seemed like years to her. She read a book, watched @CAPS1.V, and then she went to check if her maid was done. The maid was still not done, and @PERSON1 became impatient and got really mad. She pounded on the door and said, ""You better hurry up or else..."" Then she saw someone out of the corner of her eye. She realized that she had left the light on in the bathroom and nobody was in there. Her maid was right behind her. She was embarrassed and humiliated. So she ran to her room and cried. That is the story of the time the princess was impatient!"
947	18885	7	3	A time when I was patient was when my little sister was in the bath tub for four long hours taking a bath. I was waiting for her to be done because I had something important to do in the bathroom. I could have gotten angry and rushed her, but I decided to be patient. Finally, she finished her bath, and I was glad I had waited calmly.
948	18886	7	3	"Finally, the day was here! The new roller coaster, @CAPS4 Michogg’s Adventure, was opening! I couldn't wait! Only one thing stood in my way to go on the ride, the drive. We crammed ourselves into the old minivan and set off. After @NUM1 minutes, my brother said, ""Are we there yet?"" Finally, we arrived. We waited at the ticket booth for half an hour, then we got in. My brother and sister wanted to go on the kiddy rides, and that took another hour. ""Come on, your older brother wants to go on the big ride,"" my mom said. There it was, the best ride! Only one problem, there were a lot of people lined up. ""It will be worth it,"" I thought. We got in the line and after @NUM2 hours, we got on. When it was over, @NUM3 exclaimed, ""That was awesome! Let's go on it again!"" Then I looked at the line. Twice as many people were lined up. ""At least there won't be as many people on the other rides,"" I said. @NUM3 was very patient to go on the ride, even though it cost us @NUM5 hours. In the end, it was all worth the wait."
949	18887	7	3	One beautiful morning, @CAPS1 went to renew his license. He thought that if he woke up really early, he would be the only one there. But of course, he wouldn't be the only one. Unfortunately, everyone thought the same thing. @CAPS1 was really tired as he woke up at @NUM1 am, but they opened at @NUM2 am and @CAPS1 didn't know that. So @CAPS1 went to the pancake house and got himself a nice hot coffee. When he came back, there was a long line around the corner. But @CAPS1 waited and waited patiently. Finally, he got his license, and his patience was rewarded.
950	18888	7	3	"A time I was patient was when my mom was taking me to my friend @PERSON1's house to play football. It is a long story but I will tell you anyways. It all started when my friend @PERSON1 called me to come play football. So I asked my mom for a ride, and she said ""yes"". When we were driving, my mom had to get a few things from the grocery store. She took a whole hour in there. Then she had to go somewhere else, and that took @NUM1 hours. Then my friend called and said, ""Are you coming or what?"" I said, ""Yes."" I kept my cool and waited patiently. Then I finally got there. It may not be much of a story, but that was the time I was patient, and it made me feel good about myself."
951	18889	7	3	Here I was on @CAPS1 third day of volleyball tryouts. I was absolutely sure I was going to be on the A team. I confidently tossed the ball up and watched as it let @CAPS3 drop back down. However, the toss was no good. I quickly threw @CAPS3 up again, and hit @CAPS3 as hard as I could. “@CAPS1 last serve,” I thought anxiously, “please be over.” I watched intently as the round, white ball soared through the thin air. When @CAPS3 got near the net, it seemed as if gravity suddenly took effect. The ball dropped down and hit the net and rolled off of @CAPS3. @CAPS3 didn't make it over. I felt the cool wind brush against @CAPS1 sweaty face. As the coaches decided what team we would be on, I sat on the damp grass patiently. Finally, they handed me a small, white envelope. I breathed in and out slowly. I could feel @CAPS1 stomach tie into one giant knot. I had been waiting for this moment for months. I nervously reached @CAPS1 sweaty hand into the envelope. I was getting more nervous by the second. I slowly slid the piece of paper out of the envelope. I heard one girl scream in excitement. Finally, I was going to find out whether I was on the A team, @CAPS2 team or getting cut. It felt as if the world depended on it. I felt a rush of relief and excitement when I saw the sight of the word “congratulations.” At the sight of those words, I pulled out the rest of the letter, “you have made the @CAPS2 team.” I suddenly had a feeling of mixed emotions racing through @CAPS1 body. I decided to just be happy. I went around congratulating everyone who had made a team, and hugging the ones who didn't. After all this time I finally knew. It made me happy to know that I tried something and had to wait to know if I succeeded or not. I wouldn't have had it any other way.
952	18890	7	3	@CAPS7 were is my dad? He didn't come home yet, right? “@PERSON1, sweetheart,” @CAPS2 @CAPS7 began gently, “Your father was called out into war.” “@CAPS1!” I ran up to @CAPS2 room, pacing back and forth, saying, “He could have said goodbye. I haven't seen him in two weeks, and now he's gone.” @CAPS2 @CAPS7 walked in and said, “@PERSON1, I know this is hard for you, but you can send him letters.” “I know. I was going to start one now. Same as we,” @CAPS3 she said as she walked out. I wrote a letter saying, “Dad, you could have said goodbye, but you left. Well, I would have waited.” @CAPS4 went past, no sign of a letter from him. Every day I came home from school, I asked @CAPS7, “Any letter for dad?” “No, honey, nothing for you,” @CAPS5. I started to grow up, still no letters. @CAPS2 brothers and sisters got them, but not me. I felt forgotten. “Why have I not gotten a letter from dad, but everyone else did?” she said. “I don't know,” @CAPS3. I would send him a letter every day. I didn't get one letter back. I started to wonder why. Did he hate me? Did he not want to talk to me? Had he forgotten about me? I @CAPS9 @CAPS7 yelled, “@CAPS1!” “You have mail.” I ran down the stairs to the kitchen, and there was something on the counter for me. It had @CAPS2 name on it, and it didn't say who it was from. “@CAPS7, who is it from?” “Open it and find out,” @CAPS3. I slowly took off the letter and started reading. “Don't worry. I have not written to you yet, but maybe this will make it up. I love you more than anything in the world, daddy.” I opened the package, and it was @CAPS2 dad's picture of us and his rucksack with all the letters I sent him, and all of them were unopened. They all had a teller form in all envelopes. And that very night, he called and said, “But, I love you no matter what. Keep loving, say so soon.”
953	18891	7	3	Patience is the ability where you can wait or stay put for someone or something. Some people can be very, very patient, calmly biding their time. But other people have no patience at all. For example, like if you're waiting in line at the store and someone has a lot of things and you're in a bit of a rush. Now, you could be rude and yell at him or her, scream and make all that crazy mess. Or you could wait patiently and maybe she will let you cut in line. That's what patience is to me. It's about choosing the calm and understanding way in situations that test our nerves.
954	18892	7	3	Patience is one of the world's most important life - skills. Having my best friend live across the street is truly great. He has @NUM1 older sister, named @LOCATION1. @LOCATION1 was blessed with Down's syndrome. This basically means she doesn't understand things as fast as you and I. You can also clearly see it from the way she acts. @LOCATION1 is one of the happiest people I have ever met. Knowing @LOCATION1 as well as I do also comes with a downside. You need to be extremely patient. When talking to her, lots of people would quickly give up and leave because she doesn't get it right away. But her closest friends have developed patience like no other kind. Having @LOCATION1 as my neighbor is one of the greatest things that could have happened. She has made me a master at one of the most important life - skills. @LOCATION1 is a wonderful person and, I guess a great teacher. But when you are having a bad day, be grateful because not everyone is as blessed as you. You should cherish your ability to understand things easily and use your patience to help others like @LOCATION1.
955	18894	7	3	It was a hot @DATE1 day in @CAPS1. My family and I went to @ORGANIZATION1. We went on all of the rides with great enthusiasm. Our last one was the @CAPS2 @CAPS3. The line was short when we were walking there, which made us feel excited. Once we got there, the line was all the way to the train. It was like waiting for a pig to fly, so incredibly long. My brother and I had to go to the bathroom. My dad and mom stayed to save our spots. When we got back, my parents were another spot back. “@CAPS4, why are we so far back?” my brother said. My parents got out of line so they could get a drink. Ten families wanted to get in line. We waited and waited until, something spontaneous happened to us. The ten families were in the wrong line, so we got to be in front (behind three other families). My family and I had so much fun on the ride that it was definitely worth waiting. It taught us that sometimes, waiting pays off in the end.
956	18895	7	3	Everyone has to have patience. Everyone has patience; it depends if it's a long - lasting patience or a short - lived one. People always say “Patience is a virtue.” Teachers need a lot of patience for what they do, especially if they are first - grade teachers. When you get into middle school all the way up, teachers expect older kids/young adults to be well - behaved. Now if you have a job that focuses on adults, your patience might not be high/long. Like my dad, he is a lawyer and he deals with adults. His patience is not close to what my mom's is. My mom still deals with adults, but she grew up with four brothers and she was the oldest. My dad expects people to be on time within a couple of minutes. Whenever I say “Come pick me up at seven o'clock,” he will be there by seven o'clock. Now when I tell my mom to come pick me up at seven o'clock, she will be maybe ten minutes either way. That is my story about the people I know and “Patience,” showing how different people can have varying levels of this important quality.
957	18896	7	3	Patience, my mom, and I were sitting on the couch and we were going to go to the store to get groceries and then go to the school clothing shop. My sister didn't really want to go, but my mom made her. So she was already mad about that. We went and got food that she apparently “didn't like,” but she was just being her normal, self - centered and greedy self. “We are here,” said my mom as we arrived at the clothing store to go shopping. She doesn't like jeans, skirts, or dresses like I do, maybe because she doesn't think she can fit them. Anyways, we went in and she doesn't see anything “she likes,” so she starts throwing a tantrum. My mom was so patient with her. I couldn't believe it. So we lost track of her name and she took Patience to my spare clothes area. This incident really showed how my mom's patience could handle my sister's difficult behavior.
958	18897	7	3	It was [specific date] and [PERSON4] was in class messing around at his desk like usual. [PERSON4] isn't usually the patient kind of a person. Then his teacher asked a question to the class and [PERSON4] had thought in his head that it was one of the best answers. [PERSON4]'s hand shot straight up in the air, one of the first hands raised. “[CAPS1]! Lots of answers,” Ms. [PERSON1] Berry said. Ms. [PERSON1] Berry is kind of more of a round - faced person, with some big glasses to see clearly. But all of the students love her as an English teacher. “[CAPS3] [CAPS4], what's your answer?” “[CAPS5] I was just scratching my head. Okay [CAPS6].” “[CAPS7] language?” “[CAPS8] good answer though.” There were about [NUM2] more hands in the air. In [PERSON4]'s head he just wanted to blurt out his answer but he knew that this time he was going to at least try to be patient. “[CAPS9] these last [NUM3] people and then we will go [CAPS5],” Ms. [PERSON1] Berry exclaimed. [PERSON4] was raging with impatience inside his head but outside he looked as calm as could be. “[CAPS10],” [PERSON3] said. “[CAPS11] a metaphor?” [CAPS10] answered. “[CAPS13] you're right it was a metaphor.” “[CAPS14] darn it that was my answer!” [PERSON4] mumbled under his breath. But even though another classmate took his answer, [PERSON4] was happy because he knew he was waiting patiently, which was a big step for him.
959	18898	7	3	Bang! I had just shot myself in the foot with a BB gun. It all happened when my sister got a gun for her birthday. I went up to a target and got ready to shoot. That was when I got shot. I went to my mom and told her what happened. The next day we went to the doctor's office to have a look at my foot. The doctor had about [NUM1] or [NUM2] patients there, not including me. My mom said “It could take a while.” I am a person with barely any patience at all. We waited, and waited, and waited for an hour. Today wasn't my lucky day. She called out a person's name, it wasn't mine. We waited for a total of [NUM3] hours and then the doctor finally called my name. After the BB got removed, I went home to sleep. That was a time when I had to be patient, and it taught me that sometimes waiting is necessary.
960	18899	7	3	Patience! Being patient can get you what you want and I'm gonna tell you a story about how I got what I wanted by being patient. It was [DATE1]; two weeks before my birthday I asked for a motorized scooter. I was told I was too young for one. Of course I was upset, I was furious. I waited a few days, but I didn't get it. I waited another week and I still didn't get it. When my birthday came, ([DATE2]) I finally got my motorized scooter! I was so happy! That's why people should be patient because you might get what you ask for. This experience clearly demonstrated the power of patience in getting what we desire.
961	18900	7	3	A time I was patient was when my grandparent and I were driving to Florida. We started early in the morning, excited for the trip. It took about one and a half days to arrive, with a few stops along the way for rest and food. Then it took us six hours to get to @LOCATION2. My uncle @PERSON1, his wife and his four boys went also. They had rented a nice house by the beach for us to stay with them. On @DATE1, which was the day after we got there, we went to @LOCATION1 to see my grandpa’s sister @PERSON2. That took us about an hour and thirty minutes because we got a bit lost on the unfamiliar roads. The last time we went to Florida was to see my cousin @CAPS1 get @CAPS2. No, his little sister was getting @CAPS2. I was really looking forward to it and couldn't wait to see them. The wedding was @CAPS3 and I found it a bit confusing as I couldn't understand it. So I waited patiently for it to get over. After the wedding, we went back to my aunt’s house. On @DATE2 we went to the flea market and it was huge, filled with all sorts of interesting things. It took us an hour to look at the whole thing. I wanted to leave at stand fifty - five but I had to buy something for my mom and dad. So again I waited patiently for us to leave. On @DATE3 we left to go home. We got here around @NUM1 in the @TIME1. I was so tired I almost fell asleep on the floor. So the whole ride there and back I waited patiently, and it was a great trip overall.
962	18901	7	3	Being patient is a very important skill to have. You truly need this skill to live your life smoothly. Without patience, your life would be very crazy, filled with unnecessary stress and frustration. One time when I was patient and had to wait, and when it was time, it felt really good. One day about @NUM1 years ago, I went to @ORGANIZATION1. And if you have been there then you know how long the lines are. They can be up to about an hour and a half of waiting. I was waiting for my turn to go on the haunted house. It looked really spooky and like it would be a lot of fun. Then when I got there it looked like there were @NUM2 people in line at the time. My mom asked, “@CAPS1, do you want to go on a different ride and then come back and do the haunted house?” I told her no and we got in the line. After about @NUM3 hour in line, there was only about @NUM4 people in front of my mom and me. Then it was finally our turn. When I got to sit down in the chair and be buckled in, it felt great to know that after waiting for a long time I did it. I was patient. I didn't keep peeping and asking if it was our turn, I just stood there patiently. That was the time I realized that I had been patient. I knew from then on that I really could do it, have patience. It's an important skill to have and to help you live your life well without it being crazy.
963	18902	7	3	One time I was a patient was when I broke my arm. I was at the hospital for @NUM1. I was playing outside and was climbing a tall pole. I got a bit too excited and dropped down. I put a @CAPS1 on it and it started to swell up quickly. My doctor was very peaceful and had a kind smile. He was also very nice, explaining everything to me gently. He examined my arm carefully and told me what needed to be done. In conclusion, this is a time I was a patient, and it taught me to be calm in difficult situations.
964	18903	7	3	A time I was being patient was when I was in line to go see @CAPS1 @CAPS2. The line was so long that I was really tempted to leave. I was standing there, shifting from one foot to the other, thinking about all the other things I could be doing. But I did not want to lose my place in line. When I finally got inside the theater, the line inside was even longer than outside. So I took a deep breath and was patient. I watched as people slowly made their way in. But when I finally got in, the movie was over. I was so mad that I just went straight home and went to sleep. It was a disappointing experience, but it also made me realize that sometimes being patient doesn't always pay off as expected.
965	18904	7	3	Patience, an essential part of our world. Patience is definitely something everybody needs, but not everybody has. I firmly believe that everybody needs patience because everything takes time. And if you “don't have the time” to do something then you don't have the time to live a fulfilling life. And if nobody had the time to live then I wouldn't be here right now. I believe that patience is more than just its definition. I believe that it means to be able to allow time to pass so you can do something meaningful. If all you did was work then you'd have a pretty boring life. For example, if you had a @CAPS1 teacher for an elective class. She would have to be patient to be able to teach you the language of @CAPS1. Otherwise, she probably wouldn't be a good teacher. Another example would be that let's say you're on @NUM1 and you're going to go to @LOCATION1. But traffic is holding you down because of a @NUM2 car pile - up. And you honk your horn out of frustration. That's not going to speed things up any more than they already are. Maybe your timing is perfect when you honk, but it doesn't make anything go any faster. When people hear someone honk their horn it most likely comes up as “@CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7 PERSON @CAPS8 @CAPS9.” That statement is pretty much correct. When you honk your horn in traffic it doesn't make anything go faster, it makes things seem longer and people instantly label you as @CAPS11. In conclusion, I would like to state that patience is important to mankind because if nobody had patience, the world would be a chaotic place and nobody would be able to co - exist peacefully on earth right now.
966	18905	7	3	A lime when I was patient was last year. Every day last year, I had to be patient because of my aunt. My aunt would pick me up from the back of the school. Some days, I didn't know if she was coming to pick me up. Like one time, it was the first day of school, and I was completely confused about what was happening. I had no idea who was going to pick me up. Since I didn't have a phone, I couldn't call anyone. There I was, patiently waiting at the school. As I waited, I went with my friend to his house and then returned to the school to wait some more. After about @NUM1 or @NUM2 minutes, which felt like an hour, my aunt finally came and picked me up. This experience taught me the value of patience.
967	18906	7	3	My neighbor was extremely patient when he killed that @NUM1 - point buck for the first time! He was excited and proud that he caught this beautiful white - tail deer. He said he'd never been this proud before. After the successful hunt, he went out to dinner. I clearly remembered my neighbor's face when he told me about it. I was genuinely happy for him. If I had the money, I would have got something to commemorate the @NUM1 - point buck. When I got to see the deer's head, my jaw dropped. It was the most beautiful deer I'd ever seen. This hunting achievement was a moment of great pride for my neighbor, and I was glad to share in his joy.
968	18907	7	3	"@PERSON2 stepped out of his warm, cozy house and into the cold, biting, blowing air. He slowly walked, carefully staggering on the slippery ice, out to the barn. The barn was truly unique; it was a pitching barn. @PERSON3 had trained many softball pitchers and catchers in this barn, including me. I was already in the barn and had turned on the heater. I was warming up thoroughly, doing wrist flicks, 'k - s', one - leg throws, arm circles, and screw - ball flicks. My catcher, @PERSON1, caught the ball every single time. @PERSON3 said, ""@CAPS1. Let me see your screwball and rise ball."" I took my place on the mound and threw my screwball. It curved right, and the glove cracked. ""@CAPS2! Excellent! Hey you! Give me a high - five!"" @PERSON1 said. I slapped her hand, and we both said ""@CAPS3!"" ""@CAPS4, @CAPS4 good. Now throw me a rise,"" @PERSON2 said. I threw one. @PERSON3 gave me pointers after I had thrown three rise balls. ""You are doing good. Just keep your legs open and your arm flicking up a little more,"" he said. He never lost patience with me, not even after one rise ball almost hit the ceiling. He just kept working with me. After many more pitches, I had finally mastered it. We finished our pitching session ten minutes later. @PERSON3 told me I was doing great. He said we would work on it again on @DATE2. ""@CAPS5 is @DATE1. Right?"" I asked. ""@CAPS6 day!"" he said cheerfully. He gave me a warm hug. I love @PERSON3. Not just because he is my dad, but also because he is a great, patient, and dedicated man."
969	18908	7	3	"Once, my dad and I were supposed to go to the races. But I had to wait for my dad. He said he was getting off work at @NUM1 o'clock, which was also the time the races started. Since it takes an hour to get there, I knew we were going to be late and wouldn't be able to meet the drivers and sit in their cars. So, I patiently played in my room with all my favorite toys. I was worried that I wasn't going to go at all. Eventually, @CAPS1 I decided to take a nap. Later, I felt something gently tapping me. I opened my eyes and saw my dad. He said, ""Get up, we're going to the races."" I was so overjoyed. When we got there, we found out we had the wrong time; we were an hour early. So, I got to meet the drivers and sit in their cars. That weekend, they were having a three - hundred - lap race, which was the end of the race season of the year. First, they held the three - hundred - lap race. Then @CAPS1 they did the figure - eight boat race. After that, they had the school - bus derby race. I was so happy to be there and see the school buses race. A little kid said, ""Now how am I going to get to school? They're crashing all the school buses."" When @CAPS1 the races were finished, I thanked my dad for taking me to the races and for not being late to meet the drivers and sit in their cars. We went home, and I went to @CAPS2, feeling extremely satisfied with the amazing day."
970	18909	7	3	When I was going to @LOCATION1 with my family, I had to be patient. Our flight left at @TIME1 am, so we arrived at the airport at @NUM1. We patiently waited for two hours. Nobody complained because we each had something to do. Me and @PERSON1 were engrossed in playing video games, and my mom was deeply involved in reading. When we finally got on the plane, it took three hours to reach @LOCATION1, and no one complained then either. This entire journey taught me that patience can make long - wait situations bearable. So, this is the story of the time when nobody complained for five hours, and it was a great family experience.
971	18910	7	3	On a super hot summer's day, me, my mother, and @CAPS1 all went to the Best Western. The reason is that we don't have air - conditioning and we were melting like ice cream under the scorching sun. So when we got there, lo and behold, there was a pool! We went up to our room and quickly got changed into our bathing suits. Then we went down to the pool, found a nice spot, and carefully put our towels there. But, unfortunately, everyone had to get out for chemical cleaning. I was burning up with anger and disappointment, my face turning red like a tomato. But I took a few deep breaths, cooled down, and waited. Waited, and waited and waited, still no one could go in. It had been about fifteen minutes so far and everyone was bored out of their minds, fidgeting around. And finally a buzzing noise rang in my ears! But it meant that some food was ready at the snack bar, so it got my hopes up but they fell down again. Waiting, still waiting then a voice said, “ok, everyone back in the pool.” I was overjoyed by these words, and I ran as fast as I could then jumped right in! It took like a half - hour, even if it wasn't worth all the waiting, it was still fun. So maybe next time something takes a long time I'll try to be less aggravated and more happy, maybe..
972	18911	7	3	One time I was patient was at my house when it was my turn to play the game. I had to wait a while. So I just sat there, watching my friends play. I'm never patient when there's food involved. I don't like to wait for my food at all. It really sucks when I have to wait, like my stomach starts growling and I get all antsy. I don't know any other time I was patient. I just don't like to be patient because waiting makes me feel restless and annoyed. But I guess sometimes being patient is necessary, even if I don't enjoy it.
973	18912	7	3	There I was on a cold @DATE1 @TIME1. Still almost pitch black, with only the faint rustling of leaves in the breeze. I was hunting in my blind with my dad. It was so quiet we could hear a pin drop. I had to be very patient because even the slightest movement could scare a deer away. We were sitting there for almost @NUM1 hours, not even making a sound. I was shifting in my seat a little at first, but then I forced myself to stay still. To me being patient was hard but I did it. I was in the woods being patient and soon enough a deer came by. I had to be patient and wait till his head went down so I could stand up and shoot it. That took about @NUM2 minutes, every second feeling like an eternity. But it was worth it because I finally shot the deer and me and my family all got to eat some delicious deer for dinner. This experience taught me that patience can really pay off.
974	18913	7	3	Today I had to be Patient during the meap. The meap is a @NUM1 to @NUM2 day assessment. It has sections on writing, where you have to carefully craft your thoughts; reading, where you need to understand complex passages; and math, which involves solving tricky problems. It is the hardest thing you will have to do in school. I think it is the hardest thing in life because it requires so much focus and endurance. But it helps you learn a lot more as you go through different types of questions and it might help with your future jobs by showing your ability to handle difficult tasks. So, even though it's tough, it's an important experience.
975	18914	7	3	A time when I was patient. A time when I was patient was when I was in @NUM1 grade. When I was in @NUM1 grade my teachers said that we had to write a story about us being patient. So once upon a time there was a girl named @PERSON1 who was not patient. So the whole world knew her as the impatient one. @PERSON1 hated that name so she thought to herself and she said @CAPS1 @CAPS2 I'll make them stop calling me that. So @PERSON1 went around her street and politely asked everyone @CAPS1 @CAPS2 I stop being called the impatient. Nobody would tell her the answer so @PERSON1 screeched out loud @CAPS1 @CAPS2 I stop being called The impatient. Then @PERSON1 heard a voice. It was an old man. His name was @CAPS4 and he said I know @CAPS1 you stop being called that way. @PERSON1 said @CAPS1 please tell me. All you need to do is be patient. Then @PERSON1 thought to herself I've got to be patient. So what @PERSON1 did was she went to the store. And you know what she did? She got in line and she stood there quietly, waiting her turn. She was patient. So when everybody went through the line, they said good job @PERSON1 and everybody stopped calling her impatient. This shows that with a little effort, one can change others' perceptions by being patient.
976	18915	7	3	Have you ever been patient? I have. One time, me, my mom, my dad, and sister went to a well - known @CAPS1. When we got there, the hostess at the entrance gave us a number and politely told us to wait in the comfortable waiting area. I was being patient, sitting there quietly, looking around at the other waiting customers and waiting. Then @NUM1 later, a waiter came to lead us to a nice table by the window. We all sat down and told our friendly waitress what we wanted to drink. Then we all looked at the menus carefully and found out what we wanted. The waitress came back and asked us what we wanted to eat. I said steak and so did my dad, my mum and sister got mini tocos. She said ok, and that our food would be out shortly. Well it turns out she was way off. We were sitting there for @NUM2, starting to get a bit hungry and restless. My mom wanted to leave but the rest of us said no and waited patiently. Finally after @NUM2 @NUM4, our food came out and we were glad. The only bad part about that was the mini tocos were frozen solid. So we just asked for our bill. The waitress came back and gave us the bill, luckily that wasn't frozen solid. We paid our bill, left no tip and left. After that my mom thanked me for being so patient and we decided we would never go there again.
977	18916	7	3	Sometimes I do show patience and sometimes I don't. Being patient is being @CAPS1, like remaining calm in difficult situations, @CAPS2, such as being understanding towards others, and @CAPS3, which means having self - control. These are the good character traits that a leader has. Without patience, you'll @CAPS5 up at every hard thing you do. So be a leader, a person who @CAPS4ít @CAPS5 up. Be a person who you love and in addition, be everything you can be. Remember, patience is everything. It can help you overcome difficulties and build better relationships.
978	18917	7	3	Have you ever waited for something that seemed so @CAPS1 away, that seemed to take so @CAPS2 to get there, but in the end, it all paid off? I have. Just @DATE1, I took the @CAPS3.A.T to get into the @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7, also known as @CAPS8, (@NUM1 - @CAPS9). I had to wake up at @NUM2 am, on a @DATE2, feeling a bit sleepy but excited, to get ready. I had to beat @ORGANIZATION1 at @NUM3. When I got there, I saw a long line of students and had to wait in line for @NUM4 minutes to find out what room I would be taking the test in. It took @CAPS10 @CAPS11 to take the test! With three breaks in between to rest and relax a bit. However, when I was done and exited my room engulfed in the crowd of about @NUM5 other kids taking the test, I met my mom who gave me encouraging smiles and big hugs. Since my three best friends also took the test, we all got together afterwards and roamed the beautiful campus, looking at the different buildings and imagining ourselves as students there. It turned out to be a great day.
979	18919	7	3	@CAPS6 was @NUM1 at night, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and I was sooo anxious to know what I had gotten for @CAPS1 the next day. I couldn't go to sleep at all, tossing and turning in my bed, because I was so excited for that awesome day to get my presents and celebrate @CAPS1. I love @CAPS1 because of all of the joy, fun, and happiness in everyone's spirit. @CAPS6 is very rewarding and good to wait for things because if you wait, then good things will come to you and those around you. Sometimes I already know some of the things I had gotten (because my mum is a bad hider) for @CAPS1. I am patient with others because I would like for them to be patient with me as well. Treat others how you would like to be treated. I think @CAPS1 is the most joyful time of the year, don't you? @CAPS6 is fun to fellowship with pets, friends, and family because you become closer. You can share stories, laugh together and create wonderful memories. Well, that is my patience response. Thank you for your time @CAPS9.
980	18920	7	3	I chose to write a story in my own way about patience. Patience is how long you can stay waiting for something or someone. Like in a restaurant, you need to be patient and wait for your food. You might be sitting at a table, looking at the menu, and then waiting as the chefs prepare your meal. Sometimes there could be a long wait, but being patient means not getting angry or frustrated. In an airplane waiting area, you be patient for the plane to land and get ready for departure. You sit in the waiting seats, watching the announcements on the screens, and waiting for your turn to board. These are the things I know about patience, and it's an important quality in our daily lives.
981	18921	7	3	I am in the middle of being, well, seriously trying to be patient right now. You see, @CAPS1, my birthday is coming up, and my cell phone is not working at all. That's why I told my mom that I needed a new phone. She is dealing with some issues and might not be able to get it for me immediately, so I have to be patient. I'm just hoping and thinking it will be super cool once I get a new one! @CAPS1, the situation is a bit tough. I don't know which phone I'll end up getting. Being patient is really hard. Being patient involves not whining, no, and not yelling either. Patience can sometimes come with a bit of discomfort and waiting. So, I'll be patient and see how it goes. In the end, I'm sure it will all work out for the best.
982	18922	7	3	I have to be patient all the time when I'm teaching my puppy (@PERSON1) right from wrong. It's a daily challenge, and I often wonder when others are patient. @PERSON1 is a new and adorable part of my family, but he is still very much in the learning phase of distinguishing right from wrong. I try to teach him various things every single day. However, when I go over a particular lesson about @NUM1 times, I start to get kind of mad. Mom tells me that @PERSON1 is just a puppy and is still learning, and that being patient with him helps train him faster. I understand that I have to be patient when teaching @PERSON1 new things. If I'm patient, he will learn faster, and we'll have a better relationship. In the end, the patience I show now will surely pay off in a well - behaved and loving puppy.
983	18923	7	3	It was a cold @DATE1 @TIME1, and the air was biting. The @NUM1 and @NUM2 grade football teams were playing at different times, one at @NUM3 and one at @NUM4. Of course, there were @CAPS1 leaders, and I just happened to be one of them. The game starts at about @NUM3 o'clock, and we started cheering with enthusiasm. After about @NUM3:15, we were getting very cold. We were wearing our warm - ups, but the cold was seeping through, and we were still cold. So, now that we were cold, we were getting kind of cranky. As half - time came, it was even colder. We all took a break and went and got some hot chocolate to warm ourselves up. Well, of course, we were in a hurry to get back to the bleachers to sit down. I started to walk faster and faster, then I dropped my hot chocolate down the front of me. I was really mad, but I'm a @CAPS1 leader, so I had to put on a happy face. Then we started cheering again. It was colder than when we started, but we just kept cheering. Then some of the @CAPS1 leaders decided they wanted to take off their warm - ups. If more people want to take them off, well, all of us have to take them off, so we did. And we froze, but we held on there until the @NUM7 game was over. Then we all went home and probably went straight to bed, exhausted from the cold and the cheering. In the end, it was a tough but memorable experience.
984	18924	7	3	I think patience comes into play in a lot of places. For example, when you're trying to get a job, you have to be patient. If you're impatient and act out, the boss will kick you right out of the building without saying one word to you. Another place where patience is crucial is in achieving success. If you moan and groan because something is taking too long to happen, that's not patience at all. The better thing to do would be to get up and try to do something about the situation. Lastly, if you have to wait to get something, like money from your job, you don't just go and rob the place. You have to be patient and wait for your due payment. In all these aspects of life, patience is the key that unlocks opportunities and leads to positive outcomes.
985	18925	7	3	Once I was at an airport in @LOCATION1. We were coming home from a wonderful trip to @LOCATION2. After we got off the plane, we had to go through the rather long process of customs. There were only two people working for @LOCATION3 citizens, which meant the line was extremely long. After half an hour, we were only half - way through the line. There was a lot of waiting, and many people around were whining due to the long wait. But we persevered and finally made it through. Of course, the customs officers all thanked us for our patience. Once our passports were stamped, we were on our way to the next flight. In the end, despite the long wait, we managed to continue our journey home, and the patience we showed at the airport was worth it to get back to our destination.
986	18926	7	3	Once upon a time there was a young girl named @CAPS1. She lived with her loving dad and mom in a cozy small town of @PERSON2. It was almost her birthday, and she was extremely excited for this special day because she was turning twelve. Twelve had been her lucky number ever since she was little. Her mom said they could go into town and visit chef @PERSON1's restaurant to eat out. She happily agreed. So that morning, she woke up to the delicious smell of pancakes. Her dad had made her some scrumptious pancakes with fresh, juicy strawberries on them. After enjoying her breakfast, she went out to go milk their cows for her parents. @CAPS1 really hated milking the cows because they were very stubborn. But she mustered up the energy and went out there. To her surprise, she managed to milk the cows in only @NUM1 minutes. @CAPS1 went back inside and carefully put the milk on the table. As she sat there, she started to wonder if she was going to get a birthday present. @CAPS1 decided it would be best if she was patient. When her mom came home from work (she works at a dress - making store), she said, “Are you ready to go eat?” @CAPS1 jumped up and yelled, “Yes, yes!” So they rode into town and parked at the restaurant. They walked in and the lights were off. Her dad quickly got to the light switch, and all of her close family and friends were there. They yelled, “Surprise!” @CAPS1 was in such a shock that she kept repeating, “@CAPS3 you, @CAPS3 you, @CAPS3 you.” And on a table were twelve beautifully wrapped presents, and under the table was a cute little dog. Her mom and dad had got her a dog. She named the dog Wonder because every time she saw him, she began to wonder about her wonderful life. And she learned that great things come when you are patient.
987	18927	7	3	Being patient means waiting calmly and not getting frustrated. When my family and I went to @LOCATION1 for the @LOCATION1 state game, my dad showed remarkable patience, which was quite unusual because he is normally impatient. So we were really surprised. When we got inside the stadium, there was a line of in - considerate people. @CAPS1 had taken our seats, so we had to wait for security to tell them to move. It took about half an hour for the security to find us. Again, my dad remained patient, but the @CAPS1 people sitting in our seats couldn't wait. They started to get very angry. When security finally arrived, we then had to wait for them to sort out the issue. My dad was still patient and stayed calm throughout. After all that waiting, we finally got our seats. I was relieved. The reason my dad was so patient was because he did not want to get kicked out of the stadium. So he managed to stay patient and composed. This experience taught me the importance of patience in difficult situations.
988	18928	7	3	When I was at Cedar Point, I had a lot of patience. I went to Cedar Point with my friend @PERSON1 last @DATE1, which was about @NUM1 @DATE1's ago. It was my first time there, while this was like @PERSON1's @NUM2 time visiting. We went on so many thrilling rides, but the bad thing was the long lines. The lines were incredibly huge! At first, I wasn't very patient. I kept looking around and getting a bit annoyed. But after a while, I managed to calm down and have patience, while my friend didn't. My friend really wanted to go on the Dragster, but I wasn't interested. She even forgot that it was my first time there. After hours of riding amazing rides, the lines just kept getting longer. My parents started to lose their patience, but my friend and I remained calm. It was quite funny because usually, it's the other way around. Sometimes I wish people could be more patient in situations like these. But I'm not sure if that will ever happen. However, this trip taught me that I can develop patience even in challenging circumstances.
989	18929	7	3	Do you have patience? Well, if you do, you're like some of us. But I know a guy who truly has patience. His name is @CAPS1.M. @CAPS1.M holds the secret of patience. What helps him a lot is that he doesn't talk much. For example, one time we were at Cedar Point. We were standing in a line for three long hours! @CAPS2 didn't care though. He just stood there calmly. Another time, we were outside playing, and we made a small hole. He got stung five times, but he didn't complain about how much @CAPS4 hurt. I have some patience, but not as much as @CAPS2. However, @CAPS2 isn't perfect. When he's hungry, he has no patience, and I've always wondered why. The one time @CAPS2 showed the most patience was when his mom's car broke down in the middle of nowhere. It was cold outside, and the car was freezing. It took nine hours for a tow truck to arrive. That situation really tested his patience, and it threw his mom over the edge, but not him. Finally, when they got to a place, they had a nice meal prepared by @PERSON1. Then they went to @ORGANIZATION1 to get some food. @CAPS2 has the most patience I've ever seen someone have, and his example shows that patience can be a great virtue in difficult times.
990	18930	7	3	One day I went to the store with my mother. There was an @CAPS1 old lady in front of us at the checkout. She seemed to be having a hard time. She was moving very slowly, taking her time to get her items out, find her money, and complete the transaction. I know she was an @CAPS1 old lady, and she probably had her reasons for moving slowly. But it was really testing my patience. I was getting a bit annoyed as I stood there waiting. I really don't have much patience in such situations, but I know that @CAPS2 some people are more understanding and patient. This experience made me realize that I should try to be more empathetic and patient towards others, especially those who may be facing difficulties or moving at a slower pace.
991	18931	7	3	There is only one time a year I'm truly patient for something, and that is @CAPS1. I eagerly anticipate @CAPS1's arrival every year. I can never wait for @CAPS1 to come around. During this special time, I get to see my brothers, uncles, aunts, cousins - every single body. It is the absolute best time of the year, and it's right up there next to my birthday. It's a time filled with joy and togetherness that I cherish.
992	18932	7	3	There was a time I had to go to my doctor for a monthly check - up. When my aunt and I got to the building, we realized that there were significantly more cars there than usual. When we stepped inside, we noticed that a flier clearly said “@NUM1 shots @DATE1 through @DATE2.” As we took the elevator up to the fourth floor and stepped into the waiting room, we saw @NUM2 people. Luckily, not all the people were waiting for @PERSON1, but I did have to wait for an hour and forty - five minutes. Finally, when I got to see my doctor, she gave me my shot and made sure I was okay. After this long day at the doctor's, I went home and took a big, well - deserved nap.
993	18933	7	3	One time I had to be patient was when we went on a family trip to @LOCATION1 to see family and friends! We had a long - planned big trip out there. The tires on our vehicle were well - used. We were patient throughout the trip, like during the flight that took @NUM1 hours, and then another @NUM1 more hours in the air. For part of the trip, we drove along Highway One, which is situated right next to the Pacific Ocean. We passed a small black sedan. During the journey, we stopped at a place to look at some tourist attractions. There was a grassy hill on one side and some interesting scenery related to cycling on the other. I mostly slept and listened to the radio for almost @NUM3 hours. Then, finally, we stopped in San @CAPS1. After staying there, we got on a plane for the ride home. It was a @NUM4 ½ - hour flight @CAPS2 to Atlanta, @LOCATION2. It was a large plane with a middle section and two other sections. We were in the middle. On both sides of us were college students who would yell across the aisle to the other side. I tried to sleep, but it was very uncomfortable. It was the most uncomfortable plane ride of my life, but I had to be patient, and now it's over.
994	18934	7	3	Patience is having control over yourself while you wait. In order to be patient, you have to calmly wait until whatever you are waiting on is done. @CAPS1 essentially means to have composure over yourself. For example, if you go to the doctor's office for a yearly check - up, you have to sit in the waiting room for at least one hour before they call your name. But patience is not always easy. Like when you are waiting for a pizza restaurant to deliver your pizza, @CAPS1 usually takes about @NUM1 minutes. To me, @CAPS1 is something that seems like a made - up concept. It's not that people don't have patience, but it can be quite a challenge.
995	18935	7	3	One day, me, my mom, my dad, my sister, and my brother went to Fire Mountain. So we had to wait for a really long time in the line. Finally, we got to the front of the line and got our seats. Then we sat down, but we had to wait for a long time for a waiter. So we started singing songs to pass the time until our waiter arrived. I was getting a bit impatient and said I wished she'd come faster. Then she finally came. After that, we got our drinks and our food. We ate our food and drank our drinks. Then we went home, and that is the time I was patient through all the waiting.
996	18936	7	3	One time when I was patient, I got rewarded. Just a few weeks ago, my science teacher assigned my class a leaf project. We had to collect @NUM1 leaves to get @PERCENT1. When I started collecting my leaves, I had to press and dry them. To do this to a leaf, you will have to carefully put the leaves in newspaper, then gently place heavy books on the newspaper so the water will gradually come out of the leaves onto the newspaper. It takes a long time to do this process, and sometimes you have to do this a couple of times for each leaf. I had to be patient because the first due date was approaching, but mom said to finish my project by the next due date. So since I was patient, my project got done before the second due date and I got @NUM2 extra points. So when you're patient, you can get rewarded.
997	18937	7	3	My mom and I were on our way to our house from Sonco. We got stopped by a train, and it was moving very slowly. My mom and I were waiting very patiently, but after a few minutes, my mom wanted to turn around. However, we stayed there and waited. Finally, the train passed, and we were able to continue our journey home. This experience taught us that sometimes patience is the best option, as waiting it out allowed us to reach our destination safely.
998	18938	7	3	One time I got birthday money and I wanted to buy an electric scooter. On the weekends, I always waited for my dad to get home so we could look on the internet. He always got home and we looked, but I never liked any. But one day he did not have to work, so we looked some more and I found two that I liked. One was a gas scooter and one was an electric scooter. We went to look at the gas scooter and it was a lot of money, and it had a bunch of scratches on it. So, we called the person with the electric scooter because I did not like the gas scooter. We went to the seller's place and I got it. I estimated it to cost @MONEY1, and it was indeed @NUM1 @MONEY1. I got home and rode it for three days. One night, I was riding it and we went in the garage. It went out of control. We thought it was the fuse, but it was the controller, and that's the part that everything hooks up to. We called the company and ordered the part, and they sent us the wrong one. We told them it was not the right one and they sent the same one again. It fell off the desk and we forgot about it. Now I ordered it again and they said this time they are sending the right controls. I have been waiting about @NUM2 year to @NUM3 months. I'm still hopeful that I'll soon be able to ride my scooter properly again.
999	18939	7	3	Patience is, in definition, being understanding and tolerant. I am not patient. I am understanding, but I am not that tolerant. Some people though, are both tolerant and understanding, or in other words, patient. Here is a story of someone I know who is tolerant. In the @NUM1 grade, my math teacher's assistant had to be extremely patient with our classmates because they would ask the same questions over and over again. She would teach the lesson thoroughly and then have to reteach it before answering questions. I was in the advanced group, so we progressed quickly and never really had to ask questions. I could never be as patient as she was while teaching those students. This shows that true patience is a valuable quality that not everyone possesses.
1000	18940	7	3	One time I had to wait very patiently. One afternoon, my brother @CAPS1 went to pick up some car parts. Then it all happened. Out of nowhere, a car drifted into his lane and then crashed into him. Since our truck didn't have air bags, it was a bad situation. The other driver was in a van with air bags. About @NUM1 minutes later, my mom got the call about what happened. Then we rushed as fast as we could to the scene of the crash. I had to wait in the car till my dad got back from going to get @CAPS1. I waited patiently, constantly praying that he was alright. And thankfully, my prayers were answered. He just got some bumps and bruises. But the car got towed away. We later went to where the truck was to get our belongings and see what happened to the truck. The damage on the truck was not nearly as bad as what happened to the other driver's van. We got the truck back a few weeks later. But I'm glad I still have my brother. This incident made me realize that patience and hope can get us through difficult times.
1001	18941	7	3	I'm going to tell you about the time I had to have patience taking this @CAPS1! It all started a few minutes ago. I walked into the classroom with a determined look on my face, prepared for anything. But clearly, I was not as ready as I thought. Just four minutes later, I had this @CAPS1 sitting right in front of me. So, I began by recalling the times when I'd used patience. This moment seemed as good as any. Now, don't get me wrong. I understand the purpose of taking the @CAPS1. Well, I think it's supposed to help us learn, or maybe it's just to make our hands hurt and cramp up. I really don't know for sure. Writing about patience is incredibly hard because it can slip away from you in an instant. But the @CAPS1 is what it is, and I'm determined to do my best. So, the story must go on! It's extremely quiet in the classroom, and the smell of pencil lead and paper seems to linger in the air. My eyes are heavy with tiredness, and I can't help but let out a huge yawn. My hand has fallen asleep, and every few seconds, you can hear a “sniff”, “sniff”, “sniff”. We're not allowed to get up, so we're stuck sitting here “sniffing” and dealing with runny noses for the whole hour. When you were a kid, whoever is grading this, did you ever take this test, or at least a section of it? Well, it's none of my business. Never mind. Ouch! My hand really hurts! Just a second. (shake, shake, shake, crack) There, that's a bit better. Patience is a virtue, but sometimes it's hard to care. You probably don't have the patience to read all this, so let me finish by saying this. Writing about patience has been a challenge, but now, I'm finally done. (yes!)
1002	18942	7	3	One time when I had to show a lot of patience is when I sprained my arm ice skating. I was out on the ice, doing spins and tricks everywhere. I was really into it, trying out all sorts of difficult moves. Then, one spin I attempted didn't go as planned. I didn't land it properly and fell hard on my back. But the bone that ended up hurting was my arm. My mom was really surprised that I could even stand up because of how hard I'd fallen. My arm was throbbing with pain. So, my mom quickly rushed over to help me, and then we had to go home. The next morning, the pain in my arm was @NUM1 times worse. It was really unbearable. I had to go to the doctors to get x - rays for it. The doctors said it would take two weeks for the x - rays to develop. So, I was stuck in pain for two whole weeks. In the end, it turned out that I didn't break my arm. However, waiting for the results was excruciating. It took a great deal of patience for me to just keep waiting, and waiting, and waiting for those x - rays. This experience taught me that patience is important, especially when dealing with difficult situations.
1003	18943	7	3	It was a cold fall afternoon. My grandpa and I were out on a hunting trip. We'd gotten up early in the morning and headed to the @CAPS1 nolvek. Little did I know what an eventful day it would be. We got settled into the ground blind at about @NUM1. Looking around, it seemed like it would be a long and uneventful afternoon. We sat there for @NUM2 hours, and it felt like an eternity. We just kept waiting and waiting, but still, no deer showed up. All of a sudden, my heart started racing at the sight in front of our blind. We had lured the biggest deer I have ever seen. It was a monster - sized deer, @NUM3. @NUM4 feet tall and with a @NUM5 rack. It was an amazing sight. I quickly loaded my @NUM6 special and aimed carefully. I shot it in the shoulder. I was so excited that I almost let out a scream. As with any story, there's a lesson to be learned. Some lessons are about respecting your elders. For me, the lesson is that patience is rewarded. And as you can see, my patience that day was definitely rewarded. This experience will stay with me as a reminder of the value of patience.
1004	18944	7	3	One time I was patient. I told my mom and dad that I didn't want a birthday party. So, they talked about it and came up with a different plan. My mom and I went to @LOCATION1. When we got there, we had a great time. We got to play almost all the games there. Of course, we skipped the boring ones. We also rode on the go - carts twice. The feeling of speed on those go - carts was really exciting. After that, we went to a store and bought a new video game. I'd been wanting that game for a while. We also got some new dirt - biking gloves. I was really looking forward to using them. That was a time when I was patient so that I could do something fun. It showed me that sometimes, being patient can lead to great experiences.
1005	18945	7	3	“Patience is a virtue.” I hear that saying over and over again in my mind. “Patience is a virtue, patience is a virtue.” I never really gave it much thought until I went to babysit my cousins for the first time. My cousin @PERSON2, who is only around @NUM1, is really well - behaved. She does anything you tell her to do. She's an easy one to babysit. But my other cousin, @PERSON3, he has his own ideas and likes to do things his way. Not that I don't love him, but he can be one of the hardest little kids to babysit. We started off the morning pretty well. We had a nice snack, played in the room for a while, did some arts & crafts, and watched a movie. It was a fun and relaxing morning. A few hours before my aunt was supposed to come home, @PERSON1 went poopie in her diaper. Now, I've dealt with a lot of poopie diapers before, so I wasn't too worried at first. I set @PERSON1 on the changing table and took her diaper off. That's when I realized that I didn't have any wipes. I asked @PERSON4 where they were, but he was too busy playing with those milk - pumping bottle things. “@PERSON4, I need you to go get the wipes right now. Please.” @PERSON1 was now squirming around on the changing table, and I had to hold on to her tightly if I didn't want poop all over the house. “I know, but I can't,” he said. “Well, why can't you?” I asked. “Because I don't want to,” he replied. I was starting to lose my temper when I suddenly remembered the saying “Patience is a virtue.” I took a deep breath and realized that I was experiencing what it means to be patient. “@PERSON4, I'll bet you can't go get them as fast as a cheetah!” “Yes, I can!” he said. “Okay, then prove it.” And he did. I realized that you'll get things done faster if you're patient, and sometimes a bit of creativity can also come in handy. This experience taught me the true meaning of patience and how it can help in difficult situations.
1006	18946	7	3	I wondered who would win the contest. I just sincerely hoped that I would be the winner. I was extremely nervous, my hands were slightly trembling. I was also a little bit scared as if my heart was in my throat. I didn’t know what was going to happen next. I was very eager and patient to hear who won the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 contest. I was anxiously waiting for the contest to end. A little bit earlier I played the game with full concentration. I was currently in first place, which both excited and worried me. I was nervous because if I win I will get two tickets to @LOCATION1’s @CAPS3, which I had been longing for. I sat quietly in a chair, trying hard to control my fidgety legs. I tried not to show that I was nervous by pretending to look around casually. All I could do was wait for it to end. Then, my mom said we could wait by riding rides at the fair. First, I went on the tilt - a - whirl. The strong wind blew against my face during the whole ride, and I was constantly wondering if anybody beat my score. Next, we looked for another ride. I tried my best not to think about the contest by focusing on the colorful lights and noisy crowds around. Later, we found a ride to go on. When we got off, my mom told me that I won. Happily, I walked back to the place to claim my prize with a spring in my step. When I was waiting it was scary, but it was absolutely worth it. I was nervous the whole time, and I also tried not to think of it too much. I was very anxious and I really want to do it again some time. I told you when I was patient. When were you?
1007	18947	7	3	"The thing that frustrates one @CAPS1 the most is when people don't ever take a moment to think about patience. They are the exact opposite of patient. They always seem to jump @CAPS1 to @CAPS4’s unpredictable moods. Right then and there, they would impatiently say ""Do it now."" Do you want to know? I will tell you about a time when @CAPS6 brother was one of those impatient ones. This incident happened when we were walking to the store with @CAPS6 brother because @CAPS6 mom and some others needed something. We were in a bit of a hurry, feeling a bit panicked. When we got to the place, it was a bit of a walk, about a mile. The store didn't look very nice at all. There were some unruly people around, and it felt like there was a risk of things being stolen. We started walking. Only one thing was on my mind. @CAPS6 brother rushed down the aisle in search of that bottle. So we passed the produce section and continued walking towards the cleaning supplies. When we were there, a woman was about to walk down the aisle. @CAPS6 brother quickly @CAPS1 down the aisle to go out and get it. He was in such a rush that he almost knocked things over with the bottle. It was quite a mess. He was acting so impatiently, @CAPS4 trying to get him to stop, but he didn't seem to mind. We kept saying ""@CAPS4, we need to get home and go to bed, @CAPS4 it's getting late."" On the walk home, we gave the item to dad and mom. She looked at it and asked what it was. Then she said ""Why didn't we read it first?"" @CAPS6 should have been more patient. It's a good reminder to @CAPS1 to be more patient in similar situations."
1008	18949	7	3	"When I was patient, it was on this @DATE1 when we were going to this place in @LOCATION1. It took us @NUM1 long hours to get there, but we kept saying ""forget it, we'll be in @LOCATION1 soon"", even though we still had a way to go. It was @NUM2 midnight, and we were so sleepy that our eyelids were heavy. We went to a Holiday Inn, and once we got to the room, we went straight to sleep. The next morning, we went swimming in the hotel pool, enjoying the cool water. Then we left and headed to @LOCATION1 park. My two cousins were really getting on my nerves. They kept fighting and talking about each other in a mean way. I was so annoyed that I was about to lose my temper. Then we finally got there at about @NUM3 pm. We had to take a little train to get into the park. The park was huge, with colorful flowers and tall trees everywhere. The first ride me, my sister, and my little cousins went on was the comet. The thrill of the fast - moving ride made us scream. Then we got on the @ORGANIZATION1, the @CAPS1 runney foleon, and the @CAPS2. Despite the annoyance from my cousins earlier, I managed to stay patient throughout the day. That was a time which I was patient."
1009	18950	7	3	I was over at my friend's house one afternoon. She was rummaging through her things, clearly looking for something she needed. So we went over to her sister's room. Her sister was on the phone, so we sat there patiently, trying not to make a sound. We had sat there for about seven minutes, and both of us were starting to get impatient. Our feet were tapping on the floor. We decided to go ask her mom. I guess she was really busy because she told us to sit down, be quiet, and be patient. We sat there again for another seven minutes, but she was still deeply involved in her work. So, we got up and went back to her sister. She was off the phone now. My friend, who was already on the verge of losing her cool, asked her sister where her nail polish was but in a mean, impatient tone. “@CAPS1’s in the drawer! Now get out of my room,” she yelled. After looking and looking through all the drawers and corners, we finally found @CAPS1. She isn't that patient, and I learned I'm not patient either. My friend was still trying to be patient, but her tone gave away her impatience. That's the time when I realized when someone was trying, but failing, to be patient.
1010	18951	7	3	One day I woke up and looked outside. The world was covered in a thick layer of snow, and it was bitterly cold. I went to the living room and told my mother that I wasn’t feeling well. My voice was hoarse. So my mother checked my temperature and said I had a fever. I also had a runny nose, and my nose was all red. She said I probably had a cold. She had to go to work on @DATE1, but she immediately decided to stay home from work to take care of me. She made me a cup of hot chocolate, the steam rising gently, and a delicious breakfast. Every time I needed something, she would just get up right away. Whether it was a drink of water, some more food, or even another warm blanket, she got up and got it for me without hesitation. She was so patient because every single time I asked for something, she got it without complaining. She just did what I asked her to do with a gentle smile on her face. She even went up town in the cold weather to get me my medication. That is why my mother is the best and the most patient person I know.
1011	18952	7	3	I had to have patients' records in the @CAPS1 of @CAPS2. We had to have patient information in the @CAPS3. The @CAPS3 was rather slow here. We got there at @TIME1, then we @CAPS5 it at @NUM1 when we were in the @CAPS3. We stayed there for hours, and at a @CAPS7 patient's bedside in the @CAPS3, I was @CAPS9 so tired that I was going to go @CAPS10 to the car and fall asleep. But I used my patience to go through that @CAPS3 and got the @CAPS11 scoring of a @CAPS12. I had patience so I could do something @CAPS13, and in the end, it all worked out.
1012	18954	7	3	There was a time when I had to be patient. My family and I were getting @NUM1 cute pug puppies from a very nice lady who lived @NUM2 minutes away. I was extremely happy when my parents made their final decision about buying them. We visited the puppies @NUM3 more time when they were still really tiny and young. After our last visit, we had to wait three whole weeks because they had to be old enough to go home with new families. These three weeks seemed to pass by at a snail's pace, but all of the waiting paid off. Being patient gave me a chance to get well - prepared for the puppies. We bought them soft beds, fun toys, sturdy crates, and other essential dog items. We wanted to be fully prepared for our new family members. The day finally came to pick up the puppies. They were so incredibly adorable! We brought them home and we let them freely explore all around our house. They loved it! Our puppies turned out to be great dogs. I am so glad that I had to be patient when waiting for our puppies. I guess good things really do come to those who wait!
1013	18955	7	3	"I had patience when my dad fell ill because we had to wait for the doctor to tell us we could see him. But after a while, the doctor came and said that he went into a seizure and then a stroke. They @CAPS1 - @CAPS2 him (my dad), and we waited about a good @NUM1 minutes, and we used about @NUM2 boxes of tissues as we were very worried. The doctor said that ""we will keep him over night to observe him"". Then the next day, we went to the hospital, and after a while, they had to pull the plug. I had patience in that situation because I waited in the lab area of the hospital, and waited for the doctor to tell us what happened, and when they took the @CAPS1 - @CAPS5, and lastly when they said they needed to pull the plug on him. So, that's my story about when I had patience."
1014	18956	7	3	I was a patient in the doctor's office, and I truly believe so. I was a patient because I sprained my knee once and fractured my @CAPS1. That's what made me a patient. I almost forgot about the lump in my neck, so I am going to see my doctor to get it checked out. In this way, my experiences in the doctor's office clearly show that I am a patient.
1015	18957	7	3	"Sometimes it can be hard to be patient. For me, it needs to be something I really want or want to do. It was a cool day in @LOCATION1 @CAPS2.C. I had just turned @NUM1 and was going to meet President @PERSON1 face to face! I won a great contest that allowed me to do that. As we arrived at the White House, a polite man took us inside. He led us to a small room and then left. It was around @NUM2 then. He said we couldn't come out because we might distract somebody. So we waited, played hangman, and saw other @CAPS3. Then it was around noon and I was getting quite hungry. Around @NUM1:30 pm, @PERSON1 came in! He said ""would you like something to eat?"" I said ""yes"". We went to this fancy restaurant whose name I can't pronounce. He said sorry for having to make me wait, but I didn't care; it was definitely worth it."
1016	18958	7	3	I show loyalty to a lot of people that I know, and in return, they show me loyalty. This mutual loyalty strengthens our relationships and makes our interactions more meaningful.
1017	18959	7	3	A time when I was patient is when I'm at gymnastics. When you are trying to learn a new skill, patience is truly the key. For example, when I was learning a new skill on the bars called a cast to handstand, it was extremely difficult. Day after day, I struggled and never could do it right away. I put in my personal best effort every single day, but I had to be patient, as my coach said. He told me that when the day comes, I'll do it, but until then, I need to keep trying and do the best I can. It could take days, months, or even a year to master this skill, but I just have to wait until the day my body will finally execute the skill. So I waited and waited, tried and tried, but still there was no result of getting my new skill. Finally, after four long months of persistent practice, I did it. I got up on the bar and successfully performed the skill. All my waiting and hard work paid off. That day, my coach told me, “I told you that you could do it. It just takes time and patience, and today was your day, and you did it.” This is a time I had to use patience to get my new skill. I learned that being patient is hard, and all you can do is wait and see what patience will bring you, and in this case, it brought me the achievement of mastering a difficult gymnastics skill.
1018	18960	7	3	Book @CAPS1 “And the characters lived happily ever after…for now!” @CAPS2! @LOCATION1 shut the book, feeling very sad that no more pages were left. This was the third book in her beloved series, and she absolutely just needed the fourth one to continue the story. In the school the next day, she went straight to the library with great anticipation. She opened the doors, and was greeted with that familiar, dusty old book smell that she loved so much. @LOCATION1 made a bee - line for her favorite shelf, which held all her favorite books. She scanned the shelves, quickly noticing that the book was missing. She asked the librarian, @PERSON2, about @CAPS12, and was surprised to find the book checked out already. She put her name on the waiting list, feeling sour about her name being tenth. The next day was @DATE1. @LOCATION1 went to the library and asked @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 about the book. The results were very disappointing. Her name was @NUM1, which was pretty good for only one day, but when she was home, she was in a very sour mood. “What's wrong!” she told her mom. “Mom, I really wanted this book, but @CAPS12 was already checked out. My name is @NUM1 on the list, so it could be ages until those other people finish.” “Honey, I think you have to learn some patience,” said mom. “Patience? What's that?” asked @LOCATION1. “Patience is when you wait for something, and you don't complain about it. Take you, for example, you're being very impatient.” “But I'm waiting,” said @LOCATION1. “Yes, but you are complaining a whole lot.” The next day, @LOCATION1 was as patient as she could be. She did not go to the library and ask for the book, and she went the whole day without complaining. Later on, @LOCATION1 was called to the office. When she got there, she found @PERSON2 and @PERSON1, the secretary. “Here you go,” said @PERSON2. “What's this?” asked @LOCATION1. “This is the book you wanted. It's checked out to your account, and all ready to read.” “Thank you,” said @LOCATION1. She couldn't believe it! She finally got her book! Moral: patience pays off, especially when you're willing to wait, and this experience taught @LOCATION1 the true value of being patient.
1019	18961	7	3	A time that I was patient was when my family and I were going to get @ORGANIZATION1's autograph. We were standing in a long line for hours under the hot sun. My legs were aching and cramping, and the pain was really bothering me, but I didn't care because I was too excited to worry about anything. I just kept my eyes on the goal of getting his autograph. Finally, after what seemed like an eternity, I eventually got it. Holding that autograph in my hand made all the waiting and discomfort completely worth it.
1020	18962	7	3	One day just before football practice, my lock on my locker got stuck. All @NUM1 of the coaches tried to get it off. All of them except for one, coach @PERSON1. He stayed in the locker room with me, patiently trying to get it off. When we realized it wasn't coming off easily, we had to find the @CAPS1. When we found him, we politely asked for bolt cutters. We had to walk all the way across the large school to get them. Once we had them, we had to walk back to the locker room. When we got there, he tried to cut the lock. He tried for @NUM2 min, but they wouldn't work. So we had to walk back across the school to the tool room and get another pair. This one finally cut the lock after @NUM3 min. Throughout this whole frustrating process, coach @PERSON1 remained calm and patient. I think this took a lot of patience from coach @PERSON1, and it taught me the importance of staying calm and persistent in difficult situations.
1021	18963	7	3	"For this passage I am going to tell a story about the most patient person in the world. In the Old Testament long ago, there was a man named Job. He was very rich, very happy, and was loyal to God. One day, the devil pointed this out to God, and the devil said that Job would easily turn away from God. God denied this, so the devil said, ""Let me destroy his crops and livestock, let me take his camels."" God said, ""Fine, but do not hurt Job himself."" The devil agreed. When Job was having a bad day, the next day one of his servants came in and said, ""A great fire has burned down the sheep and the servants; they are the only ones left."" Another servant came in and said, ""Your livestock was attacked by wolves; we are the only ones left."" Then another servant came in and said, ""Thieves have stolen your gold."" Then, yet another servant came in and said, ""The roof has collapsed in the hall; your family has been killed!"" Even though Job began to become a broken - down man living in the ashes, he would not curse God. Soon, the devil came again, but this time made Job horribly sick. Even though this went on for years, he still would not curse God. When God saw this, He sent the devil away and healed Job. He blessed him with a new family and fortune, and then Job was happy again."
1022	18964	7	3	A long wait. I was only four at the time. I had moved to Novi. Yes, moved to Novi, Michigan from Rochester, Minnesota. Quite a long way down south for me but I was a young little girl who didn't care too, too much. So I lived in Novi, went to kindergarten, made friends, moved into a new house, and so on until I was seven. That is when I found out that we were moving. Again, back to Rochester. Well, now I wasn't four anymore. I had a lot of amazing friends here (in particular two of them) and now I would have to start all over again. I didn't hate the idea but I didn't love it either. Of course, it didn't exactly matter. We were moving anyway and I knew from the beginning that I would easily have fun and make new friends. The only thing I didn't want to leave behind were the old friends, memories, and all the other stuff I loved about this place. So I took along my memories, promised to keep in touch with friends, and then moved. Novi was different but good. There were plenty of changes to adjust to but it was pretty easy overall. I made plenty of new friends with whom I now hang out with every day. I've slipped into life here like you slip into bed every night. What I do is fun and feels like normal. I have now been living here for four years. I have been exchanging letters, emails, events, and memories with friends down in Novi and friends here all this time. But even so, I long to go back down for a visit. I have been patiently waiting for it to happen. Now, I think that patience is paying off, because I finally get to visit this year. My only difficulty has been that I don't get to see everyone. But not for long. I see all my friends here all the time and now I'll get to see my older friends too. Yipee for me! I can't wait! Four years of waiting has provided me with an opportunity!
1023	18965	7	3	When I got bit by a dog, I was in the park when it happened. The dog jumped up and bit me in my face. So my dad and his friend put me in the truck and we went to Mercy Hospital, a hospital in the city. They had me sitting in a hospital bed for two hours. Then I got shipped to Hurley. And then I sat in the hospital watching TV, still waiting for surgery. Three hours later I got it. So all together I sat for five hours. And all that time, the wound could have got infected. And I got prescribed a course of antibiotics so they could keep the infection at bay. But I had to have patience after all I was a patient.
1024	18967	7	3	I am patient every Thanksgiving and Christmas. I have to be patient every Thanksgiving. I get so hungry I start to whine and I have to wait for the food to be ready. On Thanksgiving, we set the table, prepare the side - dishes, and wait for the turkey to be cooked. I get so excited I just keep sniffing. Then, oh, I can now tell you about the dessert. I love it but we have it like an hour after the meal, so I'm hungry then too. Every Thanksgiving at my grandma's house, I look forward to her home - made apple pie. Oh, as soon as they walk in with it, I jump up and down. At Christmas, I have to be patient because I always want to see what presents I get. I search under the Christmas tree for boxes with my name on it. If I find one, my parents or grandparents tell me we have to say grace first. Then, at last, I get to open my stocking.
1025	18968	7	3	"Today was Christmas Eve and Tommy, the little boy, was so excited. He was bouncing off the walls! ""I wonder what Santa will bring us,"" exclaimed Tommy, looking through a catalog. ""I want this and this, and this, oh, definitely this."" ""Tommy, you need to be patient. Christmas is tomorrow and you need to do your share and help clean the tree,"" Tommy's mother says. ""I want presents now!"" Tommy whines. ""You know,"" his father says with a sigh, ""if you aren't a good boy, Santa will only bring you peanut shells."" Reluctantly, Tommy gives in and says, ""Alright, I'll help."" It seemed like many many hours later to Tommy, it was time to go to bed. He was glad that he had been patient, because he knew, in the morning, he would have presents."
1026	18969	7	3	Patience. It was a warm @DATE1 @TIME1 and I was at my sisterís house, comfortably seated on the couch, playing wii with my energetic niece. When my brother - in - law Matt comes into the living room, looking a bit restless, and says, ì@CAPS1 bored, lets do something today!íí @CAPS2 we all, after a brief moment of discussion, decided that we would go to michigans adventures for the day. My sister @PERSON1 told us to carefully pack the cooler with a variety of snacks and drinks and to neatly put pillows and blankets in the back seat of the car. But little did we know that we were actually having six hours to @CAPS3 to go to six flags and that @PERSON1, Matt and my mom have been planning this for weeks. After being in the car for two hours, feeling a bit antsy, I moaned ìare we there yet?íí ìno.íí said @PERSON1 ìwere lostî ìohî  I replied. But I really didnít think much about how we were lost because weve been to michigans adventures a thousand times before. For the rest of the ride there, I was pretty quiet. In other words @CAPS4 was very asleep. When I woke up it was because my niece was shaking me with excitement. I stretched and squinted from the sunís rays. When my eye adjusted to the light, I looked around and realised that we were at six flags! When we got in, the first ride we rode was the supeman. On that ride, you sit and things lock firmly around your legs and stomach and it tilts you over @CAPS2 its like your flying. We wanted to ride it @CAPS2 bad but the line was @NUM1 Ω hours long. While we were standing in line, we found various things to do like swing and play on the metal railing, play I spy and all sorts of things. And when we finally were on and off the ride, I realized that it was really fun, and worth it and that I was patient and didnít complain. In the end, this trip taught me the value of patience and the joy it can bring when waiting for something exciting.
1027	18970	7	3	My mom is very patient. The reason why my mom is patient is because when she goes to the beauty shop, she calmly calls @NUM1 hours of waiting not a long time. She just sits there, perhaps reading a magazine or chatting with others, showing no signs of impatience. Another reason she is patient is because if I don't do my chores, she doesn't get very upset. Instead, she gently asks me to do it again, giving me another chance without scolding. My mom is also very patient when it comes to work. When she has a lot of work to do, like writing a @NUM2 - word paper, she doesn't get frustrated. She sits at her desk, methodically organizing her thoughts and putting words on paper. In conclusion, my mom's patience is an admirable trait that not only helps her in her daily life but also serves as a great example for me to follow.
1028	18971	7	3	Patience is the art of waiting. Patience is dealing with teachers at school and sincerely trying to understand their point of view. Without patience, you and your younger - sitting or young - teacher would constantly be in heated arguments. Thatís why patience is so important. Patience should be constantly exercised. In sports, it helps you to calmly accept the referee's decision, whether it's a good or bad call. You need to respect their judgment without getting overly angry. Patience also helps in learning because youíre not going to master it the first time you try. Patience makes perfect. School is a great place to use patience, whether you're learning something new or dealing with an opinionated teacher. You need to use it while dealing with energetic children because they are always trying to get reactions out of you, whether they're good or bad. In the end, itís a test of your self - control. Itís very important to have that patience, whether it's for small things like learning a new concept or big things like taking an important test. Itís better to have patience than not, as it can lead to better relationships and more successful outcomes.
1029	18972	7	3	In my life there has been many times were I have been patient and times when I have not been patient. For example, the other day I asked my mom if she would drive me to Target so I could get gum. My mom said yes, but I had to wait until she finished with a little bill. I was patient by quietly waiting for my mom to take me. When I got to Target, my mom told me to hurry up. I ran into the line at the checkout counter, but there were a lot of people, so I had to wait. Instead of getting all mad, I took a deep breath and was patient. Also, instead of my mom getting annoyed, she was also patient. One example of me being impatient is, about a week ago when I asked my dad to play catch with  me. He said yes, but you have to wait a while. For some reason, I got very mad and lost my patience. I started yelling about why I had to wait. I then realized I was being unreasonable and that I lost any patience. I quickly said sorry and then we played catch. In the end, I learned that patience is a virtue that I need to work on to have better interactions with my family.
1030	18973	7	3	Patience is one of the things that people need to have. I remember when l was in the store and my cousin, looking a bit tired, wanted to go home and her mom, being calm, said wait. My cousin was impatient that day because she just wanted to get back home and relax. I think that patience will help you go through life. For an example, if you were going out with your friend and she was driving and you got tired and wanted to go home and said lets go. Then you were the one that was impatient because she was the one driving and needed to focus on the road. Patience will always be one of the things we have to practice. If you be patient, you could do things much better. You have to sometimes wait for managers to call you to get the next job you applied for. But you can't be impatient or you won't get hired for that job. You always have to be patient because you don't know what would happen if you didn't be patient. In conclusion, patience is a key quality that can open many doors and lead to a more harmonious life.
1031	18974	7	3	@CAPS2 @CAPS1, @CAPS2 - @CAPS1, @CAPS2 - @CAPS1! The loud, rattling sound is ratling through @CAPS11 cars. All I can think about is after @CAPS6 and having a nice lunch. I grow more and more impatient as the clock steadily ticks and @CAPS11 heart throbs rapidly. I do not like the meap for that very reason. During the reading selection, all I think is, “@CAPS7 has to be the most boring story in history”. Then I turn the page, @CAPS8, and realize @CAPS7 one is, “@CAPS9 makes me so impatient. All I wanna do is finish the test. Little beads of sweat trickle down as @CAPS9 progresses slow but I do not want to be the last to turn @CAPS9 in. In the writing part, I think “What @CAPS10 am I going to write about?” @CAPS11 hand starts to ache, and @CAPS11 head will pound because of everyone's pencil running as if @CAPS9 were in a horror - film. @CAPS2 - @CAPS1, scribble - scribble, eek - eek, bom, bom, then you have to read over and over, make sure you have a proper title and read the hand - writing clearly. The most nerve - wracking part of all is the math segment. There are questions I completely forgot. All the math teachers seem to cram all of @CAPS9 in @CAPS11 head at once. @CAPS9 is absolutely terrifying. Then while you're testing, there is someone who can't sit still and their desk starts rattling. Well, if anyone could not tell, one, I am very impatient and two, I do not like the meap. @CAPS2 - @CAPS1 is the most annoying sound. Along with many others, I am trying to get a good score. @CAPS2 - @CAPS1, little, beams of sweat, libom bom, eek, eek scribble - scribble. In the end, I just hope this test is over soon so I can be free from this torture.
1032	18976	7	3	One time I was patient was when me, my dad, @ORGANIZATION1, and @CAPS1 were going to @CAPS2 @CAPS3, a well - known amusement park at @LOCATION1. Me, @ORGANIZATION1 and my dad were really excited and wanted to ride the millennium force. So we stood waiting in line for two long hours in the scorching hot sun waiting to ride the ride. Some of the difficulties we faced was that the ride was having some technical problems. So when we finally got to the ride, it turned out okay. It was a test of my patience, but in the end, the experience on the ride made it somewhat worth it.
1033	18977	7	3	On @DATE1 I was with my dad at @NUM1 am. I was sitting quietly, watching intently, hoping something would come. And all of a sudden, I grew extremely tired and I fell asleep for an hour. When I woke up, I continued watching but nothing came for an hour as I was waiting and waiting and waiting. Then from the many nights of waiting, I heard leaves cracking and I thought, “Is it really true?” On my first day, I was determined to shoot one when I saw one. I was a little too excited! I reached to get my gun too quickly and he ran away. On another day we came out, I saw another doe but to my left this time. But I got my gun even slower this time and @CAPS1 I aimed carefully and fired! Well, that's what I thought but no, it was jammed and @CAPS1 I had to unload it carefully. Then my dad called me over the walky - talky, and asked “what are you doing.” @CAPS1 I said “I see a doe,” @CAPS1 he said “then shoot it,” and it stood there. @CAPS1 I shot again and then it ran away. “I missed,” I said. All that patience for nothing. It was really disappointing, but I guess patience in hunting isn't always rewarded.
1034	18978	7	3	I walked into the big open room. The strong smell of crayon, sweet animal crackers and earthy dirt overcome the air and hit my nose like a big wave rolling in from the sea. I take my first nervous steps into the room. The floor is covered with all sorts of toys and a lot of colorful crayons. The kindergartners are running around screaming like little animals that heard they were about to be eaten for dinner. The teacher is standing right in the middle of it all. She has a distant look in her eyes and she looks like she's about to cry. When she sees me and my name tag, her face lights up a little bit. She practically runs at me with arms open. The teacher introduces herself then says they're all mine. I never would have realized student teaching would have me doing so much teaching. I knew I'd do a little but as the teacher introduced herself, then said she was leaving and I had to teach them the alphabet. So I was stuck with @NUM1 energetic kids and a “war.” I eventually, with some gentle grabbing and pulling involved, get the kids to sit down criss - cross apple sauce on the floor. It's too bad I underestimated how wild they were. As I begin, one of the kids starts throwing toys at me, so as calmly as possible I half growled, “@CAPS1 @PERSON1, that's not nice, please stop.” @CAPS2 stops for about @NUM2 way - too - short seconds. So this repeats and I end up doing this with all the wild - eyed, crazy - haired little ones. It took a lot of stinking patience to get them to finally sit still. We got to about @CAPS3 when the kids got fussy again. At that point I was feeling more like a babysitter than a teacher. I was gradually understanding how that teacher was willing to leave. Finally I get that light - bulb going off in my head feeling. I run to my purse, grab my bag of candy and say, “when we finish learning the alphabet A - @CAPS4, anyone who can say the whole thing will get a piece of candy!” I realized to them that's like gold to an adult. I was amazed and couldn't believe my ears. Every kid learned A - @CAPS4, I actually ran out of candy, although it took a lot of patience and pointless bickering. When the bell rings I hastily leave to go home. It took a lot of patience but I did it, and I reward myself by sleeping. It was a tough day, but I learned a lot about patience and dealing with young kids.
1035	18979	7	3	A day that I was patient was, one day I was really happy and excited about my birthday coming up. I could not wait to see what @CAPS1 I was getting. I thought about it for about a week, constantly begging my mom to tell me what @CAPS1 I was getting. The days passed and it felt like they got even longer and longer. I tried and tried day after day to try and take a peak at what @CAPS1 I was getting, but I always got caught. So finally my mom told me to just stop thinking about it and be patient and it would come faster. So I waited, and it seemed like it was taking forever. The next day I woke up, my brother came and jumped on me and said “ah - ah I know what @CAPS1 you're getting and you don't.” And I jumped up and said “What @CAPS1! How come you know and I don't? That's bad, tell me please.” And he said no. Then I got up and walked out the room and went to my mom and said “I give up.” She looked at me and said just be patient and it will go by faster, you only have four days left. Then I walked away. Then the days started to go by a bit faster and then my birthday came up. I was so happy to finally see what @CAPS1 I was getting. And that was the day I was patient. It taught me that patience can lead to nice surprises.
1036	18980	7	3	A time when I am patient is when I want something really bad, like a new phone or to get on the computer to play my favorite games. But that is not the only way to be patient. You also have to be patient in church, sitting quietly during the service, and in the doctor's office, waiting your turn to be seen. So there are many ways to be patient, and it's an important quality to have in different situations.
1037	18981	7	3	I was patient when I had to wait in a very long, winding line at a popular amusement park in [LOCATION1]. I had to wait for [NUM1] hours for the ride, The [CAPS2]. It went from [CAPS3] to [NUM2] in [CAPS4]! When going [NUM2], the coaster went straight up, then stopped at the top ([NUM4] yard) and we just sat there for like [NUM5] seconds! Then it moved and we went straight down at [NUM6]. It was really cool! The anticipation during the long wait only made the experience more thrilling. It was worth the wait. That was the time I was patient, and it taught me that good things come to those who wait.
1038	18982	7	3	It takes a lot of patience, especially when you are travelling for [NUM1] hours straight. When I was [NUM2], we went to [LOCATION3] for a half - a - year. Me, my mom, and my dad left at [NUM3] am for the airport. We waited there for a long time, sitting on the hard chairs and watching the busy airport traffic. When we finally got on the plane, we took the hour - long flight to [LOCATION4]. Then a [NUM4] hour flight to Los [LOCATION1]. We waited in those airports for a long time, looking at the shops and people around. Then came the [NUM5] hour flights to [LOCATION2]. That was the longest flight I've ever been on. The plane was a huge double - deck [NUM6] jet. Then we took the [NUM7] hour flight to Hawk Bay. It was a really long trip. It took a ton of patience. Well, we went there because my dad was making a golf course. That takes a lot of patience too but, it's a lot more fun. That was the most patient I've ever had to be, and it made me realize how important patience is during long - distance travel.
1039	18983	7	3	"Last year I went to [LOCATION1] city with [CAPS1] mom, [CAPS1] step - dad, [NUM1] of [CAPS1] brothers, [CAPS1] [CAPS2] [CAPS3], and [CAPS1] her [NUM2] kids [PERSON1] and Sack. The first place we went was the Statue of Liberty. We got in line for the ferry that takes you to the island where the Statue of Liberty is. The line was incredibly long and chaotic. I thought, ""[CAPS4] great"" because it was nearly [DATE1] outside and we were going to be waiting here for at least an hour. After about a half - hour I noticed that the line goes into a building. What was in there? I wondered. All of the kids except me were complaining, whining about the heat and the long wait, and [CAPS1] parents were starting to get irritated. We finally got in the building and guess what, another gigantic line! Yeah, what fun! At least the building was air - conditioned. We had to go through metal detectors and security checks before we got on the ferry. The ferry ride wasn't bad but it was quite full. On the bright side, we got to sit down. We all got off the ferry and looked up at Lady Liberty. It was actually really big. Unfortunately, they closed down the part where you get to go inside it because it was so hot. [CAPS4] Well, it was cool enough seeing it. We walked around the entire island and were trying to find the ferry. We found the ferry and waited in the line [CAPS5] until we got on the boat. I was proud of myself for not complaining. Apparently [CAPS1] mom was too because when we got back to the hotel she pulled me aside and thanked me for being so patient. This experience showed me that patience can make a difficult situation more bearable."
1040	18984	7	3	Patience is like waiting your turn to talk in a group discussion, respecting others' opinions, or waiting for a slow - loading website to fully open so you can access the information you need. Patience can be helpful in many ways such as waiting till you get to your destination during a long and traffic - filled journey, or waiting for the person you called to answer the phone so you can talk. Patience allows you to experience difficulties without complaining, making the situation more manageable and less stressful for yourself and those around you. In the end, patience is a valuable virtue that enriches our daily lives.
1041	18985	7	3	A story of being patient. A young kid wakes up from a good night's sleep. He stretches and then goes upstairs to the kitchen to get a cool drink of water. After quenching his thirst, he goes back down to the living - room and settles on the couch to watch cartoons. The funny characters and exciting plots make him become very excited, especially when he suddenly remembers he gets to go to a football game today. The @CAPS2 are playing @CAPS1. His dad comes downstairs all dressed up for the game and tells him to quickly get ready. They then drive about @NUM1 miles to the @CAPS2 stadium. Once they arrive, they find their seats in the crowded stands. The game starts, and the @CAPS2 kickoff. The opposing team makes an advance, but the @CAPS2 stop them. By the end of the first half, unfortunately, the @CAPS2 are down. Surprising as it is, the score was @DATE1 to @NUM2. You can already see some impatient people leaving their seats. Then comes the @DATE1 (halftime break). Now at the end of the @NUM3 quarter, the @CAPS2 are still down. More and more people around us leave the stadium. However, the @CAPS2 are gradually coming back. We are still here, patiently cheering them on. Now down by @NUM4, the @CAPS2 get another touchdown. They are only down by three. With @NUM5 seconds left, @PERSON1 throws a perfect pass to @LOCATION1. The crowd goes wild with excitement. We were patient enough to stay till the end of the game, and it was truly worth it.
1042	18986	7	3	This story is a story about when I broke my ankle. It happened about @NUM1 years ago. I was at swim practice, full of energy and ready to dive. I was about to dive off of lane @NUM2. When I lost my balance while getting on the block, I immediately realized I was about to fall. I quickly tried to catch myself, but unfortunately, I ended up falling into the water and twisted my ankle backwards from the swim block. It was really hard for me to get out of the water as the pain shot through my leg. My mom, who was watching nearby, quickly called the doctor. We found out that I couldn't get an x - ray for nearly a few days. So she came to the pool to get me and brought her old car. During those @NUM3 days of laying in my bed, I kept thinking about my ankle. @NUM4 days later, when I come to find out that my ankle was broken. So I ended up spending @NUM5 weeks not going to swim practice. I was so bored just sitting around. That was the time when I had to be patient for four days until I got an x - ray, and it taught me the importance of waiting for proper medical diagnosis.
1043	18987	7	3	Ok, it was a time when I was on a bus going to Texas. My mom and my family were going to see my great - grandfather. The bus initially smelt good, but then a same lady kept spraying perfume, making the smell overpowering. So I had to just sleep and snack on a couple of delicious snacks. However, I kept getting woken up by a crying baby. Every time I had to go to the bathroom, there was always someone in it. Also, when I was trying to sleep, everyone on the bus seemed to get louder. So when it was time to catch some @CAPS1í@CAPS2 (a connection maybe), my bus driver would wake us up, and we would have to get off the bus and onto another bus. It seemed like the journey on that bus would never end. You had to have a lot of patience or you wouldn't be able to just relax when the day was done. I finally got there in @NUM1 days. It was worth it because we went to six different places. If I didn't have patience, then the experience of being on a bus for @NUM1 days would have been a horrible experience, but thanks to my patience, I could enjoy the trip and the visit to see my great - grandfather.
1044	18988	7	3	"One time I showed patience was when a friend said there was something that I had wanted for a long time. As soon as I got to her place, I charged towards the computer to see if it was still available. ""Yes!"" I said, trying to calm my excitement, and it was still there. It had taken me a really long time to save up for it. As I quickly went through the order details, I was thinking ""@CAPS2 is going to be so awesome once I get @CAPS2."" Then I pressed the confirm order button, and suddenly, I realized they got the same thing too. Now for the hard part - the waiting. I went to school the next day and the next, and for a week, the thought of @CAPS2 continued to fill my mind. I kept imagining how cool it would be to finally get @CAPS2. I took the long bus ride home, constantly thinking about it. Once I got off the bus, I was waiting impatiently for it to come. I rushed over to the mailbox to get the mail and I found a box. My heart jumped and started beating faster as I ran inside and unwrapped it. And there, it was my @CAPS4 new iPad. I was so, so happy and all of my patience had paid off. I had finally got it, and it made all the waiting worthwhile."
1045	18989	7	3	"There was this day not too long ago that I had to wait. Nothing but wait. It was at basketball tryouts when we were finding out if we made the team. I had to wait, sitting there nervously, and wonder if I made it. I thought to myself, ""I wonder if I pushed myself enough. I wonder if I messed up too much."" All I could think about were the mistakes I made. So that day, @TIME1, as I was sitting down waiting to hear my name, my heart was pounding. Then, I heard it! "" @PERSON1 number @NUM1 from the tryouts, please come get your paper."" I got it, took it outside, opened it with shaking hands, and read. ""Congratulations, you had made the gold team."" I jumped up and down with joy. That day I had shown patience, and as a result, I made the team. It was a great lesson that patience can lead to wonderful rewards."
1046	18990	7	3	Two summers ago I went to @LOCATION2 and @LOCATION1. We had to drive for @NUM1 hours straight. I mostly just sat quietly in the back seat and listened to my @NUM2 player, enjoying the music. The long @CAPS1 was a very boring car ride. On the way, I intently looked for licence plates with different states on them, trying to spot as many as possible. When we were half way there, we stopped at a dunkin donuts. Since @CAPS1 was early in the @TIME1, my sister and I got delicious donuts and hot chocolate. Then we reached a whole bunch of little booths where you have to show your passport to get in. After a short wait, finally we were in @LOCATION2. We stayed there for @NUM3 or @NUM4 nights, having a great time. Then we were on the road again for @NUM5 hours to go to @LOCATION1. When we got there, all the patience paid off. And that’s a time when I was patient.
1047	18991	7	3	This story is about a time when I was patient. I was about @NUM1 years old. It was a gorgeous day outside with the sun shining brightly. The best part is that it was my birthday, and I was super excited. All of a sudden I had a brainstorm. I was going to try and ride my bike with no training wheels. So I ran inside as fast as my little feet would let @CAPS9 go. I burst @CAPS1 through the front door and I yelled loudly, “@CAPS2, @CAPS3 @CAPS7 quickly I have something to tell you.” “@CAPS4 is off buddy” my @CAPS2 screeched as she ran down the stairs in a hurry. “@CAPS5 is @CAPS3” I yelled eagerly. “@CAPS6 is coming.” “@CAPS7 on sweety you have gotta somewhere @CAPS4 your son wants us to hear it must be important.” “it is, it is, it is,” “@CAPS7 on mum we can meet him outside.” “@CAPS8, we will be outside” “ok” “@CAPS7 on lets go.” @CAPS9 and my @CAPS2 ran outside to wait for @CAPS3 patiently. And that was a time that I was patient.
1048	18993	7	3	Do you have a mother who is busy all the time? If not, I do. For some reason I like to travel everywhere with her. One day we went to a place that I forgot the name of. It was a somewhat unfamiliar place. I was so patient during that trip. Being patient is kind of hard because, you really don't have nothing to do. @CAPS1 took her like @NUM1. I just stood there quietly, looking around. I was happy when we left but I wasn't saying things like, come on, hurry up, @CAPS1’s taking too long, @CAPS2 hungry, @CAPS2 ready to leave and things like that. This experience showed that I could be patient even in such situations.
1049	18994	7	3	When I was patient, I asked my mom to buy me a bike and I had to wait and wait for like two weeks. I was constantly thinking about that bike on my birthday. I also wanted a fish, and I asked my mom to buy me a fish. She didn't say anything, so I kept asking and asking and asking. Then I realized I should stop and gave it a break for three days. Then she got me a fish. I was so excited when I saw it, but unfortunately, then it died. Four weeks later, then I asked for a turtle and she said yea she will. Then I waited and waited until she got me one. When I finally saw the cute turtle, I was happy. That’s when I was patient.
1050	18995	7	3	One time my sister and my mom were patient when I went to dicks sporting goods. I wanted a new bag, adidas sandles and crazy socks. Well, it took me hours to pick out socks. There were so many kinds, like zebra, strips, blank, blaid, and dots. I carefully examined each pair, trying to make the best choice. My sister did not get to get anything cause she did not have money, and she just waited for me patiently. So finally I just picked the zebra ones. Then I had to find the adidas sandles, but then I could not find them. I searched every corner of the store. Like an hour later, they only had one left in my size, but this girl took them right off my feet and took them. I looked at my mom and she was angry as can be. So then I went to get a bag. They had one pink left, so I grabbed it and went home. This whole experience showed that patience was needed in such shopping situations.
1051	18996	7	3	I do not have much patience because this year I'm getting a laptop. Every day, I look up laptops online. I'm so excited that I can't put down my iPod. I keep talking to my family about the laptop. I don't go a second without thinking about it. I have everything ready for it, like a laptop bag and a mouse, but I have to wait. Waiting for a laptop is not the only thing I had to have patience for. Last year for Christmas, I got an iPod as a favor, but I had to wait till Christmas Eve because my family pitched in. We bought it on Black Friday, so I looked at YouTube videos on iPod touchs because I could not wait any longer. It is hard to have patience when you want something so badly, especially when you feel like you already have it in your mind.
1052	18997	7	3	A time to be patient is all the time. If you were not patient, you would be running around all the time. You would never have time for your family and yourself. Like my mom tells me when I'm eating, “Slow down, you're not going anywhere.” If your food was about to go somewhere, you wouldn't be able to because you are too tired to do it. Always take your time to learn how to be patient. It is easy; just take your time and enjoy the process.
1053	18998	7	3	One day, me, my mom, dad, and sister were going to Orlando to go to Universal, which is an attraction place. Me and my dad were walking, and he was asking me if I want to go on this roller coaster called the Dueling Dragons. I wasn't too sure about this because it was my first time on a roller coaster, so I said no. But I never knew if I liked roller coasters, so I said fine, let's go. While waiting in line, we waited for 1 hour and 30 minutes. In that period of time, I would just watch the other people that were having their turn. I looked for the first time, and the roller coaster was going like 60 miles per hour from where I was standing. So there were still like 20 people in front of us, and I was like, “When is our turn?” And it felt like the time was going slower, and slower, and slower. Finally, our turn was near. Only 5 more times, and finally, a group goes, and it's ours. I take my sunglasses, and my dad takes his sunglasses, and we sit in the front. Here it goes, climbing the track, and I'm like, “Ok, this is fun.” Then we go like 80 miles per hour. I can't even scream; we are going so fast. Then we go upside down and twist and stuff. Then it ends, and I'm like, “No, no, no. I like roller coasters.” And that is the time I was patient.
1054	18999	7	3	On a morning of July 1st, when every one of my family members woke up at 7 or 8 o'clock am. Me, my brother, and my sisters told my mom, “Can we play the PlayStation and the laptop?” She said sure, but you guys have to wait until each other's turn. And we said, “Ok.” Then we played it. Each person had one and a half hours to play on both things. I let my brother and sisters play first because I'm the older one, and I have to wait patiently until it was my turn. Well, until it was my turn, we would have to take turns playing the game on the things. We would do that until the day was done or until tomorrow was done. That would be it until next weekend or until we can play it again. And that's what I say I do as being patient at home and showing respect to my brother and sisters.
1055	19000	7	3	There were many times when I was patient. There was a time when I was patient for a whole month. I was getting a new basketball video game, but it didn't come out until another month. So I had to be patient. I could not wait until the game came out. It seemed like it took forever. It was the day before the game came out, and I lost my money that I was going to use to get the game. So then I had to save up 50 more dollars to buy the game that I wanted. I had to get two part - time jobs so that I could help me make the money that I lost. So two weeks passed by, and then I went to the game store so I could buy the game. When I walked in the store, the manager told me there are no more copies of any basketball games. So I had to be patient for a whole nother 3 weeks, and I got very mad. So I waited 3 weeks for the game, and I finally got the game. I was so mad that I had to be patient that long, but I got what it was worth. So that is my story about being patient, and it shows that sometimes patience really pays off.
1056	19001	7	3	At a time when I was patient, I was at my grandma's house in @LOCATION1. My cousins and I were eagerly waiting for my grandma to get home so that we could go to the beach. After about an hour of waiting, my cousin and I started to play video games to pass the time and make it go faster. My grandma had probably worked for @NUM1 hours. At three - pm, I decided to watch a movie. I remained patient throughout the whole movie. Right at the middle of the movie, my grandma got home. We all waited patiently until she was ready to go to the beach. This was a time when I had truly been patient, and the subsequent trip to the beach made the wait worthwhile.
1057	19002	7	3	I remember a time when someone I know was patient with me. It was near the beginning of the @NUM1 grade. I had enthusiastically enrolled in band that year, choosing to play the trumpet. In band, we played various songs and had regular tests to ensure everyone was playing correctly. However, on my tests, my band teacher <@NUM2</PERSON> noticed something amiss. I was consistently playing the wrong notes. He kindly told me that I needed a long, private lesson if I wanted to play my notes accurately. So, one afternoon after school, I took the lesson. I began by playing my notes for him, and he immediately pointed out they were wrong. Then <@NUM2</PERSON> carefully broke down the notes for me one by one, patiently explaining the correct way to play each note. He had me play the notes again and again, both individually and together. Whenever I messed up, he showed me how to play them correctly, being extremely patient with me. Finally, I was playing every note correctly. The lesson lasted about @NUM4 minutes, and he was patient throughout the entire process. Now, I play my notes right thanks to the lesson and @PERSON1's patience. I've learned that if I need more lessons in the future, I can always count on <@NUM2</PERSON>'s patience, whether it's for extra lessons or required classes.
1058	19003	7	3	This year I tried out for the @NUM1 grade volleyball team for my school. There were so many girls vying for a spot on the team that I was extremely nervous about which team I'd get on or if I'd even make the cut. So, I worked my hardest, considering my prior experience from other teams I'd been on, and I gradually became confident that I'd make the team. After @NUM2 days of intense tryouts, they grouped us into either The A, @CAPS1 or intermural team, based on our skill levels. We received a letter that afternoon, and I was thrilled to find out I made it into the A team! We immediately dove into practice and games. We were winning most of the games and steadily improving our teamwork. Then, a couple of days ago, we played against @ORGANIZATION1 middle school. As neighboring middle schools, we were obvious rivals and were determined to beat them. We joked about it being for “bragging rights,” but more importantly, we really wanted to do our best. The first game was incredibly close, but we managed to win, and I played about half the time, actively surviving, hitting, and moving all around the court. I felt very confident going into the second game, even though I didn't play as much as I'd hoped. I still had a great time! In volleyball, you play @CAPS2 games in a match, and the best two out of @CAPS2 wins the match. At that time, we had won both of the first two games, which meant we'd won the match, but we still had to play the third game. Even though we'd already secured the match, our coach wanted us to win all @CAPS2 games. “Pretend like it's the winning point, and play your hardest,” she'd encourage us. So, as the third game started, I was on the bench with some of the other players. I waited until about half of the game and started to wonder when I'd get in. As time passed, I was getting discouraged because I hadn't played yet. I asked the coach a couple of times if I was going in, but she was too engrossed in watching and coaching. So, I sat patiently. Then, just about a point before the game ended, she looked at me and said, “Can you do it?” I shot right up and subbed in. I went to the back of the line, tossed the ball in the air, and hit it! I'd made the winning point! In the end, I learned to trust my coach and to have patience, because it usually is for the best! That experience of serving the winning point was truly unforgettable and taught me a valuable lesson.
1059	19004	7	3	The word patience means a lot of things. It can mean waiting for something calmly and also encompasses much more. It truly takes a great deal of self - control and perseverance. I'm the type who tends to complain a lot and generally lacks patience. In contrast, other people don't complain and can handle waiting gracefully. A lot of teenagers struggle with having patience. As you grow older, you gradually develop patience, but it's not guaranteed. Some adults also don't have patience, and it depends on whether they actively work on it. It also depends on the life experiences a person has gone through. Patience is a virtue that can be cultivated with time and effort, and it can greatly enhance our daily lives.
1060	19005	7	3	My mother is the most patient person I know. When she drops me off at practice, she quietly waits two and a half hours for me to cheer, fly, and dance through the whole routine. She sits there patiently, perhaps reading a book or just observing. When I go to science programs, she waits at least two hours until it's over. She never shows any sign of impatience, just quietly biding her time. Every morning, she waits for me to finish getting ready, giving me the time I need to feel prepared for the day. After school, she waits for me to buy something at the table in the lobby, patiently standing by. All that she asks is for us to return the favor. She doesn't rush us unless we're running late. And she always gives us a warm hug before we leave, showing her love and support. Her patience is a constant reminder of her selflessness and the depth of her love for our family.
1061	19006	7	3	One day there was a little boy named @CAPS1. He was really hungry and his mom was a slow cooker. She would take a long time to get done cooking. @CAPS1's stomach was growling, and he was starving. He was getting really impatient with his mother @CAPS4. @CAPS1 went outside to play with his friends. He came back home and was eagerly wishing dinner was ready. He went in the kitchen and said, “Mom, is dinner ready?” “@CAPS3 right now,” said mom. “It won't be ready until another hour.” @CAPS1 was thinking about what he could do until dinner was ready @CAPS4. He went to go play his video game. It was an exciting space - ship game where the space ship was shooting other space ships to survive. After a while, @CAPS1 got bored @CAPS4. He went in the kitchen to see if dinner was ready. His mom wasn't finished @CAPS4. @CAPS1 decided to be patient, and his mom finished cooking in less than five minutes. In the end, @CAPS1 learned that a bit of patience can make the wait for good things much more bearable.
1062	19007	7	3	Patience is when you wait for something without complaining. A time I was patient is when I was @NUM1 years old. It was about @NUM2 degrees that day, but the winds were picking up just a little, making the air feel a bit brisk. I was being patient so I could go on a ride in @LOCATION1 adventures. It was the shimmying timbers ride. The line was extremely long; when I say very long, I really mean it. It took me about a half - hour to get on the ride. Another ride I waited for was the @CAPS1 @CAPS2. But that one had a shorter line. It only took about @NUM3 minutes. All these rides require patience because if I didn't show patience, I wouldn't be able to enjoy the good rides. The last one was when I was @NUM4. I wanted to ride the thunder hawk, and the line seemed to stretch on for a whole hour. I played my Nintendo while I was waiting to help me be patient. An hour later, I got to ride that ride all because of patience. This experience taught me that patience is truly a virtue when it comes to having fun.
1063	19008	7	3	Patient is when you are listening and tolerant of how someone feels. My mom and dad are very patient with me and my sister. My sister just came and moved in with us. She is @NUM1 years old. She came to live with us. It's hard having a new person in the family. You always have to get one extra thing like an extra plate, spoon, fork, pizza, supplies, and things she needs for school. Since we have to get stuff, we have to work harder. My sister doesn't do all the things that I'm used to. My parents are more patient and forgiving with her, but I know why. Sometimes my mom and dad might seem a bit strict and mean, but she's not used to the way we do things around our home. I look up to my parents because they are so nice to everyone. Even though it's different having my sister here, I know they are still patient. Their patience shows me how to be more understanding in new family situations.
1064	19009	7	3	I do not have patience. I often find myself getting frustrated when I have to wait for things. Whether it's waiting in line at the store, waiting for a friend to arrive, or waiting for a task to be completed, I struggle to stay calm. I tend to get restless and start fidgeting. I might even start complaining or rushing things. However, I realize that not having patience can cause problems in my life. It can make me seem rude to others and prevent me from fully enjoying the process of waiting. I know I need to work on developing patience so that I can have better relationships and a more peaceful mindset.
1065	19010	7	3	I was patient when I didn't want to go to Wisconsin. I really had no interest in that trip, but I held my tongue and went along. I was patient on my way there while driving. The long hours on the road could have been really annoying, but I didn't complain. I was patient when I was fishing, not uttering a single word about how boring it was. I wasn't thrilled about sleeping on the ground either. The whole camping trip, I showed patience. The story begins. The journey to @STATE1 took @NUM1 hours. In the car, there was a TV. I watched it for a while and then I looked outside and saw a moose! I screamed, “Moose!!” My roommate's boyfriend, Mike, stopped the car and backed up. That was my first time seeing a moose. Then when we got there, we set up our tent and then went fishing. I was patient as I waited for the fish to bite my worm. I was so patient that I caught @NUM2 fish that day. Then when we came back, I had to sleep on the ground. There were bumps and rocks under me, but I didn't complain because that's how camping is. The next day, we were on our way back. I couldn't find the TV and I didn't have a drink. I also had to go to the bathroom. A sign said, “A @CAPS2 station on exit @NUM3”. I was patient and went to the bathroom and got a water. This camping experience taught me that patience can turn an initially unappealing situation into a memorable one.
1066	19011	7	3	This is a story about a time when I had to be patient. This happens every year, and I'm pretty sure everyone knows about it. It is called a birthday. Every year, I have to wait for @NUM1 days for my birthday to come. It takes quite a while, but I know I have to be patient. Being patient is hard work, but it usually pays off. Another way that I have to be patient is waiting for the @CAPS1 tests to get over. During this time, I often feel anxious, but I always remember it has to end sometime. So I have to sit there, do the work, and be patient. In the end, patience helps me get through these waiting periods and look forward to the good things ahead.
1067	19012	7	3	I played soccer for a rec. Team called the cheetahs. Rec means I was in the best division possible one could be in. Rec soccer was fun, but my two best friends and I were doing all the work, while no one else on the team was not doing anything. So I decided to go try out for a select team. A select team is in the second - highest division you can be in. When try - outs came, I was really nervous. My hands were sweating, and my heart was pounding. After I tried out for three days, if you were selected, you would get a phone call saying you made the team. It took a long time to get a phone call; it felt like it took an eternity. In between those days, I had to wait and wait and wait and wait and so on. When you wait for a long period of time, that's called patience. Eventually, patience is what got me through that anxious waiting, and it's an important quality in life.
1068	19013	7	3	I think patience is when someone is able to wait and not complain. I was never patient, so here is a story I have made up. One day there was a girl named @CAPS1. She really wanted to go to the park. But she still had to do her homework, chores, take care of her sister, and clean up the rest of the dinner. She was really busy. She started with her homework first because all she had was a math worksheet with @NUM1 problems on each side. Which was easy because they were just addition and subtraction. That took her @NUM2 minutes, (@NUM3 on each side), which isn't that bad. Next she did the chores. Her chores were to clean up her room and the living room because her sister's toys were all over the place from before. But luckily her sister was asleep. Now that her sister was resting and not making much of a mess, it took @CAPS1 about @NUM4 minutes to clean up all the toys because all she had to do was throw them back into the toy box. Now, we go to her room. It was an extremely messy room; you first couldn't open the door. So she had to tug on the door until she could finally fit herself in. The door slammed shut from all the clothes, but luckily it didn't wake up her sister. @CAPS1 first made a checklist of what she needed to do. She had to: vacuum, fix her bed, and put all the food away that was in her room back in the kitchen. That took about an hour and a half. So in all, that's been about @NUM5:45 minutes. Now all she had to do was clean up the rest of the dinner. Her mom couldn't because she had to drop off her dad at the airport for work, so it was up to her. But the bad thing is that they had spaghetti for dinner and her sister spilled it all over the floor, so she had to mop. So right away she cleaned the table which took @NUM7 minutes, mopped which took like @NUM4 minutes. When she was finally done, her sister woke up and she had to feed her and then she could just take her with her to the park. She gave her some apples and then when they finally finished, she took her sister with her and they had a great time. Through all these tasks, @CAPS1 showed patience, and it led to a fun day at the park.
1069	19015	7	3	I have had to be patient a few times in my life. Sometimes we have to be patient at the doctors, waiting for new game and movie releases. But I am going to tell you about a time I had to be patient at an airport. One time I had to be patient at an airport. The problem wasn't waiting for the plane to arrive or the line for our ticket. We had to wait because all the planes were down. We had to sleep there overnight. I was being as patient as I could, but my grandma didn't like how we had to wait over an hour just to get into the food court and then another hour just to get our food. The food court was very crowded, with people pushing and shoving. It took all my patience not to get angry at all the other people. Some examples of how I was feeling about my patience are like being at the doctors, on long car rides, or maybe even waiting for a test score, and there are many other things. Make sure you work on patience and stay calm. Patience helps us deal with difficult situations like this one at the airport.
1070	19017	7	3	I think that my coach is patient because there are @NUM1 girls she is watching. She has to teach us stuff that we don't know. Our coach has to teach us stuff like the @CAPS1 play and teach us how to do moves like cross - overs. She teaches us to run fast, and she has to be patient with the slower kids that can't run as fast. When she's teaching the slower kids, she explains things again and again with a kind voice. Our coach had to be patient when she was handing out jerseys because we all had to try them on, and it took a little of her time. So she had to be patient. Thanks to her patience, we are all learning and improving in the sport.
1071	19018	7	3	We all don't like waiting, but we have to learn to be patient. On @DATE1, when I went to @LOCATION1, I had to be patient for a lot of things. I had to be patient when waiting in the long queues at the airport and while using public transportation. Being patient means you are understanding and tolerant. Over my trip, I had to do a lot of waiting in airports. I sat there quietly, still being patient. Being extra patient was important when waiting for my flight to be called, as the announcements were slow and the time seemed to drag. Another place to be patient was when I had to wait for my bag to come on the baggage carousel. I watched the conveyor belt turn round and round. There was also a long wait at airport security, where I patiently followed the instructions. To sum up, you have to be patient when waiting in airports. When I went to @LOCATION1 on @DATE1, I had to be patient when using public transportation. When waiting for a train to arrive, it was rush hour and the train was full. I stood on the platform, patiently waiting. When I was in the taxi and there was traffic outside, I relaxed and was patient, looking out of the window. To conclude, I had to be patient when using public transportation. I still don't like waiting in line but I am patient when I do. I learned patience when waiting, and it's something we have to do as it makes our experiences smoother.
1072	19020	7	3	When me and my dad were in line for the Kencer Hauck at @LOCATION1 adventures! I had to wait patiently to get on. The line was massive, with so many people. There were families, groups of friends, all of us eager to experience the roller - coaster. It was shocking that so many people were in line for this roller coaster. We waited for what seemed like hours but was only minutes. As we got closer, the anticipation grew and it was getting hard to be patient. I fidgeted a bit, but my dad reminded me to stay calm. Finally, we got on the ride and it was insane. The twists, turns, and drops were exhilarating. So waiting for those minutes that seemed like hours was rewarded with a thrilling and unforgettable experience. In the end, I realized that patience can lead to great rewards.
1073	19022	7	3	"One time I was at the @ORGANIZATION1. We had already ordered our food and we were waiting to get it so we could eat. We sat at the table, looking around as we waited for about ten minutes. Then finally our food came! We looked at the food they gave us and we got all the wrong food and no drinks. So my mom had to politely give it all back to them. We sat there again, a bit disappointed, and had to wait about fifteen minutes this time. So we waited and waited and waited, chatting with each other to pass the time. Finally, they gave us our food and this time we got the order we had placed. We finally left @ORGANIZATION2 and we got to eat our food. Also, we got ice cream after we ate. ""@CAPS1 the good thing is you guys were so patient. Thank you guys for being good!"" is what my mom said to us when we got home. That is how I learned to be patient and that patience pays off in the end."
1074	19023	7	3	"(waiting) (heart beating) ""@CAPS1 @CAPS2. @CAPS3 is your report cards,"" said @PERSON2 Hemlock. I, @PERSON1, was the last one in line. I stood there nervously, waiting my turn. ""@CAPS3 you go @PERSON1 @CAPS11 A - @CAPS12, keep up the good work!"" said @PERSON2. ""@CAPS4!!!!"" I said, screaming happily. I ran home going straight A - @CAPS12. ""@CAPS5 @CAPS6 @PERSON1,"" @CAPS7 mom Aya said. I called @CAPS7 @CAPS9 @CAPS8 saying, ""@CAPS9. I @CAPS10 @CAPS11 A - @CAPS12! but can I order something from the internet for @MONEY1?"" ""@CAPS13 why not for a @CAPS11 A - @CAPS12 student,"" she replied. I placed @CAPS7 order and I waited @NUM1 week. During that week, I was excited but also patient, and when the package finally arrived, it was all worth the wait."
1075	19024	7	3	A time when I was patient was when I went to a skate competition in @CAPS1. The registration line was almost endless, stretching by @CAPS2. I stood there for almost an hour, shifting my weight from one foot to the other at times, but trying to stay calm. I watched the people in front of me slowly move forward. When I finally got up there and paid my fee, it was all worth it because I got to compete against my best friends. We skated together, having a great time, and I realized that the patience I showed in the line led to this fun experience.
1076	19025	7	3	A time when I was patient was at the @NUM1 birthday bash in the neighborhood where I used to live. I was waiting in line, and the line seemed like it stretched for a mile. People were chatting and shuffling slowly forward. I waited and waited, and then finally, I went to look for my ticket and realized I'd left it in the car. So, I had to walk all the way back to the car, feeling annoyed with myself. When I got back, the line had grown twice as big as before. I waited some more, and it was really frustrating. Then, out of nowhere, it started raining. I didn't have an umbrella, and I was getting soaked. I was still waiting, thinking how could it get any worse? Well, it did. They shut down the concert. So, I went home with my feet and hands soaking wet. I just lay down, went to sleep, and tried to relax. P.S. It was the worst day of my life.
1077	19026	7	3	Me, I have very little patience. I mean nearly none. When I wait, I get this weird feeling, almost like a nagging toothache that just won't go away. Weird, huh? Well, you get the picture. Let me tell you a story about when I lost my patience. It was the @DATE1, and I was at my @CAPS1 safety course put on by the @ORGANIZATION1. We had just finished up taking the test that determined success or failure in the course. They came out with the first group of people's names who passed and their certificates. By the way, everyone was outside waiting under the hot sun. The first group was done in @NUM1 minutes. It took about @NUM2 minutes to grade the tests and five to give out the awards. Unfortunately, my group was last. We all sat on a hard bench for three hours! My patience completely wore off. I just started rocking back and forth, back and forth, until my group finally got called up and we got our awards! My patience has thankfully gotten a @CAPS3 better since then. I did pass the course and am becoming a good @CAPS1. I've shot a partridge and one @NUM3 - point buck. That is my story, have a good night!
1078	19027	7	3	I have to be patient when I'm taking the @CAPS1 @CAPS2. I'm patient because I have to wait for my classmates to finish their @CAPS1 @CAPS2. Sometimes, I feel like I have to wait forever. But that's fine; I can just take a short nap at my desk. I sometimes hate being patient. It just really frustrates me. Waiting for like @NUM1 minutes just for people to finish a test. It's good because you shouldn't rush on the @CAPS1. It just frustrates me that people take so long. It's not just at school; it's at my house too, like when waiting at the doctor's, the dentist's, at a friend's house, and at the library. Man, this is so hard to be patient. But it's not good to be impatient. I wish people were as fast as I am during a test. Then I wouldn't have to be very patient. Oh well, I guess I'm just going to deal with it. Man, this really stinks being so patient.
1079	19028	7	3	Patience is a good thing to have. Good things come from patience, and bad things don't happen. But what is patience? Patience is being able to handle problems calmly without whining and complaining about them. Patience is being able to wait while others can't stand the wait. Some people are very impatient, such as my dad at some times. For a month or so, he had been carefully saving up his extra money for a new @CAPS1. Once he had enough, he got a new “@NUM1” flat - screen @CAPS1. But if he had waited only about another week, he could've gotten one about a foot bigger for the same price. Let's say your little sister is bugging you non - stop, and you politely ask her to stop, but she just won't listen. So, instead of totally flipping out on her, which will get you into tons of trouble, just wait for a parent to get home so she gets in trouble and you don't. In the end, patience truly pays off in avoiding unnecessary problems.
1080	19029	7	3	Once upon a time, there was a girl named @PERSON2. She had always dreamed to be a princess. Every present she got was either a beautiful dress or shiny jewelry. She loved to try on dresses in front of the mirror, imagining herself as a princess. She had two sisters, both @NUM1 (one year older than @PERSON2). Their names were @CAPS1 and @PERSON1. @CAPS3 house was an old, cozy house located deep in the woods. One day, @PERSON2 went out to get the mail. A well - dressed man in a tuxedo gave her a letter that looked very fancy, with gold edges and a wax seal. @PERSON2 opened the letter and read it aloud. It said, “@CAPS2 @PERSON2, you're invited to a ball at the castle on @DATE1 at @NUM2 pm.” @PERSON2 screamed in excitement. @PERSON2 decided to go to the mall to look for a ball gown. She found a beautiful gown, but it was way too much money. She asked the lady at the front desk if there was any way they could lower the price if she helped around the store for a couple of days. The lady accepted the offer. She worked and worked for hours each day for two days. Finally, her patience paid off. She could take the dress home. She drove home quickly and put the dress on. She only had an hour left, so she had to hurry. She carefully put on her makeup and jewelry and looked at herself in the mirror and said, “I did it.” She got in the car and drove to the castle. It was so beautiful the way the moon's soft light hit the gold paint on the walls. @PERSON2 got out of the car and walked inside the castle. She walked down the stairs gracefully, and everyone stared in awe. It was @CAPS3 best day of her life to have everyone think she was beautiful. She went to the dance floor and danced with some guys. The prince came up to introduce himself, and when she turned around, he fell in love at first sight. @PERSON2 couldn't believe the prince talked to her. He asked her to dance. They danced all night. When the prince went on stage, he called her name and she went on stage. He asked her, “Will you marry me?” She said yes. She had become a princess! Sometimes dreams really do come true.
1081	19030	7	3	One time when I had to be patient was when I had to babysit. My family friend has a one - year - old daughter, and I have a six - year - old brother. I had to babysit both of them because my mom and her boyfriend were going to have a double date with our family friends. Things were great until they left. My brother was in preschool at the time, and they gave them these paper books and worksheets to do, and I had to help him. I thought, “Ok, this will be easy.” My mom told me that he knows the words, so I wouldn't have to sound out every single one. But he wouldn't do the work, and the baby wouldn't quit crying, and the dog wouldn't stop barking (he hates when babies cry), and the house was crazy! I started to panic. What was I supposed to do? And I didn't want to ruin my mom's plans, and I definitely wanted to prove her wrong. I calmed down and remembered what one of our friends said; he told me to be patient. I let the dog outside and picked up the baby and headed back to the table where my brother was playing. First, I read the book aloud; it got both of their attention. Then I made a game out of doing the work, and it was all good. Then dinner time came. I made some food that we all liked and set the baby in his high chair with his food and gave my brother his plate. I turned around, and he threw his plate at me, and food was everywhere! I got mad and told myself to be patient. I cleaned up the mess and fed the kids and put in a movie, and they all fell asleep! I quietly cleaned up the house, and my mom and friends walked in and were surprised I did it. Patience is a big part in life. If you lose your temper, it just makes things worse.
1082	19031	7	3	One day my mom came home from work. She came in and said, “Honey, do you want to go shopping for your clothes now or later?” I chose now. So my mom changed her clothes, and we were off to the store. It was around 5 p.m., so it was rush hour. The traffic was bumper - to - bumper, and it seemed like it was taking forever, and I was getting mad. Then my mom said, “Be patient, and it will be over soon.” This is a time when I was patient. After ten minutes, things started to clear up. It still took a while, but it was getting better. In less than twenty minutes, we were pulling up in the mall parking lot. There were a few cars in the lot, but it didn't seem like much. When we got into the store, that's when I really was mad. The lines for you to purchase your items led all the way to the back of the store. Then my mom said, “Look. The lines are long as you can see. Are you sure you can handle this and have patience?” “I'll try,” I said. After we got in the store, we were looking for my clothes, and we were also looking at the long lines to see if they went down some. We got my clothes, then got in line. We spent about an hour in the line, and it made me mad. Not only did it make me mad, it made me hungry because I skipped lunch. When we got out of the store, we were happy and hungry. We left the store and went to McDonald's. When we were down the street from McDonald's, there was this traffic line. We got closer and closer to McDonald's and then realized that line was the McDonald's drive - thru line. We got in the lot, and I knew for sure that I was going to have to be more patient. So we waited, and the line went really fast. We got up to the speaker, and my mom ordered a fish sandwich for her and a chicken sandwich for me. We got to the next window, and they gave us our food. When we got our food, the lady said, “Thank you for your patience.” Then she asked us if we would like a free fry of any size for our wait. We told her yes and we will take a large fry. My mom turned to me and said, “Do you see what happens if you be patient?” I said yeah, and patience is a good thing to have. That was a time when I was patient.
1083	19032	7	3	The time I was patient, I had trouble with football. I needed help doing everything, like how to hold the ball properly, how to position my feet for a throw, and how to run with the ball without fumbling. But my dad helped me. He taught me how to throw, kick, run, and catch. I was patient because I watched him carefully and then tried to do it myself. I saw him playing football with his friends one day, and we went out to join them. The stuff he taught me was hard at first. For example, learning the right arm motion for a long throw took many tries. But it helped. With each practice session, I got better at football. I realized that patience was the key to improving my skills. Thanks to my dad's teaching and my own patience, I became a much better football player. Patience truly pays off in learning new things.
1084	19033	7	3	Patience is probably one of the most important things in your life. If you are patient, most people will probably like you more. For example, if you are in line for something at school, like waiting to use the school's 3D printer, and you were patient, you will probably get a “Good job” from one of your teachers for being so patient. You always have to be patient, whether it is at school, in an amusement park ride's line where there are a lot of people in front and behind you. You will want to be patient because if you are not, you wouldn't want to lose your temper in front of all of those people, cut in front of them, and possibly get thrown out of the amusement park in front of everyone. Then, you would be embarrassed. This is why I think patience is important as it helps us maintain good relationships and avoid embarrassing situations.
1085	19034	7	3	Fishing is a great sport, but it takes a lot of patience. My first fishing trip was at a lake about 20 miles from my home. I had loved fishing ever since then, but the trip wasn't easy. I think that fishing is fun because I was patient. Accomplishing what I did took every ounce of patience I had. When my uncle visits from Texas, he always brings his fishing rods and fishes in a different way. I never went with him until about one year ago. He decided that I should bring a friend so that if I get bored, I would have someone to talk to. The patience started when we were about half - way there, and oh no! We hit a fence. The car had broken down, so we called a mechanic. The wait was about 2 hours, 30 min, and my friend asked, “So, are we ever going to get there?” The wait was tough, and my friend and I were getting restless. We finally fixed the car and drove the rest of the way. Once we got there, we had two problems to fix. We had no bait. We found a nice spot at the other side of the lake. We had to scavenge for some baits, which took about 3 hours to get enough baits. We were finally ready to fish. We got the rods, set up the chairs, cast our lines, and waited. There was no way to make fishing faster, so we sat, hoping for some bites. In the end, my uncle, my friend, and I caught 10 fish! We had three for lunch and went home with 7 fish left. I love to go fishing because it relaxes me. I felt like anything could have happened, but we went fishing, relaxed, and brought a couple of meals. That's why I love fishing because it requires patience.
1086	19035	7	3	One time when I was patient was on my birthday when I was turning @NUM1. I was extremely excited because I knew that I was getting a cell phone, and that's all I had been wanting for ages. All of my friends had them, and I just wanted one because if my mom had to pick me up for something and didn't know where I was, it would be so much easier. It is just a necessity right now because cell phones are very helpful. My birthday was on a @DATE1, so the night before, I was at the football game. Everybody was asking if I was going to get a cell phone, and I kept on telling them yes, I'm getting it tomorrow. I woke up the next morning, rushed downstairs, and the first gift that I got was the cell phone. I was really overjoyed and immediately started to get all of my friends' numbers. I learned that when you're patient and not constantly asking, you will get what you want. This experience taught me the value of patience, and I'll always remember how rewarding it can be.
1087	19036	7	3	One day, me and my brother asked my dad to take us to Game Stop so we could get a new game controller. He said in a little while, so we waited patiently by riding bikes around the neighborhood for about an hour. Then we went swimming in the pool for a while. But he still wasn't ready, so we played with my dog, Macy. Finally, he was ready to go, so we went to Game Stop to get the controller. But they didn't have it. So we went to @CAPS1 Boster, and they had it. We got the controller and went home and played the game on the console. That is how I was patient all day. And the best way to be patient is to keep yourself occupied for a long period. This way, the time passes more quickly, and you're less likely to get frustrated.
1088	19037	7	3	My grandma was patient for @NUM1 months because she had a big check that kept having mistakes with it. For example, they spelled her last name wrong, so it had to be called back and re - typed every time. Each time they re - typed it, they would make a mistake, and this happened five times in a row. It takes a long time to process, and we needed to pay our bills so we wouldn't get kicked out. We also needed a new car and clothes. Our car was on the verge of breaking down, and our clothes we had outgrown. When my grandma finally got her check, we went straight out and got a brand new car and clothes. I think my grandma was pretty patient after they had to re - do it over five times. I know I wouldn't be able to be that patient without losing my temper. Her patience taught me that sometimes, waiting is necessary to get what you really need.
1089	19038	7	3	The story is about a time I was patient. I am being patient right now. I am being patient about waiting for @CAPS1. I'm not a person who likes to be patient. When I want something, I want it right that second. Christmas is my favorite holiday. There is so much wonderful stuff about it. There are cookies, family gatherings, and presents. There is always a problem, and my problem is I like to try and figure out what my present is. That is what stinks about being patient; you are always waiting for something good to happen. All my family knows not to put anything in a bag for me because I will look in the bag easily. And if they don't wrap it very well, I will find a little slit in the wrapping paper. The worst time to be patient is the night before you can open your presents. I really hate that you have to go to bed while your presents are practically yelling at you not to leave them unpackaged. Also, it seems that all holidays are like that. Well, I guess we all have to be patient about something. I'm being patient about @LOCATION1 football winning the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 and @ORGANIZATION1 and the Florida Gators. First, @ORGANIZATION1 has got to get out of the @CAPS5 bold game thing. Patience is tough, but in the end, it will be worth it when these teams achieve their goals.
1090	19039	7	3	"Topic: write a story in your own way about patience. @CAPS1, you ever seen someone with good patience? Well, I have. @CAPS5's neighbor was really eager for the soccer try - outs to score. He practiced all day, juggling the ball, passing, and working on different moves. The day for try - outs came. He went, juggled in front of the coach, talked with the coach, showed off some moves, and then went home. The coach said, ""It will be a couple of weeks to see if you're on the team or not."" @CAPS2, @CAPS3 @CAPS5, ""I can't wait that long."" After he got back, he told me all about it. ""I don't want to wait a couple of weeks,"" he said. So I told him about patience. I said, ""The more you complain, the worse you will feel when you face disappointment."" So he went home and practiced a move he couldn't make. A few days later, I was walking outside when suddenly, @CAPS4 @CAPS5's friend came screaming outside saying, ""I made it!"" I just smiled as I said, ""Patience works."" This shows that with patience and hard work, good things will come."
1091	19041	7	3	One time that I was patient was when I was @NUM1 years old when I caught my @NUM2 fish. Me and my dad went fishing on my uncle's boat. My dad stopped the boat where we were going to fish. He carefully helped me put on my life jacket and then baited my pole. And then he cast it out for me. My dad was catching them like crazy. In about the @NUM2 @NUM4, he got about @NUM5 fish. He told me to be “patient” that it was my @NUM2 time. So as my dad was reeling them in, I was sitting there waiting patiently. And then all of a sudden, my bobber went down. I yelled out to my dad. He said, “Reel it in.” I tried and tried and almost fell off the boat. My dad came over and helped me. When we got it on the boat, I asked my dad what kind of fish it was. He said it was a blue gill. He said it was a good catch for a first-timer. So me and my dad released it and went back to fishing. That was a time where I had to be patient, and it taught me the value of waiting.
1092	19042	7	3	Write about a time when I was patient. At my old school, before this school, I was patient all the @NUM1. In some @NUM2 jump, people jumped in line. I calmly told them to go. Then they wanted to fight. So I held my patience in. The teachers were talking to them about it. I saw them outside of the line. They did not do anything to me. So I knew they were trying to cause trouble to disrupt the school. By being patient, I avoided getting into an unnecessary fight and showed that I could handle difficult situations calmly. This experience made me realize the importance of patience in maintaining a peaceful environment.
1093	19044	7	3	Patience, every knows what it is and how we all can stay focused. It's like if we're waiting at an unemployment line. We wait because patience keeps us from getting angry. But if we're waiting for a long time, there's a better chance of getting angry. When you wait, you also show care. You know someone is in front of you, and you wait, wait, wait until it's your turn. Because waiting and being patient lets you absorb the things around you. You can look at things you never seen before in your whole life and study what you saw to see what it is, even if you already know it. When you are patient, you show gratitude to the person in front of you. And gratitude shows respect and trustworthiness. That's a way of being polite and patient to the person in front of you. When you are patient, you don't have to rush anything because you have a lot of time. And you shouldn't complain at all when you are or are trying to be patient. No matter how long you're patient, the maximum time is for you. And you bring up that time faster by not being patient. Patience is a big thing because it gives you what you want or need in a lot of time. I think patience is important because you never know who's being patient with you, so you should be patient with someone else. It's a simple yet powerful virtue that can make our interactions more pleasant and meaningful.
1094	19046	7	3	The first time I ever was patient before is when I had to wait @DATE1 years to get @DATE1 film out of my camera. My mom always promised me to get the film. But since her money was used on necessary things, she told me to wait @DATE1 @DATE1. So I waited @DATE1 @DATE1. Time crept up, and this is what happened. I asked my mom again, “Can I get my film out of my camera?” She said no because she used her money on school supplies. I was willing to wait another @DATE1 @DATE1. So @DATE1 @DATE1 came again. I asked her, and she said no because once again she spent her money on paying people back for helping her out, just like any responsible parent would. So I had to wait until next @NUM1 @DATE1. So I waited, and waited, and finally, @NUM1 @DATE1 has passed. But she forgot because she had to get groceries. So @DATE1 I asked her one more time, and she said, “Yes, but I have to pay my dad back for helping me, and after that, I'll bring your film out to buy.” So now I've told you how long I have waited. Also, I had to get a new digital camera because the old one had been dropped too many times. Through this experience, I learned the true meaning of patience and understanding.
1095	19047	7	3	Every day at lunch, I have to be patient while waiting to get called up to get my lunch. Especially when you're waiting in line, then you really have to be patient. Sometimes the line moves slowly, and it can be frustrating. But I try to stay calm and wait my turn. But sometimes you're lucky and you can go to the other line to pay for lunch. And then when you finish lunch, you can go out, ride, and play. But @CAPS1 you must finish your food, neatly throw it away, and wait patiently. You have to wait for your friends or for the teacher's signal. That's a time when I was patient. By being patient during lunchtime, I can avoid getting into any trouble and enjoy my time with my friends later. It's a small but important part of my daily routine that teaches me the value of patience.
1096	19048	7	3	"I was a passenger on a plane ride heading to @LOCATION1. All I could do during the flight was stare out of the window at the various towers and buildings as we passed over them. I remained patient throughout this time. I was also patient when my little brother had some issue and got a ""fly shot"" (I'm not entirely sure what that means). As a result, I had to wait in the lobby for a while. However, the biggest test of my patience was dealing with my brother. He would go through my things, break all my stuff, bite me with his toys, and constantly whine or cry over the things he wanted. Despite all these challenges, I managed to stay patient, which shows that I can control my emotions even in difficult situations."
1097	19049	7	3	During the @DATE1, my family and I took a trip to @LOCATION3 for a couple of weeks. In the beginning of the second week, I embarked on an activity I had never done before. My two older sisters (@LOCATION1 and @PERSON1), my dad, my cousin (@PERSON2), @PERSON2’s uncle (@CAPS1), and I were on our way to the boat. I was extremely excited as this was my first time fishing in the ocean. A few hours passed, and unfortunately, we didn't catch anything. But we remained undeterred and continued to wait. While waiting, we passed the time by drinking coffee, telling jokes, and playing little pranks like pulling each other's fishing lines to make them think we had caught something. We left at @NUM1 am, and by the time it was @NUM2 pm, we still hadn't caught anything. However, my dad and @CAPS1, who go fishing regularly, reassured us that we just needed to be patient. About @NUM3 minutes later, @CAPS3's fishing line started pulling. @CAPS1 quickly stepped in to help her reel it in, and to our surprise, it was a clam the size of my thumb. Everyone on the boat had been so patient, but unfortunately, no one else managed to catch anything. As it was now @NUM4 pm, we decided to call it a day and head home. @PERSON2 was visibly happy. Everyone had been patiently waiting to catch something, and @PERSON2 was especially patient as she had to use the bathroom for most of the time we were on the boat. I suspect that most of us on the boat secretly needed to use the bathroom after being there for so many hours. When we got home, we told everyone about our fishing trip and what we had caught, which was nothing for everyone except for @PERSON3 and her tiny clam. I know many people who wouldn't have lasted on that boat for even an hour. So, I was truly proud of how patient everyone was, and I sincerely hope to do it again the next time I go to @LOCATION2 with my family.
1098	19050	7	3	Being patient is not an easy thing to maintain. It requires a great deal of self - control in order to have patience. Having patience is very important because in many situations, if you're not patient, you might miss out on opportunities. For example, if you're applying for a job and you're not patient enough to wait your turn, the employer might not hire you as they're not looking for an impatient person. First, my family and I were planning a trip to @LOCATION1. We had to leave at @DATE1 am, so I couldn't go to sleep properly. I woke up at @TIME1 am, feeling extremely tired. I couldn't take a nap because I was afraid that if I did, the nap would turn into a deep sleep and I'd miss our departure. Next, I had to finish packing my things. I was really exhausted and stressed as there was only an hour left before we had to leave. When I finally finished packing, I started to watch TV to keep myself awake because I knew I couldn't fall asleep under any circumstances. Then, my cousin needed his diaper changed, so I was about to change it. But just as I was about to start, @CAPS1 called and said, “Let's go.” I was relieved and happy because now I could go to sleep in the rental van. In conclusion, I had to maintain my patience throughout this stressful situation, but it was really hard to do when I was so sleepy. I tried different things to keep myself awake, and thankfully, it worked. What really almost made me angry was having to change a diaper at that moment, but somehow, I managed to maintain my patience, which shows that I can handle difficult situations with self - control.
1099	19051	7	3	One beautiful day, my sister and I were outside @CAPS1. My mom told us that she'd be back soon. She was going to the store. A couple of hours later, she returned with a package. She said that @CAPS2 was a present for my sister, but she couldn't open @CAPS2 until her birthday. Her birthday was in a couple of weeks. My sister was really disappointed and said she couldn't wait that long. Then she stormed off in a huff. After a couple of days, she decided to be patient. She thought the days would pass quickly. And indeed, the days did go by, but not fast enough for her. My mom told her to just think about the present and be patient. It was hard for her to wait, but she tried her best. I was there to support her. We got home from the store and talked about one thing or another on the way. Finally, the day of her birthday arrived, and she was extremely excited. She opened all of her gifts except for one. The package was sitting right there in front of her. She rushed over to it and ripped it open. When she opened @CAPS2, she just stared in disbelief. In the moment of silence, she said, “@CAPS2's just clothes.” I could clearly tell that she didn't like it. She exclaimed, “I can't believe it. I was patient for so long just for clothes.” I burst out in laughter. I thought her reaction was quite funny. After I stopped laughing, she told me not to get used to being patient at home because I might never have to be patient again. This experience shows that sometimes patience doesn't always lead to the most exciting results, but it's still an important virtue.
1100	19052	7	3	Have you ever been in a situation when you know something good is coming or is going to happen and you just @CAPS1 can't control yourself? You ask your parents, “when,” and they say, “soon, just have some patience!” Well, this has happened to me multiple times, such as when we were going to @LOCATION1 or @LOCATION2. But on this special occasion, it was about getting our new dog. I decided to be a mature teenager and be patient. It was @DATE1 @TIME1, the day my family was getting a dog, and I was so excited. My stomach was filled with butterflies, fluttering around as if they were trying to fly out and explode in happiness. Everyone else in my family was equally excited, but just then, I remembered my goal of being a mature and patient teenager. So, I carried on with my normal, everyday life. I had my breakfast, combed my hair, got dressed, brushed my teeth, and then went to school. Later, when I came home, my mom announced that my dad would arrive with my puppy in @NUM1 minutes. So, I sat on my chair in my room and watched the clock tick and tock for about @NUM2 minutes. The anticipation was killing me, but I held myself back. Then, I walked into the living room, where the rest of my family was sitting, and waited patiently until I heard a door slam. Suddenly, boom! The door of my dad's truck slammed shut. My mom, brother, and sister bolted to the door in a frenzy, while I simply walked calmly to see the puppy. “Aww!” everyone screamed in delight. “@CAPS1 Can I hold her,” “She's my dog,” and “Let's name her” were some of the things that came up in the conversation. Then, my dad glared at me, standing there quietly, and handed me the dog. “You are being so patient, you @CAPS1 should be the one to hold her first!” I was so proud of myself. I had been patient, and as a result, I was the one who got to hold her first. This experience clearly shows that being patient @CAPS1 does pay off. It taught me that if you can control your excitement and be patient, good things will come your way.
1101	19054	7	3	I was at my friend's house during the cold winter. I patiently shoveled a sledding slot so that we could pour water on it to make ice. Shoveling was tough as we had to dig through a thick layer of snow to reach a nice base where we could pour lots of water. I'm usually not a patient guy when we spend hours on a task. But I kept telling myself to be patient. The reason I started losing my patience was that it was getting dark and I had to leave soon. Fortunately, before I completely lost it, we finished the job. I was overjoyed that we got the icy trail done. It was also a bit of a wait for the water to turn into ice, but that didn't bother me at all. That's how I showed patience that day to achieve a great and fun thing. However, we couldn't go on it that night because it was too late. That's my story about patience. The experience taught me the value of perseverance.
1102	19055	7	3	Patience is an important part of life, and I learned that lesson during the hunting season on @DATE1. For most of @DATE1, we sat quietly, but all we saw were various forest creatures except deer. We reached a point where we didn't want to go hunting anymore, but we still went out. As days passed and the weather got colder, we started to spot some does. My step - dad @PERSON1 said that if we didn't see bucks by the @DATE2, we would shoot a doe. When the @DATE2 arrived, we were ready to shoot a doe, but most of the day, we saw nothing. With about @NUM1 minutes left of the @DATE2's daylight, a perfect buck walked into the field. This experience clearly showed me that patience in hunting can lead to great rewards.
1103	19056	7	3	One day, my mom, my brother, and I were driving in our car. We were on our way to a beautiful beach when suddenly, our car stopped moving. The battery had run down and was completely dead. My mom quickly called a tow truck, but the operator said the truck wouldn't arrive for two hours! My brother and I complained constantly during that long wait, but my mom just sat there quietly. She patiently waited for the tow truck (@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3) to reach us. Finally, the truck came and got our car moving again. I was truly amazed by my mom's patience. It made me realize that staying calm in difficult situations is a great virtue.
1104	19057	7	3	One time I was on my way to the bus stop. I arrived @NUM1 minutes before the bus was supposed to come. So I sat there and checked my watch. It was @NUM2 minutes past the time I was supposed to get picked up. I waited and waited, then checked my watch again. It was @NUM3 minutes past the scheduled time to be on the bus. I started to get impatient, but then I thought that buses can have delays. I sat back down. I was going to an important place, and I knew I had to be patient. After @NUM4 more minutes, the bus finally came. It let me on for free because I was the only one who stayed at the stop. When I got home, my mom asked me how it went. I told her the bus was late @NUM5 minutes. She asked what I did, and I said I waited patiently and they let me on free. She said that's the reward for being patient, which made me understand the importance of waiting calmly.
1105	19058	7	3	I was waiting in line at @LOCATION1 adventure for an exciting ride. Standing there, I quickly started to feel impatient. But suddenly, I saw the line start to move. That sight made me calm down and continue waiting. When it was finally our turn to ride, I realized that we had been waiting for an hour. Understanding patience means knowing why you have to stand there waiting. You can't push or shove your way to the front of the line. Tolerance means that you can't do whatever you want just to get ahead. You can't hit, cut, push, or shove to the front; you simply have to wait. This experience at the adventure park taught me that patience is key in crowded situations.
1106	19059	7	3	"Being patient requires a great deal of tolerance. For most people, it's incredibly hard to be patient, but sometimes it is very important. A few weeks ago, my neighbor really needed a well - deserved break from her @NUM1 - year - old daughter, @CAPS1. I gladly offered to babysit because I genuinely love being with her. I definitely didn't know what I was in for. She came over at around noon, and we played games like hide - and - seek and building block towers for hours. But then she got extremely cranky. I gave her a delicious snack of cookies and milk, but that didn't help at all. She started crying so loudly that I had no idea what to do. My mom came rushing into the room in a complete panic mode. ""What's going on? Is everything ok in here?"" she asked. I told her that everything was fine, but @CAPS1 was just really cranky. My mom replied, ""Let's take her to the park. She will have a great time there!"" I agreed, and off we went. I noticed that @CAPS1 likes to do things independently. She insisted on getting herself into her car seat all by herself, getting on the swings without any help, and putting together puzzles on her own. That requires a ton of patience because she takes a really long time. I love watching @CAPS1, but if I didn't have patience, it would be extremely difficult. In the end, spending time with @CAPS1 taught me that patience is truly a virtue in taking care of children."
1107	19060	7	3	It takes a great deal of patience when you are out hunting. After about @NUM1 deer seasons, my patience finally paid off. I was using a high - quality bow and was quietly waiting in my stand. Then, a @NUM2 - point buck walked out. He was about @NUM3 yards from my stand, and I softly called him closer using my deer call. Then he was @NUM4 yards from my stand. I took a steady shot, and he buckled. The @NUM5 minutes I waited to find him felt like a lifetime. I was sitting in my stand, heart pounding, waiting for the right moment to go after him. Then I got out of my stand. He ran about @NUM6 yards and dropped. When I got to him, I was so excited because he wasn't just a @NUM2 - point buck; he was a magnificent @NUM8 - point buck. Remember to use the reliable regin blood head and be patient. You could shoot the deer of a lifetime, and all your patience and effort will be well worth it.
1108	19061	7	3	This is a story about patience. Patience is an essential virtue needed in life. Sometimes when you get very frustrated, you desperately need patience. One reason is if someone or something really gets you mad, you need to exercise patience, or you can easily get in trouble. For example, if you get mad because of someone's rude remarks and you start a physical fight, you'll get in huge trouble with the law or at school. Or if you try doing a complex task like assembling a piece of furniture and you can't figure it out, you need patience. Otherwise, you might break the furniture parts in anger and get in trouble with the store or the person who lent it to you. Another reason for patience is if you are working with someone on a project or teaching someone a new skill, you need patience so you don't hurt their feelings if they can't do something right away. They might get mad and not want to be associated with you, which can ruin the project or the learning experience. A third reason for patience is if you know someone who keeps getting you mad or keeps humiliating you in public. You need to have patience with him/her. Just ignore the person so you both don't get in an embarrassing situation. If you wouldn't have patience, things could end drastically. So that is why you should have patience. Without patience, you can get in trouble, lose a friend, and a lot of other things could go wrong. That's why you need patience in every aspect of your life to maintain peace and good relationships.
1109	19062	7	3	I have a lot of patience. For example, one time I really wanted to know if I made the volleyball team, and I had the patience to wait for the official announcement. I did not complain at all, even though I was really anxious inside. I believe having patience is very respectful toward yourself and others. Once I had a difficult test, and I really wanted to know when we were going to receive our graded papers. But I had the self - control to be patient. Others did not have patience. They kept asking the teacher when we were going to get them, and both were complaining loudly. They clearly did not have patience. Another example is we're going to go to @LOCATION1 on @DATE1, and we still had to plan the day. I did not have a ruler here at that time, and it made the planning a bit more difficult. The more I thought about the lack of tools and the waiting, the harder it was to keep my patience. Men, @CAPS1, sometimes are more patient and sometimes not so much. In conclusion, having patience helps us handle difficult situations better and shows respect for those around us.
1110	19063	7	3	I woke up at around @NUM1 am not feeling very well. I had a terrible headache and an upset stomach. I was at my friend @CAPS1's house. I tried to wait it out until she woke up, thinking that maybe I'd feel better, but I just couldn't bear it anymore, so I gently woke her up. I told her that I wanted to go home and called my mom. In about @NUM2 minutes, my mom had come to pick me up. I told her that I thought I was going to throw up. I had to wait and wait in the car until finally we got home. It took about two hours until I finally threw up. It was a horrible experience. I felt so weak and miserable. After throwing up, I felt a bit better, but it was a long and uncomfortable journey of waiting and feeling sick. This experience taught me that sometimes we just have to be patient even when we're feeling our worst.
1111	19064	7	3	My mom has patience with me and my brother despite all the fighting going on and people getting killed around here. She doesn't like us going to places when such things are happening, especially if we come home late. It's her way of looking out for us, and though we sometimes don't understand, we know she means well.
1112	19065	7	3	There was a time that I didn't want to be patient but had to be. We as a family were going to go to @PERSON2 common for a holiday. On the way, while we were on the highway, about @NUM1 yards ahead of us, two cars were involved in an incident and both pulled over. They were beside the road, visibly angry. Soon after that, the cops came. Keep in mind that we were waiting behind all this. The cops investigated everything thoroughly and called in some additional resources. @NUM2 minutes later, a truck came around the traffic jam and started working on the road. I don't know why there seemed to be nothing obvious to be fixed. Finally, after what felt like an eternity, we were let past, and continued our ride to @PERSON1. This experience taught me that sometimes patience is the only option on the road.
1113	19068	7	3	"Lots of people are good at being patient; I'm not so good at it. But when you're traveling a long distance, you have to learn how to be patient. Several times a year, my mom, my sister, sometimes my dad, and I drive up to my @LOCATION2's house. She lives about @NUM1 hours away, near the beautiful @LOCATION1. My @LOCATION2 loves when family visits, so we don't mind taking one weekend every few months to go and see her. I've had to make that trip at least @NUM2 times in my lifetime. My mom works the night shift at a well - known hardware store. Usually, she works from @NUM3 @CAPS1 to @NUM4 @CAPS2. So when she gets off work, we quickly pack up and leave. I always bring my @CAPS3 with me to keep me entertained. But most of the time, I end up sleeping. One time, I had drunk lots of pop and was extremely hyper. I was really annoying my mom a lot. So, I put in my @CAPS3 and started acting like a complete idiot, singing loudly along to the songs. Until, unfortunately, my @CAPS3 died. I felt my heart sink a little. I couldn't fall asleep now. I was still full of energy. I started listening to the radio, but all we could pick up was country music. Since we were going @CAPS7, we were traveling away from the signal range of the cool radio stations. Finally, we reached ""The up @CAPS7 store"" where we always stop to get gas and some snacks when we go to @LOCATION2's. I got @CAPS8 and even more pop. I gave a tiny mischievous laugh to myself as I handed the items to my mom. In the car, I finished my food and was bored once again. There was truly nothing to do in that car. I was really angry at that point. I looked out the window and let out a big sigh. Soon enough, I had fallen asleep. I woke up to the sound of us pulling into the driveway, and my @LOCATION2 running to come greet us. Finally, we were there. I had survived yet another long ride to @LOCATION2's house. Then I remembered, we had to drive home too. Even though I make this trip several times a year, I'm almost positive I'll never stop getting bored during the ride. Being patient is definitely not one of my favorite things to do, but for the sake of seeing my @LOCATION2, I'll keep trying."
1114	19069	7	3	"I want to go see a movie. There are no movies here at home that I want to see. ""Hey, dad, can I go to the movies with someone?"" I asked. ""Sure!"" my dad answered. I looked up what movies were playing and there was a pretty good selection. I carefully picked the movie I wanted to see. Then I realized I needed someone to go with me. I called up my friend @CAPS4 and asked her if she wanted to go see the movie I had chosen. It turned out she wanted to see it too, so she said yes. After that, I quickly got something to eat and then relaxed for a bit. All of a sudden, it was time to leave. I was running behind schedule. I got ready really fast and went to pick up @CAPS4. Unlike me, she was calm and patient. In her place, I wouldn't have been able to stay so composed. That's one of the reasons why I like @CAPS4 as a friend; her calmness balances out my impatience."
1115	19070	7	3	Do you have patience? I have very little patience. I can't wait for anything for long. When you have patience, you have to wait calmly for what you want or need. It's not easy for me, but I know that in many situations, patience can lead to better outcomes. I should try to be more patient in my daily life.
1116	19071	7	3	A time when I was patient was when I went to the glasses place. I needed to get my eyes checked and get approved to get new glasses. So the next day, my grandma called and asked if I, @PERSON1, had gotten approved. They said “@CAPS1”. My grandma then asked how long we had to wait, and they said four weeks. A week went by, and they called to say my glasses were done. So the next day, we went and picked them up. That was a time I was patient, and I was glad I waited as I got the perfect glasses.
1117	19072	7	3	“@CAPS1” I fell on my butt, again. I was trying to throw a front - full for cheer. A front - full is a big, complex twisty thing in the air where you spin and turn. I almost had it; I just couldn't land it properly. My gymnastics coach has been very patient with me. He has been working with me for about a month on this one difficult trick. I really wanted to make him proud because he is like a brother to me. His name is @LOCATION1, and I have known him since third grade. Whenever he sees me, he says “my baby!” and gives me a warm hug and a kiss on the forehead. @PERSON1 can do many amazing gymnastic feats and has competed in numerous competitions. He taught me my back handspring, the first big trick I ever learned. His patience helps me, but sometimes it doesn't. I am happy he is patient, but sometimes I wish he would push me harder. Whenever I think he gets disappointed in me, I feel really bad and always give it my all. It is an amazing feeling when you do it for him. “@CAPS1” I fell on my butt, again. Instead of the normal, enthusiastic “try again”, his response was flat and bored. I went to the edge of the floor. My adrenaline was pulsing. I was determined to get this! As I ran and jumped, everything seemed good. I did the trick and landed! For about a second anyway. My feet slipped out from under me, and @PERSON1 came running to me smiling. He was proud of me, even though I didn't stick the landing. We kept working, and eventually, I got it! I was really happy to tell my cheer coach, but even happier that I did it for @PERSON1, showing that his patience and my hard work paid off.
1118	19073	7	3	Last @CAPS3, my mom ordered @CAPS1 @CAPS2, and I was patient for an entire @CAPS3. To be exact, it was one @CAPS3, a few months, and then four months, and finally five months. Why? Well, the game came out this @CAPS3 on @DATE1, and I had to wait for it. How did I pass the time? Simple. I tried not to think about the game, avoided talking about it as much as possible, and only marked the expected release date on my daily calendars. Even though I beat the game exactly thirty - two times on every difficulty level without any help (heh, heh!), I still have to wait for another month or so for Call of Duty: @CAPS4. So this really stinks because now I can't stop thinking about it, but I'll keep being patient until it arrives.
1119	19076	7	3	Everyone should have patience. Living with patience will help you because there will be times when you have to be patient. Sometimes, some people can be patient, and some people can't. I am one of those people who can be patient at times and impatient at others. Being patient was a hard thing for me to overcome. Well, for once, I was patient in my life. That time was when a lot of elderly people were coming through the door, and I held the door for all of them. It wasn't easy because I had to be at a @CAPS1 appointment in about @NUM1 minutes, and there were a lot of them. It took about almost @NUM2 minutes to wait for all of them to get through the door. But I still continued holding the door. After holding the door, I was late for my @CAPS2 appointment, but it was still worth it as I did a kind deed. This experience showed me that even when it's hard, being patient and kind can bring a sense of fulfillment.
1120	19077	7	3	One time I was patient was last year when I was at an amusement park in @LOCATION2 called Cedar Point. I was standing in line to get on an amazing roller coaster called the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 Force. It was a very tough and thrilling ride, but the line was ten hours long. Standing in the hot, unbearable line was really painful. Usually, waiting in long lines in @LOCATION1 is no fun, but I endured it because I knew the ride would be worth it. Finally, I got on the roller coaster, and it was as amazing as I had hoped. That long wait taught me the value of patience.
1121	19078	7	3	When I went to get my new phone, I had to be extremely patient because my grandma likes to work with a specific person at the store. The man named @CAPS1, who my grandma and I were waiting for, finally came over to us. So, we went to the display of the phone I wanted, and he started talking at length about various features. However, my grandma reminded me that if I wasn't patient, I wouldn't get my new phone that day. We made our way up to the counter, and he was showing all sorts of things about the phone. I was eager to get out of there so I could look at it myself in peace. Me and my grandma finally left the store, and I had my new phone with me, and I really like it. Name one time you were patient and what you were patient for!
1122	19079	7	3	A time when I was patient was at the doctor's office. The doctor took an unusually long time, and I patiently waited for the doctor to come back to the examination room. It was a @DATE1 @TIME1, and my mom and I went to the doctor because I had an appointment. I arrived at the clinic, and the doctor called me and took me to a room. After about @NUM1 minutes, he finally came back. During all that waiting time, my mom and I were chatting about various things. I kept wondering what was taking so long, and my mom said she didn't know but told me to just wait. Then the doctor came in and started asking me questions like what I eat, what I do for exercise, and I just said I didn't know. After they finished asking the questions, they apologized for keeping me waiting and gave my mom some papers. Then we went downstairs, and I had to go to a lab to get my blood drawn. There were a lot of people in the lab, but I was patient. Finally, they called me in and took my blood. That was a time when I was patient with my mom at the doctor's.
1123	19080	7	3	"Well, I'm working on being patient. Patience is all about waiting or just sitting with someone you don't particularly like. One time when I was little, I was not very patient at all. My mom would say ""wait a couple of seconds,"" and I would immediately say @NUM1, showing my impatience. But as I got older, I became more patient. For instance, I'm patient with teachers, peers, and parents. However, there are still times when I have an impatient side. I try not to get impatient, but sometimes it just happens. I love having someone to talk to, but sometimes I can't talk to them because I'm impatient. My friends are really understanding about it at first, though sometimes they get a bit annoyed. My mom is really patient, but my dad is not, so maybe I get my impatience from him. I don't really talk to my dad much. Although I'm impatient at times, I'm really outgoing and funny. I have a lot of friends because I'm outgoing, but sometimes I get in trouble because of it, and that's a downside. I love talking and having fun. Maybe if I was more patient, it would be even more fun. I'm working on my patience. I think I can do much better than what I have been doing, and maybe if I get more patient, I will perform better in school. I know I will try my hardest in the patience department. In conclusion, I need more patience, but patience is something I can definitely work on."
1124	19081	7	3	"Patience. Wow, you want criticism; are you sure? Well, since you asked for it, it looks like I have to give it to you. Patience is something that my cousins, uncles, aunties, and even you and I desperately need, especially in these days and times. We practically need it every single day. What does the key word ""patience"" mean? Patience means that you are understanding and tolerant. Also, it means you can experience difficulties without complaining. Or in my own words, it's about long - suffering and being able to wait until what you want is done. Being patient is something that I am not all the time, but I need to be. Like my daddy says to me all the time, ""You are not going to always get or receive everything you want, so you'll have to learn patience."" That is one word I do not like, especially when it's something I really want. So that is my story about patience explained in my way."
1125	19082	7	3	A time I have to have patience sometimes is in class. I don't have a great deal of patience in general. I have to exercise patience in @NUM1 block. @NUM1 block is math class. In this class, we have @PERSON1. @PERSON2 talks non - stop all the time. He keeps talking until lunchtime, which is about half an hour. So I have to wait for quite a while until he finally gives us the classwork. That's how I have to show patience in class. To conclude, even though I don't have a lot of patience at all, in class, especially during @NUM1 block, I do manage to be patient.
1126	19083	7	3	ì@CAPS1 were gonna be late!î yelled my baby cousin @PERSON1 from across the room. She had her big, blue snowcoat all zipped up and her cute red boots laced tightly. She began to jump around with excitement, her little pigtails bouncing, and it made me laugh easily. ì@CAPS1 were gonna be late!î she repeated, her voice getting louder. You see, I was going on a skiing trip with my parents, my cousin @PERSON1, and her parents. I was extremely excited. My parents were spending a lot of time talking to @PERSON1ís parents about the trip details before we left, so @PERSON1 was a little whiny about not going right away. I tried to calm her down. ì@PERSON1, do you want to play @CAPS3?î I asked gently, tapping her shoulder. When I said that, her eyes seemed to grow twice their size. ì@CAPS4! @CAPS4! @CAPS4! Madison yeah! I wanna play, I wanna play!î @PERSON1 yelled with enthusiasm. Though she made it sound like a jumbled mess, I smiled and we began to play. She would guess, and I would let her win. She was so adorable, and I think I made her more patient to leave by helping her play a game. Finally my parents walked outside and we began our ski trip. Patience had paid off, and we were on our way to a fun day on the slopes.
1127	19084	7	3	One time I was in a real bind. I was being patient when my little brother was taking a long shower and I really had to go to the bathroom. So I waited outside the closed door, my discomfort growing. Of course, he locked the door, and in a moment of desperation, I tried to pick the lock with a toothpick. I jiggled it around in the keyhole, but it didnít work. Then I told my dad about the situation, and he just said ìbe a man you can hold it inî. That advice didnít help ease my urgency either. I was so frustrated that I was just about to take the door off the hinges. And then, just when I was at my limit, he walked right out and smiled at me. So then I went in the bathroom, and to my annoyance, it was soaked in water. I couldnít help but yell at him. Even though I lost my cool at the end, that whole experience showed that I had been patient for a long time before that outburst.
1128	19085	7	3	Iím always having to exercise patience in my daily life. Itís because I have an older brother who has a habit of not doing what he is told. Letís say my dad tells him to clean the bathroom. Well, it takes him a full ten minutes just to get up from the couch and start moving. And then, when heís finally cleaning, I have to go to the bathroom, and he wonít let me in. So thatís one of the main reasons I have to be patient. Another source of my patience - testing situations is my older sister. Sheís always on the phone, chatting away with her friends. I barely ever get to use it for my own calls. So I wait until my parents get home, and then they yell at her to get off the phone. It might take a while, but eventually, I get my turn. Thatís why Iím very patient, constantly waiting for my chance in these situations with my siblings.
1129	19086	7	3	It was @DATE1, and I was sitting by the window, sipping on a warm cup of hot chocolate. I could see the snow pouring down in big, fluffy flakes, creating a winter wonderland outside. I saw our @DATE1 tree, which was beautifully decorated and full of presents under it. I couldnít wait till I could open them. Iíve been wanting a Wii since @DATE1, but I never got one in the previous years. But that didnít stop me from hoping and dreaming about it every @DATE1. So I really wished I got one this year. After a while, my parents said @CAPS2 can open our gifts. ì@CAPS1î I screamed with joy, and I quickly tore the paper off the presents. I saw that I got a makeup set, a digital camera, and many more wonderful things. But not a Wii. I was really frustrated, my face falling. So I asked my mom if @CAPS2 could buy the Wii tomorrow. But she replied ì@CAPS2 canít afford it. @CAPS2 will buy it when @CAPS2 get enough money. Well, I was a very patient person, so I guessed I could wait. As @CAPS2 all sat around and enjoyed our @DATE1, we watched some holiday movies on TV. Then after a week or so, my parents got their paycheck. So my mom said @CAPS2 could go out and buy the Wii. ì@CAPS3î thank you ìmomî I screamed with excitement. When @CAPS2 arrived at the store, I got the Wii, and it cost @MONEY1. I couldnít believe it; my patience finally paid off. Now I got my new Wii, and Iím enjoying every second of playing games on it.
1130	19087	7	3	A lot of people in the world are patient. However, I think that my @CAPS1 is the most patient person in the world. I think this because she was born in a difficult environment where resources were scarce. She had to be patient for the basic necessities like food, money, and water. She couldnít just go out and buy food at the grocery store like we do today. She had to be patient to go through the whole process of making her own food. For example, if she wanted popcorn, she would first have to gather some corn shells. Then she would put them into a pan and start a fire. It could take a long time to get the fire going just right and wait for the shells to pop. That is a far cry from the convenience of putting a bag in the microwave and pushing a button. She is also patient with me when I make mistakes or act childish. She never loses her temper easily. That is why I think she is the most patient person in the world, and her patience is truly an inspiration to me.
1131	19089	7	3	Being patient is one of the many important things in life that we have to deal with. If you are impatient, then people will quickly say that you lack patience and need to calm down. Being patient also clearly means that you are a polite person who will not complain about anything. Moreover, no matter what happens, you will be understanding and willing to wait. Let's say somebody was standing in a line to get food. You would have to patiently wait your turn in order to get your food while the other person is getting his or her food. That is being an understanding and polite person and sometimes even a role model for little children. You are setting a good example and being considerate. These are the many reasons on why being patient requires understanding and being considerate, which are essential qualities in life.
1132	19090	7	3	Me and my brother have been eagerly asking for a dog for quite a while. Every month, mom and dad said we were going to get one, but every month we ended up getting a fish instead. Mom would carefully look online for dogs, and dad would also look through the paper in search of the perfect dog. Colin and I told them daily that we would feed it, walk it, and give it water. The month of my birthday, about @NUM1 days before the @NUM2, they suddenly said that we were getting a dog tomorrow! It was at @NUM1:00 at night, so we couldn't fall asleep because we were so extremely happy. The @CAPS2 morning around @NUM4, we excitedly got in the car. Mom said the place was in Howell, so it couldn't be that far. Colin and I were so overjoyed. When we got to the house, there were @NUM5 small, fluffy dogs. One was white and @NUM6 black. I told my mom I wanted to get her. @CAPS3 told me it was up to dad. Dad loved her, so that meant we were taking her home. We named her very patiently. And though our patience wore thin at times, it was well worth it as we now have a wonderful dog in our family.
1133	19091	7	3	An warrior named @PERSON1 was patiently waiting for his sword. He sat quietly for a full hour while everyone around him was yelling. He was in a state of contentment. All he could think about was his @CAPS1. He had a deep - seated love for swords and already had @NUM1 swords in his collection. So he waited patiently to get his new sword. Once he got it, he went after the ninjas. The ninjas had taken a boy named @PERSON2. With his magic sword, he fought bravely and turned the ninjas to dust. After that, the warrior and @PERSON2 went to school. The warrior took on the role of the teacher, and @PERSON2 became his student, starting a new chapter of learning and growth.
1134	19092	7	3	My story of when I was patient was when me and my family were going to the monster jam. It was one of the most exciting things of my life. But the trip there was almost a nightmare! It took half an hour to painstakingly find a place to park. Then, at least @NUM2 minutes passed for my mom's friends to show up. And finally, we had to wait in line for an hour. Last but not least, it took @NUM3 minutes to find our seats. Despite all these delays and difficulties, I remained patient. Thank you for listening to my report about patience and sitting through it. Patience truly paid off as we eventually got to enjoy the amazing monster jam.
1135	19093	7	3	"There was a time when I really wanted to go somewhere, and my mom said, ""Not tonight,"" because it was a school night. So I said, ""Okay, I know it's a school night."" At least I said it with good manners and loyalty! That was a time when I showed loyalty to someone. And here is a time when I stuck up for someone. Well, my best - friend was in a fight with this other girl in person. I went right up to my best friend's ""enemy"" and firmly said, ""Why don't you just go home and leave my friend alone?"" She backtalked me, but then finally we started ignoring her, and she left. That was a time when I stood up for my best friend while she was in a fight. These experiences taught me the importance of loyalty and standing up for those we care about."
1136	19094	7	3	When I had to go to the doctor, I was under the impression that I'd be seen relatively quickly. I had thought that I would be in front. It was over @NUM1 people there in line when we got there, and more people were still trickling in. I had to get my shots, so we had no choice but to wait patiently. But my mom found it unbearable because there were so many people in front of us. So, I dozed off while she kept pacing around restlessly. When I woke up, five people had already gone in. She still couldn't be patient and kept walking around, which made me quite nervous. Then another @NUM2 people went by, and the progress was agonizingly slow. Finally, she calmed down. She became so patient because they warned that they would ask her to leave if she didn't. I've never seen her so patient; it was truly unbelievable. This experience taught me that patience can be found even in the most trying circumstances.
1137	19095	7	3	When I was in the sub line and in @NUM1 grade, I stood there patiently. Even if someone cut in front of me, I didn't let it bother me. I waited for @NUM2 minutes, and the line still seemed endless. As time ticked by, my patience gradually wore thin. After @NUM3 minutes, I finally reached the point where I could get a sub. Waiting @NUM4 minutes for a sub felt as interminable as waiting for a pizza. Once I got to the check - out center, I discovered I had no money in my account. I was absolutely furious, just like someone who hasn't been paid for a year. This incident made me realize how frustrating it can be to wait for something only to be disappointed at the end.
1138	19096	7	3	One time I was patient was when my brother broke his arm. It was a beautiful, sunny day, and we were playing outside on the playground during lunch recess. He told me that he was on the monkey bars. His hands got all sweaty, and he lost his grip and slipped. Eric fell hard on his arm and let out a loud scream. The recess ladies quickly brought him to the office and called my parents. Then my parents called my school to inform them that they were coming to pick me up. They picked me up, and then we went to get my brother. We drove to the hospital, and they started doing x - rays. It seemed to take an eternity. I sat there quietly for @NUM1 hours! My parents told me that they really appreciated how patient I was. This was the time when I showed great patience in a difficult situation.
1139	19097	7	3	My story in my own way about being patient is when there are about @NUM1 people in front of you at a central point in a line. You must be patient in the lines because others were there before you, so you have to wait your turn. Cutting in line is unacceptable, and you'll get kicked out of places if you do that. You don't want that to happen. For example, if you're in line to get something to eat, you have to wait your turn so you don't get kicked out. The same goes for rides; you have to wait your turn to avoid getting the security on your back. By being patient in lines, we can maintain order and ensure a fair experience for everyone.
1140	19098	7	3	"A time when I was patient was fishing with my grandpa up north. We sat out there all day, and we trolled up and down the channel at least @NUM1 times. Each time we got bites, but unfortunately, we never managed to catch any fish. We tried our usual routine, but it wasn't working well. So, I decided to come up with a new plan. I suggested to my grandpa that we turn the boat around and head towards Shigle Bay. He agreed, but the problem was that there were a lot of rocks in the area we were going to. The last thing we needed was for the prop to get broken off. But we took a chance and carefully maneuvered the boat to where I directed him to go. As soon as we entered the bay, bam! We saw the pole bend down so far that it was hard to believe there was a fish on it. I quickly grabbed the net, and my grandpa took hold of the pole and started to reel it in. Eventually, we got it to the surface, and it was a @NUM2 - inch walleye. We smiled and said, ""Looks like we're having fish for dinner tonight!"" This is the story of when my patience was tested by fishing, and in the end, I caught the biggest fish in the lake, proving that patience pays off."
1141	19099	7	3	"@CAPS1 on!"" I said. We were in the rather cramped waiting room of my dad’s doctor’s office. My dad goes to a special doctor for his specific health issues. It was incredibly boring in there, with nothing much to do but stare at the plain walls. There also was a fundraising sale going on, so my sister and I went over and checked out what they had while my dad sat quietly reading a book. We were at the doctor’s for almost all morning. We were there for a routine check - up! That was the most tedious day of my life. The doctors were very slow and seemed a bit disorganized. “I told my dad, was he patient?” There was also a rummage sale near the doctor’s area. In that rummage sale, they had dishes, all sorts of food, some nice jewelry, and even a few diaries. My sister got a delicious Krispy treat. My sister also got a cool hat. Her hat was really stylish. I also got a small trinket, and it glowed blue, purple, pink, and sparkly. Finally, they called my dad. My dad went into a patient room. When my dad came out, he said he was healthy. He had to wait until they got his prescription ready to take and get filled. They gave him his prescription and we left. In conclusion, we should be patient with people. Patience is kindness. I am always patient with people. I hope you are also patient with people."
1142	19100	7	3	One day in the beginning of fall, @PERSON1 was comfortably sitting on the couch, watching TV. As she was intently watching her favorite show, a commercial suddenly comes on and says that the final movie, of a very popular fantasy series, is coming to theaters tomorrow night. The next day at school, everyone was extremely excited. They all couldn't wait to see the movie that night. Finally, the time came to go get the tickets. When @PERSON1 got to the theater, a huge line was already formed, stretching around the corner. @PERSON1 was patiently waiting in the line. Then she realized her best friend, @PERSON2, was just a few people in front of her. Then the rich popular girl showed up at the line. Her name was @CAPS2. She arrogantly walked up to the ticket booth and tried to cut everyone in line. She even tried to pay extra money for a better seat just because she thought she was special and because she cut people in line. The ticket seller firmly said that she would just have to get in line like everybody else. That made @CAPS2 mad, and because she didn't get in line when she first got there, more people got in line behind her. But all that time @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 were chatting away. Since they were patient, time flew by and the next thing they knew they were at the ticket booth buying tickets. But @CAPS2 thought it took forever to get her tickets cause she was not patient. In the end, patience truly pays off, and it's important to respect others in a line.
1143	19101	7	3	I was patient when I went to Cedar Point. I had to wait in line for a really long time for a particular ride. There were a lot of people there, trying to figure out the longest word in some kind of game near the entrance, something like “drogster”. I had to wait for almost an hour for a ride that lasted only a few minutes. That is the reality of waiting at a popular amusement park. But despite the long wait, I remained patient, and it was still a fun experience overall. Patience allows us to enjoy the little things and make the most of situations, even when we have to wait.
1144	19102	7	3	One day my family and I all went to Cedar Point. I was so excited that I could barely contain myself in the car on the way there. When we arrived, I quickly rushed out of the car, eager to start our day of fun. We got our tickets and a detailed map of the park. Then we decided what ride we wanted to go on. We were gonna go on the Fire Dragon. There was such a long line that it seemed to stretch on forever. It felt like the line wasn't even moving at all. I was as patient as can be, trying to distract myself by looking at the other rides in the distance. I was so excited to try this ride. The family finally moved up, little by little. Finally!!! We were next. We all got in our seats and carefully made sure we were buckled in nice and tight. The roller coaster was about a couple of minutes long, but it was full of twists, turns, and thrills. It was definitely worth the wait. That was the time I was patient, and it taught me that patience can lead to great experiences.
1145	19103	7	3	One Friday evening I was at the popular ice - cream store, Frasty’s. The line was huge. There had to be over 30 people there and I was in the middle of the line, sitting there waiting patiently. I was thinking about what I am going to get, maybe a chocolate sundae or a strawberry milkshake. One by one, the employees took the orders. Until one short old lady hadn't decided what she was going to get yet. I sat and waited as she rambled on, asking the prices, if it was sugar - free, what toppings it had on it, and so on. Finally, she ordered. I was at the front of the line and all of a sudden a group of people come up. I guess they were “holding their place in line”. There had to be 5 of them, yelling at the person behind the glass like a rowdy bunch. Finally, the order was done and I was up. Just then, a sweet old lady asked, “Can I cut in front of you, dear?” I had to say yes. It wouldn't be nice if I didn't. That is my story about being patient. Patience in such situations shows our kindness and respect for others.
1146	19104	7	3	My brother Matt has never been the patient type of guy. He always gets extremely frustrated whenever something or someone takes an unusually long time. We always have to exercise patience with Matt, but that all changed one day. Me, my mom, my nephew, Matt and his girlfriend decided to go out and get something to eat at a popular diner. While we were there and waiting in the long line, I made a bet with Matt’s girlfriend. The bet was that for however many impatient comments he said, she would owe me two dollars for each one. If he did not say any impatient comments, I would owe her two dollars. After the waitress took our orders and left, we all started chatting. The adults talked about work and various other things, while me and my nephew, @PERSON1, talked about school and other related topics as well. That took up at least a couple of minutes. The remaining couple of minutes, we watched the exciting football game that was playing on the TV. During those couple of minutes, including the couple minutes when we were talking, I did not hear Matt utter one impatient comment. I was really impressed. I was a bit upset that I owed Matt’s girlfriend two dollars, but it was worth it to see Matt being patient for once.
1147	19105	7	3	One time when I was patient, I went hunting with my mom. You have to possess a great deal of patience to do that. When my mom and I were sitting quietly in the deer blind, she was carefully getting her crossbow ready for when a deer came into sight. But we were sitting there for about @NUM1 hours. I was on the verge of losing my patience, but then some deer came in, a mother deer and her cute little fawn. My mom didn’t want to shoot the mother or the fawn, because then the fawn would be left all alone. So we waited patiently for more deer to come in, but none did. But I still managed to hold onto my patience. When it started to get cold and dark outside, we thought no more deer were going to come in, so we just went home. Plus, my mom was starting to lose her patience a little bit. But that’s the time I was patient for a little while, and it taught me the value of waiting.
1148	19106	7	3	When I think about patience, I usually think of my mom, and how incredibly tolerant and understanding she is. Even when she has explained something to me about @NUM1 times and I still don’t understand, she helps me without a single complaint. A good example of this is when she and my dad taught me how to ride a bike. It was the @DATE1 time and I was about five years old. My dad was at work and my mom and I were feeling bored, so she went into the garage and pulled out my brand - new bike. My dad had told me that you needed to turn the handlebars before you crashed, but I kept forgetting and falling down. Devastated that riding a bike wasn’t easy, I gave up a little bit after a few tries. Now, though, my mom gently and encouragingly persuaded me to try again. Holding on to the bike firmly, she told me to pedal. She let go, and yelled, “Turn! Turn!” but it was no use. I turned the wrong way and toppled over on the soft grass. “It’s okay. You almost had it!” mom said as she rushed over to me. Putting on a brave face, I tried again. Over and over, I attempted to ride my bike. Not once getting mad at me, mom helped me up every single time. On my one last try before it was time to go back in the house, my mom let go and I rode all by myself, around the corner and back! When I got back, we both did little happy dances, my mom congratulated me warmly, and we called my dad to brag about my new accomplishment. To me, my mom showed remarkable patience that day. She didn’t let me give up and she never complained. Overall, my mom is a perfect example of patience, and because of that, she taught me how to ride a bike and the importance of perseverance.
1149	19107	7	3	You’ve got to try to be patient with homework. One time when I was doing my homework, I started to become impatient. Because I was having a really hard time understanding the problems. But then my dad said he was going to help me. He told me to be patient. So I sat there quietly and waited. And I stayed patient as long as I could. Then he finally came over to help me. I usually get impatient when it comes to homework or something similar. You truly need to try your hardest to be patient, as it will make the learning process much smoother.
1150	19108	7	3	Everyone has been patient at one time in their lives. I know I have. A year ago, my brother and I had a project to complete. That we both needed a computer to finish. I let my brother go first. Since there is only one computer in the house, I had to wait. After several hours, I checked to see if my brother was close to being done. He was not, but I had remembered at that moment that he was a slow typer. He finally finished the next day. I had no problem with it because I had plenty of time to type my paper. This is the time I was patient, and it showed me that being patient can lead to a more harmonious situation.
1151	19109	7	3	One time when I was patient was when I went to camp. I had to wait @NUM1 long hours in the stuffy bus till we finally got to the camp. During the journey, I mostly slept and ate some snacks I had brought along. We also watched movies on @PERSON1's @CAPS1 player to pass the time. We finally arrived at the camp, but I had to wait some more for the registration process. Moreover, I had to wait till the heavy rain stopped so I could carefully get my stuff into our cabin without it getting wet. Next, we waited for chapel to start. There were other things to do there like playing tennis, volleyball, or sitting by the lunch room and having a friendly chat with friends, or alternatively, reading a book in your cabin. When the bell rang, we all went into the program center and patiently waited for chapel to end. By the end of the week, we had shown a great deal of patience. Oh, at lunch, we had to wait for seconds because the food was really delicious. Finally, I had to wait another @NUM1 hours on our way back home. This is a time I had patience. (A whole lot of it), and it made the camp experience more memorable.
1152	19110	7	3	One day on earth, an unexpected event occurred when an alien race came. They were called “@CAPS1”. These aliens had a strong desire for these special things called the @ORGANIZATION2 balls, which were said to summon a @ORGANIZATION2, and it would grant you a wish. @NUM1 powerful and strong fighters, @CAPS2, @ORGANIZATION1, had to step up and stop them. However, the aliens were incredibly strong. @ORGANIZATION1 was already in a tough situation and was defeated. Then, @ORGANIZATION1 trained rigorously with king @CAPS3, while the others were anxiously waiting for @ORGANIZATION1 to return. Finally, @ORGANIZATION1 came back with new strength and beat the crud out of the aliens. Thanks to @ORGANIZATION1's efforts, the earth was saved, and peace was restored.
1153	19111	7	3	One day after school, I was told I had a doctor's appointment. So I asked, “When?” and my mom said @NUM1. I had a dance after school that started at @NUM2, so I exclaimed, “@CAPS1! I have a dance at @NUM2!” She started talking, but it seemed like a bunch of “bla bla bla” to me. Well, at least that's what I heard; @CAPS1, I might have been wrong. “@CAPS1, mom, it's my first dance!” I said with obvious anger. But she asked me to get in the car. As time passed, we were in the waiting room for an hour. I had already missed half of the dance. I was quiet then. Finally, we were in the office and then went home to quickly get ready for the dance. And despite the set - back, I had a great time and a blast at the dance.
1154	19112	7	3	Patience, you should have patience in whatever situation it comes to. If you don't have patience, here are some things that can happen. Once, my sister's friend was wanting to cross the road. She was in a hurry and didn't want to wait. So, she didn't look both ways, and a car was coming. She ran out in front of it and got hit by the car. She had cuts and road burn all over her body. She was taken to the hospital where me, my sister, and mom went to go see her on the day of the accident. She was all cut up and could hardly walk. She had so many cuts that someone had to help her move around. Later, maybe about a month after she got hit, she went to the doctor because she kept getting really bad headaches. They said she had something called coma atices, like she had a little coma. So, that's what happens when you don't have patience, even over something as small as crossing the road. You have to have patience for that too. But if you have patience, good things can happen. Like a story my mom told me. She told me to wait in the car with the windows up and the air on. So I did. I was getting really bored and was about to get out, but then I saw two guys trying to open a car window. So I grabbed my cell phone, went to the back, sat down on the ground, and called @NUM1. The police were on the way and were in the driveway. Now they got out of their cars and ran over to the guys and caught them. They soon found out that the @NUM2 guys were guys they had been looking for. So I got a money award for catching them. The money award was @NUM3 dollars. So my patience of not getting out of the car got me money, saved my life because they would have killed me if they seen me, and helped find bad guys. So, sometimes patience can save lives and help find bad guys. You never know what you could get from having patience. So that's my story about having patience and what it can give you. So you should always have patience in life.
1155	19113	7	3	One person I know was very patient one time I was with them. That one person was waiting for a call or e - mail that was promised to come. The call or e - mail was about a basketball team that was very dominant in the state. The person who was going to call or e - mail the person I was with was the coach of that team. He saw the person I was with, which was my brother, play in a tournament downstate in @LOCATION1. The coach was there to recruit talented players for his @CAPS1 team. He watched one of my brother's games closely and approached him after the game. They had a detailed talk about the team, and the coach told my brother that he would be a great asset to the team. My brother said he would love to play for him and gave the coach our phone number and his e - mail address. The coach said he would contact him in @NUM1 days maximum. On our long drive home, which took us @NUM1 days, my brother kept checking his e - mail every now and then. On the @CAPS2 day, the coach never called or e - mailed him. The second day still brought no news. My brother was very patient and never stressed out over it not coming. The third day on our trip back home, when my mother told him that it might not happen, my brother was very understanding. So we got home at @NUM3 o'clock, and I was starting to doubt that my brother made the team. Then the phone rang. My brother talked for a while and then hung up and said he made the team. That is one time my brother showed remarkable patience, and it paid off well.
1156	19114	7	3	A wise man once said patience is a virtue. Let's find out if that wise man is right. I'm going back @DATE1 years. I had just talked to my parents. I said, “@CAPS1, can you call me when this Lego for @CAPS2 arrives?” “@CAPS3,” @CAPS5 said. Then @CAPS5 asked me to move. I kindly stepped aside, and @CAPS5 placed the order. It was @DATE1 when I asked her, “@CAPS1, do you know when my Lego is coming?” @CAPS5 said, “It should be here before or after @CAPS2.” I replied with an “@CAPS7.K..” It was the week before @CAPS2. I checked the mail. “No package,” I thought to myself. So I checked the porch, but there was nothing. A week after @CAPS2, the mailman came. I could see a package on top. It turns out the wise man was right; patience is a virtue. This is the time I was patient. I also learned it's better to wait for some things, as good things come to those who wait.
1157	19116	7	3	One day, my mom and dad were looking up vacations on the internet. They came across a vacation to @LOCATION1, a place just outside Traverse City. We decided to go for @NUM1 days, and it was going to start next month. I was excited to go, but I still had enough patience to wait until the people called us to confirm our reservation to @LOCATION1. When the day finally arrived, I was really excited. We packed everything and got ready to go. Even the dogs were eager to join us. After putting the dogs in the car, we started our journey. We had to take the dogs to my grandma's because there was nowhere else for them to stay. So we dropped them off and then started heading to @LOCATION1. It was a four - hour drive. When we were about an hour into the drive, my sister got really impatient and kept asking, “Are we there yet?” But I just sat there, looking out the window. Then we reached a pitstop. We went in to get water and drinks. My mom and dad wanted coffee, but they had some trouble getting it. So we had to stay there for about @NUM2 minutes until they finally got their coffee. Me and Miranda just sat there patiently the whole time. Then we remained patient throughout the rest of the ride to @LOCATION1. This experience taught me that patience makes the journey more bearable.
1158	19117	7	3	Can you @CAPS1 a time in your life when you had to wait for something for a very long time? I had to wait for a long time. Do you think you know what it was? It was @CAPS2 eve. I was only five at the time. So I woke up on @CAPS2 eve, and I couldn't wait until tomorrow. I kept telling myself that all day. I went outside to try and pass the time, but it was freezing cold outside. So I had to come right back into the house. I had nothing to do, so I just kept waiting. Then, “@CAPS4,” my brother got up, and I played with him the whole day until it was time to go to sleep. I ran straight up to my bedroom and got right into bed. I woke up the next morning, and I was so happy that I didn't have to wait anymore. I had to wait for what seemed like forever. Now I'm thirteen, and I don't really care as much, but I would still love to hear about your similar experiences someday. It shows that as we grow, our perspective on waiting changes.
1159	19118	7	3	I was at @ORGANIZATION1, waiting in line for a ride that I really wanted to go on. The line was huge! It was like a long line of dominoes. I don't like waiting in big lines. Like most kids, I don't whine and fuss about waiting. In my head, I'm thinking about when I'll get to go on the ride. I don't scream and shout; I just try to stand still and wait. Time ticked by, “tic tac, tic tac.” I was just waiting for the line to get shorter. Minutes later, it was finally my turn to go on the rollercoaster. I was so excited! I went on the ride, and it was fantastic! The only thing is that it was only a minute long, while the line that I had to wait in was about an hour. Well, it was all worth it. This shows that sometimes the wait for something great is well - justified.
1160	19119	7	3	On @DATE1, me and my two friends were all laughing out loud. Then I remembered that in @NUM1 min, I had to eat dinner. So I walked inside, and my friends were being so patient. They didn't leave me. I hurried as fast as I could so I wouldn't keep them waiting. After I finished eating, we went back up to the park and swung on the swings. Then we walked back to my home because they had to leave and go home. That was my @DATE1. It was a fun day filled with the kindness of patient friends, and I'll always cherish the memories of that day.
1161	19120	7	3	@CAPS4  @CAPS1 lives in Ohio, a state known for its friendly communities. He attends @CAPS2 middle school, where he has made many friends. One day after school, as he was walking home, @CAPS3, his close friend, asked him to wait in the school's parking lot. @CAPS3 wanted to call his mother and ask if @CAPS4 could stay at his house for the weekend. @CAPS4 patiently waited for an entire half - hour while @CAPS3 talked and argued with his mother on the phone. But after @CAPS3 finished talking, he sincerely thanked @CAPS4 for being patient. Then they all spent a fun - filled weekend at @CAPS8 house.
1162	19122	7	3	One time I was patient. It was the time I really wanted an iPod Touch. My grandma, who always loved to surprise me, was bidding on an iPod Touch at an online auction. The bidding process took a long time as there were many other bidders interested in the same item. But in the end, we won the bid. After that, it took a long time for the seller to ship it. We had to wait for several days, constantly checking the tracking information. However, we finally got it. In the end, all the waiting paid off as I got to enjoy my new iPod Touch.
1163	19123	7	3	If you were someone sitting next to me on a bus on the way to @LOCATION2, you would definitely call me patient. You'd see me sitting calmly, looking out of the window, not showing any signs of restlessness. Although if you were my best friend and it was the day before you took me to @LOCATION1ís @CAPS1, thatís a different story. Iíll tell it to you anyway though. My best friend @PERSON1 and I had been talking on the phone everyday for at least an hour each day for about two weeks straight, excitedly planning our upcoming trip. Finally, @PERSON1 asked me over. And if I wanted to go to @LOCATION1ís @CAPS1 the next @DATE1! Of course, I said yes without hesitation, and soon enough, it was planned that I would spend the @TIME2 on @DATE2 and leave @DATE1 for @CAPS3 with her. The next few days were a bore, just sitting at home and babysitting my brothers. It seemed like a millennium later that @DATE3 @TIME1 came. @PERSON1 called and said that I probably wouldnít be able to spend the @TIME2, but we were still planned to leave for @CAPS3 at @NUM1:ooam on @DATE1. I said I was okay with it, but I was still uber bummed. @DATE2 came and it was complete torture. I babysat my brothers, but there was nothing to keep any of us occupied. We tried running around the house a few times, but that only took about ten minutes. We then decided it was time for a movie. We watched @CAPS5 to burn at least two hours of spare time. We had lunch and after that, things went by super quick to make up for how slow it had been passing. I talked to Kenzie for at least two hours, and then my parents came home and everything went about as usual. Next it was time for bed. I tossed and turned in my sheets, but couldnít get to sleep. Kenzie ended up calling me at @NUM2 just to tell me that she was eating a piece of pizza, which didnít help at all. Finally, I fell into a deep sleep that was much needed. The next morning, I got dressed, packed my bags neatly and was ready to go. Kenzie, her mom and her brothers arrived and we were finally off to a sweet @DATE4 day of @LOCATION1ís @CAPS1. The ride there seemed five minutes long, but that was a good thing.  We were there! We went on tons of sweet rides and got @CAPS7 @CAPS8 for dessert. I was both patient and impatient at parts. Now you know that for me, if Iím very impatient, but if its somethings smaller, I can wait.
1164	19124	7	3	I was patient when I was in school when my teacher left the room. The moment the teacher stepped out, the kids started going crazy. They were standing on the tables, making a ruckus. They were throwing paper @ORGANIZATION1 planes and paper all around the @ORGANIZATION1, creating a complete mess. The noise was deafening as they were screaming at the top of their voices. Meanwhile, I was just sitting there quietly, watching them in disbelief. Soon, the teacher came in and saw what was happening. I was just sitting there, amazed at how stupid they were acting. Then I watched as they got in trouble and received calls home. I was thinking it was a good thing I was not part of it because I might get kicked from the cross - country team, which I loved so much. The kids were suspended from having lunch. I hope that this never happens to me again because I was just a witness, and being a witness could potentially get the kids in even more trouble.
1165	19125	7	3	A time when I was patient is last year when my dad took me hunting. It all began when we woke up at @NUM1 in the morning. We quickly got dressed in our warm hunting gear and left to go get in our deer blind. The deer blind was a small, secluded place in the forest. As soon as we got there, we heard a lot of gun shots. There were sounds from shotguns, rifles and even black powder guns. The noise echoed through the forest. We sat there patiently all day, not moving much, waiting for a deer to appear. We didn't even take many breaks, just sitting quietly. When it was dark again, we packed up our equipment and left. Me and my dad didnít see anything that whole day, but I didn't complain. That is a story about how I am patient.
1166	19126	7	3	"One day I was going hunting and I was patiently waiting in the living - room for my dad to get his hunting clothes on. When he finally did, we grabbed our hunting gear and headed out to the nearby woods. After that, we carefully got into a well - hidden blind. As we sat quietly, we patiently waited for fifty minutes. Just then, a deer gracefully came into the clearing. It was a perfect doe with a sleek coat. Finally, the deer slowly made its way in front of the blind about @NUM1 or @CAPS1 yards away and my dad quietly said in my ear, ""wait for it to turn broadside."" @CAPS1 I held my breath and waited until it turned and then I shot the doe. Finally, we got out of the blind and started to search for my arrow but never found the deer. I knew I had to have patience for next year's hunt and learn from this experience."
1167	19127	7	3	One time I saw this awesome @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 in a store window. It looked so great with its shiny finish and unique design. So I asked my mom if we could get it, and she said we'd go for it tomorrow. I waited and waited, sitting around at home, trying to distract myself with books and TV. I was very patient at first, but as the day wore on, I started to get a little irritated because it was taking so long. I was kind of getting impatient, but I didn't complain though. Even to this day, I still want that @CAPS3. I guess I just have to be patient and wait for the right time.
1168	19129	7	3	@CAPS1 brother was patient once. @CAPS1 brother showed patience by being understanding and tolerant. He demonstrated understanding and tolerance by sitting down quietly and waiting. He was waiting in the doctor's office to get stitches after an accident. I was being patient by waiting with him, sitting beside him in the uncomfortable waiting - room chairs. We always try to be patient when we have to wait for something. Another time I was being patient is when I always get @CAPS1 hair cut or my hairline trimmed. I had to wait in a long line at the barbershop to get @CAPS1 hair cut. These are some of the times I had to be patient and I've learned that patience is an important virtue.
1169	19130	7	3	One day I had a doctor's appointment. I arrived at the clinic and had to check - in at the front desk. The receptionist gave me a form to fill out, and after I did that, I had to sit in the waiting area and be patient till the doctor called me back to get my check - up done. I sat there, flipping through old magazines, waiting for my turn. Then I had to wait till the real doctor came to see how I was feeling and to see if I was eating well too. The doctor asked me a lot of questions and examined me thoroughly. After that, I had to go to the check - out desk to find out what my next check - up was. Then I had to get my pills refilled at the pharmacy next door. Finally, I went home, glad that I'd been patient throughout the whole process.
1170	19131	7	3	One time I was patient was when my mum said that she would buy me a @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS1. I was so excited when she told me, imagining how great it would be to have it. I waited and waited and waited and waited for her. I knew I had to be patient because she was going through hard times at work, dealing with a lot of stress and long hours. I tried to be understanding and not pester her about it. Even though the waiting was tough, I held back my eagerness. I'm still hopeful that one day she'll be able to get it for me, and I'll keep being patient until then.
1171	19132	7	3	These stories are about times when I was patient. This is one story. So one time on this @DATE1, my guardian was putting my winter clothes away. I told her, “These are my good clothes, and they're not really winter clothes.” She said she knew and that she was just putting them up because I had too many shirts that were the same color. I was trying to talk back, then I was like, “Oh, I see what you're saying,” because I couldn't fit everything in my dresser. So I was patient and helped her put my clothes up. Patience means being able to do what somebody asks you or doing the right thing for people. It also means being able to help somebody when you think they need help. In this situation, being patient made the chore easier and helped me get along better with my guardian.
1172	19134	7	3	Once upon a time, I was at the doctor's office, and it was very crowded. Well, while my mom went to give the boy the information about me, I was sitting down next to this lady, and her daughter was crying. When my mom came back, and the doctors were calling names, I was trying to be patient. So I got up, went to the kids' play area, and started to play. A couple of minutes later, the doctors finally called my name. We got there at @NUM1, and the doctors called me at @NUM2 pm. So they gave me a shot, and I sat in the room for @NUM3 minutes. Then they gave me some medicine and told me to go to the pharmacy at @CAPS1 to get the prescription. That was the time I was being patient. Even though it was a long wait and there were distractions like the crying child, I managed to stay calm and wait my turn, which made the whole experience smoother.
1173	19135	7	3	I was being patient when I was waiting for my own phone so I could text my friends, call them, and do more. I was also waiting to get my own snowmobile license so I could ride my own snowmobile on the trails. No matter what, you should always be patient. Whether it's waiting for a new gadget to connect with others or for a license to enjoy a hobby, patience is key. It helps us to stay calm and focused while we wait for the things we want, and it makes the eventual reward even more satisfying.
1174	19136	7	3	Playing hockey is important to me. I am a goaltender playing for Farmington Hills. Playing goal takes skill, having “thick skin,” and most importantly, being patient. Every game day, my dad tells me, “Be cool, calm, and collected,” the three C's (as I call it). I step on the ice and wait patiently for the puck to come my way. Once it does, I am in action. The period ends, and I wait patiently. The second period is here. I stand waiting for the drop of the puck, hoping we score. Goal!!! Goal!!! @NUM1 to @NUM2. My patientness helped; it's @NUM1 to @NUM2! The third period comes. Goal!! Big save by me (that's me)! Goal!! Goal!! @NUM5 to @NUM2. That's it, the game is over! I waited patiently to get that win against the @LOCATION1. After the game, we all go and party at @CAPS5 @CAPS6's house to celebrate a big win. And we all had a really great time doing it too. Patience in hockey, like in many things, is crucial. It allowed me to stay focused and make the saves needed to secure the victory.
1175	19137	7	3	This is a story about a time when I was being patient waiting for a plane in an airport. We were on our way to @LOCATION1, and we had to take two planes to get there. When we got off the first plane at the second airport, we went to check what time our second flight would arrive. When we found out the time for the second flight, we were shocked because we had to wait six hours for it to come in. My mom told me I had to be patient, but I'm not good at being patient. To get things off my mind, we decided to eat. When I was done eating, I was about to scream because I wanted to go, but I reminded myself to be patient. So I went to the gift shop to try and get it out of my head. Only three hours had passed, and it was really annoying me. So I started to play my DS. Before I knew it, we only had one hour left, so playing my DS distracted me. I got impatient really fast, so that's when my sister and I started goofing around. All of a sudden, our plane arrived. I was so happy. My mom was so proud of me for being so patient that she bought me something from the gift shop. So I finally learned to be patient. Through this long - wait experience, I realized that with some distractions and self - reminders, I could be patient and make the best of a difficult situation.
1176	19138	7	3	There have been times where I had to be patient. This one time I went to the dentist, we got there early in the morning and we sat down in the waiting area. Let me tell you something, I really hate the dentist. The waiting room was filled with other patients, some reading magazines and others looking a bit anxious. So we probably sat there for an hour or two, just twiddling our thumbs. But only one good thing I got was missing school. I think we had a test that day, and I secretly hoped I wouldn't have to take it. I think the worst places to go are the dentist and doctor. The one thing about the doctor is you don’t have to wait as long. That means you can get in and go. But sometimes you have to be patient, like when you get a job or an interview. One good thing is that patience can get you to good places. Being patient is a polite way to go. So if you're all prepped up, you want to go down the patient way. Not being patient is just disrespect. It's like treating things like dirt. Patience is sort of like table manners, nice and professional. If I were you, go the patient way as it leads you to a good future.
1177	19139	7	3	"Patience is very important. If there were no patience, everyone would be irritated all the time. Without patience, we wouldn't be able to get through the day. We would be constantly looking at the clock, thinking, ""When am I going to get out?"" Some people have no patience, and others have tons. That could affect how everyone acts toward each other. A lack of patience could affect the littlest things. For example, we might end up fighting because we had to wait in line at a store or have to count money carefully. It could change the lifestyle of everyone on the planet. Patience is one of the most important things on the planet. Patience helps us make the right choice. Instead of someone asking you a question and you answering right away, you wait and make the better decision. Although many of us think we understand patience, it is more than just waiting. It's being acceptive of something you don't like. It's also going through life without constantly saying, ""Why can't I do what you can?"" The world wouldn't be the way it is without patience, and we should all strive to be more patient in our daily lives."
1178	19140	7	3	"Patience, something you have to have when you want to be friends with someone. This story is about a young girl and boy who want to be friends, but one of them just doesn't have patience. I was walking into the room where the speech competition was held. The room was filled with students and teachers, and there was an air of excitement. I sat next to all my friends, and they all thought I would get first place. When I went up with one of my friends, he said that he had just a little bit too much cologne on because he was really nervous and he didn't know what he was doing. None of them actually knew that he and I were friends. After I went up to see what number I was, I saw that I was the first one to speak. My friend said that I would do good, and he was right after me. I soon started to speak about lady [PERSON1]. Everyone loved my speech! After my friend, [ORGANIZATION1] and I were done with our speeches, we both sat next to each other and were talking a lot. Then after all our friends asked us if we were friends, I said, ""No way! Why would I be friends with him?"" Then everyone laughed. We both looked at each other in a bad way. After a few days, we weren't talking to each other since [CAPS1] was so suspicious. I was very patient and was able to wait to talk to him. But of course, [ORGANIZATION1] wasn't patient at all. He was eager to tell [CAPS1] that me and him were friends, but we couldn't tell anyone because to them we were both different. But the truth is that we're both exactly the same since we both like soccer, basketball, music, and talking like [NUM1]. Haha! Soon [CAPS1] found out. [ORGANIZATION1] had gone and told [CAPS1] that we were friends. Turns out everyone laughed at us. They were actually happy that [ORGANIZATION1] finally had the patience and told them that we were friends. Now me and [ORGANIZATION1] are best friends and will be best friends forever! In conclusion, having patience is a good thing, but sometimes people can't have patience when they want to become friends, yet in the end, patience often pays off."
1179	19141	7	3	A time when I was patient was when me and my cousin's family went to [LOCATION1] and my sister was sick. Me and my other sister sat in my car, feeling a bit bored. For about two and a half hours, we just sat there, looking out of the window. My sister was getting mad, constantly fidgeting and complaining, but I just sat there patiently. My mom and sister were in the doctors' office for the longest time! My sister ended up going to the doctors' office three times. But I was very patient. When she wasn't at the doctor, all she wanted to do was lay down, so we barely got to do any fun stuff. By the end of the trip, she was feeling better, so my mom took us to do something fun. That was a time when I was patient, and I'm glad I was able to stay calm and wait for my sister to get better.
1180	19143	7	3	Being patient is waiting your turn in line and not cutting. You should wait because cutting in line is not only rude but also disrespectful. And if you keep cutting, you will have no friends. Being patient is respectful to others, and others will be more likely to be your friend. It's not respectful when you don't wait your turn. For example, when you want to do something while your mom and dad are speaking to another adult, it's rude to rush things. It's also rude when other people don't want to do something with you, or when you're nagging to leave somewhere like an aunt's or uncle's house. There are negative consequences when you don't wait. Be respectful and wait; it's a better way to make friends. And if someone is not being respectful to you, tell them to be. Then walk away and say firmly that they need to wait and be patient. In the end, patience and respect go hand in hand, and by being patient, we can build better relationships with others.
1181	19144	7	3	I felt an intense thrill coursing through my body. We were @NUM1 seconds away from the grand opening of @ORGANIZATION1. The anticipation was palpable in the air. I had to wait a full @NUM2 minutes to board Space Mountain. I really wished I could've bypassed all the people patiently standing in line, but I knew waiting was the only option. When I finally got off the ride, I immediately knew that all the waiting was completely worth it. At the end of the day, I eagerly begged to go on one more ride. Once again, I had to wait @NUM3 minutes to get on. This particular ride showed the rather boring history of @CAPS1. Then, at the end, it presented us with a screen where we got to choose the future, and it even showed a funny cartoon with our faces on it. It was a truly memorable experience that capped off a great day.
1182	19145	7	3	Have you ever babysat little kids? If you have, then you surely know how much patience such a task requires. It was my little cousin’s third birthday party, and as the oldest child present, it was my clear responsibility to keep an eye on the younger kids. At first, everything was going swimmingly. The kids were quietly engrossed in playing with the plastic kitchen, sweetly offering me fake food. Then, one of them discovered the ball popper and started to play with it. Of course, as is typical with little kids, if one child has a new toy, the rest of them immediately abandon what they're doing and rush over to play with it too. So, all of the little kids quickly gathered around the ball popper, giggling with pure delight as the machine shot plastic balls up into the air. Suddenly, a little girl reached out and snatched a ball right out of the air, which instantly caused the other kids to start fighting over the balls and screaming at the top of their lungs. I loudly yelled at them to stop, but when they completely ignored me and kept on fighting, I realized that this situation would demand a whole lot of patience. I calmly walked over and took the ball popper away, then patiently waited for them to settle down. Thankfully, my little cousins eventually stopped fighting and were able to play with the ball popper quietly once again. I learned an extremely important lesson from my cousin’s birthday party – babysitting indeed requires a great deal of patience!
1183	19146	7	3	“@CAPS1!!” I groaned as I realized I had yet another math homework assignment due the next day. I was already so tired of math. Every single day, my fourth - grade teacher would hand out math homework that was not only really long but also incredibly hard. Some days, I would come home and just break down in tears because it was so difficult. My mom and dad always gently told me to be patient and stay calm. But I never wanted to be patient because it never seemed to work for me. Every day after school, I would come home, plop down at the table, and slowly start doing my work. Having to complete @NUM1 problems a day was extremely tough for a fourth - grader. Whenever math class started, I would take out my homework and wait for the teacher to check it. I never did terribly in math. In fact, @CAPS2 I was always quite proud of my work. But when it came to getting a new homework assignment, I was never happy. Having a new lesson every day was also a real challenge. I had to constantly remind myself to be patient and take my time. One day, my teacher gave us an easy lesson, and I felt really confident that I could finish it right at school. Every once in a while, I would come across a hard problem and start to stress out. But then I remembered what my mom said, “be patient and stay calm,” and @CAPS2 I did just that. I was patient and carefully worked through the problem. Now, to this very day, I still remember to be patient. I also understand that we will have to learn to be patient throughout our entire lives. Math is what truly helped me become a more patient person, both inside and out.
1184	19147	7	3	This one time, my brother and I were happily coming back from @LOCATION1. Everything was going smoothly until, all of a sudden, the car broke down right on the freeway. We were in a bit of a panic at first, but then we quickly called our parents to come pick us up. Well, when they finally arrived, they realized they had forgotten the cables. So, just as they were getting to us, they had to turn around and leave again. We were left waiting there on the side of the road. @NUM1 long hours went by, and finally, here they came. I anxiously asked, “Did you remember to get everything?” They shook their heads yes, hooked up the car, and off we went, relieved that we could finally get back home.
1185	19148	7	3	One time, @CAPS2 @CAPS1 was comfortably sitting on the couch, watching TV and having a really great time when his brother, or step - brother @PERSON1, walked into the room and sternly said, “@CAPS2, we have to go to my interview, or you are going to be grounded.” “@CAPS3 long is it?” @CAPS2 asked. “About an hour long,” replied @PERSON1. “But Itchy and Scratchy is going to be on, and it’s a one - time - only episode,” said @CAPS2. “@CAPS6, that pointless kidshow. Dude, that was on the @CAPS7 and then they made it into a real show,” @PERSON1 scoffed. “Where is it at?” @CAPS2 inquired. “It’s at @ORGANIZATION1. @CAPS6, and the @CAPS9 @CAPS10 man, @CAPS2 has to be there. We leave in an hour, okay. So, make a science experiment or something,” @PERSON1 instructed. @CAPS2 had never liked the @CAPS9 - @CAPS13 man. After a commercial break, something happened on @DATE1, which I shall not disclose. @CAPS2 did what he was best at – he started making a science experiment to plot revenge on the @CAPS9 - @CAPS13 man or whoever else he didn't like. So, he patiently waited for @NUM1 minutes for the experiment to be completed. Then they left. It was a three - hour drive, and his favorite show was on during that time, but he managed to tape it. He was really being patient. Finally, they got there. He spent @NUM2 minutes looking for the @CAPS9 - @CAPS10 man. Could @PERSON1 be lying to him? He was being so patient that he was starting to get really tired, and then he fell asleep. When he woke up, guess who it was? The @CAPS9 - @CAPS10 man. “Remember me?” @CAPS2 said to the @CAPS9 - @CAPS10 dude man. @PERSON1 watched and laughed. @CAPS2 quickly threw a bonney ball into the @CAPS9 - @CAPS10, and on @DATE2, there was no more @CAPS9 - @CAPS10 man. @CAPS2 had been patient; he had waited for more than @NUM3 hours to get to watch Itchy and almost @DATE2 @DATE1 to get back at the @CAPS9 - @CAPS10 man. In the end, his patience and determination led to his moment of revenge.
1186	19149	7	3	Usually, I have very little patience (and yes, I'm well - aware that patience is indeed a virtue). But on my birthday a few years ago, I had to stay in a hospital room with my dad to spend time with my mom. The hospital room was very boring, with the white walls and the constant beeping of medical equipment. However, somehow I managed to go the whole day (up to the point where my dad finally let me watch @CAPS2.V. on the small TV in the room) without being bored to tears. It was a test of my patience, but I made it through that long day.
1187	19150	7	3	"A time when I was patient. I was going school shopping. There were maybe over a hundred people in the store @PERSON1. It was like a cluster of pebbles in the sand, so densely packed that you could barely move. The aisles were so crowded that it was like trying to navigate through a whole mall crammed into one little store. Some people would leave because of how many people were in there, but then even more would come. It was me, @CAPS1's mom, and @CAPS1's dad. We started to gather the stuff we needed. We got in line behind maybe @NUM1 people or more. @CAPS1's mom was on the verge of exploding with frustration. After @TIME1, only @TIME1 people had gone through the checkout. @CAPS1's mom almost fell asleep where she stood, and I was just standing there, waiting patiently. But @CAPS1's arms were hurting from carrying the clothes, and her back ached too. She was so eager to get out of that store. @CAPS1's dad was reading a magazine while he was waiting, ESPN news to be exact. There were only a few people in front of us. I was happy that we could finally get @CAPS1's clothes. We got up to buy @CAPS1's clothes when a cash register broke. The lady said it would take an hour or two, so @CAPS1's mom started to complain. We had sat in line for an hour and a half for this to happen. @CAPS1's dad was fine with it because he was so engrossed in that magazine. I could not believe that this happened. I was so disappointed, and so was @CAPS1's mom. So we got @CAPS1's dad and left. @CAPS1's dad said, ""I'm at the good part."" I didn't get the clothes that day, but we went the next week to get them."
1188	19151	7	3	"I was patient when we were on the bus. We had just arrived at school, and the kids were loud and noisy that day. There were a lot of kids trying to get off the bus. When someone suddenly jumped in front of me, I fell back into my seat. There were about @NUM1 - @DATE1 kids getting off the bus one by one. So I waited calmly for all the kids to pass me. Then I got up and walked slowly down the aisle to the door. The bus driver, noticing my patience, said, ""Thanks for waiting."" Then I left the bus, feeling good about my self - control."
1189	19152	7	3	"It was @DATE1, @CAPS1. My friends were excitedly talking about how cool the Xbox was. They were saying how if you get Xbox Live, then you can play with people from all around the world. They were also gushing about the new game that was about to come out, which was called @CAPS2 of @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @NUM1. I had searched it up online, and it was voted to have a ranking of @NUM2 stars. Now, that's a really good game. I had asked my mom and my dad if I could get it. They both, as always, said ""we'll see."" After another month, I had asked my mom again, and she said, ""Why don't you wait till @CAPS6?"" And once I went to my dad's house, he said @CAPS6 was just around the corner. But I said that everyone had it, and I pleaded, ""Can't I just get it now?"" My dad firmly said no. So then, after that, I waited @NUM1 months, constantly thinking if he would change his answer. And again, he said no. So I went to my mom's house and asked her. She said that I should be able to wait and also warned that if I ask again, I wouldn't get it. And so @CAPS6 came, and for my last present from my mom and my dad, I had gotten an Xbox with my favorite game. I was sooo happy. And now I know that if you have patience and you wait long enough, you'll get what you want."
1190	19153	7	3	I am always patient. But do you know when and where I am really patient? It is when I am getting my hair cut. Every time I go to get my hair cut, there are a lot of people in the @CAPS1 hair shop. People often come in saying they have to go somewhere for a party or for church and need their hair cut right away. So I kindly let them go ahead of me and have to wait patiently. It makes me kind of happy to be patient because I am helping others, and I believe that if I need someone to be very patient with me in the future, then I would want them to be patient too. It's a simple act of kindness that makes the world a better place.
1191	19154	7	3	This is about a time I was patient. First, I was babysitting my cousin's kids. Their names are @PERSON1 and @CAPS1. They had to be kept out of the way because the adults were rearranging things upstairs, so we sat downstairs. Next, @PERSON1 and I watched a movie. I was getting itchy because they did not sit still. It took a lot of self - control not to yell at them to sit down and watch the movie. It was at the beginning of the movie, and I wanted to play with @CAPS1 who was sitting in her crib. Finally, they were almost done upstairs. The couch was moved, and the chair was repositioned. So, there was more roomy upstairs. That was the time I was patient, and I managed to stay calm throughout the whole experience.
1192	19155	7	3	I used patience when I went to Cedar Point @CAPS1. The situation where I used it was when I was playing a video game. As I was packing for the trip, I grabbed my PSP and put it in my bag. So, on the way there, I got bored halfway. Then I grabbed my PSP and started playing. I got so engrossed that I lost track of time. As we were traveling, my girls were also with me. When we were pulling into the hostel, we were so close to the park. But as soon as I got there, I needed a lot of patience. We got in line and sat there for what seemed like forever. So, I played my PSP. The PSP really helped me use patience. I relied on my PSP to help me through. It would have been extremely hard without it. My PSP tested my mind and helped me stay calm. In the end, I'm glad I had my PSP to make the waiting more bearable.
1193	19156	7	3	Patience is usually good or bad for me. Here are a few reasons why patience can be hard or stressful. If you are waiting to get a shot or receive life - threatening results, it can be extremely difficult to be patient. A way to avoid the normal boredom that comes with waiting is to get some notes or school work to do or listen to an iPod. Patience is everywhere. For example, during car rides, birthday parties, vacations, commercials, waiting for school to be over, at restaurants, during holidays, or whenever you say “I cannot wait,” and so on. To sum up, patience is a part of our daily lives, and finding ways to manage it can make those waiting periods more tolerable.
1194	19158	7	3	A time when I was patient was when I was waiting at the dentist for my brother. My brother's name is @CAPS1 and he is sixteen. One day we went to the dentist. My brother had to get his wisdom teeth pulled. My grandma and @CAPS2 were waiting for hours. After a while, she went to the backroom with my brother. So, I was sitting in the waiting room alone. Thankfully, I had my @CAPS3, so I watched a few cartoons and listened to music to pass the time. A few minutes later, I went to the bathroom. When I got out, a nurse told me to come with her. She led me to the backroom where my brother and my grandma were. I learned that the doctor hadn't even started yet! At least I could talk to my brother. So, for what seemed like an eternity, the doctor finally showed up. After an hour or so, the operation was over. Then we had to sit and wait for the anesthesia to wear off. My brother was acting loopy and crazy. It was actually quite funny. Finally, we left, and I didn't lose my patience throughout the long and tiring wait.
1195	19159	7	3	When I was really patient, I wanted my aunt and mother to cook me some lasagna. I hadn't had any since my mother passed away on @DATE1. My mom had my @CAPS1 cook @CAPS2 on my first birthday. When she cooked some for my first birthday party, it was all gone in no time. My @CAPS3 mother cooked @NUM1 pans of it. It was so delicious that it was gone as soon as she put it out. When I say soon, I really mean it. I turned @NUM2 years old. My mother went all out for my birthday party. My mom died from open - heart surgery. She was @NUM3 years old. She had a lot of friends at her funeral. The funeral was very nice. But getting back to what I was writing about, in @DATE2, I asked my @CAPS1 to cook me some lasagna. She said to me, “Girl, it costs too much to make it.” I said, “@CAPS1, do you want me to give you some money to cook the food for me?” She said, “No, save your little money that you have.” I said, “But @CAPS1, it's okay to take my money to buy my lasagna and cook it for me.” She said, “Girl, what did I say?” So, I quickly put my money in my pocket. Then I just kept it moving. When we got in the truck, she said, “Now @CAPS5, I am going to cook it for you when I get some more money and when I pay my bills.” In @DATE3, she cooked me some. The day she cooked me some, it was @CAPS6 @NUM4, @DATE3. My aunts came over and got some, my brother and sister got some, and my @CAPS1 and @CAPS8 got some. When they were all getting some, I just stood there and watched. I didn't tell them when it was enough because I live in their house. My brother and sister live with them. The lasagna only lasted for @NUM5 days, and that was it. When she cooked it, I was really happy. I brought it to school and ate it for my lunch, and it made my day.
1196	19160	7	3	One time when I was patient was when I was in the final part of the fourth - grade year and I'd just signed up for football. I had to wait from @DATE1. Those days seemed to drag on. When I finally got my football pads, I was so extremely excited for football that I put them on about four times before the football season started. @DATE1 passed by and it was @DATE2. In @DATE2, I participated in showing cows, which made @DATE2 pass by really fast as I was busy with the cows. Finally, it was @DATE1 again. I only had to wait eleven days until the day of my first practice. When the day arrived, it went by super fast and six p.m. came quickly. Then it was time to go. I really liked football that year and I've played football ever since. It truly took patience to wait for football. Two months might not seem long, but for a ten - year - old, it is hard to wait that long.
1197	19161	7	3	The time I had to be patient was when my brother was going to get me a present when it wasn't even my birthday yet. This is how this whole story began. It was a sweltering hot @DATE1 day and I had been diligently doing my chores which included raking the leaves, mowing the lawn, and a lot more yard work. Mom, dad, and my brother Travis had been having long conversations. When I was just sitting downstairs, they would tell me to go do my chores and then I could see them whispering and talking. It bothered me a great deal that I couldn't hear what they were saying. I finally just carried on doing my chores and I just got done mowing which took two hours. I went inside and I started to watch TV. All of a sudden, I hear “click click tap bam,” then I heard a sudden yell of my brother Travis saying “hey get back here.” I went to our fourteen curly stairs and all of a sudden I was greeted by the enthusiastic licking and bounding of a six - month - old puppy. I grabbed his collar, laughing, and saw his name was Max. He is now a three - year - old happy mutt and that was my brother's present to me for getting all As and doing a lot of work around the house. I love my dog but that was the time I had to be patient.
1198	19162	7	3	One time when I wanted a game but I couldn't get it yet. So I asked my mom if she could buy me a new game. I asked, “How much does it cost?” She said @NUM1 dollars. Then she said I had to wait for some days. The @NUM2 days went by and then I finally asked my mom if she could buy it for me. She said “not yet.” I politely said thank you. Then the next morning, we went to the game store. When I walked in, I saw the game I wanted right away. I told my mom and we went to the counter and bought my game. This experience taught me the value of patience while waiting for something I really wanted.
1199	19163	7	3	The doctor appointment. On Oct @NUM1 @DATE1, me and my mom were getting ready to go to the doctor's. Once we got there, it was extremely crowded. I felt like we had been there for weeks, or even days. @CAPS1, there were a lot of kids crying and running around playing. I was so utterly exhausted as I was still waiting for my turn to see the doctor. @NUM2 minutes later, it still wasn't my turn. I was trying my hardest to be patient, but it didn't help at all with all the noise of the kids running around. I walked up to the register and that's where I found out my appointment was until @NUM3 o'clock and it was only @NUM4. This long - awaited doctor appointment really tested my patience.
1200	19164	7	3	One day my dad and I had a doctor's appointment at @NUM1 pm so we went there punctually. Then my dad and I sat there quietly for a while. We initially thought it would take just a few more minutes. So we waited for @NUM2 minutes. Then my dad went and politely asked other doctors how long it was going to take. The doctors said about @NUM2 more minutes, so we patiently waited for @NUM2 more minutes. The doctor still didn't come out. We waited for @NUM5 minutes. My dad went to the doctor again. They said a few more minutes. We waited for @NUM2 more minutes and finally, the doctor called us. So the doctor was @NUM7 minutes late. When we went in the room, the doctor sincerely said sorry because he was late. That's how me and my dad showed patience during this doctor's appointment.
1201	19165	7	3	Being patient is a hard task to write about. One day I was with my mom in a bustling downtown area of @LOCATION1, specifically looking for a well - known pawn shop. We got stopped at nearly every red light on the long and congested way there. No one in the car complained even when we reached a particularly long - lasting red light. Right before the light turned green, a very old lady with a slow - moving walker stepped right in front of us. We patiently waited @NUM1 minutes for the old lady to carefully pass. Surprisingly, still no one in the car uttered a single complaint. This experience really showed me the power of patience in daily life.
1202	19166	7	3	When you hear the word patience, what exactly do you think of? I think about a person standing in a long, snaking line at a busy store when there are @NUM1 impatient people standing right in front of you. In @NUM2 grade, my sister and I decided to play the patient game. It was a tough challenge about who could go the longest without food, and all we could drink was plain water. The winner would get a whole delicious box of Dunkin' doughnuts to themselves. On Day @NUM3, I had about @NUM4 bottles of water, feeling quite parched, but my sister was still bravely hanging in there. On Day @NUM5, I had about @NUM6 bottles of water, and all day my stomach groaned loudly, and I could hear my sister's stomach groaning too. On Day @NUM7, with all the groaning and growling, my sister was still holding on. I just kept sipping my water. On Day @NUM8, I finally snapped and devoured so much food that my whole pantry seemed empty. My sister, @CAPS1, was cheering and she kindly said, “Don't worry, I'll let you have one of my @NUM9 chocolate doughnuts.” And true to her word, she shared. In my opinion, this game really demonstrated what patience is all about.
1203	19167	7	3	One of the worst feelings in the world is when you find out that your flight has been canceled. This has happened to many people, but in my family, it only happened to one family. My cousins were going to come to @LOCATION1 for a joyous Christmas. Cara and I were constantly texting and e - mailing each other about all the fun things we were going to do while they were in @LOCATION1. They had been excitedly planning this trip since @DATE1, but now their flight was canceled! We were so incredibly mad! My cousins' family had to be extremely patient because they had no idea if they would be coming to see us or not. My grandma kept nervously calling my uncle in @LOCATION2. My grandma had a great idea for them: to get on the next flight. The only problem was that the next flight was at @NUM1, and it would take them two long hours to get here. When they finally got here, I was at the airport eagerly waiting. When I saw my cousin, she said, “Everyone was so patient but me!” I expected the exact opposite, but no! I thought that my cousin, Cara, would be the patient one, but I was wrong. At least someone in the family showed patience during this difficult situation.
1204	19168	7	3	A time when I was patient was when my dad and I went to Leslie, a quiet hunting area, to go hunting. We woke up early at @TIME1 @TIME3, quickly got our gear together, and managed to get there at @TIME1 @TIME4. We patiently stayed there until @TIME1, waiting for the right moment. When we were there, my dad shot a doe at @TIME1 @NUM1 in the morning, right when the light was just starting to peek through the trees. He shot another doe at @TIME1 about @NUM2 in the @TIME2, a bit later in the day. So, we left with two big, healthy does in the back of my dad's truck. That was a time that I was very patient, waiting quietly in the hunting spot for the game.
1205	19169	7	3	One time I was patient when I went to the dentist. When I went to the dentist, I had to be patient because when we got there, the waiting room was packed. We quickly got checked in, but there were so many people there that we had to wait a long, boring time. While I was waiting, I was sitting on the hard ground, feeling extremely bored. I kept pestering my mom, asking if it was almost my turn, and she kept saying she didn't know. Finally, the doctor called my name. So I went in, and then the nurse got me ready for the real doctor. After she was done, I had to wait even more for my dentist to come in because he was still busy working with a different patient. But then he finally came, and after a short check - up, I was all done! That is a time when I had to be really patient, and it taught me the importance of waiting calmly in such situations.
1206	19170	7	3	Patience someone was extremely patient with me when I struggled to understand something. That someone was my math teacher. Despite having a classroom full of students, the teacher did not complain at all about helping me. While the teacher was focused on assisting me, the students in the room sat quietly and diligently did their work. The teacher clearly understood that I was having a hard time grasping how to do the math work. It was during a math class when we were learning about positive and negative integers. My question was, “How do you order them from least to greatest?” She replied, “I was wondering if you would like me to show you?” I said, “Yes, please.” So, for about fifteen minutes, she patiently helped me. Throughout that time, my entire class remained focused on their own tasks. That is one remarkable time when people were patient with me, and it left a lasting impression on me.
1207	19171	7	3	Where do I even begin? There has never really been a time when I was patient. I was always in a rush, constantly pushing people to do something. I would get extremely mad because they wouldn't do things fast enough or move quickly enough for my liking. Whenever this happened, I would just get a bad attitude. That's precisely why I have such a hard time being patient, and now you clearly know the reason. In conclusion, my impatience has been a long - standing issue, but I hope to work on it in the future.
1208	19172	7	3	Having a melt - down! I have experienced this rather frustrating scene when I was in the third grade at Cross Creeds Christian School. It was a sunny afternoon on the 15th of June, and we lived just around the corner from the school. After about ten minutes, my patience was starting to wear thin as my mother wasn't there to pick me up. And another fifteen minutes later, I had a full - blown temper tantrum. I cried as my patience, which was like a balloon, popped and slowly deflated as I grew angrier and angrier at the fact that my mom still wasn't there. This mistake must never happen again to me. I made the wrong choice by getting mad over something ridiculously dumb. Learn from my words; don't give up so easily and keep trying to stay calm in such situations.
1209	19173	7	3	I'm going to tell you about a time when I showed remarkable patience. When my family and my mom's boyfriend went on vacation to Disneyland. When we arrived there, it was packed full of eager tourists. So, we quickly jumped in line for the first exciting ride. We were so thrilled that the attendant said it was a fifteen - minute wait. At first, the line was moving at a brisk pace. But all of a sudden, it started moving as slowly as a sloth. It was incredibly hot and humid, which was just awful. We checked the time, and it was already thirty minutes. It felt like three long hours. I was rapidly running out of patience. Then, we finally got into the shade, and it was cool and pleasant. Finally, we were next in line. My mom's boyfriend and I were so happy. He timed the ride, and it was only twenty seconds long. We waited an hour for a twenty - second ride. That was one time that I truly showed patience, and it taught me that sometimes the wait is worth it.
1210	19174	7	3	Patience is an essential quality you need to navigate through your everyday life. To have patience means that you are understanding and highly tolerant. Most people do not possess a great deal of it, but there are others who do. Like my brother, he has some patience but not a whole lot. There are five kids in my family; two girls and three boys. I'm not going to lie, but I can be quite annoying sometimes. My little sisters and brother are extremely obnoxious. But my older brother is the most obnoxious of them all! He is the one who usually freaks out over any little thing we say or do. But this one time, I don't know what came over him. This was going to be an interesting situation. We were sitting at home one day, and my big brother was being surprisingly patient. When we annoyed him, he would usually get his fists ready. So my sisters, brother, and I kept fighting and fooling around with him. We would tell him to shut up or even playfully smack him on the arm. Yet, he would just sit there as if nothing was wrong. He would usually beat me and my siblings if we fought, but this time he didn't care at all! I was seriously starting to get worried because that wasn't like him at all. So I got up and smacked him right across the face, leaving a red mark on his cheek. He had been patient ever since we started being annoying. But at this point, I think I crossed the line. He got up, with his hand wide open for a smack. Before I knew it, I was on the floor crying. I ran to tell my dad. Oh, did I mention I'm daddy's little girl? I think you could've guessed that my brother was the one that got in trouble. He had so much patience by being tolerant during all those annoying things we did. Well, in the end, he got scolded by my dad, and so did my fingers. At least I never got in trouble. That's when being daddy's little girl really comes in handy! In conclusion, this incident showed me the power of patience and the consequences of pushing someone too far.
1211	19175	7	3	When I'm patient, I'm mostly in the woods. This is when I am hunting. You have to be extremely patient to wait for deer. They don't always come; sometimes it could just be a young fawn quietly tiptoeing through the bushes. Other times it can be female does gracefully moving around. But when you see a majestic buck, it's everything. First, you have to patiently wait for it to come in close enough for a clear shot. When it does, you have to calmly wait to bring up your gun steadily. Then you have to patiently wait for the perfect shot. If you get it, you must be patient and wait for it to die. If you can't find it right away, don't give up. That is when I was patient, and I learned that patience truly pays off in the hunt.
1212	19176	7	3	One time my volleyball team went to @ORGANIZATION1. I was one of the last people off our bus, which means I was one of the last to order at the bustling food area. I stayed there very patiently as everyone in front of me ordered their meals. I casually talked to my friends as they were also waiting. Next, I carefully figured out what I was going to eat, (@CAPS1 cheese, burger, @CAPS2 fry, and a large drink). “@CAPS3 @CAPS4, @CAPS3 @CAPS4” I mumbled as I watched the clock, and my eyes slowly got droppy from the long wait. “@CAPS7, @NUM1” the lady said. “@CAPS8 @MONTH1 I take your order,” she finally said. I clearly told her what I wanted, and she put it on her register, and then I began to patiently wait some more. A couple of minutes later, I finally got my order. Finally, after being patient for quite a while, I got my food. That was the time I was patient at @ORGANIZATION1’s, and it made me realize that patience leads to getting what you want.
1213	19177	7	3	People with patience are great teachers. My mom is one of those great leaders. She has a remarkable level of patience. She has a family and many daily responsibilities. When we ask for things over and over again, she doesn't get angry and burst out. Instead, she just calmly says no or yes you @MONTH1 with a warm smile. Or when she comes home from a long, tiring day at work, she never complains. She just keeps a bright smile on her face and finishes the rest of the eventful day. When she wakes up in the morning to take us to school, she has a beaming smile on her face and she never utters a single complaint. My mom is a very patient woman and a great teacher and leader. I appreciate everything she does for me, my brother, and dad, and I hope to learn her patience.
1214	19178	7	3	When I had to be patient, was when I wanted a psp so badly. So there was a time when I really, really wanted a psp. I eagerly asked my parents, and they said I had to wait till @CAPS1. I was so tempted to keep pestering them because I wanted it right away, but I decided to patiently wait for a long time. I occupied myself with other things during the wait. Finally, the day came, and I got a psp. This experience taught me that patience can bring you the things you desire.
1215	19179	7	3	I remember I had to use @CAPS10 sisters old phone. The @CAPS1 pearl. It was really slow, it often dropped calls, and I found it @CAPS3 horrible to use. @CAPS10 birthday was coming up, and I really needed a new one. So I asked @CAPS10 mom when I was going to get one for @CAPS10 birthday. She said “@CAPS5. Be patient.” And I was so eager to know that I kept asking her, and she said probably not. But I didn't give up. I was really patient until @CAPS10 birthday. When I woke up, I saw a bunch of presents neatly placed on the kitchen table! @CAPS10 family watched me excitedly open them. When I had one left, I opened it. It was a huge box! And I opened it to find another box inside. And another, and another, and another. Finally, it was at the smallest one. I opened it, and the side of the box said, iphone on it!! I got an iphone @NUM1! I was so happy! “@CAPS9 what you get for being patient,” @CAPS10 mom said with a big smile, and it made me realize that patience is always rewarded.
1216	19180	7	3	Patient one time I was truly patient. I was really patient. I was invited to a sleep - over, and when I went to the sleep - over. So when I got there, we went to the storage area to get some pop, but the situation there was a bit chaotic and not clearly organized. In the end, despite the disarray, I remained patient and just went along with it.
1217	19181	7	3	"What is patience? Being patient means to wait for something that might take a long time, but you understand the situation and wait without being rude. An example is when you're waiting for a brand - new toy that just came out. Everyone around you has it, and it's the coolest toy in town. The problem is your mom and dad can't afford it right now. When you understand that money is tight and you don't start by your mom's side, begging for the toy every single day, you're being patient. If you keep begging, then you're not being patient, and your mom is going to say ""stop, you're not being patient."" Before you be rude and keep begging for what you want, think of other people, understand why it might take longer than you'd like, and be patient. Patience helps build better relationships and shows understanding."
1218	19183	7	3	"I'm writing a story about patience. Patience can be described like when I'm waiting for you to get done with whatever you're doing. For instance, a teacher, say Ms. [Teacher's Name], has been waiting for the kids to be quiet. And they just can't seem to stop making noise. Even though she's getting mad, she still remains patient with us. Instead of saying ""get out of my class,"" she gives us chance after chance. Because she wants us to be well - behaved and stay in class. In the end, her patience might just help us learn to be better students."
1219	19184	7	3	"I know a person that's way more patient than me! That person is my sister. My sister is the most patient person you'll ever meet. I, on the other hand, am not patient at all. First of all, when we're going somewhere, my sister would just calmly sit there. Meanwhile, I would constantly say, ""Can we leave now?"" My sister is always patient in such situations. She doesn't let the waiting get to her. That's why I think she's patient, and I really admire her for that quality."
1220	19185	7	3	One rainy afternoon on a particular day, my little brother's friend's mom called and needed me to babysit. She and my mom were going out and wouldn't be back till nine p.m, so she needed me to come over. My mom drove me over there and dropped me off at seven p.m. After a brief introduction on what to do if there was an emergency, they left. When they left, me and the kids had a great time. We wrestled and watched TV. We ran around the house, talked to each other (mainly they tackled me in their excitement) and I lifted them upside down. Then at around eight - thirty, I put them in bed and covered them up twice to make sure they were cozy. After they brushed their teeth and went to bed, I walked downstairs twice to read my book. I really sighed in relief and then turned on the TV. I needed a bit of patience because I was a bit worried as my mom might forget to pick me up. But in the end, my mom came to get me, and it was a tiring but rewarding babysitting experience.
1221	19186	7	3	"There is a time in everyone's life when they have to be patient. The time I was patient was when I was helping my little brother learn how to tie his shoes. I know this sounds like an easy task, but it really isn't. Time after time again, my brother attempted to tie his shoes but could never do it correctly. So I told him to go get one of his shoes, and I would teach him. When we got started, I thought this would be over in about five minutes, but no! He could not make the bunny ears properly. So we tried and tried again. He would get so close to tying the knot, and then he would get so excited that he would pull the knot as hard as he could, and the laces would fall to the floor. I really wanted to give up and just let him use his shoes with straps, but no, he was determined to tie his shoes. After about an hour of tying, he finally got it! He didn't tie them perfectly, but it was good enough to keep them tied. I said ""good job"" and started to walk to the kitchen. When he asked about the double knot, so of course, I walked over and told him just to cross the two bunny ears and loop around, but he didn't get it. I had to have shown him a billion times how to do it! But he still didn't get it. We hit the half - hour mark for the double knot, and I went in the kitchen for a juice box. When I came back, my brother had a smile on from cheek to cheek and held up his shoe proudly. In the end, all my patience paid off as I saw the pride in his eyes for learning a new skill."
1222	19187	7	3	At one time, I was very patient when I had to do a project on birds, which included a life - size scale model. On the model, I had to carefully glue small parts on every day. But the glue took 3 hours to dry completely. So I had to redo it three times, which made it a 10 - day project instead of a seven - day one. I worked harder than my classmates, but I kept breaking my wonderful creation. The delicate wings would break off, and I patiently had to glue them back on with precision. I finally completed it, though it took way longer than I wanted to. I used patience, carefulness, and a steady hand to finally succeed. This experience taught me that with perseverance, even the most challenging tasks can be accomplished.
1223	19188	7	3	A time when I was patient was during a time I was with my mom, and she decided “let's make some cookies”. So we got all the cookie dough ready. The raw dough looked so good, even though they weren't cooked yet. My mom just said “go to the oven for 15 minutes!” I did not want to wait that long for my cookies. As they started to take their shape of big, dark brown, round, and soft, my mouth watered. I wanted them right then. The timer buzzed, I rushed over there, grabbed a hot pad and almost threw them out of the oven! Right as I was about to get one, my mom snapped “they need to cool down”. She set the timer for 10 minutes! I did not think I could wait that long. My mouth watered at the smell. I was dying; I wanted them so bad! I thought the smell could kill me! Every minute seemed like an hour. Then the timer buzzed, I sprinted over there, grabbed a plate, and tossed 3 of the biggest cookies on the plate. While doing so, I burned my hand. But I did not care. I took a bite out of a cookie, and my wait was over. My patience paid off in the end. It was so worth it for the delicious cookies I got. This taught me that waiting can lead to great rewards.
1224	19189	7	3	School. In school, you have to keep patient. By the end of the day, you run out of patience. You would be trying to tolerate your lack of patience. Most of the day it will be fun. Maybe if you go along with it, you will be cool and stay patient. But patience is something I need when it comes to waiting for lunch and the bathroom. See, every day I have to tolerate people who go to the bathroom when I need to go. I have to wait until it's my turn. Then, when I start to get hungry, I need lunch, and I have to wait for that too. Once I eat, I have to be patient for gym class. I have to be patient every day of the week. I need to tolerate all of it weekly. In the end, I realize that being patient in school helps me have a better and more peaceful day.
1225	19190	7	3	One time I was patient was in Six Flags Hurricane Harbor. Guess what? It was a Saturday! The date was July 15th. When we pulled up to the ticket booth, the man in the little booth said “ticket please.” Then we pulled up to get a parking spot. When we got out and ran for the gates, but just then, Sarah's sister forgot her towel. So I ran back to the truck and got it. Then we got into our bathing suits. Then we went to the water. The first ride I did was the “Tornado of Terror!” Mind you, it was very scary. But I said, “does anyone want to go with me?” Sarah's dad and Sarah's mom's friend from work said yes! So we got in the line. The line was like 50 to 60 people in the line. And the wait was around 2 hours! But I did not complain one bit. But then we heard a blood - curdling scream from the ride. Then a man, woman, and 2 young kids got spit out into the pool. Then we got their tube and went up the stairs. We got up to the huge opening to where you could see the 30 - foot drop - off then the bright pink and yellow funnel. About 15 minutes later, we were at the port where you get on your tube. Then we went down. Sarah's mom's friend (Lisa) went down backwards. I said “yes, you got to go down backwards. Halla!” Then we started going down, and then we just dropped (well, we free - fell) but we were going like 40 mph. It was scary. Then we got out. Then I fell into the pool and got out. I saw Sarah's mom and her two sisters. They laughed at Lisa because she was crying. Then she said she didn't feel good. So she went to the truck and took a nap. Then I rode rides the rest of the afternoon. That is a time I was patient, and it made the experience more rewarding as I overcame the long wait.
1226	19191	7	3	"A time when I was patient was when I went to the mall. ""Oh my goodness,"" I said to whoever was behind me. ""My mama and I had come to the mall to get some summer clothes. That mall was extremely crowded. Couldn't nobody get in where I was, but I was getting so patient. The thing I ever had to do was to understand, and it was this white family walking by and they all bumped me. I was so patient waiting in one place. I was just ready to leave everybody when finally came our time. That was the time when I was patient. I was so proud of myself I held it in. The whole experience taught me the value of patience."
1227	19192	7	3	"A momma bird was carefully laying eggs. She laid three beautiful, blue, perfect eggs. Days went by, and the eggs did not hatch. The momma bird got visibly upset. She talked to papa bird, and he said, ""Just be patient"". Weeks more went by, and the momma bird got increasingly aggravated. Again, the papa bird said to be patient. In her spare time, the momma bird would keep herself busy by twiddling her wing a bit, shopping for some nesting materials, cooking up some bugs, cleaning the nest but nothing could get her mind off of the eggs. Months went by. Years went by. Decades, centuries, and millennia went by! But the momma bird was still patient. Finally one day, the eggs cracked, and she was so very happy. Almost immediately, the two oldest birds took off in flight. The third asked, ""Mom, can't I fly yet?"" and momma said, ""Just be patient."" This shows that patience is truly a virtue."
1228	19193	7	3	"I was incredibly excited to get my first iPad. But, there was a very long line. Calmly, my mom kept on telling me to be patient. Quietly, I just stand there quietly. Then when we got closer I could not wait. Finally, we got to the beginning of the line. When I got up there my dad said, ""What kind do you want?"" Eagerly, I told him that I want the big one. Therefore, we got it and put a lot of cool songs on there. After that, we went home and I listened to it all day long. Then my mom said, ""Stop listening to that music."" Reluctantly, I put it down for about two hours. Then, it was time to eat my dinner. After, we went for a car ride in my daddy's new car. Finally, we went back home. I put away all the stuff I had bought from the store. Then I watched TV and ate some popcorn. Then it was time for me to go to bed. That is the time I was being patient, and it was all worth it."
1229	19194	7	3	When I was patient, we were on our way to Cape Point: with Sarah, her mom and dad and her brother and I. We were driving to go there. It took us three hours to get there. Sarah and I were very patient. We waited and waited to get there. We were so excited. When we got there, we all waited in line to ride a whole bunch of roller - coasters. We all waited in line about two hours for every ride. It was extremely busy that day. Sarah and I wanted to ride the tallest roller - coaster. It was called the Sky Scream. The Sky Scream was really high. It was the tallest roller - coaster I had ever been on and all the other people that came too. To get on that ride it was a one - hour wait. It was exciting and we had to be very patient. But when we got to the front it was worth the wait, and it made the whole experience even more memorable.
1230	19195	7	3	"Click, ""Ok, cool grandma thanks."" I say. ""Your welcome."" Grandma says. ""When will they be here?"" I say. ""I don't know."" ""You don't know what I'm talking about, which you probably don't. I'm talking about my shoes I just ordered online. There called Air Blazers. And boy was I going crazy over these things. I waited for five days and every day I would ask my mom, are they here yet, are they here yet, but every time I did, they weren't there. I was starting to get mad. So finally I rode my bike around to get it off my mind and I see a FedEx truck and I thought, yes, he's probably going to my house with my shoes, so I raced home and waited, and waited but still no shoes. So the next day I look up online where my shoes were, and it said they were in Detroit, MI. I was flipping out that meant they were coming. So again I'm waiting, and waiting and my mom decided we go somewhere. So I went in the car to leave, and I thought I heard the truck, but nope. So we finally arrive back at my house and I looked to the left and yup! there they were sitting on my front porch in a rough brown box. I run over pick it up and dash inside tear it open and there lies the best shoes known to man. I try them on (they fit perfectly) they are awesome. I thank my grandma and all my impatience flew away. I felt so happy, and it made the wait all worth it."
1231	19196	7	3	A time that I had to be patient was at Cedar Point in @LOCATION1. My @CAPS1, my sister, and a friend were spending the night at Cedar Point. My @CAPS1's friend stayed at the motorhome while my @CAPS1, my sister and I were spending the evening going on roller coasters. After about six hours, my sister and I went on all but @NUM1 or @NUM2 of the roller coasters. My @CAPS1, by the way, doesn't really like roller coasters, being old and all, so it really was just my sister and I. So after all the fun, my sister and my @CAPS1 were going back to the motorhome, but I wanted to go on just one more before heading back. So I asked if I could, and she said yes. I told my @CAPS1 that I would be back in hopefully a half - hour. The roller coaster was the second biggest roller coaster in the park. As I waited in line, I felt like it would take forever. I have @CAPS2, so as you could imagine, I could hardly stand still. I had to try very hard, but eventually I got on the ride, and then it was great again. The ride, by the way, was extremely amazing. I got off the ride, rushed back to the motorhome as promised, and though I was tired, the patience in the line was totally worth it.
1232	19197	7	3	@PERSON1. I was head - over - heels in love with the guy! I swear middle school is when you have to be the most patient out of all the time in your life! Seconds pass by like hours and your classes feel like they go on and on for centuries, which sometimes can be good, like in social studies. Social studies is the only class I have with @PERSON1 and I sit behind him, staring at his perfect head, admiring his every move. @DATE2 is the girl’s choice dance and I was determined to go with @PERSON1. So in social studies I wrote him a note. “@PERSON1, I really like you and was wondering if you wanted to go to the girls choice dance with me? From @ORGANIZATION1.” I chickened out. No way could I give it to him myself, so, I devised a plan. I told @LOCATION1 who told @PERSON2 to tell @PERSON3 (who is @PERSON1’s friend) to tell @CAPS2, (@PERSON1’s better friend) to tell @PERSON1 I liked him. Rumors spread fast in middle school so @PERSON1 found out before @PERSON2, but now he knows. And now it’s @DATE1 and time for social studies. Patience is my essence, I remind myself. Don’t be too quick to strike. Well I certainly wasn’t because the bell rang before I could give him the note. I waited and waited patiently until the right moment. Finally, I leaned over and handed @PERSON1 my note. He opened it and I waited for a reply, and waited, and waited. I think I might be a little too patient seeing today is @DATE2 and the dance is tonight. At my locker, which is four and a doorway down from @PERSON1’s, I have a note taped to it. It reads “Give me your phone number and I’ll call you for the @NUM1.” Gosh! Boys are so confusing. I gave him my number and wait by the phone. I think he’s testing my patience. I wait for what feels like hours by my phone. Finally, the phone rings, and it's him! All my patience has paid off.
1233	19198	7	3	Have you ever wanted something to be done and your parents told you “Be patient”? Recently, I've been patient. My family got a new microwave and it's too big for our counter, so we had to put it above our stove. Well, there wasn't enough space above the stove, so my parents decided to remodel the whole kitchen. My step - mom took everything out of the kitchen and put it all over the dining room, and now we can barely walk in the dining room. Lately, my family has been eating in our living room. Frankly, I really don't like eating in our living room as it just seems so messy and gross. But we also have the option to eat outside on our porch. So that's a good thing. I don't know how much longer I can keep up with this. But I've got to be patient. Finally, now my dad has made a new shelf and he can put up our new microwave, finish painting, and put our stove back. After he did that, my step - mom put all of our seasonings back and our other stuff away, and now we are back to normal. After being patient it really pays off. Now you know that no matter how hard the situation, always be patient and things will work out.
1234	19199	7	3	It was a nice warm sunny @DATE1 day!!! We decided we could go pick up everyone from my dad's house and go to the Genesee County Farm. We got to my dad's house and picked up my step - brother, step - sister, real brother, step - mom, and my dad. We started heading to the Genesee County Farm. We started walking around, constantly looking up at the sky, waiting to see if it was going to rain. If it was going to rain, that would be a waste of money. We walked up to the ticket booth to see if we could come back tomorrow with the same wristbands if it starts raining. They said no, so we decided to stand there and wait a little bit longer. Then it starts pouring down rain. We had to go sit in this metal barn until the rain stopped. Meanwhile, the barn starts flooding. Then we get phone calls saying that tornados just hit a few miles away. Finally, it stopped raining and we all go back outside. We waited for the rides to start back up. Once they finally started back up, the rain started back up. So we all ran to the car. We were soaking wet. We decided to stop trying at the fair and do something else. So instead we all went out and ate at Taco Bell and Burger King. Even though our day at the farm didn't go as planned, the experience taught us to be flexible and make the best of a bad situation.
1235	19200	7	3	One day my grandfather and I went fishing. My grandfather always says it is important to always wait. When we got to our fishing zone, I said I wanted to catch a turtle and my grandfather said, “That will take forever. Just catch some fish.” I told him that I was going to catch a turtle and that was final. When something started pulling at my fishing rod, I tried to pull it in and what pulled my line was a small white bass. The next thing that pulled on my fishing rod was a big white bass. I was getting angry because there were no turtles biting my line. The very next thing that tugged at my line was a @NUM1 - inch white bass. It was the biggest fish I ever caught before, but it wasn't a turtle. After I caught that fish, I said it's time for a break. I was eating a sandwich and my grandpa was having fun and catching fish. At the time I was finishing my sandwich, my fishing rod started pulling. I had to grab my fishing rod and reel in my catch, but it wasn't a fish; it was a baby turtle. I was so excited that all my patience had finally paid off, and I learned that with enough patience, you can achieve your goal.
1236	19201	7	3	"In @CAPS1 middle school, in @PERSON2's dirty and muddy science classroom, a boy named @CAPS2 and another named @CAPS3 were diligently cleaning the mess @CAPS7 made earlier, from their wild mudball fight. For years, @PERSON2 was trying to be @CAPS6 patient with the twins, constantly trying to be @CAPS6 patient with them, and earnestly trying to figure out what could calm them down. @CAPS7 DO have @CAPS4 though…  @CAPS5 @PERSON2. Often she wondered what went through their minds when @CAPS7 got angry. When teaching them science, @CAPS7 never seemed to understand. When @CAPS7 did wrong things, @CAPS7 didn't know it was wrong. @CAPS7 progressed @CAPS8 by @CAPS8 in her class, understanding little. But it was as the principal said, ""Be @CAPS6 patient, @PERSON1; @CAPS7 will learn eventually."" @CAPS8 by @CAPS8 as the months passed, @PERSON1 believed her husband more and more. By being patient with them and not getting angry at them when @CAPS7 did something wrong, their grades started picking up soon. By the end of the year, @CAPS3 and @CAPS2 were @CAPS11 - plus students. @CAPS7 had passed @PERSON1's class. On the last day of school, @PERSON1 went to her husband's office. She told him that his advice worked and that he was a great principal. All @PERSON3 replied was ""Thank you so!"
1237	19202	7	3	I am patient. Even though I truly hate being patient, I can usually tolerate it. Like when I was @NUM1 and there was no school because of so much snow, my mom had to go to a meeting out of town so she took me to my dad’s house. She forgot that he had to work @DATE1 from @NUM2 am to @NUM3 pm. It was too late. I had to go to work with my dad. He was and still is the manager of Autozone. So I stayed back in this little office (which I must add has never changed, even @NUM4 years later.) and I was going to have to be patient. REALLY patient. My mom had brought this doodle thing so I could draw, which only kept me occupied for an hour. Then I had to just aimlessly walk around doing nothing. That is until I found @NUM5 employees doing inventory. Hehe, they had these carts that had a top surface and a bottom surface. I quickly shimmied onto the bottom surface and held on tight. They pushed me around the store without even knowing it! I did that for about @NUM5 hours and still had almost @NUM1 hours to kill. I found this old coloring book lying in the girls bathroom. If it were me now I would never have touched it. But I did. I was only @NUM1! I don’t really remember all I did after that but I know that it was so boring because it’s implanted in my brain. Is there ever a time when patience is fun?
1238	19203	7	3	Being patient is very difficult. I was at the store with my mom, and of course she was taking forever. “Come on mom, let's go. Do we really need this stuff?” She just continued shopping. Grrr I was so angry. I almost thought about throwing a fit. Finally, we were in line. As we got into the car my mom looked at me and said, “Give me your phone.” “But why?” The way you acted in that store was horrible. Now I know I will always be patient with my mom, as I've learned that impatience can have consequences.
1239	19204	7	3	Every year I go to my dad's. He lives in @LOCATION1 so we stop at the border. The border takes forever! So my family has to be patient with them. On our way to @LOCATION1 one time the border was packed. Our family had to be patient, or there were going to be some arguments. With four kids it is bound to happen. After an hour everyone's patience was running low, so my dad kept repeating “Keep patient, keep patient” over and over. We finally passed the border and everyone cheered. So keeping patience is not the easiest thing to do. We all need to learn just a little more about how to keep it, as it can make our travels and other situations much more pleasant.
1240	19205	7	3	Are you a patient person? Well I’m not! Well, I can be patient I just won’t like to be. A few years ago my family got a Gordon setter puppy. Since they’re kind of rare in @LOCATION1 we had to go all the way out of @LOCATION2. A couple years later we bred her and ended up with seven outrageously cute puppies. The puppies crawled and barked within a matter of weeks. My dog had a tough time with them annoying her, but she lasted. Two particular puppies were trouble! Patience was definitely needed to handle them. It’s hard to handle one puppy jumping in our pond and swimming across the deep end and another climbing chain - link fences. We kept an eye on them constantly! They barked if you got them out of the water or off the top of the fence. The fence climber left our home first. I was so sad. When there were two puppies left (waterdog and his sister) they ran around the house like maniacs. My brother and I had to be extremely patient with them. Then all of a sudden, they transformed into sweet little puppies. I didn’t want to get rid of them, but we had to. Our puppies showed me that patience always pays off no matter how hard the work is, and it can turn difficult situations into rewarding ones.
1241	19206	7	3	The bell had finally rung, signaling the long - awaited time for lunch. Math class had been an absolute drag; it felt like those 45 minutes would never end. I was so hungry that I rushed straight to the lunch area without even stopping at my locker to grab my things. When I got there, there was an incredibly long line for lunch that seemed to stretch for a mile. I knew right away that I was going to have to be patient. I joined the huge line and just stood there, waiting. Every single minute felt like an hour, but I understood that it was a very busy lunch day with lots of students, so I just waited. Several minutes later, I was finally near the front of the line. All of the sudden, seven girls just cut in front of the line because their friend let them. Even though that made me really angry, I didn't complain and stayed patient. I soon got my lunch. In conclusion, that was the time I was patient. I was understanding and did not complain, showing self - control in a frustrating situation.
1242	19207	7	3	During the summer break between fourth and fifth grade, my family and I went to @LOCATION1 @CAPS1! Most of the rides had lines, but none of them had a line as long as the @CAPS2  @CAPS3. The line was huge! As my brothers, their best friend, and I approached the @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I thought I would never get on. My dad said to just wait, but I didn't see the point. When I got about half - way, one of the employees shouted, “@NUM1 more minutes!” and my excitement became more intense. Eventually, I made it to the front of the line! All I had to do was wait for the current trial to be over! But then, the speaker came on, “All rides must stop until told to continue. A thunderstorm has rolled in and we must halt because of safety issues.” I had briefly considered leaving, but had a feeling I shouldn't. I talked with some other kids I met in line. I played games like rocks, paper, scissors while I waited under the pavilion above the line. Once the storm rolled away, they allowed us on! The ride was a thrill! I had the wind in my hair, a small mist from the rain, and a thank - you from my dad for keeping us in line. In the end, my patience was rewarded with an amazing ride experience.
1243	19208	7	3	The time I was patient was when I was getting my dog. I had gone to a jazz festival with my mom, my sister, and her friend. We were walking past a last - chance rescue and out of curiosity, we went to see the puppies. My mom didn't want another dog initially, but when she saw our future dog, Boxter, she gave in. He has grey fur with some black spots and a black line running down his forehead. At the center of the rescue, he stood out. He was a grown short - hair blue healer mix. We asked the lady if we could get him, but she said they were going in for a sport - related check and we could buy him there. We got in the car and drove to the place. We signed the forms and played with him in the store. Then we walked downtown with him on the leash and we got some ice cream and went home. In conclusion, my patience in the process of getting Boxter paid off as I now have a wonderful furry companion.
1244	19209	7	3	A time when I was patient is when I had pink eye. I was patient because my family went on vacation to @CAPS1. The first night we got there, my eye started to itch and it became all red. So we decided the next morning that we would take me to the doctor's office, but there wasn't one around. After some searching, we found an urgent care. So we went there. We waited in the rather crowded waiting room. Finally, the nurse called out @ORGANIZATION1. So we went into the room. We told her we needed eye drops for me. She said ok, I'll be right back. Then my mom and I were waiting and waiting for the nurse to come back. An hour went by and we were still waiting. I was getting really impatient. Then finally she came back and told us that she was working on another patient and told us once again she will be right back and that the doctor would be in there soon. We said ok. Once again, two hours went by and we were still waiting. Finally, the doctor came in with us and told us he was gonna bring my prescription. Then yes, he did come right back. Then my family and I left to go back to the hotel to gather our stuff to go to the campground. So that was a waste of @NUM1 hours of my vacation. That's a time where I was patient, despite the long and frustrating wait.
1245	19210	7	3	I remember a time when I was patient. It was at my cousin's house. It was very boring though. I was also sad and lonely at the time, so I am going to tell you about it. It was not long ago; I was at my cousin's house. Everyone except me was having a great time. There were not enough four - wheelers, so I was the only one left out. I felt so lonely. I couldn't believe how bored I was. All I could do was watch with envy as everyone was having fun. Everyone was screaming with joy and laughing until they would cry because they were having so much fun. Then my dad found a four - wheeler in a corner for me. I forced a smile to try to look like I was having fun, then he asks me if I want to go, and I say yes! So I hop on the four - wheeler like there was no tomorrow. I knew it was just a little wait, and I thanked my dad, and then took off. I could not imagine how much fun this was. I felt the breeze hit my face, my shirt flapping on my back; it was amazing. “I wish this day would never end,” I said, screaming with joy. I had a lot of fun that day. I never had that much fun in my life. A lot can happen when you are patient. Even though I was bored at the beginning, it was worth it in the end. That was a time I was patient, and it taught me that patience can lead to great experiences.
1246	19211	7	3	"Nana! Nana! Nana! Nana!  @PERSON3 is hurt!"" I yelled, my voice filled with panic. ""@CAPS1? How? """"@CAPS2 bleeding by the highway at the corner as the fence @PERSON1's with him."" ""@CAPS3 replied calmly. ""papa! Call @PERSON4 @CAPS4!"" nana yelled urgently. ""@CAPS5  get @PERSON1 and come inside!"" nana exclaimed, her tone full of worry. ""@LOCATION1, @CAPS6 we @CAPS7 leo!"" @LOCATION1, @CAPS6, nana, and popous quickly carried @PERSON3 (@PERSON3 is a horse) to the car port and carefully took a look at him. Hours later of trying to keep him warm, @PERSON4 finally arrived. They got @PERSON3 on a talk, assessing his condition. And then they started to bandage him up, working diligently. They tried to get him to stand up but @CAPS11 wouldn't, remaining weak. @PERSON1 and I were waiting in the house, anxiously trying to wait and see if @CAPS11 was going to live. @PERSON1 decided that she was going to help out with her horse. They carried the table with @PERSON3 on it to @CAPS8 his mom. @PERSON1 was behind @CAPS8 when she set the table down. And unexpectedly, @CAPS8 kicks @PERSON1 to the tree. The next day @PERSON2 and I were putting a tent up in the back yard. So the horses could cool down. Nana called the vet to see @CAPS1 they could do. They got their @NUM1 minutes later they said that they will stich him up. And see @CAPS1 else they could do. They stitched him up for three hours. They said to watch him and see if any wounds would come out of their stitches. They also said they were going to check up on him the following @DATE2. That @DATE2 came and they took him to the statules and took care of him for a while. Eventually, @CAPS11 got better. That's how I showed patience in the @DATE1, learning the importance of perseverance through this challenging experience."
1247	19212	7	3	There has been many times I have been patient in my life before. But I think this one will interest you most. Finally, we get to go to @CAPS1. @CAPS1 is this big indoor water park in @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2. I have been wanting to go here for years, imagining all the fun I'd have. When we get there my first thought is “paradise”. Little did I know that there were the biggest lines I have ever seen. And the lines were not just for the rides; they were for everything, from food stands to changing rooms. In two days of fun, it is already our last day at @CAPS1. So I wanted to ride all the rides one more time. My mom told me to go get my swimsuit on so we can go to the park. So I did, excited but also a bit nervous about the lines. When we got to the park the shortest line I saw was probably an hour long. I was so disappointed I only got to go on like @NUM1 rides. But I knew it was time to go and leave “paradise”. We left around @NUM2 thinking we would be home by about @NUM3. And we were on our way back home. I was so bored it felt like it has been @NUM4 but really it has only been one hour. It was taking us so long to get home because it was snowing really badly, the roads slippery and visibility low. I asked my mum when we were going to get home she said just be patient. So I just went along with it and sucked it up. “@CAPS3 we are home”. I say running inside. In my head I am thinking that was the longest ride ever. I look over at the clock it was @NUM5. @NUM6 longer than we thought. But I had to go to bed right then (alas, no video games). That is a time I displayed patience, learning to accept the unexpected delays in life.
1248	19213	7	3	I believe that patience is a good characteristic in a person. Being patient is good because you have to wait without getting angry or frustrated. For example, if you were in a crowded place, there would be a lot of people waiting in line to the entrance. If you're patient, you would wait calmly, understanding the situation. But if you're not, you might leave the line and get out, missing out on the experience. People might notice you when you are patient. Impatient people get angry quickly and cannot wait. They often cause disruptions, which is not nice. In conclusion, I believe that being patient is very important in life, as it helps us navigate through various situations with grace and composure.
1249	19214	7	3	I have been patient a lot of times but right now me and my friends are saving up to meet @PERSON1! That's a lot of patience just for one ticket; it's @MONEY1! So just imagine how long you have to wait to save that much money! It’s hard being patient, especially when you are going to meet a celebrity that you have the hugest crush on! I have been patient a lot during this process of saving up money. Every day, I do my best to cut down on unnecessary expenses. No matter how hard it's going to be, I can do it with patience. My friends and I have been patient and still are. I mean, could you stay patient if you were going to meet your favorite celebrity that you love? Well, it’s not that easy. First off, it takes a lot of patience to do chores and take care of your animals, plus count how much money you have. And when people borrow your money, that really sets you back. But like I said, no matter what, we are going to save up @MONEY1 plus that to meet him and we are going to be patient the whole time we save up. It is a lot of fun because you get to learn a few lessons and you get to see and learn how to become patient. Overall, patience is everywhere and you use patience in a lot of different things in life, like this exciting journey to meet our idol.
1250	19215	7	3	I had a friend; well, she is @CAPS4 best friend and we know each other from @NUM1 grade. Then in @NUM2 grade, she said she had to move to @LOCATION1. So she moved and she would call me all the time, about two times a week. I would always answer and talk to her for about three hours, enjoying our conversations. I will always remember her. Until this one day came, she called and @NUM3 was kind of busy because there were people over at our house. One of @CAPS4 mom's friends calls me and I told  @CAPS1 (@CAPS4 best  friend) hold on, someone is calling me. She said okay, so I left the phone on @CAPS4 bed while she  was still on the phone. I went to the living room and @CAPS4 mom's friend said can you get me a glass of water and @CAPS4 mom's five other friends said the same thing. I politely went and got them water. After that, @CAPS4 mom said go take out the trash. So I went and put on @CAPS4 scarf and took the trash out. For about @NUM4 mins I had her waiting. When I took out the trash, @CAPS4 best friend was outside and she said @CAPS3 can you stay outside with me and play for a little bit. And I forget all about @CAPS4 friend on the phone. I stayed outside for about @NUM5 min. then said I got to go back inside. I went in and sat on the sofa and @CAPS4 mom's friends that were over at our house were talking and I sat with them, talking, laughing, playing, and watching t.v.  After two hours and a half while I am watching t.v., I tell myself what am I forgetting. I knew I forgot something, but I didn’t know what. So I get up and I walk around the whole house, telling myself what  did I forget. When I get to the room I was talking to @CAPS1 in, I seen the phone on the bed and I picked it up and said @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS1, realizing I forgot about her. I said hello just to see if she was still there, even if I had a feeling she didn't, which was true. She told me you kept me waiting for the longest time ever. I told her wow, you're so patient; I would never wait that long. She said come on, you’re @CAPS4 best friend. I would wait forever for you. So we continued talking, strengthening our friendship through this incident that tested her patience.
1251	19216	7	3	Have you ever been patient? I know it can be incredibly hard for me to be patient! In my daily life, I usually am not patient because I have this strong urge to have things done right then and there. I simply don't really like to wait around. However, it's not that I can never be patient! I can manage to be patient when I am waiting for short periods of time. Usually, I have a tendency to rush, not when it comes to my work, but in social situations, I rush! Being patient essentially means to wait, and it's best to do so without complaining or moaning. An example of patience is when you are going to a party at @TIME1 and it is only @NUM1. In such a case, you have to wait for a long time! And usually, that waiting time seems to go by extremely slowly! Patience is a quality that is truly important. That is why I am working hard to try to be patient. You should too, as developing patience can greatly enhance our daily experiences.
1252	19217	7	3	Last year, on @DATE1, it was my birthday. So, I excitedly told my @CAPS1 what I wanted for my @DATE3. Out of all the things I mentioned, I specifically said, “@CAPS1, I want a @CAPS2” (which is a @CAPS3 station @CAPS4). So, on the @DATE2, we set out at three in the morning to get my @ORGANIZATION1. We ended up at Best Buy. As we walked up to the store and opened the door, we were shocked to see that there had to be over @DATE4 people in the store. Then we walked over to the game section. There were two copies available, and there were five people in the section. So, we quickly grabbed one of the two. But when we got in line, we realized that half of the people in the store were already in line. Then we waited in that seemingly never - ending line forever. It literally felt like hours to us to get through to the front of the line. We finally got home at @TIME1. This story is not about what I wanted; it's about patience. So, I was patient for two and a half hours waiting to buy my @CAPS2. Wherever you go, use patience, and you will be thought about and treated nicer than you expect, making your experiences more pleasant.
1253	19219	7	3	One day my dad and I decided we would go fishing. He kept saying “five more minutes” in a rather casual way, so I just sat there in the car, getting a bit restless. The car was stuffy, and I was eager to start our fishing trip. Finally, after what seemed like ages, I got out of the car to find him fast asleep with a note beside him saying @NUM1 more min. This little incident shows that sometimes in life, we need to be patient even when things don't go as planned, and waiting can be part of the experience.
1254	19220	7	3	A time when I was patient is when I was at home watching my baby brother for my mama so she could go grocery shopping. My brother was crying because he was sleepy and hungry. It was a bit chaotic as he wailed loudly. So, I gently put him to bed. I had to be patient because he was just a baby, and my mama was gone for a long time. She had to do other stuff like shop for clothes, @CAPS1, and shoes. When my brother woke up, he was crying even louder, and I tried everything I could think of to stop him from crying. I rocked him, sang to him, but nothing seemed to work. Finally, when my mama pulled up, he suddenly stopped crying and started laughing. That's a time when I was patient, and it taught me that patience can lead to rewarding moments.
1255	19221	7	3	When I went to @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I was in @CAPS4. The @CAPS4 was very @CAPS5, with a @CAPS6 and @CAPS7 atmosphere. The situation that showed my patience was when things were not @CAPS8 @CAPS9 for me. So, I stood in @CAPS11 of everyone, waiting patiently. Eventually, I got a front - row seat on the @CAPS13. This experience proved that patience can pay off, and waiting calmly can lead to good results.
1256	19222	7	3	I am writing about a time when someone I knew was extremely patient. He was having to be patient with one thing: me. When I was very young, once at a hotel pool, I had almost drowned. The incident was so terrifying that since then I was deathly afraid to swim. So, my patient friend took it upon himself to teach me how to swim at a pool in his trailer park. What he had to be patient about though was getting me into the deep water of the pool. He wanted me to go to the deep end of the pool but I was so afraid I would drown again. So then he decided he needed to get me into the deep end somehow. We got out of the pool and walked slowly to the deep end. He just simply told me to jump in, but he should've realized I wouldn't just jump in out of fear. He did eventually get me into the water of the deep end, but all I would do was tightly hang onto the edge and not let go to swim or anything. So after that, I just got out and he began to get a little frustrated. He was patient though, and kept working with me. After what seemed like endless hours, he pretended he was going to give up on me. I told him if he stayed, I'd go in the deep end. So he did, and I jumped in and realized it wasn't so bad after all. So now I love swimming, especially in the deep ends. That's how my friend's hard work and patience paid off for both me, and him. He taught me not only to swim but also the power of patience.
1257	19223	7	3	"It was the @DATE1 and I, @PERSON1, had applied for @ORGANIZATION1. I had applied in @DATE2 and was patiently waiting for a letter addressed to @CAPS1 @PERSON1 from @ORGANIZATION2. From the very beginning of the @DATE1, I had religiously checked the mail box every single day. Every day as I eagerly ran down the long driveway, my heart filled with hope that that day would be the day the letter would come. I was afraid because @NUM1 of the @DATE1 had passed and still no letter. It was like waiting for that one climactic moment at the climax of the movie when you think the main character will finally make his move. @CAPS4 was the first @DATE3 in @DATE4 and I was having a simple lunch. I thought to myself ""@CAPS2 is the day it has to be."" I heard the distinct sound of the mail truck pulling up to our mail box and bolted for the door. As I met the mail lady, she gave me a kind smile; she sees me every day. Every day she witnesses my smile fade as I check the mail for that one important letter addressed to @CAPS1 @PERSON2. She looks at me and says ""@CAPS4 is that day."" Patience is a hard thing to acquire, but in the @DATE1 I had had my fair share of patience. And finally, that patience was about to be rewarded."
1258	19224	7	3	A time I was patient was when I really wanted a game called X - Men @CAPS3 Wolverine. I was so excited about it and kept talking about it. My mom said I had to wait until @CAPS1 came strolling down the road. I can understand why she said that because we were a little short on cash at that time so we had to make the rest of what we had last a little longer. After a few weeks had passed, I gradually forgot all about the game. Then on @CAPS1 day, my sister and I got downstairs so fast, almost tripping over our feet in our excitement. Then when we were eagerly unwrapping gifts, I noticed a gift with my name on it. I quickly go grab it and I opened it and it was the X - Men @CAPS3 @CAPS4 and two other games that I wanted. After that, I went up to my room, grabbed my @CAPS5 and headphones, popped in X - Men @CAPS3 and played it all day long. That patience I had shown was totally worth it as I got not just one but three amazing games.
1259	19225	7	3	One day, I had to be patient. Why? Cause I had asked my mother can I go skate but she told me to be patient so we waited and waited until she finally said yes. After waiting, we were mad cause my mother had to go get the money for my sister. She had to drive to the bank to withdraw the money. It was really annoying having to wait even more. So next always be patient but if you do not be patient you will not get your way. Like one day my sister Haven and I wanted to go to the movie with our friends so we had to be patient for a whole hour. Why? Cause we had to wait until mom got off of work so she could give Haven @MONEY1 and me @CAPS1 @MONEY1. We sat around the house, constantly checking the clock. So that is how you be patient. Patience can be hard but it often leads to getting what you want.
1260	19226	7	3	When my friend and I went to @ORGANIZATION1, it was extremely busy. There were people everywhere. We didn't have to wait a long time at first, but for @CAPS1 my ride we had to wait a long time. The line was snaking around the area and it seemed to move so slowly. My friend was very patient and I was not. I kept complaining loudly on how long it took. I was fidgeting and sighing constantly. @CAPS1 eventually we got on the ride and had a blast. The ride was full of twists, turns, and exciting drops. It was horrible waiting, but it was worth it because the ride was the @ORGANIZATION2. It's the best ride in the whole wide world. That experience taught me that sometimes patience can lead to amazing rewards.
1261	19227	7	3	To write about a time I was patient is hard for me to do so since I am not a patient person, but I am going to try. Three days before the trip to Cedar Point, I was so excited that I simply could not wait for it to arrive. I tried various ways to make the time rush by, like constantly checking the calendar, but it didn't work. I had been off of school for @NUM1 weeks and I had done everything I wanted to do, from playing video games to hanging out with local friends. When my mom, sister, and friends and I go to Cedar Point, we always have a great deal of fun, of course. Every night since I knew we were going to Cedar Point, I would sit there and think about how many kids would ask and complain to their moms, saying, “Can't it come any faster?” But me, never. Not even once. I know that no one could make time go by faster. So I waited. I did my daily chores, packed my bags neatly, and watched some interesting TV shows. Trust me, it was very long and extremely boring, and I was itching to complain, but I didn't. I took a deep breath every time this feeling of impatience would come over me and said to myself that it was only a little wait compared to other things. I would also think about how lucky I am to be going to Cedar Point. I know I am a very impatient person and I am trying to fix it. This is what I try to do while waiting for Cedar Point to come along. This is what patience is to me, and in my life. This is also a time in my life when I was patient, and it shows that I can work on being more patient in other aspects too.
1262	19228	7	3	Being patient. Well, when I have a baby cousin coming from @LOCATION1 and she was adopted from California, so I have never seen her before. I have only seen her in the helper materials and photos. The photos showed her with a cute little smile. So I have heard her voice on my phone before. She sounds so cute, with a soft and sweet voice. And I'm missing my aunt and uncle too. I haven't seen them in @NUM1 years. They used to tell me funny stories when I was a kid. Out here, I'm still being patient, waiting for them to come, whether it's tomorrow or today. It's a surprise, and I'm trying my best to hold back my excitement. This waiting period is testing my patience, but it will be all worth it when I finally get to see them and meet my new baby cousin.
1263	19229	7	3	It was a cool @DATE2 @TIME3. The sun was just coming up as I quietly got into my box blind, making sure not to make any loud noises. It had snowed the @TIME1, but it was only @DATE1. Then again, I was in the upper peninsula of @LOCATION1, where the weather can be quite unpredictable. I was hunting for a monster ten - point buck with my brand new @NUM1 and @TIME2 gun, which could kill a deer @NUM2 yards away. I have been sitting for an hour, but it felt like an entire day. I've only seen a squirrel, and he was fun to watch as he scurried around, but it wasn't the rush you get when you see a deer. “@CAPS1, @CAPS1!” I was looking intently in the direction the sound was coming from. “@CAPS1, @CAPS1!” My gun was up, and my adrenaline was kicking in. “@CAPS1, @CAPS1!” I see movement, put my scope on it, and I see it. It's a grouse? I lowered the gun, calmed down, and watched it peck at some corn. It was @NUM3. Time for lunch, and all I had was a turkey sandwich, a shiny red apple, and a bottle of cold water. I started with my apple, eating it slowly while carefully looking around. When I saw a brown figure move, I quickly grabbed my gun with my apple still in my mouth. So picture this, a guy with an apple in his mouth, and looking through a scope. As I looked, I realized it was him, the big @NUM4. He had massive horns that looked like they could pierce through the air, a big, strong body, and he was probably five or maybe six years old. I put my crosshairs just behind the shoulder and I switched the safety off. Slowly, I pulled the trigger. My mind was a blur and “@CAPS4!” It was a perfect shot. Later @TIME2, I found him, and he was big @NUM5. I got him mounted, and that's where he is now, a proud reminder of that exciting hunting day.
1264	19230	7	3	I was patient when I had to wait in line for @NUM1 hours just to ride the thrilling roller - coaster. Then I got on it, and it took off at @NUM2 miles per hour. I was firmly stuck to my seat for five minutes as it zoomed through the tracks. Then it went down at a terrifying @NUM2 miles per hour, making my stomach do flips. I got off and decided to ride it again, feeling the strong centrifugal force. I was really into it. The drop of the roller - coaster was extremely steep. The ride was @NUM1 minutes long, and there were about @NUM5 people in the carriage with me. I went on the power - packed ride again. It was an amazing experience. My heart was still pounding with excitement. I came home as it was getting dark in the @TIME1. I woke up the next day and ate a delicious breakfast. The whole time, I waited patiently in the line, and it was all worth it for that amazing ride. This shows that patience can lead to great experiences.
1265	19231	7	3	The time when I was patient, I was about @NUM1 because I was in @NUM2 grade. I'm @NUM3 now, but back to what I was saying. I was seven in the @NUM2 grade and I was standing in the lunch line. These kids just kept on cutting in front of me, pushing their way in just for some lunch. I could feel my anger rising, but I just sat there, being patient and keeping my cool. I reminded myself that getting angry wouldn't solve anything. I just stood there calmly. When we finally got to do something else later, I was still patient. When we reached the destination, I was okay with it. It was okay because I still got to eat my lunch. This experience taught me that patience can help us get through small annoyances in life, and in the end, things usually work out fine.
1266	19232	7	3	One day when I was being patient is when I was waiting @CAPS1 @NUM1 to come out of GameStop. I stood there, looking around the area while waiting. For that one day until @CAPS1 @NUM1 came out, I kept looking at the signs of the game and I said “@CAPS2 must be a good game”. So instead of waiting at GameStop, I went home and played @ORGANIZATION1 football @NUM3 on my Xbox @NUM4. As I played, I started to feel tired, and then more and more tired. Eventually, I fell asleep on my pep game chair until the morning. My older brother woke up and said “let's go to GameStop to get @CAPS1”. So we went to GameStop and waited in a long line for about an hour and thirty minutes until it was our turn to buy @CAPS1. It cost like @MONEY2. I had @MONEY3 and my brother had @MONEY1. He didn't want to put any money in for the game and I said “I'll pay @MONEY3 and you will pay @MONEY1”. So we bought the game and played it until we beat it.
1267	19233	7	3	Here is a way that I had to be patient, and we all know that in life, one has to be patient with others. Yes, it was my birthday. I wasn't thinking about my birthday party, the delicious cake or the cold ice - cream. No, I was thinking of getting the money. I opened the first present, and there was no money. Then I opened the second present, and yes, there was money. And so on until I got to the last present. It was a card, so I was sure it had to have money in it. I could hardly wait until I could buy something with it. How does being patient come into this? Well, I had to wait, and wait, and wait. It took nearly five whole months! Could you believe having to wait so long just to use that money? Well, anyways, it paid off. When I finally got to use it, I couldn't believe it. It was the best thing in the whole world. That is why being patient is very hard to do if it's for a long time, but it's also a good thing to do because it pays off every time.
1268	19234	7	3	Tick, tock, tick, tock. Every muscle in my body was tense, and it urged me to run and look for my dad. The sound of the clock in my head was driving me crazy. Tick, tock, tick, tock. But I stayed put, my eyes carefully scanning the crowded airport. Tick, tock, tick, tock. And then I saw him. Tick, tock, tick, tock. I ran forward as fast as I could and gave him a giant hug. The clock in my head stopped ticking. Hi @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and @CAPS1 gonna tell you about a time I was patient. I think that I was really patient when I got back from a trip, with my friend to @LOCATION1. I was waiting at the airport for my dad to come and pick me up and I was so excited! You see, I had been gone for two weeks and I was really homesick. It took all my self - control not to go looking for him, but I knew I couldn't just go running off. I had to be very patient. In the end, it was worth it because it would have been harder to find him if I had gone looking for him. As you can see, I think I was very patient when waiting for my dad in the airport. Thank you for listening.
1269	19236	7	3	This is a story about a time when I was patient. It was the @NUM1 @DATE1 and we were on the plane, all excited about going on a cruise. When we got to the ship, I was so excited that I was constantly thinking about how much fun I was gonna have, what my room would look like, and all the cool new places I was going to visit. So we got on the dock and there was a line. I patiently waited to get on. Then @CAPS1, there was another line to check your passport, so I was patient and waited. Again @CAPS1, there was another long line. It was to get our room keys, but I was patient and waited again. I just stood there for a little bit, trying to pass the time, and then it was done. But wait, you would never guess, there was another line. So like all the other lines, I stood there, using my iPod to listen to music. Then my dad said “ready”. I said “ready for what, another line?” He said “no, to look at your room and relax”. I was so excited. Finally, we were done with the lines, no more waiting for a while. So I opened my door with my very special key that we had to wait in line for and looked at my room. It was amazing. But the bathroom was a little small, but overall it was great. I was so happy to finally be done with the lines. That is a time when I was patient.
1270	19237	7	3	One time I was going to see my friend that lived at the end of the street. I walked there slowly, taking in the beautiful scene of the sun going down. The young kids were playing and laughing carelessly in the neighborhood. A @CAPS1 boarder waved at me, but I didn't trust him enough to wave back since he seemed like a bit of a strange person, not to be mean or anything. I finally got to her house and knocked on the door. She answered about @NUM1 seconds afterward. “Oh, hi @CAPS2!” she exclaimed and smiled kindly. “I have to finish my homework and eat.” I nodded. So I went to wait in the park. I sat on the swing and started to swing back and forth gently. An hour went by. I patiently sat there, looking around the park every now and then. I didn't know if she was coming out and decided maybe I should go home. It was getting dark and I could barely see the swings anymore. When I got up, she was outside. I told her I had to go home because it was late, but I could come back tomorrow. That was a time I was patient.
1271	19238	7	3	One *Saturday*, I was very patient when our flight got *delayed*. We were going to *Miami* that *Saturday* when all of a sudden the *delayed* sign came up on the *screen*. I was kind of sad but I said I had to be patient! Our flight was *severely delayed*. So when we were waiting we did a lot of things! First we went to eat in the food court! We decided to go to *Chili's*. We also had to wait for our food! Got some good *nachos* & they were very good! Then we went to the *souvenir shop*. At the *souvenir shop* I got *three* key chains for my friends! Then I got myself *two* magazines and a reading *lamp*. I also got some *chocolate bars*. They were very good! Next we just took a little walk around the *airport*. Then we went and sat down & relaxed for a couple *hours*. Then I fell asleep! When I woke up we were just about *ready* to board! I was very *excited* to finally get to *Miami* & enjoy all of the *warm* weather! I learned that being patient really does matter! That was the time I was really patient.
1272	19239	7	3	Being patient! Patience is a good learning skill. The three steps to being patient are being quiet, not complaining, and waiting a while if you have to. My mom and I went hunting with *John*, my step - dad. We had to be quiet so a deer could come. We sat there being extremely quiet. I think it was the quietest I've been ever! All of us were getting sick of being quiet but we had to be in order for a buck to come. It was very cold and I was dressed warmly but I was still cold. There was a little heater in the *hunting shed* thing we were in. We couldn't complain about being cold or tired, or just waiting, so we all sat there not complaining, which was good. When I was about to ask if we could go, a ten - pointer came out of the woods to find something to eat. We were waiting patiently for the deer to come closer. *John* loaded the gun and pulled the trigger. The buck jumped and ran off. *Poor* shot! We got out of the shed and searched for a blood trail. We had to wait a while to find the deer but it was worth it. The right way to be patient is shutting your mouth, not whining, and waiting. A good skill to learn is being patient. Being patient truly pays off in the end.
1273	19240	7	3	Being patient is a very hard thing for me but one day I learned my lesson. It was a *Saturday* and my mom woke me up at *7 am*. She said we had a lot to do. When we got in the car I didn't know that I was going to have to be patient the whole day. First, on our way to the *Whole Foods* market we got stuck in a traffic jam for about *30* mins to an hour. The cars were barely moving, and I was getting really frustrated. When we finally made it to the *Whole Foods* market we had to stand in line for about *15* mins. I told my mum I'm ready to leave but she said I have to be patient and that being impatient is a bad thing. After we left there we had to take my grandma to the doctors. It took them almost two hours just to call her name. Then it took another *30 minutes* to get checked out. After that we went shopping for some clothes and shoes and the mall was very crowded and busy. We were at the mall for like four hours and most of the time we were standing in lines. People were pushing and shoving, and it was really annoying. Finally, we went home because it was time for my mom to start cooking. I learned that I need to work on being patient because it is a part of life, and without it, daily tasks can become much more difficult.
1274	19241	7	3	At one *point* in life, you would have to be patient. Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant. Somebody that's patient experiences difficulties without complaining. There was one *point* in life when I was patient. Yay! Yeah! My mom is taking my friends and I to *Six Flags* *Adventure*. I called many friends, and told them if they wanted to go. Meanwhile, we packed up some water bottles and hopped into the *car*. We were all looking out the window. OMG! Look at those big roller coasters. One of my friends shouted out. There we were at *Six Flags* *Adventure*; the first ride I saw was the *Goliath*. The highest and fastest roller coaster there. Well, it only lasted *60* seconds. So we were all talking about it, then we decided to go on it. Wow! The line is huge. We all said. I shouted out it's ok, I heard it's an awesome ride, let's just all be patient. Meanwhile, we waited and waited, chatting and joking to pass the time. Until we were finally the next people to ride. We went on the ride, and then all of a sudden the ride started. We didn't know and it only lasted *60* seconds. We waited about two hours but it was worth it. In conclusion, I really do think that being patient is a good thing in life, even if it takes hours. I learned so much from just going on the *Goliath*. We should all be patient because no matter where you are, you will always need to be patient to enjoy the good things in life.
1275	19242	7	3	"I remember one time I was impatient, it was when my *mom* called and said she was going to send me *50*$. *Immediately* I asked her when she was going to send it and she said *next Friday*. Today was *Monday* so that meant I had to *wait four* days. *The next day* came up and the *mail* truck came by and I thought I had money but it wasn't *next Friday* yet, *frustratedly* I said, ""This is so annoying."" *Friday* came, I was still waiting so I tried going to the *store* to pass the time. ""It's taking forever!"" So *when* it was *Saturday* they had my favorite game on sale, ""The Bully"". The case had a yellow sticker that *said $40* and no tax at all. *Angrily* I went home. My dad woke me up and said ""it's *next Friday*"". *Hastily* I rose up, ate breakfast, *then* checked the mail. *Disappointedly* it was bills, bills, bills and ""my money"". My *mom* sent it *finally*. At last I said I have money, so I bought some ice - cream *and* I bought my favorite game ""Bully"". ""That's the time when I was patient and learned that waiting for the right moment is important."
1276	19243	7	3	Patience in @CAPS1: Understanding and being tolerant of others' actions and situations is what truly makes up patience. In order to play on any sport team, you have to have patience. I say that because you might not always get the pass or score the point, but you are still important to the team. Your time will come when you can shine and contribute significantly. A time when I was patient was when I was on the @CAPS1 court. It was during our game; the carman – @PERSON1 girls @CAPS1 team was going against flushing. A young lady from flushing was called for a foul (I didn’t even see it. Truth be told, I’m not even sure if it happened, but you can’t argue with the officials). She was shooting her free throws. She was taking forever! I’m surprised her shot wasn't taken away. What was she waiting for? New @CAPS2? I didn’t say anything. I just stood there, nice and patient! Eventually, the girl took her shots (@CAPS3 @CAPS4), and she didn’t make either of them. Anyhow, I was so proud of myself. I felt really happy for myself. I’m just now realizing that the whole time I was standing there, I didn’t make a face, or say anything, or think something negative in my head! I was just standing tall, minding my own business, and intently watching to see if it would go in. Then on the second shot (you can now box out), I just assumed the box - out position, sitting down, hands out, and facing the basket. I was really happy for myself, and I even told the girl good shot. Hence, it pays off to be patient. One, I got the rebound, and my teammate got the point, and I also got an assist. Two, I was displaying the right way to act to the opponents. Nobody’s perfect, and you’ll have to wait and see who will score the next point! In the end, patience in sports not only helps the team but also reflects well on one's character.
1277	19244	7	3	It was my first game. I was extremely pumped and ready to go in. The coach yelled “big guy,” and I was by his side in an instant. Then he said, “Next play you're going in.” But then the assistant coach said no, I wasn’t allowed to. The whole time, I didn’t complain at all. I never said one word of protest to anyone. Instead, I helped other people on the team, like tying shoelaces or passing water bottles. It was still fun being part of the game atmosphere. The whole time, at least I didn’t complain and make it worse for everyone else. I spent the entire game on the sidelines. I never went in, not once. I was very patient, though not to say I wasn’t mad. I was so frustrated that I was ready but couldn't play. At least I got some exercise just standing there, constantly moving my feet to stay warm. The whole time, I supported my teammates. I encouraged them when they were down, gave them high - fives after good plays, and helped in any way shape or form. I listened to them complain about their mistakes, but I also gave them support. There were moments when I was so mad I could have exploded. I was ready to show what I could do, but my coach said no. That one stupid word “no” stood in my way. But at least I learned something. I learned that patience is a virtue, and sometimes, you have to wait for the right opportunity to prove yourself.
1278	19245	7	3	Hunting, especially when you are turkey hunting, you need to be extremely still and quiet. You have to have a great deal of patience. If you move even a single muscle, all the turkeys will run away in an instant. Sometimes you will be sitting for hours and hours, just waiting for that one perfect shot. I remember when I was hunting with my dad @CAPS1. We were sitting under a big, old tree for probably three hours. It was a long and quiet wait, with only the sounds of the forest around us. Finally, a turkey came into view. Unfortunately, just about when I had a clear shot, my dad made a small noise that scared them all away. But I still had the patience to stay out there for another @NUM1 hours. I sat there, hoping that another turkey would come. That is my example of patience. In the end, patience in hunting is not just about getting a shot; it's about enjoying the process and being in tune with nature.
1279	19246	7	3	One day, two years ago, I was going to visit the @ORGANIZATION1 train. There was a @NUM1 hour wait. Once we got to the front of the line, we had to go back to the end because my mom forgot the tickets. So now we had to wait 2 1/@NUM1 hours to get to the beginning again. It was extremely hot outside, and the sun was beating down on us. Once we finally got there, the guy told us that we could have just told him our name, and he could have found our tickets online. My mom got really mad, but I tried to calm her down. In the end, we got to go on the @ORGANIZATION1 train, which was really fun. We got to see all the beautiful scenery along the way. That's the time I had to @CAPS2 patiently wait for over @NUM3 hours, standing in extreme heat. It taught me that sometimes, setbacks happen, but if you are patient, you can still have a great experience.
1280	19247	7	3	In my opinion, being patient is when you are waiting your turn for something. And being impatient means not waiting your turn and rushing into things. In your whole life, you need patience because sometimes you might just have to wait. Whether it's waiting in line at the grocery store or waiting for your turn in a game. I have patience, and I know a lot of people who have patience too. I was raised to have patience. When you're doing something, don't rush because you can mess up. For example, if you're painting a picture, rushing might make the colors look messy. But don't go way too slow because then people will think you don't know how to do it. You can just go at your own pace so you can get it done right and the way you want to. People who don't have patience aren't always happy all the time. They get frustrated easily and miss out on the details of things. In conclusion, patience is an important quality that can lead to better results and a happier life.
1281	19248	7	3	"Have you ever had to be patient before? I have, and this story will tell you all about it. Last year on my birthday, my kind - hearted uncle @CAPS1 promised me a sleek new phone. But he told me I had to wait for him to get the money. It was tough, but I knew I had to be patient. So I waited patiently, day after day. Then @DATE2 finally came. However, more months passed, and I still hadn't heard from my uncle. I began to become extremely frustrated with him because he had made that firm promise of the phone to me. I told my mom about my annoyance, and she said he has always been like that and advised me to keep my patience, saying, ""So what if he got it a little late."" I was thinking in my head, ""A little? It's been almost a year!"" Then on @DATE1, my uncle came over for our big family reunion. He then told me he knew that I thought he forgot about the phone. I knew he was right, but just then a little light bulb went off in my head - he couldn't have forgotten about it. Soon it was time to eat, and that is when he presented the shiny @CAPS2 touch phone to me. I was so excited that I just had to jump up and give him a big hug. He told me that whenever he promised me something, he would test my patience to see if the wait was worth it, and in this case, it definitely was. So whenever your patience is being tested, keep your cool; it will all come to you soon. To conclude this story, I want to say patience is important to have because without it, you will never be able to wait for anything in life. The rewards of patience are truly worth it."
1282	19249	7	3	You will say that you are bored very fast. Most people are because when you get out in the deep, quiet woods, there's nothing much you can do except watch and wait. If you make even the slightest noise, you will see nothing for your whole hunt. Hunting is all about patience, but it is a truly great reward when that graceful doe, powerful buck, or whatever you're hunting is right in your sight. There are sometimes that I have been impatient, and there are times that I have been patient. When I was younger, I was very impatient. I would get up and walk around restlessly. But when I got older, I got more patient. Like when I got my first deer, it was a magnificent eight - point buck. Hunting in @MONTH1 takes a great deal of patience, but I like it, and it's really fun. Patience in hunting is what makes the experience and the catch so rewarding.
1283	19250	7	3	One time I was patient was when I had to get some important @CAPS1 done, and my mom was on the computer. I needed the computer for my @CAPS1 urgently. She told me she would be only a few minutes. So I waited calmly at first. I decided to watch an interesting episode of SpongeBob while I waited. As the episode ended, I went back to the computer. She still wasn't done! So I made some delicious bagel bites, which are basically pizza on a mini bagel. I ate @NUM1 bagel bites one by one, and so on. I got to @NUM2 bagel bites, and I started getting full. But I kept eating because I was really hungry. I ate and ate until I finally got stuffed, so I decided to stop. I went to check to see if mom was finally done yet, but yet she wasn't. I went outside to go play some exciting sports with my friends. We were out there for about @NUM3 @CAPS2, and then we got tired, and eventually, we all went home. As I walked in the door, I looked at the computer; it was still in use. I went to go take a warm bath because baths are soothing. I took a while in there because it was so warm and relaxing. I got out, went upstairs to change into comfortable clothes, and came downstairs. Surprisingly, my mom was off! I went to get on, but she came in and said it was time for bed. So I woke up early the next morning to do my @CAPS1. This took a lot of patience because it was really hard to wait so long, but in the end, I managed to complete my task.
1284	19251	7	3	"One time I was in a situation where I had to be patient. We were on our way to see a beautiful point. The whole family was with us. We all were in @NUM1 cars and vans. I was in the van @NUM2, and there were others in the car and @NUM3 in another car. It was like a long @NUM3 - hour drive. I was in the car with my mom and @NUM1 sister. We were on the road for about an hour. First, I was playing with the fan in the car, then I was just having a nice family talk. But after about an hour, I was so impatient. All I could hear was my mom saying, ""Be patient, we'll get there."" I was like, ""No, no, I want to be there @CAPS1 right now."" She replied, ""We got all day."" Then we stopped at a nice little place to get something to eat. After that short break, we continued our journey, and then we were finally there. It taught me that patience is key during long - distance trips."
1285	19253	7	3	One time I had to use patience when we were driving to the beautiful @CAPS1. It was in a cozy minivan with my mom, dad, cute baby sister who was @NUM1 months old, and my aunt. We were in the van for about @NUM2 to @NUM3 hours, stuck in the limited space. By the time we got to the hotel, it was @NUM4 o'clock @CAPS2 time, and in @LOCATION1, it was @NUM5 or @NUM6 am. I was very tired of being patient. I'm not a very patient person, so my mom was very proud of how great I did with the baby crying constantly and being stuck in one place for those long hours. It was extremely difficult, having to sit still and endure the noise and the long drive. But the outcome was great! We reached our destination safely, and the stay at the hotel promised to be wonderful. This experience showed me that even if patience is hard, it can lead to great things.
1286	19254	7	3	Being patient is incredibly hard. I absolutely hate waiting. Whether it's for things that will take days to come up, like mail or packages, or for people, or just about anything. Patience requires an effort that I simply don't have. I really have never been a patient person. I don't know many people who are either. There's my mom who “claims” to be patient, but she really isn't! I think one of the least favorite phrases is “be patient”! I tense up and get frustrated when I'm impatient! When I'm waiting to call someone, I'm tempted to call them a hundred times. I'm patient when I want to be (which is never), and sometimes when I don't realize that I'll be impatient in about three seconds because I'm done with the writing page and time isn't up yet. In the end, it's clear that patience is a virtue I still struggle to acquire.
1287	19255	7	3	When I was @NUM1 years old, my mom started making my @DATE1 present. She was going to make a beautiful blanket. Sadly, she didn't find the right materials for it right away. I had to be patient, but it wasn't done, and then... My @DATE1 was almost @NUM2 months ago... She finally found a time to work on it, but she said she couldn't find what she needed in @NUM3. I have been patient and every year on my @DATE1 and on @CAPS1 I ask if it is finished, but I'm really starting to lose it. Can I be patient for a little while longer? Well, I guess I'll keep trying, but I really hope it gets done soon.
1288	19256	7	3	One time when I was patient was when I was fishing. We were fishing on a cold, windy night and no fish were biting. I was just sitting there being patient, munching on sunflower seeds. My dad was getting mad and I was still sitting there listening to the backwards Celtics games on the radio. We were only catching little fish that night, nothing to eat or keep. We left at like one in the morning and went to get the boat on the trailer. It was pitch black and freezing cold. I eventually had to get in the icy water and put the boat on and strap it down. On the way home, one bent trailer tire popped about five miles away from home. I was still patient but my dad wasn't. We stopped and went out to look at the tire. We didn't have a spare so we drove home on our rim. That is the most patient I have ever been. To improve this writing sample, she could have explained what a millennium is. That would make things more clear. Also, she could stop using “I” to start most of her sentences. That would make it more interesting. In the third sentence she put “were” instead of “was”. That would make her sound smarter and get a better grade. In the second paragraph I don't know if she meant @TIME1 or @TIME1. If she said if it was a.m. or p.m., it would make the story more clear. If she corrected all those things, this would be a good sample. Overall, patience can be tested in many unexpected situations.
1289	19257	7	3	When I was patient, I was sitting at a restaurant. And I ordered my drink and Mike was the first one to get served. Then when we got our food, they said it will take about five more minutes, so I sat there patiently. It was fifteen minutes later when the waitress came back and she had made the wrong food. I was starting to lose my patience, but then I just relaxed. She came back with my meal this time it was the right one. So I was very happy. And I was really hungry so I ate it very fast. When I was done, they gave me a free discount because of the mix - up they had with my meal. And my mom bought me something from a store for having such great patience. And that's when I was very patient. It shows that patience can sometimes be rewarded.
1290	19258	7	3	We were going to @CAPS1. Me and my cousins were so excited! We were waiting eagerly to ride the skyline. After we ate a delicious meal, me, my cousins and my [relative] headed for the skyline. The skyline gave you the whole view of Cedar Point. “I'm so excited,” said one of my sisters. “Yeah, me too!” said the other. We were walking towards it. It took a really long time. When we saw the line, we groaned! “This will take so long,” said my sister. I was so surprised when my @NUM1 - year - old cousin [reaction]. “Wow it looks really high,” said my cousin. “Don't worry, we have @CAPS3 with us. She'll take care of us,” said my younger sister. Finally it was our turn. There were @NUM1 small kids behind us, wanting to go on so badly. “Why don't you go ahead,” said my cousin. I was shocked my cousin had so much patience. Usually she would start wanting to go first for everything! I was so proud of my cousin. We had a great time there. I hope we come back again and create more memories like this.
1291	19259	7	3	"Patience is a hard thing to have, but there are rewards to having it. I had a teacher in band class whom no one could remember, and he forgot to give us our report cards. So after a few weeks, I made a bet with him that if he didn't bring us our report cards the next day, he owed me a bag of raffles. Weeks went by, then months went by, until finally, it was the end of the year, and he still didn't have them. Once school started up again and we were halfway through the school year, my band teacher walked in and gave me two packs of Swittles. I then remembered the deal we had made and said, ""You're only supposed to give me one."" He told me, ""The second one is for being patient."" This experience clearly shows that patience can indeed bring unexpected rewards."
1292	19260	7	3	Patience is a valuable thing. Every day, I go to basketball practice to watch all my friends play. I don't participate in the practice because a few weeks ago, I broke my ankle playing soccer. It takes a great deal of patience to sit in a gym and watch your friends have fun for an hour and a half. Every Tuesday and Friday, I sit on the bench and watch the team play a basketball game. I have the choice not to go to the games, but I exercise patience and go anyway. It is very boring to just sit there, but I do it so I can watch and play next year. You know now that patience is a virtue. It takes lots of patience to do really anything. Do you have patience? Patience isn't when you're sitting somewhere for a while and get upset with someone. It is when you are calm and waiting, and I'm sure this patience will pay off when I'm back on the court.
1293	19261	7	3	The one time when I was patient was on the exam day of last year. Some of the ways how I was patient was by keeping to myself or, as you know it, being quiet. The exam itself is not that hard, but when you have to have patience, that's when it gets difficult for you and me. Patience is key because you will have to use it for a long time! But let's get back on track shall we. On the exam day, when you are done, you have to wait for your classmates to be done. So in that spare time, you can read a book or check over your work. Patience is also important because when you're taking the exam, you can't rush on it. You have to take your time and know that you are timed. That's where patience comes in! Sometimes when you are done with the exam, you can just sit there and think about what you did today. The reason I say this is because of other people! If everyone in the classroom doesn't have patience, you are most likely to fail the exam. You have to have a silent and quiet room! Now if everybody in the room is being silent, then you can and will do good. When I have the exam, I show patience when I am done because I care about other people's work habits during the exam. I understand that you don't have the exam anymore, but it is about being patient! When I get my test results back this year in seventh grade, I hope I did good because my classmates and I all had patience! And remember, patience is the key thing to success.
1294	19262	7	3	"One day at school, John was waiting in line to get his lunch when out of the blue, three kids popped right in front of him. John said to the kids, ""You know you have to go to the back of the line, right?"" ""No, we don't,"" said the kid. Then a few minutes later, a girl named Lily (that John likes) was going to the very back of the line, but John said she could cut in front of him. So she did. Once John and his friends got up to where they got their food and they were waiting to pay for it, the kid two spots away from Lily couldn't remember his student ID number. It turned out that he was a new student. So they had to make him a student ID number, and then he paid for his food. Finally, they got through. Lily sat down with her friends, but John had nowhere to sit because his friends were outside. So Lily saw him and asked if he wanted to sit with her, and he did. Finally, he was done. Lily asked if John wanted to hang out at recess, and he said sure. But one of Lily's friends was not done eating, so they had to wait for her. When she was done, they went outside. This was what John was waiting for. Then the bell rang to go inside. He was mad, but he got to hang out with Lily the whole time, which made it all worthwhile."
1295	19263	7	3	Last summer, while I was up at my family's cabin, my step - dad taught my brothers, their friends, and me how to water - ski. It seemed a bit daunting, but not really. I tried first. Using all the steps my step - dad told me to, and being patient with myself, I got prepared in the water. Out of the blue [literally, we were on a lake], I got up on my skis just like a pro! I could do it all. When the water - skiing session came to an end, I brought the boat up to the cabin. There was a girl who was hesitant to try. When we got out to the lake, and I had skied a few times, she was up to here in the water, trying to decide if she was going to try skiing for sure. We sat there for what seemed like an hour waiting for her decision. But, in the end, she decided not to try. I was very proud that day because I didn't try to persuade her into trying it. I was very patient with her. And although her decision was the wrong one in my opinion, I am still proud of myself to this day, for showing patience and respecting her choice on that boat.
1296	19264	7	3	When I was about seven and my mom was pregnant with my younger sister. It was the night before she was due to have her. We were all sound asleep in our beds. When my mom suddenly started to scream in pain, we all rushed into her room in a panic. My dad quickly asked her what was going on and she said, “She's coming!” My dad then raced to the car, put it in gear, and drove off in a hurry, leaving us and my mom, who was about to give birth, behind. Then, when my dad realized he had forgotten us. So, when he got back home to pick us up, it was already morning. They took us to a special room in the hospital. The nurses prepared my mom for the delivery. My little sister and I were waiting anxiously in the seats next to her bed. Then, when they took my mom to get an ultrasound, we had to wait patiently in the corridor. It was finally time for the delivery. My sister, grandma, and I had to wait outside the delivery room. We were so patient, even though it took over an hour to get my little sister out. When they were stitching my mom up, they took my little sister to get all cleaned up. When we could see her through the window, I was eager to see her get her first bath, shots, and when they put those patches on her. I had thought she was an angel. But when they brought her to our room, my mom looked exhausted and pale, and my brand - new baby sister was so incredibly beautiful. My mom said she was so proud of us being so patient while waiting for our little sister. My mom said she would name her Lily. And we all liked that name. I was so happy that day, and it was a precious memory of family and the joy of new life.
1297	19265	7	3	Patience is something not very many people have. I am in between; I can be patient at times, but at other times I'm not. To be patient is to be understanding and tolerant. It also means you can go through tough times without complaining. Every year, we go to the Golden Gate Bridge for Labor Day to walk across it. The rule is, if you don't complain, you get delicious fudge. This year, I thought I wasn't gonna get fudge because I had pulled muscles in both my legs and the night before, embers from a campfire had burnt my legs. I knew that to get fudge, I had to be patient. So, I slowly got dressed, limped to the bridge, and gathered up all my confidence and patience and started the long walk. Every year we try and beat our bridge - walking time, and I thought my legs would slow us down. So I kept telling myself “be patient” over and over. Then I sped up, going past the first three miles in 30 minutes (because my legs were worn out). I knew to beat our record, we would have to walk two miles in less than twenty minutes. We were walking faster than I thought we could, and my legs felt like they were on fire and ready to burst! I couldn't do it anymore. I knew I had to stop and complain, but my determination kept telling me “Keep going!” My willpower wouldn't let me stop; it was about tolerating the pain and being patient. I also had to be patient if I wanted fudge. So I cranked up the speed and sped to the finish line, not only to get fudge but also to beat our record. Thanks to patience, I got delicious fudge and we beat our record. That's a time I'll never forget because I had patience and I kept going until I crossed the finish line. That's how I was patient, and I'm glad I was patient with my legs. I'm not very patient usually, so thank goodness for patience, which taught me that I can overcome difficulties when I persevere.
1298	19266	7	3	A time I was patient! Being patient is all about being tolerant and understanding. Sometimes when I'm in a bad mood, I have to be patient when someone asks me a dumb question or gets on my nerves. One day last year, I was feeling sick and really upset because it was ruining my summer vacation. My little sister, Emily, wanted some ice cream, but not from the ice - cream truck that passed by every twenty minutes. She wanted it from the ice - cream shop which was about seven to ten blocks away. I was bundled up in my warm blanket, feeling miserable, when she jumped up on my bed. “Please, please, I want to go get ice - cream. Please, please, please!!!” she pleaded. I snapped at her in a mean voice. “Emily, you little hob - goblin, get off my bed or I'll get really angry!!!” I was so caught up in my bad mood that crying seemed so silly and stupid to me at that moment. Tears welled up in her eyes, and I didn't realize at that moment that she was little (four years old) and didn't quite understand that I didn't feel good. I quickly apologized and explained that I was sick. Immediately after, she ran out of the room. Ten minutes later, she came back with a hot cup of tea and Emily said, “I made mama make you some tea.” That was heart - warming for me. After I drank it, Emily asked if I felt better. I said a little, then she got back on my bed and started bouncing. I was patient with her and knew that she didn't fully understand yet. So I got up and took her to the ice - cream shop to get some ice - cream. Emily was happy, and that made me happy. I felt extremely proud that I was patient with Emily even when she got on my nerves. I know I wasn't patient with her at the “beginning,” but at the end, I was, and it strengthened our bond.
1299	19267	7	3	It was a sunny Saturday afternoon and we were up at the lake. We were all excited as we wanted to go on the boat and go tubing. We carefully carried out all the necessary things to the boat and got all ready to go. We tried to start the boat, but there was no response. My dad and cousin took the back of the seats off and peered inside. There was a large amount of water in the back, and they realized the bilge pump had stopped working. My step - dad took a close look at it and said that it was going to be re - wired. He worked hard and soon re - wired the boat, but it still hadn't worked. All the kids were now getting antsy and restless, fidgeting around. Every adult said we needed to have patience. Everybody then calmed down and walked away to wait quietly. Pretty soon, we heard a boat start up that sounded exactly like my dad's. We ran down there with great excitement, and sure enough, the boat was started. We quickly hopped in, and there we went, tubing down the beautiful river, enjoying the cool water and the wind in our faces. Later that day, my mom had said to me, “Patience is a virtue,” and that experience really taught me the importance of being patient in difficult situations.
1300	19268	7	3	When I was 10 years old, my mom used to be impatient all the time and got annoyed easily. But then one day, she was going to take a shower. However, people kept going in and out of the bathroom, and she patiently waited for a while. I got up from my spot and saw her standing there. I quickly hid behind the corner. As I peeked from one end to the other, she was still standing there, looking sleepy and almost falling asleep, yet she was still being patient. Another person then stepped into the bathroom, and I quickly walked over and said, “Excuse me, but my mom is coming. She's been waiting.” So I gently woke up my mom, saying, “Mom, mom, wake up. Go take a shower!” She slowly woke up and went to take a shower. After she came out, she let out a sigh and said, “Ahh, it kind of feels good. That was better.” It was a small moment that showed me my mom could be patient when she needed to be, and it made me appreciate her more.
1301	19270	7	3	Iím constantly patient mostly because of my younger sister. Sometimes it's easier than others to be patient with her, but most of the time Iím able to manage. I think this is a great example. One chilly @DATE1 @TIME1 I was in my mother's room and I saw her doing her make - up. I asked ì@CAPS1, did you get @CAPS5 good at putting make - up?î @CAPS2 responded ìwith patience and years of practice.î The next day when I had gotten an allowance, I asked my mom ì@CAPS3, mom, can we go to @ORGANIZATION1 later?î @CAPS2 replies ì@CAPS4, @CAPS9?î I answered ìso I can get some make - up to practice withî. ì@CAPS6.î @CAPS2 says. When we get there, thereíre @CAPS5 many choices to choose from! I asked my mom to help me select the best ones! After we check out, it's time to go home and practice! Sadly my first lesson in make - up didn't go too great, but I did ask my mom for some help and @CAPS2 said ì@CAPS8, I know youíll catch on soon!î and I wondered out loud ì@CAPS9?î @CAPS2 almost said as a whisper ìbecause anyone can pay someone else to do their make - up and hair, but almost no one can or will take the time and patience to learn it themselves.î This experience taught me that patience is key in learning new skills.
1302	19271	7	3	When my @CAPS2 and I got into the checkout line at @CAPS1, @CAPS6 heard impatient groans and sighs around us. Almost every line was extremely long and the whole store was packed with shoppers. I groaned along with everybody else, annoyed at the long wait. My @CAPS2 continued her cheerful whistling, and didn't seem to notice the chaos around. ì@CAPS2, this is going to take forever!î I whined. ìDon't be so negative. Itís not that long.î @CAPS4 replied. @CAPS4 saw my responding glare and chuckled. ìHow about we play a game?î @CAPS6 then started a game of eye spy for @NUM1 minutes or so as the line slowly inched forward. After @CAPS6 finished our game, @CAPS4 continued to make small talk, chatting about random things, and then checked her list to make sure @CAPS6 had everything while I played a simple game on her phone. Soon @CAPS6 were up next and I smiled in relief, and thought to myself it was a good thing @CAPS2 kept us occupied! As @CAPS6 walked out of the store my @CAPS2 said, ìSee, when youíre patient, you get food!î @CAPS6 both laughed and drove home, realizing that patience can turn a frustrating situation into a bearable one.
1303	19272	7	3	Every year me and my entire family take a trip to @LOCATION2 to the @LOCATION1 beach. Everyone in my family that goes is me, my mom and my dad, along with my little sister, my three cousins, my aunt and uncle and my grandparents. We all stay in one big hotel together, which usually has @NUM1 well - furnished bedrooms. Out of the whole year we only stay for two weeks. So I have to be very patient during the other three hundred and fifty - one days. While we are there we fish for sharks and sting rays in the clear blue waters, hang out on the soft sandy beach and swim either in the vast ocean or the inviting pool. The beautiful scenery, the fun activities, and the quality time with family make it absolutely worth the wait. I always have a great time and now I wait patiently for next year, looking forward to another amazing beach vacation.
1304	19273	7	3	I remember it all clear as glass ice. It was two summers ago when my mom, two brothers, and I went to @PERSON1 point. The car ride was about an hour and a half, maybe two hours, with the car cruising along the highways. I was really excited about going on the new ride at @CAPS1 point - the @CAPS5. With nothing to do but listen to the catchy music on the radio and stare out the window at the passing scenery, this car ride seemed to be turning into an eternity. Of course, once we got there we still had to go on lots of other rides. We usually start at the front and work back, doing things in an orderly manner. This I didn't mind since we went on mostly big roller coasters with a few exceptions for rides like @PERSON2 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 @CAPS4, and @ORGANIZATION1. My mind was kept plenty distracted from the maverick with how much fun I was having at the time. Unfortunately, it became harder to keep my patience once we got to the @CAPS5 since the line was nearly an hour and a half long, snaking around the ride area. I guess that the long line was to be expected considering that it was a new ride. After waiting for so long we finally got to ride it. The @CAPS5 was amazingly epic, with its high - speed twists and turns. Finally, all of my patience had paid off, and I had a great day full of thrilling experiences.
1305	19274	7	3	Iím going to write about a time when my sister was being patient to go to the dentist. One day my mama said she was going to take my little sister to the dentist. My sister was so happy and was eagerly looking forward to it. Also my mama had to go to other places too. First, we went to Costland mall to get me a beautiful homecoming dress. We spent some time browsing through the various stores and finally found the perfect one. After that, we had to go to Shoe Depot to get me some nice shoes to match the dress. Third, I went to go get my hair done at a nearby salon. Last, we were on our way home but I told my mama my little sister had to go to the dentist. When we got to the dentist, we had to wait @NUM1 min. I told my little sister @CAPS1.M.G, this whole day you have been so patient. I couldn't do that. It really showed me the power of patience in waiting for something you want.
1306	19275	7	3	Why wasn't my uncle there yet? Come on! I was saying there had trapped beads up my back, feeling the tension building. The only thing I had to call for help with was my cell phone. Where was uncle @PERSON1 @CAPS1? All of a sudden, I'll look back to see what was wrong. I was at uncle's house waiting for him to hurry up so we could go hunting. I couldn't wait. Opening the creaky door very quietly and stepping out with my @NUM1 - gauge shotgun, I then ran out into the woods and into my tree stand. We had had this stand for as long as I could remember. That I now see was a bad thing. The ladder was rickety and we felt like it would break. The top bowed and broke quite a few times in different spots. We kept telling ourselves that we would rebuild it but we never got to it. So after climbing up the ladder I let the gun to my side and waited. Hunting required a lot of patience but I didn't need any. There standing on the horizon of trees, was the biggest buck I had ever seen. I almost gasped as it was so beautiful. Loading a slug into the barrel I took aim... Boom! I shot. I missed, unlucky! The slug tilted to the side. I reached for the gun so I could put it on a stable surface. The gun landed bent. I turned even to see the slug coming down. I turned so I was facing the ground and tried to get up but I had sprained my leg. Then with a great crash!!! The slug fell into my tree stand. I was trapped beneath my back. I tried to move but my back hurt too bad and my knees were starting to bleed. I was lucky I didn't break my neck. So my problem ended. I wasn't patient at first. But I learned my lesson and waited patiently until my uncle was within yelling distance. I got in trouble, and learned the hard way to be patient.
1307	19276	7	3	"So one day in fifth grade I was running around playing tag on the playground when, ""push!"" I got pushed off the slide about a few feet. I fell and hurt my arm so it went numb. I was in pain so I went to the doctor's and waited for two hours. I just sat patiently by not moving my arm at all, watching other people walk in and out. Finally, they called my name. They told me my arm was broken but they could not put a cast on there. So we went to the other doctor across the road, waited @NUM1 minutes and got a blue cast. About a month later I got it taken off. I went back to the x - ray room but then they said I have to cast it up again. This time I got a green cast and eventually I got it taken off. That's the time I was patient."
1308	19277	7	3	The time I was patient was when I went to the @CAPS1.B.I @CAPS2. My dad went there and he did a bunch of intense training. He was there for like @NUM1 months. At the end, if they made it through they got an award. So there was kind of a large number of people. We had to dress really nicely in our best clothes. We had to sit through all the people getting awards that we didn't even know. The worst part was they gave long, drawn - out speeches. Then after what seemed like endless hours my dad got up! I was so happy he got his award! Then we got to leave. That was the time I had to be patient.
1309	19278	7	3	"Go! @CAPS5 coach yelled. @CAPS5 soccer team and I were running sprints to get warmed up for our game today. @CAPS5 day was well - planned, first soccer then @CAPS5 friend's birthday party. I could hardly wait. That's when I felt a rain drop pound down on my head. Before I knew it I felt another, and another, and another! Suddenly it had started pouring heavily. @CAPS5 team and I rushed under a nearby awning. ""Boom!"" The thunder nearly shook the ground. Finally the refs come over and announced, ""the game has been delayed."" I sighed and slouched down on a picnic table. I knew now I would have to be patient if I wanted to get through today. There we sat under the awning as rain slammed down on the roof and thunder cracked. ""How would I make it to @CAPS5 party now?"" I thought. ""Boom! Boom! Boom!"" More thunder came. It had to go @NUM1 minutes without thunder for the game to resume. Before I knew it we were already on minute @NUM2. Even the slightest bit of thunder and we would need to start back at @NUM3. We were now at minute @NUM4. We listened closely until we heard a ""Boom!"" from far north. Frustrated I said ""@CAPS3 @CAPS4 mon!"" @CAPS5 team began to count the minutes again. Finally after the longest @NUM1 minutes of my life there was no sign of thunder or rain. The game was back on! @CAPS5 team and I sprinted on to the field. We played our hardest that game but, sadly we lost @NUM6. We walked off the field with our white socks and jerseys splattered with mud. Every one of us were sopping wet. @CAPS5 mom gave me the ""cheer up"" look and I quickly ran to the car. ""I will still make it to @CAPS5 party but, I will be just a few minutes late and I have to change in the car."" I said to myself. As I sprinted through the wet grass I heard @CAPS5 coach yell from behind me, ""Have fun at your party @PERSON1, and thanks for being so patient!"" I smiled and replied ""Thanks coach!"" That day I realized being patient is a good quality to have. Many people appreciate it when you are understanding and don't complain during difficult times."
1310	19280	7	3	On the way back home from a doctor's appointment, I was getting annoyed about being stuck in the car. I did not want mom to get annoyed more. So I tried really hard to be patient. Once in a while I would play with the seatbelt. @NUM1 minutes have passed and I was getting more impatient. But I still kept calm. Once I got home I went to bed and relaxed. I learned that sometimes patience in small situations can prevent bigger problems.
1311	19281	7	3	A time I had to be patient was when my dad was waiting to get the money for our chihuahua. It was [DATE1] and my dad sold his guitar to his uncle to get money for the day. Of course, his uncle didn't have it right away. A day went by and still nothing. When my mom came and picked me up, I went to swim practice, trying hard to be patient and wait for my dad to get the money. At around [NUM1] o'clock my dad called saying he won't get the money till [DATE2] [TIME1]! I was really mad, but still tried my best to be patient. A few days went by and soon it was [DATE1] again. I was so excited. We finally got the chihuahua. I had been patiently waiting for a week and was really tired of it. But when I saw the cute chihuahua, I realized my patience was worth it. That was the time I had to be patient for something good, and it had truly paid off.
1312	19282	7	3	Being patient is what you need to get anything done in the world. One example is school. How do you use patience in school? A way is being understanding to your teacher because they're there to help you and teach you important skills for life. If you don't be patient and understand your teacher, you will make little progress in life. Another example is with your parents. You need to be tolerant with them as they were tolerant with you when you were growing up. If you don't have patience with your parents and don't listen to them, then you won't learn all the valuable life lessons they can give you. Without these skills, you will find it difficult to succeed in life. In conclusion, patience is a key virtue that helps us in various aspects of life.
1313	19283	7	3	Once I knew a girl whose name was [ORGANIZATION1] and she met another girl named [PERSON1]. They had been inseparable until high school. [ORGANIZATION1] had gotten many more friends and started becoming very popular in school. [PERSON1] called [ORGANIZATION1] every day to see how she was and if she wanted to hang out. [ORGANIZATION1] kept lying to [PERSON1], saying she was busy and always making up excuses to blow her off. But one day [ORGANIZATION1] had a very bad day at school. When she tried to tell her new friends about it and apologized for how she was acting, she found they weren't really interested. Then [ORGANIZATION1] realized that [PERSON1] really was a true friend and had been patient with [ORGANIZATION1] through the bad times. This shows that if you are truly patient, only good things can come. Patience can help us maintain true friendships and bring us happiness in the long run.
1314	19285	7	3	"One time I got in trouble for getting a [CAPS1] on my report card and my mom said I was grounded. I asked her how long I would be grounded. Then I went upstairs to read a book. An hour later I came down and asked again, ""How long am I grounded?"" She said, ""I don't know how many times I have to tell you. Stop asking me so often."" So I was bugging her all day. She said, ""I am running out of patience."" I said, ""Can you just tell me?"" She said, ""Okay."" She pulled out a sheet of paper. I said, ""What is that?"" She said, ""I counted how many times you asked me. Twelve times! 'Yikes'!"" My mom said, ""Twelve days and that is final."" I said, ""Okay."" I think I learned a lesson today: Don't bug your mom all day and do better in school so that I won't get in trouble like this again."
1315	19286	7	3	One sunny, beautiful day I went out and was driving my [glad - assume it's a vehicle] around. All of a sudden my mom yelled at me and said she was going to go get my new [good - assume it's an item] in [CAPS1] [CAPS2], and she said I couldn't go. So I sat down waiting, waiting, waiting and waiting. Then I decided to play PlayStation [NUM1] ([CAPS3] [CAPS4]). I was playing for two hours straight, and then I decided to go watch [CAPS6] Assassin ([CAPS7]). After that was over, I went back to play PlayStation [NUM1] (p.s. [NUM1]) again. I played it for another hour. Then all of a sudden I hear beep, beep. I look out the window, and it was my mom in [CAPS1]. Then we talked about the new [glad - assume it's related to the item]. Then I hear beep, beep and it was my new [CAPS8]! Then I ran out, took it out and rode it for like [NUM3] hours straight. That is how I had patience for about [NUM4] to [NUM5] hours long. I was really proud of myself after I was done riding my new [CAPS8], as my patience had allowed me to enjoy my new thing.
1316	19287	7	3	Patient I was patient when I was in @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 appointment and had to wait in the waiting room. The waiting room was filled with other people, some reading magazines, others just sitting quietly. My teacher said, “Wait a minute,” because the teachers were talking to someone else. I sat there patiently, looking around at the decor of the room. When I had any @CAPS3 - related matter, the teacher said, “Don't open it,” so I always remained patient. When someone tells me to wait, I also show patience. For example, I'm patient when I'm waiting for the buses, airplanes, or trains to come. Sometimes, when I'm bored while waiting, I still manage to be patient. That's how I've been patient, and I've learned that patience can make waiting more bearable.
1317	19289	7	3	I am going to tell you all about a time when I had to use patience. I had to be patient when I was waiting for my friend to fix my x - box @NUM1. My friend was really taking forever when he tried to fix the x - box. All I could do was sit in a comfortable chair and watch him carefully as he tinkered with the device. He finally got the x - box fixed after about seven or eight hours of hard work. Once my friend and I began to play the game, unfortunately, it broke again. So then we had to take the game to @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and have them look at it. I had to have patience because if I didn't, I would have been really bored sitting there watching them examine it. Once @CAPS1 @CAPS4 looked at the system, they told us that they would have to take it away and then look at it more thoroughly. It took @CAPS1 @CAPS4 almost four days to fix the system and return it to me. So I had to have patience so that the system could be delivered. Patience is a very needed thing in life. Now you know all about a time in my life when I had to have patience, and I've realized that it's essential to stay calm in such situations.
1318	19290	7	3	“@CAPS1 on,” said my little brother. The @CAPS2 line is taking forever. “@CAPS2 is the last time we are coming on this @CAPS2 ride,” I grumbled. The ride that we were on was space mountain at @ORGANIZATION1 land in @LOCATION1. As we got into line at the ride, there was a sign that said there was a @NUM1 - minute wait from that @CAPS2 point. It was extremely hot, and it felt like I was walking through a sauna. The line would not go any faster, no matter how much we wished it would. My older brother was happy for some reason, and no one could understand why we were standing in line in such @NUM2 weather. I was being as patient as I could be. I just stood in line, wishing that we could get on the ride sooner. The first hour went by, and another sign came up saying there was a @NUM3 - hour wait from that @CAPS2 point. We all got really mad. The walkway sounded completely silent. I know that everyone could hear a pin drop as if a pin or someone's shoe hit the ground. Everyone was being patient, though it was hard. Finally, we waited @NUM4 hours to go on just @NUM3 rides. That was the first time I was that patient, and I learned that patience can turn a frustrating situation into a memorable one.
1319	19291	7	3	One time when I was patient was when I was in the car going up north to @LOCATION1. I was in the car for eight long hours. My cousin @PERSON1 was driving, and my @CAPS1 @CAPS2 was sitting in the seat next to her. I was in the backseat with their dog @CAPS3. The dog was a bit restless at times. My cousin @PERSON1 and my @CAPS1 @CAPS2 were talking the whole way there. I tried asking to stop and go to the bathroom and get some food, but they said, “Not yet.” So I waited and waited. An hour went by, and I tried asking again. I got the same answer, “Not yet.” That's when I really had to call on my patience. I sat there quietly, looking out of the window, watching the scenery pass by. Eventually, we did stop, and I realized that being patient had made the long journey a bit more bearable.
1320	19292	7	3	One sunny afternoon, I was so excited because I was going to see my favorite band. When I was in school, my mom picked me up from third grade. I was so excited that it was finally time to go. My dad dropped my brother off at my grandma's house (he was only a toddler, so he could not go). I was bouncing off my seat and asked, “Mom, are we there yet?” Mom replied, “@CAPS1, we have two more hours to go, and then another hour, so we are going to see the place here.” “@CAPS2, can I have my DVD, please?” I asked. So now it had been two hours that I'd been in the car. Then we went everywhere my mom and dad wanted to go, not where I wanted to. I sat there patiently, though I was a bit disappointed. Then it was time to go see the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5! When we arrived, I was a little sleepy, but that would not stop me. When they only played two songs, I felt like sleeping on the seat. I waited all day to see them, and I went to see them. That was a time I was patient to see my favorite band, and even though the experience wasn't perfect, I'm glad I was patient and got to see them perform.
1321	19293	7	3	I remember the time when I had to be incredibly patient, and it truly wasn't even a bit funny. I had to be patient to get my new cell phone. My mom told me I was going to get one when the school year started. I waited and waited with great anticipation until the school year finally started. But then my mom told me I would have to wait another week because she didn't have the money after all the school supply shopping she had done. So I waited another week, trying my best to stay calm. I was so excited when I remembered that my parents planned a trip to @LOCATION1 that weekend, so unfortunately, I had to wait yet another week. It was on the following @DATE1 when I was at my cousin’s house, sitting quietly in the living room. My mom came in and surprised me with my new phone. I was so happy that I finally got it. So I guess you can get cool things when you are patient, and that patience really pays off in the end.
1322	19294	7	3	One Christmas about a year or two ago, we drove up to my grandparents' house. They live in Cold Water, so it took about @NUM1 hours of driving through the winter scenery. All my relatives on my dad's side were there, chatting and laughing in the warm living room. All the presents were neatly placed under the tree, and I couldn't wait to open them. The parents were just talking about nonsense, like how the weather was this year and the latest family gossip. So I opened my big mouth and said “can we open presents now?” We started to open the presents, but the adults had to go first. They are the slowest gift openers ever. I was about to rip the presents out of their hands and open them myself. But I didn't do that though because I was being patient, biting my lip and trying to stay calm. After they finished, I said “yes!” Of course, then my little cousins had to open next. Let me tell you, they aren't fast at all either, fumbling with the wrapping paper. After that, I finally got to open my presents. In the end, it was worth it. I got an Xbox @NUM2, and over @MONEY1. That was the time I was patient, and it taught me that waiting can lead to great rewards.
1323	19295	7	3	Patience is a very hard thing to do in life. It’s one of those things that is so impossible for people to do sometimes, even for little kids. You can tell when someone is being patient when they are being polite and waiting their turn without complaining about it. They might sit quietly, with a calm expression on their face, not showing any signs of impatience. Sometimes people don't like being patient. I know I don't like it a lot @CAPS1. People who are not patient tend to @MONTH1 be not tuned into others' waiting. They might tap their feet, sigh loudly, or constantly check the time. But people who are patient, they sometimes tend to be annoying or quiet, not talking very much. Even when they do talk, they stop talking when people interrupt them. And they definitely don't yell at someone out at all. It's a good thing to have patience because you will grow up with a good family, good friends, and a fulfilling life. So in conclusion, that's why it's good to be patient, as it enriches our relationships and experiences.
1324	19296	7	3	A time when I was patient was when I went to the book store and I wanted a book. I was at the book store, looking around the shelves with eager eyes. I wanted a book called Taylor Swift Back at the @LOCATION1 as a School Girl. My mom said if you are patient then yes. I was so happy because she knew I love Taylor Swift books and her life. As soon as I got it, I sat down on a nearby bench and started reading it, getting lost in the story. My mom said thank you for being patient. I said you're welcome and I said thank you for buying it. I have told my mom that if we could go to the book store, and she said not today. I kept on asking, and she said no. I kept on asking, and she said maybe. So I sat in the car, listening to the radio quietly, trying to be patient. Then we went to the mall, and there was a book store in the mall. I asked if I could look around, and my mom said yes. She said find the book that you wanted. I searched through the shelves carefully and found it. She bought it for me. This is a time I was patient. One thing I learn is to be patient if you want something and don't keep asking, as patience can lead to getting what you desire.
1325	19297	7	3	A time when I was patient. I am patient when I go hunting. I know that at any moment, the buck of a lifetime could walk out in shooting range. And if one does, I will be ready, sitting still in my tree stand, my eyes scanning the forest. The first time I shot a deer was with my bow. I remember sitting there, being as patient as I could, waiting for a deer to step within range. I was cold, my fingers starting to numb, but I didn't move. Then I heard the leaves crunching. There it is, the deer! I thought about how to draw it back. Then I shot. I could feel the arrow gliding through my bow, a smooth and powerful motion. Then the arrow hits the deer with a thud, and the deer takes off into the bushes. I waited there in my tree stand, my heart pounding, ready to go claim my deer. Me and my dad tracked it about a soft distance through the woods, following the faint blood trail. And there it was, lying on the ground. I was so excited that I all yelled out. It was nice to know that all my patience and hard work had paid off. Thank you for reading my story. I hope you enjoyed it, and it shows how patience can lead to great achievements in hunting.
1326	19298	7	3	Patience, it truly takes a great deal to have it. One time, my sister was deliberately trying to get on my nerves. She was acting in a way that clearly showed she was trying to hate me, but I didn't let her behavior affect me. I firmly believed that I have patience. There I was, calmly watching TV, and she came and stood right in front of the TV. I politely asked her, “Can you move off in front of the TV?” To my relief, she moved and then sat beside me. However, she kept on touching me, but it didn't bother me at all. She asked me over and over, “I'm annoying you, aren't I?” I simply replied, “No.” I was determined not to let myself get angry. I said to myself that I was going to stay calm until I really lost my temper. I finally told her, “So you don't bother me. Get out of my face.” But she still tried her best to provoke me. She even attempted to rip up my homework. I just said, “I don't care.” She gave a smart comment, “Whatever,” and I just kept watching TV. I was so patient with her. She then said, “I'm going to make you mad.” I ignored her, and she got really mad. She kept shouting, “Do you hear me?” I just walked outside and said to myself, “I can't let her get to me. Otherwise, we might end up fighting.” I went back into the house and sat down. I told her firmly, “You can't make me mad, so you might want to stop.” She replied, “Girl, whatever.” I was so ready to say something back, but I knew I shouldn't give her anything to feed off. In the end, my patience prevailed, and I managed to keep our relationship from turning into a fight.
1327	19300	7	3	I am writing about when someone was patient. My mom was patient when she didn't receive her money that day. She was eagerly waiting for it to come, but it didn't arrive as expected. So, she was a bit mad for a moment. However, the next day, the money finally came. And I said to her, “I told you, mommy, it was coming today.” She did get the money. I was also waiting with her, but I had no idea when it would arrive. She showed great patience by not calling the people and asking them where her money was. The next day, when there was no one at home, I was also waiting patiently. Then we went to the @MONTH1. There, we got the money and everything was sorted out. After that, we went to the mall. I was extremely happy, and so were my brothers and sisters. This experience taught me the importance of patience, just like my mom showed.
1328	19301	7	3	I remember when I went to @LOCATION1 to visit my step - grandmother during @CAPS1 and decided to go fishing. Initially, I really didn't want to do it because I am a very impatient person. The creek where we were going to fish was conveniently right behind her house. I enthusiastically grabbed a fishing rod and headed into the “backyard”. I skillfully flung my fishing line into the water and then sat down to wait. After maybe @NUM1 minutes, there was nothing happening (except that my sister caught most of the things). Finally, the action started to unfold. I was so excited that I jumped out of my seat, accidentally knocking it over. I quickly grabbed the reel. I twisted and twisted the handle for what seemed like an eternity, and finally, I brought the fish up. The fish I caught was quite small compared to what my sister caught just seconds later. My step - grandmother then threw the small fish back into the creek. After another @NUM1 minutes, I became extremely frustrated and decided to go for a swim. After an hour of swimming, I went back to my rod and made up my mind to be more patient. I waited patiently until my line started moving. I calmly got up and twisted the reel faster than before. To my delight, I'd caught the biggest fish of the day. I sat back down and waited for an entire hour for my line to move again. And then, I caught another fish. I was so happy that I dropped my rod and rushed to tell my step - grandmother. This experience taught me that my patience led me to catch the biggest fish of the day and also helped me learn something new about myself.
1329	19302	7	3	Patience is when you can wait for a while without complaining or giving up about waiting. That is what it means to be patient. An example of being patient is this: Let's say you are standing in line for @NUM1 hours to get tickets to see your favorite band play. Standing in that long line for @NUM1 hours, without complaining at all, is a clear sign of being patient to get those tickets. Being patient is not only very respectful to yourself but also to the people around you. I firmly believe that everyone could use a little more patience. People should think about patience more often. If everyone in the world didn't have patience, the world would truly be a crazy mess. For example, no one would be willing to wait. Everyone would just want to be first. It would be complete chaos. So, I'm really happy that there is patience in this world and that many people possess it. It makes our daily lives more bearable and harmonious.
1330	19303	7	3	I was patient when I had a doctor's appointment. Me and my mom had been waiting for almost an hour for them to call my name. We were sitting there patiently, looking around the waiting room. Twenty minutes later, the nurse finally called me. She politely said, “Sorry for your wait. Thank you for being patient.” After that, my mom took me to get something to eat. We went through the drive - through. We were waiting for @NUM1 minutes. Then, the staff gave us our food and said, “Sorry. Thanks for being patient.” Throughout these two experiences of waiting, I realized that patience is an important virtue. It helps us deal with delays in a calm and respectful way. Even though waiting can be a bit frustrating, being patient makes the whole process much more pleasant.
1331	19304	7	3	This is a story about what patience means to me. Patience is when you encounter a problem and you refrain from complaining about it. For instance, I had to give my mom @NUM1, but I didn't have the @NUM1 right then and there. My mom didn't complain; she simply waited. She showed patience. Patience does not mean constantly begging. It implies that you are understanding and tolerant. If your dad said he is going to give you some pizza, have patience and wait for that pizza. When you have patience, people will also have patience with you. For example, if you were watching TV and you didn't want to get up yet, people will have patience and wait for you to get up. Patience does not mean you keep asking. For example, I was at @CAPS1 @CAPS2, begging my mom for candy. Had I had patience and waited for her answer, I would have gotten the candy, but I didn't. This is my story and what patience means to me.
1332	19305	7	3	A person I know who is patient was my old teacher named @PERSON1. He was a very patient man, even though we often got on his nerves. When we didn't understand a question that he had explained countless times, he remained patient. Even when we showed attitudes towards @PERSON1, he was still a patient man. I think @PERSON1 was determined to be patient with us, and he must have prayed because he was always patient with us through all difficulties. @PERSON1 was the most patient teacher and person I've ever met. His patience taught me a valuable lesson about understanding and tolerance.
1333	19306	7	3	Patience, what's the first word that comes to your mind when you hear that word? Waiting? I know that's the main word in my mind. Here is a story of when I was very patient. Every kid dreads MAP testing. It was @DATE1, and we had to be completely silent. It's hard enough to be quiet, but it's even harder when you're sitting next to your friends, especially if you're a girl. We had to do MAP writing, which is the most difficult for me. But when I was done, I felt really good about being quiet for everyone else. That's the story of when I had to be patient, and it showed me that with patience, I can overcome difficult situations.
1334	19307	7	3	"Patience can be a very hard thing for me to have at times. For example, when I go to restaurants and we wait for our food, I get bored very easily. One time, I had a sore ankle from an injury in soccer. A couple of months later, it still hurt in the same spot. So, my mom set up an appointment with my doctor. When I went to the doctor, she felt for a lump or fracture in my ankle and said, ""I don't think there is anything wrong, but we won't be sure."" Then, she sent my mom and me to the urgent care on @NUM1 with a note that said I needed an x - ray. After about a twenty - five - minute car ride, we were there. When the kind lady checked us in, we waited in the x - ray waiting room. My mom texted my sister saying we would be a while. I had to have patience because we were waiting there for a whole hour! Clearly, this was a time I had to have patience because I was already nervous about a possible broken ankle. Through this experience, I learned that patience is necessary in difficult and uncertain situations."
1335	19308	7	3	Being patient is a wonderful thing to be. Here is an example of me being patient for my birthday. My birthday was coming, and I was extremely happy. I would always count back the days, so I had a personal calendar for counting down to it. After that, I made lots of birthday lists. I went to stores to see what they had. For an example, I saw this beautiful skirt that had a matching belt. @NUM1 days before my birthday, I was so excited that I even lost my appetite. I also went to @LOCATION1 and checked out all the wonderful cakes. The day finally came, and we went shopping for all the stuff I wanted. In conclusion, I showed patience in waiting for my birthday, and it made the day even more special.
1336	19310	7	3	A time I was patient was when I had to tackle a difficult task all by myself, without any help. Not a single bit of assistance came my way. It was incredibly hard. I was given just one hour to finish it, but realistically, I needed three hours. It was so tough that not even a college student could have finished it. @ORGANIZATION1 was the hardest math test I've ever taken. Despite the odds, I remained patient and did my best. In the end, although I might not have completed it perfectly, I was proud of myself for staying calm and trying my hardest.
1337	19311	7	3	“@CAPS1, how much longer?” I complained at the bustling airport, “@CAPS2 have been waiting for about two hours now.” “@CAPS3 will only be a couple more minutes, sweety,” replied my @CAPS1 in a firm yet gentle voice. “@CAPS3 better take only a few minutes because I really want to go to @CAPS5 world,” I complained again. As you might know now, @CAPS2 are in an airport filled with people coming and going. @CAPS2 had to wait for six long hours before our flight took off for @LOCATION1. It took a great deal of patience that I thought I never had. In the first hour of waiting, I was extremely bored. I had nothing to play with besides my gameboy @CAPS6. The gameboy @CAPS6 is a boxy - looking object that folds open neatly. There is a small screen on the top and controls on the bottom half. That was my only source of fun to keep me busy and prevent me from falling asleep. I was so bored. But thankfully, I found a @CAPS8.V. that they had at the airport. @CAPS2 went over to the @LOCATION2 to watch, but the only channel @CAPS2 could watch was the news. I did not like watching the news at all, so I went back to playing my gameboy. I played that for about an hour. I hadn't said anything to my @CAPS1 in the past two or three hours. I didn't want to bug her, so I left her alone. When the next hour passed, @CAPS2 finally boarded our plane. @CAPS2 waited a total of @NUM1 hours and @NUM2 minutes. It was a painful but memorable experience. When @CAPS2 boarded the plane and found our seats, my @CAPS1 said to my brother and me that she was very proud of our patience. To this day, I realize why my @CAPS1 and dad don't like to fly to places anymore. It's the long waits that can be so tiring, but this experience also taught me the value of patience.
1338	19312	7	3	@CAPS11 was @DATE1. It was almost time for @CAPS1's birthday. @PERSON1 was going to be six years old. He was eagerly helping his @CAPS6 make his birthday cake. After they were done making the delicious cake mix, @CAPS1's @CAPS6 carefully put it into a cake pan. She then put the pan into the oven for @NUM1 hours. “I can't wait for my super yummy chocolate birthday cake to be done!” said @PERSON1 excitedly. A few minutes later, @PERSON1 asked if his cake was ready. “@CAPS3, @PERSON1,” said @PERSON1's @CAPS6, “@CAPS4've still got about @NUM2 hours and @NUM3 minutes until your cake is done.” “@CAPS5, that'll take forever,” whined @PERSON1. “You've got to use your patience, @PERSON1,” she said. “@CAPS6, what's patience?” @PERSON1 asked. “Patience is waiting for something without complaining, @CAPS11,” explained @PERSON1's @CAPS6. “@CAPS7, you can do something so the time passes by faster. Like play a game, ride your bike, play with your friends, or play in the sandbox,” she suggested. “@CAPS8,” said @PERSON1, “I'll go do something else.” So @PERSON1 went downstairs to play his video games. When he was done playing his video games, he checked the oven to see how much time had gone by. There was two hours and thirty minutes left. Then @PERSON1 decided to go out and ride his bike. He quickly put on his helmet and got on his two - wheeler bicycle. He went for an exciting ride on the neighborhood trails. He saw his friends and joined them on their bike ride. After their bike ride, @PERSON1 asked them if they wanted to go play in the sandbox. They all said yes. So they went to the backyard and played in the sandbox. @PERSON1 and his friends all worked together to make this huge sand kingdom. It had big, imposing castles and it had a deep trench all around it. It took up the entire sandbox. @PERSON1 went inside to ask how much time was left on the oven. “@CAPS6, how much time is on the oven?” asked @PERSON1. “Only five more minutes,” said his @CAPS6, “you should take that time to brush off all that sand. I see you and your friends are covered in it. And when you're done, you can invite them in for a piece of cake.” When @PERSON1 and his friends were done getting the sand off of them, they all went inside and had a piece of the delicious cake. After everyone finished their cake, they all said, “It's the best cake ever!” This experience taught @PERSON1 the importance of patience.
1339	19313	7	3	“@CAPS1 on, @CAPS2!” I yelled with excitement. We had just gotten our tickets for my favorite amusement park in the world; @CAPS3 @CAPS4. “@CAPS5 down, @PERSON1,” my @CAPS2 told me in a calm voice. “I'm coming,” she said. I'm not usually super hyper, but I just adore roller coasters. It's also nice to just take a @DATE1 off and head up to @CAPS3 @CAPS4. I live in @LOCATION1, so the drive isn't that short. My @CAPS2 had just finished giving the man our tickets. “@CAPS6 your day at @CAPS3 @CAPS4,” he told us cheerfully. “@CAPS9, @PERSON1, what do you want to ride first?” my @CAPS2 asked me. “@CAPS10 about the @CAPS11?” I asked my @CAPS2. “@CAPS12 not?” she replied. By the way, if you didn't know, my name is @PERSON1. But that's not important right now. What's important is getting on the @CAPS11. My @CAPS2 and I waited in the long line for about an hour. It seemed to take forever, but before I knew it, we were buckling up in our seats. Now I know the @CAPS11 isn't the biggest ride, but it's still pretty large. As we were getting ready, I was a little nervous. Everyone gets nervous before their first ride, and as we were slowly going uphill, everything started to get smaller, and I started to get more nervous. However, the @CAPS11 ended up being an absolute blast! After the @CAPS11 we rode the mantis, the @ORGANIZATION1, the wicked @CAPS16, @ORGANIZATION2, the @CAPS17, The mean @CAPS18, the @CAPS19 @CAPS20 @CAPS21 and the @CAPS22. “@CAPS23 right, @PERSON1, pick the last ride,” my @CAPS2 said. Well, that was easy. We still hadn't gone on my favorite ride yet. “@CAPS25's go on the @CAPS26 force,” I said. We got in line. The sign said the wait was two and a half hours. But, I've been on the ride before, and I know it's definitely worth it. The wait ended up being a bit longer, four hours to be exact, and I wanted to leave after three. But I waited. In the end, it was totally worth it. The waiting was terrible, but the thrill of the ride made it all worthwhile. I really enjoyed my day at @CAPS3 @CAPS4, and I'm glad I waited for the best ride. It was a day full of fun and memories.
1340	19314	7	3	It was about the middle of @DATE1 when my family and I were going to @LOCATION1. I was so excited that I had been counting the days and had packed all of my things, including my toys and accessories, with great enthusiasm. I was really pumped as my mom and my brother were packing in the morning. By the time we were all set, my dad and I were raring to go. We packed everything into our old, reliable car @NUM1 and then headed off. An hour into the journey, I asked my dad, “When are we going to be there?” “Not until...” my dad said. After that, I fell asleep. My brother, being a bit mischievous, bothered me in his own silly way while I was sleeping. We stopped at a gas station because my mom had to go inside. At that time, I started to get even more excited. It was about @NUM2. @NUM3 and I had to wait to get to a hotel. I was still excited because we were in mid - @LOCATION1 and I knew we would soon get to our destination and have an awesome time together. Although the wait was long and a bit frustrating at times, I tried to be patient. In the end, when we finally reached our destination, it was all worth it. That was my story about the time I had to be patient, and it taught me that good things come to those who wait.
1341	19315	7	3	I am going to write a story about patience. Patience is when you calmly wait for somebody to do something. One clear example of this might be if someone else is painstakingly fixing something for you, and you are really eager for them to be finished so you can smoothly move on with your life. However, it is the type of thing that demands time, perhaps a great deal of time. But if you want it done correctly, you will have to exercise patience and wait. Sometimes, it will not be a person you wait for, but an inanimate object, like a television show that follows its own pace and cannot be rushed, even though sometimes you are tempted to rush it. With a human, however, if you rush them to do something, which can happen, it may end up being not as good and even break in about ten seconds after they complete it. Although it might end up happening faster, the quality suffers. You might also wait for nature too, such as a sunny day when it has been raining continuously for over a week. You also might be waiting for the power to come back on during a storm. For me, I have really longed for the power to come back on during a storm because there is absolutely nothing to do! Patience is also about waiting for your turn, like when you are bored. In essence, patience is a valuable virtue that helps us navigate through various situations in life.
1342	19316	7	3	One time when I was patient was when I accidentally broke my thumb. I remained patient because I wasn't complaining about the pain, nor was I crying about it. In fact, I really wasn't doing anything because I didn't think it was even broken. It didn't really bother me at the time. Then I waited to go to the doctor and got it checked. The doctor initially didn't think it was broken because I almost beat him in a thumb wrestle. But he decided to x - ray it just in case. When he came back with the x - rays, he said it was broken. He was very surprised, I was surprised, and everyone around me was surprised too. This experience taught me that sometimes we may not realize the severity of a situation right away, and patience in such times can lead to proper diagnosis and treatment.
1343	19317	7	3	This past @DATE1, my family and I went to @CAPS1. When we were in Flagstaff, we were going to a large ski slope. It was basically a big ski slope that attracted many visitors. When we went to the top on a ski lift, I was scared that I was going to fall. When we got to the top, I could clearly see Flagstaff and sort of the surrounding mountains. The height made me dizzy, and since I don't like heights, I started to feel nauseous and almost threw up. I was extremely happy to get in line to go down. When I got down, I felt better for a moment, but then I felt like I was going to throw up again. Despite the unpleasant experience, I love my mom and the time spent with family. That day was the worst day of my life. However, I was happy the next day when we went to the @ORGANIZATION1. This trip showed that not all outings go as planned, but we can still look forward to better days.
1344	19318	7	3	"Sometimes it's hard to be patient, especially when you have to be tolerant of little kids. Well, I have to do that sometimes when I go to visit my little cousin, @ORGANIZATION1. @ORGANIZATION1 is eight years old, and she really gets on my nerves. She asks really dumb questions and does stupid things, and I don't like her at all. My mom says, ""When you grow up, you two will be best friends."" Yeah, right, I don't think so. Whenever I visit her, I just have to tolerate her behavior and be patient. For now, I have to deal with her quirks, but when we grow up, we might become friends, but maybe not. Only time will tell if our relationship will change for the better."
1345	19319	7	3	"Once when I was patient was when we went to Green Bay. It took @NUM1 an incredibly long time to get into our @CAPS1. When it was finally the time we got in the @CAPS1, it was @NUM2 their time, which is @NUM3 our time, and I was a little upset about the delay. The next day, we went to Toys ""R"" Us. My sister was mad, and my mother wanted to get a van. We first tried a white van. Me, my brother, and dad really liked the white one, but my mom and my stupid sister didn't like the white Dodge van. Then we tried the silver van, and my mom and my dumb, stupid sister loved it, but me, my bro, and dad hated it. Oh, and we ended up getting the dumb silver van. It took @NUM4 a long time to get the van, and the journey going home was just stupid. The whole experience was quite frustrating, but I had to be patient through it all. In the end, it was a lesson in patience during family decision - making."
1346	19320	7	3	Patience is the way to being a successful person. Patience is waiting a while for something, as in life, we often need to wait for the right opportunities. If you wait a long time without getting mad or losing your temper, you are what people call patient. If you keep up this habit, you will have a good life that is filled with fewer stress and more contentment.
1347	19321	7	3	The first time I learned patience was when I was a kid. My mom said she would buy me a play - station that I wanted it so bad. But I had to wait to get it. So I did, and I waited and waited and waited. Then I figured it had been a whole month and nothing happened. I was so mad but I didn't do anything. So we went to Walmart and she bought me a play - station. I was extremely happy. Later I asked for an Xbox (Series S). My mom said wait. I waited for three months but still nothing. Four months, nothing; five months, nothing. I was just so angry. But a whole year passed and I got an Xbox. It was awesome. I got my own room and a new gaming setup. I got an Xbox Series X. Growing older is awesome as it teaches you the value of patience.
1348	19322	7	3	"Oh I have a great story about patience! One day, I was at my Grandma's and Grandpa's house. There were my two brothers, my little sister, my Grandma and Grandpa, and myself present. My Grandpa was ready to serve up ice cream. All of a sudden, my brothers and sisters started yelling, ""I'm going first, I'm going first!"" ""Lathan?"", my Grandpa asked. I responded by saying, ""I'm not being a part of this!"" I thought, ""How long is this going to go on?"" Since this was all getting me a little freaked out, I said, ""Hey! Get in line!"" They were like ""ok"". So, patiently, everyone got in the line and took their turn choosing what kind of ice cream they wanted. And what a choice we had: vanilla, strawberry, mint, or cookie - dough ice cream. Everyone settled down and enjoyed their ice cream cone, and it was a peaceful and enjoyable time."
1349	19323	7	3	I was patient when I was going to the doctor's to get a check - up. I didn't complain about it. I had to wait for two hours in the waiting room. Then when I went in, they took a couple of measurements. It took about one hour. Then they took some tests. Finally, at the end of the long process, I went home. That was the time I was patient, and I realized that patience helps in getting through such situations smoothly.
1350	19324	7	3	One time I was going hunting. We got to the woods at 6 am or earlier. When we got there we found a nice spot to sit on the ground. We were going to stay in the woods till dark or until we kill our limit of deer. When it was about an hour and a half till dark we saw a doe. But when we moved the gun to shoot it, it ran. We stayed not moving or talking, just waiting. Then more deer came. But they were really small so we let them go. When there were like 15 minutes left till dark a good - size doe came. It was too far away though, so we waited for it to get closer. Then the boom, the rifle goes off. It dropped but it was still alive laying down. We waited like 10 or more minutes then it died. That was one of the times I was patient, and it taught me that patience in hunting can lead to a successful catch.
1351	19326	7	3	There are many ways to be patient, like when you're waiting in the lunch line to eat or when you line up to leave the room. Here's a time when I was patient. It was time for this trip to go skating, and I was talking to someone. I really wanted to go right away, but I didn't say it because I knew I had to be patient. Then we got there, and I was eager to get in and skate, but they had to tell us the rules first, so I kept quiet. After that, we walked in to skate, but there was a long line for skates. Instead of pushing or shoving my way through, I waited patiently. Then I skated, had something to eat, and finally left. This shows how we can be patient.
1352	19327	7	3	"Patience, can you be patient? Some people are, and some are not. Sometimes, I can't be either. Well, here's a story about patience. One time at school, the lunch line was incredibly long. It barely moved at all. I was so hungry and wanted lunch so badly that I wasn't being patient. But for some reason, my friend was being very patient. I asked her, ""Why are you so patient?"" She replied, ""Because everyone is going to be able to get something to eat."" I thought about it and said, ""Yeah, that is true."" So, I tried to be patient, and before I knew it, I was sitting by my friends, chatting, and enjoying my food. This experience taught me the value of patience."
1353	19328	7	3	I was so bored, but I knew it would pay off. I was on a flight to somewhere, and it took hours. During that time, I went to the bathroom, had my lunch, played with my mobile phone, took a nap, and then just waited. Finally, we reached our destination. Even though the flight was long and I was bored, the end result made it all worthwhile.
1354	19329	7	3	I was patient in gym class today for my skill test. I did great and got a perfect score of @NUM1 out of @NUM1. There are @NUM3 students in my class, so it was quite a long wait. Also, when it was my turn, it took about half a minute to complete the test. We spent a long time on the skill test, and I was looking forward to playing dodge - ball the whole time. In the end, we didn't get to play dodge - ball because we ran out of time. So, I pretty much wasted my entire gym period on the skill test. This experience shows how patience doesn't always lead to the outcome we want, but it's still important.
1355	19330	7	3	I had to be patient when I really wanted a @CAPS1 bike crank. I knew I had to make money for it, so I went to @CAPS2 houses. First, I started by picking leaves, and then I showed them that I could also shovel driveways. Over @CAPS3 time, I managed to save up enough money for my @CAPS1 bike. It was really hard to be patient during that period, but in the end, it paid off because I finally got what I wanted.
1356	19331	7	3	A day of dreadful patience. “Can we leave now, @CAPS1? I'm so bored,” I complained. I waited for an answer, but I guess he just resorted to ignoring me. We were here in @LOCATION1, standing around, waiting for these lazy people to load up his truck. They were so impatient guys, taking their sweet time. “That's it, I'm gonna go talk to these guys and see what the whole holdup is. Wait here and don't touch anything,” @CAPS1 said. So I sat here, shivering from the cold, extremely bored and hangry, waiting for what seemed like hours. Finally, my @CAPS1 got back and told me it might be another @NUM1. It was just ridiculous what impatient men resorted to. We were sitting here and getting pretty impatient. We decided to just go and walk for a while to pass the time. After we got some food to satisfy our hunger, we went back to the truck. City slickers are just plain dumb. A forklift driver somehow managed to get his forklift stuck in the trailer. That's when my @CAPS1 had it. He got out and then all I heard were hollers and screams. FINALLY! After my @CAPS1 yelled a bit, we finally got back on the road. That day I learned that one thing I definitely don't have is patience.
1357	19332	7	3	The time I had to be patient was when I was at my first football game. I was so excited to get in, but I had to wait in a long line. I waited an entire hour to get in. The team was tied in the @NUM2 to @NUM2 score, and it was the @DATE1, and we were still holding our own and winning. The coach had an injured player, so he decided to put me in. I ran so fast, my legs were like pistons. I tackled the guy with the ball, and he tumbled to the ground. Then I ran for the touchdown as fast as I could. If I wouldn't have been patient and waited for my chance, I wouldn't have won the game because the coach wouldn't have put me in. That was the time I was patient, and it paid off big time.
1358	19333	7	3	One time I was patient is when I went to get my hair cut and she told me to come at @TIME1. But when I got there at @TIME1, she had like @NUM1 people in front of me. There were people sitting all around the waiting area, chatting and looking through magazines. But I didn't care because I didn't have to do anything after. So I was just going to sit there and be patient. I had my best friend with me, so I wasn't bored at all. We were just sitting there, talking about our latest crushes and texting our boyfriends. So then the lady that was about to cut my hair came to me and said, “I am so sorry, but I told you the wrong time.” And I said, “Oh, it's ok, I can wait.” And when she got done with their hair, the ladies came to me and said they were sorry. So then she had @NUM2 person left, and by the time she got done, it was getting on like @NUM3 - @NUM4. And that was the time I was being patient, showing that I could handle the delay with grace.
1359	19334	7	3	To me, patience is one of the most important traits in a person. To be patient with someone is very important. It can make you friends, it can get you a girl or boyfriend and it can get you some of the best things in life. One time, patience got me a new hockey stick. About a month ago, I broke my old hockey stick in an away game. It snapped right in the middle during a crucial play. After the game, I knew I needed a new hockey stick, so I went to the pro shop at the ice arena I was playing at. “Do you have the @CAPS1 @PERSON1 vapor @NUM1?” I asked, wondering if it would be easy to get it. “Sorry, buddy, we just ran out,” @CAPS3, the sales man, said, giving me a little shrug. I knew that if I wanted the stick, I would have to look harder. When I got home, I looked on the internet to see if there were any stores nearby with it in stock. I checked multiple websites, but no luck. I guess I'll have to order it online, I thought to myself. The delivery didn't arrive quickly. It took about @NUM2 weeks for it to arrive. But when it finally did, it was worth all the time and effort because it was the perfect stick for me.
1360	19335	7	3	I have to be patient until @DATE1 vacation comes along. I try to do my best in school until @DATE1 arrives. For example, last year I was on the honor roll @NUM1 times. I worked really hard on my studies. Over the @DATE1, if I have to do back regards or a @DATE1 patient, then I will do it and I won't leave it until the last minute. I'll make a proper schedule to get it done. Then, I'll wait until school starts again, which will be a fresh new year. I'm looking forward to new classes and new friends. I'll also wait until @DATE1 again. But in between we have some breaks and days off. I think we already have enough assignments throughout the years, since we go to school @NUM2 days a week. School can be really fun sometimes. For example, I wait until field trips and school activities. But we have to be careful so the principal doesn't take our privileges away. For example, if our behavior is bad or we get too many detentions, she'll take it away from us. That means all of my patience will be for nothing. That really wouldn't be fair because most of the time my classmates are the ones causing the trouble. So I'll just keep being patient and hope for the best.
1361	19336	7	3	A time when I was patient well it didnít just happen once, it happens all the time. The time I am patient is when my mother is either talking or at the hair salon getting her hair done. Today I am going to talk about the time she goes shopping. When my mother goes shopping, she brings all the females in my family - my cousins, aunt, and grandmother. I either go in the mall with them, stay in the car, or stay at home. I will talk about when I go in the mall with them. They shop for at least eight hours, with a maximum of ten hours. They don't just go to one mall and stop; they go to at least two malls, three at the most. They also go to a lot of strip malls, for example, Simply Fashion and stores like Rainbow. They are going to a hundred places for at least eight hours. My feet start to hurt, and I'm getting hungry and tired, but I don't complain because I am being patient. Now we are in a mall. I go to carry bags and go into a lot of females' clothing stores like Victoria's Secret, H&M, and ZARA. Then they shop for jewelry, makeup, perfume, and every woman item known to the world. Plus, I get lost because they leave me. In conclusion, I am very patient for my mother no matter what.
1362	19337	7	3	I'm writing about a time when I was supposed to be patient. Because I was about to go to a party, I had to be patient, but I didn't. I got angry as I just couldn't be patient. I also know someone who can't be patient. They just couldn't wait; they really couldn't wait, but I waited, waited, and waited. Then I got mad and I just couldn't wait any longer. I was actually waiting on my aunt to come pick me up, and she didn't show up. I called my mom, and she said she was going to take me to the party. I was patient, but she didn't come either. I didn't go to the party, and I was mad. Because my mama didn't come pick me up, I called my grandma, and she came to pick me up. That was the only time I learned about being patient.
1363	19338	7	3	You have to be patient when you go on a trip. I was patient on my trip to Pennsylvania last summer. I had to be patient for six hours before me and my family arrived. The next day, I had to be more patient because we went to an amusement park. There, I had to wait in very long lines. It is really hard to be patient. Is it hard for you to be patient? That's the story when I had patience.
1364	19339	7	3	"It's about three o'clock. The clock tells me, but I can't go to sleep because my dad and I are going fishing. So, it's eight o'clock now. My dad was supposed to be here at seven, but my grandma kept saying he'll be here, so I believed her, but I was a little worried. Now it's ten o'clock. By now, I'm just furious. I am about to cry, but my grandma said he'll be here. I said, ""He won't,"" and went in my room. Then I realized he will be here. Then I heard the door open. I ran, and it was him. I ran and said you finally came. We ate, then I looked outside and saw the boat. That's a time I should have shown patience."
1365	19340	7	3	I remember a time when I was excited. I was at home; it was Christmas time. I was the first one up, and I just wanted to open all of my presents and gifts, but I had to wait till everyone got downstairs and wait for mom to get the camera. Then we open presents. My brother and sister wanted to go first. The oldest go first, a rule my brother made up. Then finally, it was my turn. I just randomly took the present and ripped the paper off without even looking at the present because it was my turn. I had been excited all this time. That was the time when I was excited.
1366	19341	7	3	Patients to me means trying your hardest to patiently wait on someone or something. I remember one time when I was patient. Me and my @ORGANIZATION1 went to the bustling water park and we were eager to get on this thrilling water slide. However, there was a long line with a lot of kids and adults waiting. So we waited @NUM1, patiently chatting and observing the excited crowd around us. Then we finally were second in line. The kids in front of us offered to let us get in front of them but we politely turned them down. So we were waiting while the life guard was carefully telling the young boy to hold on tight because it was his first time going down a water slide. But unfortunately, the little boy fell off the tube thing, hit his head, and almost drowned because he didn't know how to swim. It was a scary moment but we still went on and had a great time at the water park, which made me realize the value of patience.
1367	19342	7	3	"Clunk! I jolted in my seat as the rental car crashed into another deep pothole. ""Look whose awake,"" my mom barked as annoyingly as possible. ""You slept for so long. I thought you might sleep until we got to school,"" she quipped. ""@CAPS2 are we?"" I asked in a dreary voice. ""Ohio,"" replied my mom's friend @PERSON1. We were going to @LOCATION1 with my mom, @PERSON1, and me @CAPS3 @PERSON2 over spring break. We would be staying in the Florida @CAPS4. While we were there we would be visiting my dad as he was working in @CAPS4. I was sure it was going to be a memorable trip, but I knew the long car ride there would be the ultimate test of my patience. It would take us @NUM1 or @NUM2 days to reach our destination. The @NUM3 day would be the hardest of them all. This was the day we would be driving through the majestic mountains. I can usually pass the time when I am riding by looking out the corners, enjoying the scenic views. However, when we reached the peak of the @NUM3 mountain, everything went hectic. First off, my @CAPS3 (who was sitting next to me) started screaming because there were not any guard rails and we were in the lane close to the dangerous edges. Second, my @CAPS3 started grasping my arm tightly like her life depended on it. Last, and worst of all, my bladder started acting up! All of these things combined to make our pleasant ride through the mountains turn into a rollercoaster ride that I will never forget for a moment. The whole time I was thinking to myself, ""I'm going to go insane! Just make it stop."" As if on cue, the screaming came to a halt, the pressure of my @CAPS3's grasp on my arm was relieved, and we were pulling into a rest stop with clean bathrooms. If I had not been patient during that ride through the mountain I would have gone insane. I would be sitting in an asylum. I will always remember that nerve - wracking ride through the mountains as a lesson in patience."
1368	19343	7	3	"Today was the first day I was truly patient. I couldn't believe it. I was so proud of myself. This is how I was patient. I was standing in line, eagerly waiting for my delicious ice cream. Suddenly, this teenage girl went up to the counter and impatiently said, ""@CAPS1 you. I have to be somewhere in ten minutes. If you don't get this line moving then I'm going to have to talk to the waiter."" All the guy at the counter calmly said, ""I'm so sorry but you will just have to wait until everybody that was in line in front of you gets their order before you."" ""Are you kidding me?"" she yelled as she stomped away. That's when I realized how ridiculous I looked when I'm impatient. So I patiently waited in line until I got up to the counter. I then said to the guy, ""You have to deal with a lot of people like that, because you handled the situation very calmly."" And he said, ""Yeah, there are a lot of people that are like that around here. It's truly sad."" Then he asked, ""So @CAPS2 would you like to order?"" I told him my order and walked home with a sense of pride. As I walked home, I felt so proud that I decided I'm never going to be impatient again, as patience really does pay off."
1369	19344	7	3	A time when I was patient was when I was waiting for my important gymnastics meet to start. I had to wait two long hours along with my energetic team. We first did a proper warm - up, stretching our muscles carefully to avoid any injuries. Then we were chatting animatedly about who we thought would win the team trophy, sharing our predictions and hopes. We asked our coach if it was almost time to start. He said it was going to be another hour. So, we talked some more, sharing funny stories, and practiced some skills for the floor exercise. We even had a head - stand contest, trying to hold our positions for as long as possible, and did as much as we could to make the time go by faster. We asked our coach another half hour later and he told us it was going to be a half hour longer because they had to get another judge. Finally, an hour later, the judge arrived and the coaches had their meeting. Then we started the meet. That is a time I was patient, and it taught me that patience is key in waiting for something exciting to happen.
1370	19345	7	3	I'm going to write about when I was patient. One sunny day I asked my mom if I could get a phone. She said if I was patient, I would be able to get a phone. So I decided to be patient. Time flew by quickly. I was busy with my studies and other activities, not constantly pestering my mom about the phone. Then one day, my mom finally said yes. You see, when I was patient to get a cell phone, I got one. Have you ever been patient with your family? Tell me, did it work out or did it go bad? If you are patient, it probably will work for you. Patience can bring good things, and that is what happens when you are patient. It shows that waiting with a calm mind can lead to positive results.
1371	19346	7	3	ì@CAPS1 !Did it come yet!?î I yelled, sprinting home from the bus stop, my backpack bouncing on my back. She was standing near the mailbox, holding a thick wad of envelopes. One of these, I hoped, was the letter. ì@CAPS2 not yet, honey,î she said, ìbut thereís plenty of bills to go around.î  I wanted to scream in exasperation, but I remembered what @CAPS3 said, ìJust wait long enough and youíll get what you want.î I trudged inside and plopped down on the couch, feeling dejected. This letter meant so much to me. It said which advanced classes I would be in. It doesnít sound that important, but only the elite could get in and this meant the world to me. I would be challenged, my parents would be so proud of me, and I would get @NUM1 bucks from grandma. See, you take a test at the end of school and wait the entire @DATE1 for results. Pretty good system, huh? No! Pretty soon, other things distracted me - swim meets, tennis matches, and books. I learned that it helps to be patient, and time goes by a lot faster. @CAPS3 was right, I guess. One @DATE2 @TIME1, on the @DATE1, I was on the porch reading a thrilling novel. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw the mailman. He shuffled around in his bag, and pulled out mail, put it in our mailbox and drove away. I leaped out of my chair and ran to the mailbox. I surveyed the mail quickly, until one envelope caught my eye. I ripped it open and sure enough, it read @PERSON1 has been selected for the following advanced classes: @CAPS4 studies, @CAPS5, @CAPS6! My patience finally paid off, and I felt a rush of excitement and relief.
1372	19348	7	3	The time I was patient was the time I was @NUM1 years old on @DATE1. It was a snowy night, and the snowflakes were gently falling outside. My mom and dad were buying a new car at the dealership. It took so long, and I was so hungry. My stomach was growling. Mom and dad were talking with the car dealer, discussing the features and price of the cars. My brother and sister were playing @CAPS1 on the floor of the dealership, having a great time. When my mom and dad were done talking with the car dealer, they looked at the car they wanted. One of the workers noticed our hunger and brought me and my brother and sister a box of delicious cookies and a carton of milk. While my mom and dad were looking at the cars, we got hungry again, but I showed patience. My mom and dad found the car they wanted. They chose a van with a @CAPS2 inside, which would be very useful for our family trips. They paid for it and we left. When we did, my father took us to @ORGANIZATION1, where we had a wonderful meal to satisfy our hunger. It was a night that taught me the value of patience.
1373	19349	7	3	I am usually a patient person, but when I have to sit for hours, my patience can wear thin. However, I still strive to be a patient person. My mom is patient too, especially at the place where she works. A lot of people are very rude to her, making unreasonable demands and speaking harshly. But my mom always remains calm and polite, dealing with them patiently. She sets a good example for me, showing me that patience can help us handle difficult situations better. I hope I can be as patient as my mom in the future.
1374	19350	7	3	One day, just a few months ago, me, my brother, and my mom were standing in line to buy school supplies. We were number @NUM1 and they just called @NUM2. It was around @PERCENT1 outside, and the sun was shining brightly, making it quite hot. We had to stand there under the sun, and it was so long that the new battery I had just put in my @NUM3 went dead. It took around @NUM4 hours just to get inside the store. Then there were even more lines! People were pushing and shoving, trying to get to the front. We barely got our things that day, but because we were patient, we managed to get everything we needed. It was a tiring but rewarding experience that taught me the importance of patience in such situations.
1375	19351	7	3	I didnít know where we were at. Then my dad told me, we were at this place called Buddies. Iíve never been there until that day. The place had a cozy and friendly atmosphere. Then the waitress led us to a circular table in the corner. Then, she asked us if we would like anything to drink. I told our waitress I would like a diet Pepsi. My sister got a fruit punch, as always. My mom and dad got a Mountain Dew, and my brother got cherry Pepsi. I donít know why we all got different drinks. It took @NUM1 minutes to get our drinks though. My dad wasnít so patient. He was tapping his foot on the floor and looking around impatiently. He knew that the food would take forever. Finally, our waitress came out with our drinks. She apologized for the wait, looking a bit flustered. Then she took our order. The wait for that was @NUM2 minutes. My dad was very impatient by then, muttering under his breath. I was the only patient one at our table. The restaurant wasnít even that busy, which made the long wait even more frustrating. I told my dad to just be patient, that the food would be right out any minute. So we waited and waited. Finally, the food came out. The aroma of the delicious food filled the air. We ate all the food, enjoying every bite. We got the bill, paid it, and then left. That was the time I was patient, and I was glad I didn't let my dad's impatience affect me.
1376	19352	7	3	I am going to be writing about a time when I was patient. One sunny day, me and my family were excitedly setting up decorations for my tenth birthday party. I was so excited and jumpy, practically bouncing off the walls. Turning ten was a huge milestone for me, so it was a really big deal. We already had the beautiful cake, which was decorated with lovely yellow and white frosting. It also had a picture of horses running across it and the words “Happy Tenth Birthday” written in fancy letters. The party was set to start at 11 am. I was wearing my pretty pink flowered dress and busy putting up streamers. I kept constantly asking what the time was, and my mom would just gently say to be patient. I had to wait, even though I was a very impatient girl. I was just so excited that I couldn't wait. Then I remembered that I was supposed to be patient, so I took a deep breath and tried to calm down. I played some simple games and read a few pages of my favorite book while I was waiting for the guests. Then, before I knew it, the doorbell rang, and all my family came running in, carrying presents and cards. I guess all that waiting really paid off. I also got some really cool presents, like a new bike and a set of art supplies. It was truly a memorable birthday, and I learned the importance of patience that day.
1377	19353	7	3	Everyday at school during lunchtime, I have to be patient to get my food. The options usually include pizza, salad, and sandwiches, along with milk. The milk is often not very fresh and leaves an unpleasant taste, but I always check it to make sure. I also had to be patient to get my gym equipment. Sometimes, there is a long line of students waiting to pick up things like basketballs or skipping ropes. It can be quite frustrating when I'm eager to start playing. But I know that being patient is the right thing to do. After all, if everyone rushed to get their things, there would be chaos. In the end, I manage to get what I need, and I enjoy my time at school, whether it's in the cafeteria or on the playground. So, even though being patient can be hard at times, it definitely pays off.
1378	19354	7	3	Elkhorn Jr. High School, on [DATE1], [PERSON1] Colbonthorne was having a pretty bland day. He absolutely loathed school; all he wanted was to go home and relax. However, his teacher sternly told him to sit down, shut up, and do his work. So, he tried to kill time by flicking eraser tops at the chalkboard. After about sixty eraser tops had been flicked, he looked at the clock, and it read [TIME1]. He let out a loud complaint to his teacher, and she firmly said, “[PERSON1], if you don't be patient, I'm going to send you home!” [PERSON1] exclaimed, “No way! You can't do that!” The teacher then retorted, “[PERSON1], to detention after school!” So, [PERSON1] sat down in fear of detention and quietly did his work all day without complaining. “Finally,” the teacher said when the bell rang, indicating the end of the school day. [PERSON1] was relieved that the long, boring day was over. He realized that maybe it was better to just be patient and follow the rules, as it saved him from getting into more trouble.
1379	19355	7	3	I was waiting, nervously looking forward and staring at the silent audience. Yet I couldn't really see that well since the bright stage lights coming down on me were quite blinding. I stood next to my best friend [CAPS1], who gave me an encouraging smile. On the other side of the stage were our competitors [PERSON2] and [CAPS2], looking equally determined. As I kept staring forward, I thought about how I got here and why I was here. I was gazing out the window of the small classroom while [PERSON1] kept talking animatedly. She said there was a contest for the whole seventh grade. We needed to get in pairs and write a story about anything we wanted. [CAPS1] and I looked at each other and quickly nodded our heads yes. Later that day, I rode my bike over to [CAPS1]'s house and thought about what to write. [PERSON1] also said whoever wins gets to go to more writing competitions. I was so excited that I was almost jumping up and down. I love writing and competition, so this was a dream come true. I jumped off my bike and ran to [CAPS1], already shouting out ideas like crazy. Finally, we decided on something to write about. It would be an adventure story about how a plane crashed in the middle of a jungle. By the end of the week, we had ten pages of writing neatly written down. I went on my Acer laptop and carefully typed the ten - page paper. After all the spell checks and grammar checks, we printed our story and turned it in. The results came at the end of the day. It was a tie between [CAPS2] and [PERSON2] and [CAPS1] and me. So, our writing was sent to the state for another competition. Remarkably, [PERSON2]'s pair and my pair won again! I really hope we don't tie for the country competition. So here I was on the stage, still staring at the audience, all done thinking about how I got here. I was so tired of waiting. [CAPS1] gently told me to have some patience, so I took a deep breath and tried to calm my nerves. After twenty minutes of judging, the president came up and said, “[PERSON3] and [CAPS1] have won first place.” We jumped up and down with joy and received our trophy. [CAPS1] and I found out that hard work and patience can really lead to something great, and this victory was a testament to that.
1380	19356	7	3	One summer, I was patiently waiting for a highly - anticipated game to arrive. I had been waiting for [NUM1] years for it to finally come out. The summer day started like any other. I checked the mailbox every few hours, but there was no sign of the game. As the day went on, the anticipation kept building up. By the time evening came, I was sitting on the front porch, looking out at the street, hoping to see the mailman. But it never came, so I reluctantly went inside and went to bed, feeling a bit disappointed. The next summer day, when I came back from a short walk, I checked the mail again. At first, it seemed empty. Disheartened, I slumped onto the couch and turned on the TV. Then, as I looked out the front window, I saw a small package sitting on the porch. It was my game! I rushed outside, grabbed it, and ran back inside, eager to open it. That's the story of my patience. It may have taken a long time, but in the end, all the waiting was worth it.
1381	19357	7	3	Once I was at a @CAPS1 wings game waiting to get tickets. The line stretched far, and the wait was incredibly long and boring. There were a large number of people queued up for that game. As much as I just wanted to go to the front of the line and quickly get the tickets, I didn't because that would be extremely rude. I felt that this long wait helped me develop my patience a little bit more. Plus, I would not want people cutting in front of me in line. I learned that good things come to people who wait, and this experience was a small but valuable lesson in patience.
1382	19358	7	3	A time I was patient was when I was sitting at my cozy house for several hours waiting for my grandma to pick me up and go get my friend. I sat quietly, reading a book to pass the time. I believe you should have a lot of patience so you get farther and wait for what you want. This patience is like a key that can open many doors in life, and that day's wait was a simple yet meaningful demonstration of it.
1383	19359	7	3	There were many times when I was patient. Maybe like waiting for a doctor appointment, sitting in the quiet waiting room, or waiting for your teacher to stop instructing so you could finish your homework. Sometimes, it felt like waiting days for your teacher to come and give your tests back. @MONTH1 could be spent waiting for those test results. But today I am going to talk about when I had to be patient to get my first dog. It was last year when we went looking for a dog to adopt. We visited several shelters but couldn't find the right one. It took @NUM1 weeks until we saw the cutest chihuahua. He was only one year old, with big, innocent eyes. We were rushing through the papers, scared someone else was planning to adopt him. When we turned them in, the lady said we had a back side too. After the paperwork, we had to wait another week because they had to fix him. My mom went shopping at the dog store. They told us we could pick him up on @DATE2. We were so excited. Instead of @DATE2, we thought we could pick him up on @DATE1. On that @DATE1 we picked him up. It took @NUM2 years of patience for my sister and only @NUM3 years for me. A year later we went back to adopt or just look for another dog. We didn't find one, but we waited, and if you're patient you will get something for that. We are still patient to maybe get another dog if our parents allow it, knowing that good things come to those who wait.
1384	19360	7	3	I am patient at school a lot of the time. When I am not understanding something and my teachers or someone else is busy, I will wait quietly for however long I need to, until they are free from helping someone else. In any of my classes I am patient most of the time. In art class we were making a box out of clay. I was a little behind because I had to finish my project that was due the week before. So when I had started working on my box, I did as much as I could remember from the art teacher's detailed demonstration. That was the start of it. So when I needed help I asked a friend that was done if they would help me get caught up. They said yes, so I was getting help from them. When someone else asked for help, she paused to assist them. I waited, even though it took about the whole hour. At the end of the hour they still weren't done, so she said she would help me the next few days. I said alright and then I said, I'd see them the next day. The next day in art @PERSON1 helped me. When she took a break or worked on her own thing, I tried my best on my box and waited patiently for her to help me again. @PERSON1 was almost done with her present but I was still waiting, so I asked someone else until she was finished with her project. Finally, when she was finished she helped me with the rest of my box. At the end of the hour I finished with it. Then we started a new project the next day that was simple. That's not the only time but it's the longest time I was patient with someone, and it taught me the value of waiting and perseverance.
1385	19361	7	3	I can't really tell you about a time when I've been patient because that's something I struggle with. No matter how hard I try to be patient, it just seems to be impossible, but it's not, maybe. I just don't try hard enough, who knows. An example of how impatient I am is when I'm at a store and I have five dollars and something I want is ten dollars. I won't save up for the ten - dollar item. I will turn and most likely buy some candies right away. My parents try to take my money and hide it so I can't spend it, but I always end up finding it and spending it because I don't want to wait until they give it back. Most of the time that happens, I get grounded, but the candy seems worth it to me at that moment. Another example is when I want to do something and my mom says no, I always sneak it and get in trouble. I know I need to work on my patience, as it would likely save me from a lot of trouble in the long run.
1386	19362	7	3	Patience is being able to calmly wait for something. For some individuals, exercising patience is an arduous task, while for others, it comes quite easily. For me, I'm moderately okay at being patient. Like I'm patiently waiting for this game I pre - ordered. It comes out @DATE1. I've been looking forward to diving into its new world and adventures. When I'm not patient is when I desperately want to get on the computer. I can hardly sit still when the urge hits. I was also patient when waiting to get my second - class rank. I knew it would take time for the results to come out, so I tried to stay calm. Well, that's all I have to say about patience. It's a quality that varies from person to person, and I'm still learning to master it better.
1387	19363	7	3	A time I was patient was when I got my shots. It was just me and my dad on that day. I had to get my shots because I was feeling under the weather and the doctor recommended them. It was still cold outside because it was in @DATE1, and the chill made me even less eager to leave the warm house. We went to the @ORGANIZATION1 for children, a well - known medical place in the area. In the beginning, I was at home getting ready to go. I put on an orange turtle - neck sweater and jeans with sneakers, trying to make myself look presentable despite my reluctance. I didn't want to go because it was after @CAPS1 and I had a lot of new games waiting for me at home. It took us @NUM1 minutes to arrive at the clinic. My dad filled out the necessary information at the front desk then we sat in the waiting area. In the middle, we started to watch television. I was really bored because there was nothing on but informercials, which seemed to go on forever. They had us waiting for over an hour. I started to get hungry and very upset, my stomach growling with every passing minute. They finally called our name. In the end, it was time to get my shot. The nice lady at the clinic gave me a juice to calm my nerves. Then she told me I was getting @NUM2 shots. I got my shots which took a very long time, and I was frustrated with the whole process. After I got my shots, before we left, they told me that I would be coming back for more shots. I was still hungry so we stopped at @CAPS2.Donalds to grab a bite. In conclusion, I was very patient when going to get my shots. The information I got about the future shots was just as painful as getting my shots. They had us wait for a very long time. I was sad to have to wait but happy it was over, and I hope the next visit will be quicker.
1388	19364	7	3	I have experienced patience when I went to @LOCATION1 @LOCATION1. It was a @NUM1 hour trip, and we were in a small car. We were a little cranky because we didn't sleep very well last night. Even though I brought a book and my @ORGANIZATION1 game, we were still pretty bored during the long drive. All I did was watch the trees pass by after my battery ran out on my @ORGANIZATION1. Dad was concentrated on the road, his eyes fixed ahead. Mom finally started looking at license plates to see where the travelers were from. Once we got into @LOCATION2, I started to drift asleep but @CAPS1 kept me up because she just finished her book and was excitedly explaining the whole thing to me. So I started reading my book again to pass the time. Even though you could hear mom, @CAPS1, and my stomach growling, we didn't stop. We had to get to @LOCATION1 before @NUM2 pm because that was when the hotel's front desk shut down. At @NUM3, we were speeding through the state of @LOCATION1 to then arrive at @TIME1 at the hotel. We were so excited that we had fallen asleep within @NUM4 minutes in the bed. It was a long and tiring journey, but our patience in not stopping paid off when we finally reached our destination.
1389	19366	7	3	Being patient, what does it mean? It means that “you are understanding and tolerant. A patient person experiences difficulties without complaining.” @CAPS1, being a patient person is indeed difficult. One time, it was hard for me to be a patient person, but I didn't complain though. I was overjoyed to be going to a water park on my birthday. I could already imagine the fun of splashing in the water, going down the slides, and having a great party with my friends. I wanted to party and get my swim on but it was almost @NUM1 weeks away. I didn't want to wait any longer, but I knew that being patient would make my experience at the water park even better. I tried to be tolerant, understanding, and patient. The week dragged on. I wanted to complain and rip my hair out because it was like the earth was turning @NUM2, @NUM3 times slower, but I knew that I couldn't! When the thought of me going to the water park got stuck in my brain like glue, the problem was clear. If I didn't think about it constantly, time would fly by again. I had to be patient because I didn't want to annoy anyone with my complaints. When the day finally came, I had a blast. I enjoyed every moment at the water park. Being patient always turns out good, as it made the long - awaited experience even more rewarding.
1390	19368	7	3	"Being Patient. Being patient has its good & bad. I have had good things happen to me. I @CAPS1 all I had to do was be patient. Here are some good things that happened to me. A time when I was patient was when I tried out for the dance team at my dance studio. I was so nervous as I never tried out for anything before. I was constantly thinking about how I did during the try - out and what the judges thought. I had to wait and wait and wait for my dance studio to call my mom. The waiting period was filled with anxiety and anticipation. One day when I was at a friend's house, my mom called me and said ""@CAPS2 you have made the dance team."" I was so happy that I could hardly contain my excitement. I couldn't wait to learn a new dance. Then I could show everyone at my dance competitions. It will be so much fun to perform on stage and share my passion for dance. Another time I was patient was when I broke my arm. I had to be really patient. I had to be so careful of my arm, making sure not to bump it or put too much pressure on it. I had it in a cast then I waited to get it off. Every day I would check the calendar, hoping the time would pass faster. Now I have no cast on. I was so patient that the doctor said that it was healing well and I didn't need a cast anymore. If you are patient, better things will come. Patience truly is a virtue that can bring about wonderful rewards in life."
1391	19369	7	3	Once I went to @CAPS1 world and we queued up patiently for about @NUM1 hours to get on this stupid ride. I was there because I had my @ORGANIZATION1, so I played with it. But after an hour, I got bored. I started teasing my sisters, and it was fun watching them get mad. Then I got bored with that too, so I just plopped down on the roadside. Finally, we got on the ride, but it wasn't even worth the long wait.
1392	19371	7	3	In my own words, patience is when you have to simply be calm and quiet, refraining from being all hyper and annoying. It's about controlling your impulses and reactions. It means not losing your temper easily and maintaining a composed demeanor. Patience is all about self - restraint and not being all rude and disrespectful to others. By practicing patience, we can build better relationships and have a more peaceful life.
1393	19372	7	3	"One day when I was at my sister's football game, my mom dropped us off at the game because she had to rush off to work. When I got out of the car, she inquired if I had my money with me. I replied no, and then she said I'd end up hungry. I simply said @CAPS1. @CAPS2 when the game kicked off, I started to feel really famished. @CAPS2 I rummaged through all of my pockets, and it just so @CAPS2 happened that I found @NUM1 bucks. @CAPS2 I went over to check how long the line was. The line was @CAPS2 long that it was almost stretching into the street. @CAPS2 I sat back down, hoping the line would get shorter. But instead, the line had gotten way longer. @CAPS2 I dashed into the line. I had to stand in the line for about @NUM2 mins. @CAPS2 when I finally got out of the line, I stood by the gate and watched my sister cheer. @CAPS2 she came up to us and pleaded with me to buy her some @CAPS3 fries. I refused because the line was too long. @CAPS2 she kept saying please! @CAPS2 I went back in line, and it moved at a snail's pace. When I got back, she said, ""What took you @CAPS2 long?"" I retorted, ""Look at the line."" @CAPS2 that is one of the times I showed patience, even though it was really tough."
1394	19373	7	3	I think patience is like when somebody is waiting for someone to finish using the bathroom so that the other person can go. For example, if I'm really in a hurry to use the restroom but someone is inside, patience means waiting calmly. Like I am not very patient because I'm eager to go to a store right now, but they tell me to wait and be patient. My whole family often lacks patience; they get restless easily. However, my friends are different; they can wait calmly and are more patient in various situations. In the end, having patient friends can help me learn to be more patient too.
1395	19374	7	3	"A time when I was patient was on the car ride to @LOCATION1. It was a @DATE1 - hour car ride, but I remained patient throughout and didn't utter a single complaint. Most kids would constantly ask, ""Are we there yet?"" but I kept quiet. Also, when I was extremely hungry, I just sat there quietly and didn't make a fuss. During the long ride, I looked out of the window and enjoyed the scenery. Finally, after @DATE1 hours, we reached our destination. That is a time I was patient, and I felt proud of myself for being able to control my impatience."
1396	19375	7	3	One day I was told we were going to @LOCATION1 for a fun outing. We were getting there by this big fast boat called the jet express. So we had to wait in this long, snaking big line at the dock. The boat was delayed due to some technical issues, so we were told it would be late. I should of known I did not dress warmly and it was freezing cold with the wind blowing by the water. We were the first people in line so that was a good thing but I was being patient, I was not complaining or anything, just stamping my feet to keep warm. When the boat finally arrived I was so relieved and my mom also thanked me for being patient and not complaining. That day turned out to be very nice and fun as we enjoyed the journey and the destination.
1397	19376	7	3	When my friend was getting his meds at the pharmacy, I waited until he got ready. I was sitting on a nearby bench to wait for him. I was getting my phone out, listening to @PERSON2's ping pong - related music and some uplifting tunes. I was looking around for @PERSON1 and I was waiting for him to be done getting his things sorted out. After what felt like a while, my friend finally emerged with his meds, and then we were able to head off together.
1398	19377	7	3	One @DATE1 sunny day, my uncle took me to @CAPS1 point to go on a roller @CAPS2, the thrilling @CAPS3 @CAPS4. The line was so long, stretching far into the distance. We waited at least @NUM1 hours, shifting our feet and chatting to pass the time. Time went by slowly and we finally got on. The roller - coaster ride was exhilarating. After, we went to the @CAPS5 thrill @CAPS6, which took about an hour and a half, filled with more exciting moments and memories. It was a great day out with my uncle.
1399	19378	7	3	"Patience. ""@CAPS1"" @CAPS4's stomach rumbled loudly. ""@CAPS2 I'm hungry"" I cried so @CAPS12 stopped at @ORGANIZATION2, because @CAPS8 were on our way home from a long day. Moments later @CAPS8 finally pulled up to @ORGANIZATION2's drive - through. The cashier said ""hi @MONTH1, I take your @CAPS3."" @CAPS4 @CAPS2 yelled excitedly ""@CAPS5 I get a famous bowl and a @NUM1 piece honey @CAPS6 wings."" The lady replied ""@MONEY2 @NUM2 at the first window."" @CAPS8 drove around to the first window. @CAPS4 @CAPS2 saved the lady a @MONEY1 bill, @CAPS12 gave her @MONEY3 and said ""@MONEY3 is your change, go to the second window."" Before @CAPS8 could drive to the second window @CAPS8 had to wait on the car ahead of us. @CAPS8 sat there for @MONEY1 minutes and they finally left. Then, @CAPS8 drove to the second window and waited. @CAPS13 minutes later @CAPS8 still was waiting. So after @MONEY1 minutes. I said"" @CAPS2 @CAPS5 @CAPS8 go get some @ORGANIZATION1"" @CAPS12 calmly replied ""@CAPS10, @CAPS8 are going to sit here patiently."" I murmured ""but I'm starving."" @CAPS8 sat there and waited patiently for over an hour. I asked one more time ""@CAPS5 @CAPS8 leave please."" @CAPS12 said ""@CAPS10, I payed for the food and I'm going to get it."" @CAPS13 minutes later @CAPS8 finally got the food after two hours. After sitting there @CAPS8 got some free food. Even though @CAPS8 got some free food I was still mad that @CAPS8 sat there all that time, but at least we had food in the end."
1400	19379	7	3	It was a hot sizzling @DATE1 day. I had decided to ride my dirt bike @CAPS1. I carefully put on my helmet, sturdy boots, goggles, and thick gloves. I headed out the door and out to my dirt bike, turned the key and it roared to life, then took off. Like a speeding bullet “zoom” I went up one of the ramps and I landed, but I was going too fast around a corner and “wam” I fell off and the foot peg went into my leg. My dad came running, picked me up gently and put me in the truck to go to the @CAPS2. When we arrived my dad had to check in at the front desk. After that we sat down in the crowded waiting area. There was a lot of people there - men, women, kids, and babies, all waiting their turn. An hour passed and we were still sitting there, then two more hours. Finally, they called my name. The nurse took my dad and I to a room and said “the doctor will be in shortly.” “All right” my dad replied. An hour passed, no doctor. We were starting to get bored, so my dad turned on the tv. Then finally, three hours after we got in the room the doctor came in. By now it was @NUM1 pm and we were exhausted. The doctor took me to get x - rayed. When we got back the doctor said I had bruised my bone and gave me crutches and said to stay off of it for a week. When we got home I lay on the couch and went right to sleep. That was the time when I was patient for six hours in the @CAPS2, but it was worth it to get the proper treatment.
1401	19380	7	3	"A time that I was patient was when I was awaiting to get into my basketball game. I played for the Destroyers. In all the games, I always had to wait until the specific time in the game. So, in the first game of the season on @DATE1, I got in four times. In the first quarter on @DATE2, I got in for about one minute. Then, I got in for @NUM1 minutes during the second half of the @DATE1 game. I was happy but I still wasn't starting. Then we got into the playoffs. I only got in two minutes throughout the whole entire game. At one point, I was gonna quit but my teammates came up to me and said, ""Don't worry, your time to start will come for everyone."" Over the next few months, I waited patiently. Then we got into tournaments. We split up the team with the older people on one team and the younger people on the other. Then I finally got in the starting lineup. I was so excited that I was in the playoffs. Unfortunately, we lost at the championship game. That was a time I was patient, and it taught me the value of perseverance."
1402	19381	7	3	"Patience helps you get through life. If you aren't patient, then you won't know where to go next in the future. @CAPS4's uncle had to be patient for months. He was running around in a frenzy, just constantly waiting for a phone call. Finally, someone yelled, ""Just be patient, they will call."" He said being patient was the hardest thing he had to do. He was wondering why they couldn't call the next day. He said he ended up forgetting about it here and there. He said he was trying to be as patient as he could be. @CAPS4's uncle was waiting to be part of America's next @CAPS1 @CAPS2. They told him they would call if he got in. They soon did because the phone rang. A woman nicely said, ""@MONTH1, may I speak with @CAPS3 Sanders please?"" @CAPS4's uncle replied, ""Yes, this is him! I've been waiting for a month! @CAPS4's family kept telling me to be patient! So now I don't have to wait anymore!"" ""You are in! So keep on practicing! Someone else will call you with the details!"" ""@CAPS6 you so much!"" Then he hung up the phone. ""I'm in!"" It was one of the happiest days of our lives. @CAPS4's uncle went through a lot. Really, all that kept him going was him being patient. He told us it was hard, but it worked out great in the end. Here's future advice. Always and I mean always be patient. You're not going to get anywhere in your life if you aren't. Patience is an important part of your life, and it can lead to great opportunities."
1403	19382	7	3	"A time when I was patient was when I counted. I didn't just count to ten; I counted a large boatload of coins consisting of pennies, nickels, dimes, quarters, and more. It took me two hours to finish counting my money, and it felt like an eternity. Counting a bunch of coins won't change the world, but it takes a lot of patience to accomplish. I still remember the moment when I finished counting the money. I was proud of myself because I admit to being a very impatient person. Patience is important because nothing would ever be finished without it. I don't think that I'll be able to count my coins again easily, but like they say, ""Patience is a virtue."" This experience taught me that with patience, I can achieve small but significant tasks."
1404	19383	7	3	"Sitting in the car, I was waiting for @CAPS2's mom to get out of the house and into the car. When she got in the car, we were off. On the way to the @CAPS1 party, I got pretty bored after about a couple of minutes. When we got out of Midland, I thought it would go by pretty fast, but I was wrong. It was slower than ever. I was bored out of my mind, and the thing that made it worse was that @CAPS2's little sisters were screaming in the back. So, then we stopped at a gas station, which felt like forever. I pretty much never talked the whole way up there. I was trying to be patient but I couldn't take it. I managed to calm myself down after about an hour of the girls screaming. They finally fell asleep. I just sat there looking out the window. When we were about forty - five minutes away, it felt like we had been driving for days. It was probably like @NUM1 minutes away when the girls finally woke up. They started screaming, ""Are we there yet?"" @CAPS2's mom and dad just kept saying, ""@CAPS3."" When we pulled into the driveway, it was probably the happiest thing that happened that day. I thought I was pretty patient on the way up there, but on the way back, I might just sleep. At the party, I was patient until we could open the presents. I freaked out. I hope next time none of that will happen, and I can enjoy the journey more patiently."
1405	19384	7	3	Being patient is hard to be. First of all, it's like you're waiting in a long line that could take forever. Being patient in this line could take a long time, but it could go by fast if you had something to do. You could bring a book to read and read on the way up to your turn from the line or just be patient and try to distract yourself with your thoughts. For example, you could think about the positive outcome that awaits you at the end of the line. In the end, patience is a skill that can be developed, and it often leads to better results.
1406	19385	7	3	One time, when I was being patient while traveling, I finally got to that special place that I always like to go. This place is called @CAPS1 point. It's a spot that I've dreamt about and always look forward to. Once we arrived there, I was extremely excited, my heart filled with joy. One small drawback to this wonderful place is the aspect of waiting. Another word for it would be being patient. Being patient means calmly waiting for someone or something. At @CAPS1 point, you have to be patient in various situations, like on the long journey there, when trying to secure a nice campsite, and also when standing in those never - ending lines. But in the end, it’s all worth it because there is so much fun and amazing experiences after being patient.
1407	19386	7	3	I remember the time when I went to the @ORGANIZATION1. As soon as I stepped in, I was so excited because it was my very first time going there. The place was so colorful, with bright lights everywhere, and it was extremely loud, filled with the sounds of laughter and music. I went on a few thrilling rides and then got hungry. So, me and my family decided to go get some delicious cotton - candy. I was happily eating my food when I saw a cute little girl. She stood in line like a well - behaved little angel, with her hands neatly by her sides. All of a sudden, I saw a bunch of rowdy teenagers just rudely cut in front of the little girl. She was so patient that she just stood there quietly, standing behind the teenagers that cut in front of her. The line got longer in just a few short minutes. I left to go on some more rides and when I came back, the poor little girl was still there. More and more people had cut in front of her but she didn't say a single angry word. All she did was mumble to herself softly. I couldn't stand it! I wondered how she could just let them cut like that. If I was that little girl, I would have lost my patience a @CAPS1 @CAPS1 time ago. I was so amazed with how much patience she had. She finally got up to the front of the line and @CAPS3! Out came the closed sign. I couldn't believe my eyes and she didn't even get mad. I kept watching until the end. She finally walked over to the @ORGANIZATION2 and @CAPS4 stand and did the same exact thing! I couldn't watch this anymore. I left with my family and thought about that girl. In the end, I hoped to have great patience like her. Just thinking of her makes me truly amazed!
1408	19387	7	3	I know a time when I was patient. My friend @PERSON1 was coming back to the football field after we scored a great @NUM1. We had planned to hang out together. It was two and a half hours before he finally got there. When he arrived, we both were patient, waiting for the right moment to play the game or do what others wanted to do. As the day progressed, the sun was like a powerful tanning booth, beating down on us relentlessly. The grass was also as dry as a cactus, crackling under our feet. But the day moved on steadily. Finally, when we went our own ways, we knew we had shown patience during that long wait. This experience taught us that patience can make our time together more meaningful.
1409	19388	7	3	One time when I was patient, my friend @PERSON1 went to the mall around @NUM1 am. We were supposed to be shopping for new school clothes. When we got there, the sun was really bright up in the sky, shining brightly and making everything look golden. The birds were chirping cheerfully, and it was as hot as a sweltering @DATE1 day. When we both walked in, hardly anybody was there at first. But we went to a store called???, and it was so full of people that I thought I was at a crowded concert. We had to wait in the longest line. It was so long that people were almost at the doors of the store. So we both waited and waited, shifting our feet from time to time. Finally, we were at the front of the line and the cashier said, “@CAPS1, you have waited in the long line probably for about @NUM2 hour. I will give you guys a @PERCENT1 discount.” We went shopping and we got rewarded for being patient. This made our shopping trip even more worthwhile.
1410	19389	7	3	A time that I was patient was last @DATE1 when I went to @CAPS1 point. I was about to get in line to ride the @CAPS2. I was at the beginning of the line and then I saw a sign that indicated a two - hour wait from that point. But I wasn't that close to the sign, so for me, my family, and the other people that were in the same spot as us, we most likely had to wait at least two and a half hours. Well, it was a scorching hot day out and I was wearing black, which probably wasn't the smartest @CAPS4 choice. So I was waiting in line for about an hour. I just couldn't take standing in that hot weather anymore. The sun was baking down on me, and I was sweating profusely. But I really wanted to ride that ride so all I could do was to wait for another hour and be patient. Then I was about @NUM1 minutes away from the ride and then it seemed like a lot of people left the line. For me, that was good because then I was at the front and I was happy that I was patient enough to wait that long. That is a time when I showed patience.
1411	19390	7	3	One day in the @CAPS1 medical facility, I had to sit for two hours because I had to come for taking out my stitches. And there were a lot of people there. We stayed there for a very long time because there were only @NUM1 doctors and this lady took so long with her appointment. So it was my turn to go in but I was scared that it would hurt. But then as he was doing it, it didn't hurt at all. And then I went home feeling relieved.
1412	19391	7	3	Awhile back, my best friend @PERSON1’s grandpa passed away. They weren’t blood - related but they were really close, like family. At the funeral, I saw @PERSON1, and her sister @CAPS1 force a sad smile toward us. @CAPS1 then left to go talk to my parents. Then, @PERSON1 started crying, saying that she wouldn’t see her grandpa’s gravestone because they were moving to @LOCATION1. She then changed subjects and started talking about the good times she had with her grandpa. I laughed and smiled with @PERSON1, sharing in those memories. My parents later said we had to go to church. I hugged her and told her everything would be alright. She smiled and said, “Many contrary.” @PERSON1’s eyes filled with tears as she said, “I don’t want to move to @LOCATION1.” A couple of weeks later, she did move with her family, leaving behind the place where she had so many memories with her grandpa.
1413	19392	7	3	My understanding of saying your patient is that being patient means when you wait in line for something. Waiting your turn is being patient. One time I was patient by waiting on the bench to play in a game. I didn't get to play until the fourth quarter with @NUM1 minutes to go. But you know what? I had patience. A lot of people have patience but some people just don't have manners when they just don't care and start to yell and scream. Like popstars, a lot of singers, popstars and other famous people think they can cut in front of anyone because they're rich. But if they weren't rich, they wouldn't act like that. Pop stars and movie stars just need to have patience. I'm not saying all popstars and movie stars don't have patience. When they were little, they probably never acted like that. We should all strive to be patient in our daily lives.
1414	19393	7	3	I was patient when my mom went to the store. She would go into the store and get a basket. She would take all day in that store. She would walk up and down the aisles, carefully selecting items. Then she would come out of that store with a basket filled up to the brim. And I would be patient all the while. Then she would go to a new store and do it again. Even though it was a long process, I knew she was getting what we needed, so I remained patient.
1415	19394	7	3	Once, when my family went to @LOCATION1 amusement park, we all had to be patient. There is a water ride where you get in a log - shaped boat. Then you sit and it slowly takes you up a hill. You wait until you get to the top, and then you splash down a steep hill with a big splash. Well, that was one of everyone's favorite rides, so there was a long line snaking through the park. We had to wait for a half - hour to ride it once. So, in order to do something fun like ride this popular water ride, it takes time, so you must be patient. If you're not patient, you probably won't get to do what you wanted to do. Patience is truly a virtue when it comes to enjoying such experiences.
1416	19395	7	3	"Patience is the ability to be tolerant, understanding, and face difficulties without complaining. Patience isn't something they teach you in my school. There isn't a book you're assigned to read called ""Patience"", there is no movie called ""Patience is the Key"". None of that exists, even if you live in a world where a necklace can be turned into a camera, or a cell phone is a gun. I have just been assigned my first undercover mission and it's not at all what I had expected. So far, all I have done is sat on a cold, hard bench next to the strength meter at a county fair, surrounded by the noisy crowd and the smell of cotton candy. What people really don't understand is the patience that is put into being a spy. Sure, there's an occasional car being blown up, but not today, not for me. I hear the clock in my hand go 'tick, tock, tick, tock'. Suddenly, there's some action. The subject (the person I'm assigned to watch) is on the move and, oh, nevermind, all the subject has done is buy a three - dollar bag of popcorn. I start to doodle a design in the dirt, with my foot. I'm just about to abort the mission, seeing that nothing is happening when all of a sudden I find a clue. There in the dirt that lay just before me. I see a tiny computer chip. I pick it up and spray it with fingerprint - revealing mist. A purple, fluffy cloud of vapor surrounds the chip. Sure enough, when the purple cloud vanishes, I see that the subject's fingerprints are on the chip. I pull out my laptop and insert the computer chip. ""CONFIDENTIAL"" are the words that stay on the computer screen as if refusing to leave. I sit there waiting, bored. I remember patience. I think to myself that if I'm able to defeat twelve armed robbers with nothing but a tablecloth, I'm sure I can sit here and just be patient. At least twenty minutes have gone by now but it feels like twenty hours. The computer still has written on the screen, ""CONFIDENTIAL"", ""CONFIDENTIAL"", ""CONFIDENTIAL"" was successful. ""EUREKA!"" I say aloud and people start to stare, but I don't mind. I click the square on the screen that says ""open"". Slowly, a small message opens up that says ""Meet me at the ice cream parlor."" I close my laptop and start to slowly walk over to the ice cream van, observing everyone and everything around me. A man wearing a yellow shirt and a lady with a purple scarf draped over her head are the only two people standing by the ice - cream stand. I walk a little bit closer and I realize that the man has a gun. I pull out mine and with a few loud roars, they were both in handcuffs. Of course, they were both working with the main suspect. I would have never been able to successfully complete my mission without being patient."
1417	19396	7	3	I remember a time when I was patient. I was so patient that the doctor gave me a sucker. I was being patient because the doctor was looking for a needle to stick in my arm. He told me to wait a second, but I wasn't waiting a second, I was waiting for hours. I sat in the small, stuffy examination room, with the white walls and the uncomfortable plastic chair. My mom could not wait any longer; she was pacing back and forth, looking at her watch. She was about to take me home. I told her to be patient and it would feel like time is going faster. She said she is going to try, but if it didn't work we're leaving. She waited patiently, sitting down beside me, holding my hand. Next thing you know, the doctor came back in the room and said thanks for being patient. He was still looking for the needle. Then he came back in the room again and said I found it. It was in the other doctor's room, above the sink on the dresser. After I got my shot, the doctor thanked me and my mom for being patient and not leaving. After he thanked me, he gave me a sucker and shook my hand. Me and my mom left out and went to the store and got something to eat. This experience taught me that patience can lead to a positive outcome.
1418	19397	7	3	So you want a story about being patient? Well, you're in luck. So the story starts off with me at the doctor's office. I'm waiting. I was going to sit here for a few hours, so as I wait, I'll read something. I picked up an old, tattered magazine from the table. So I'm reading and all I hear is whining, oh, and screaming. I look up and see a little kid throwing a tantrum. I try to calm the situation down. I get the kid to stop crying and the mom to stop screaming, so I was happy. Then my sister Cheris comes up and screams in my ear. I was really annoyed but not mad, so I just got another magazine to read. Then my mom says it'll be another hour. I was so mad I screamed. This is true and despite all these disruptions, I was still patient. In the end, I learned that patience can be tested in the most unexpected ways, but it's always worth it.
1419	19398	7	3	I was patient when we were going to lunch. I was standing there patiently, surrounded by the hustle and bustle of the lunch crowd. We got our lunch and everyone was patient. Then when we got our lunch, I know a time when my friend was patient too. When we were at the water fountain to get some water, some girls came up to the water fountain to get some water. He waited patiently, standing back and letting them go first. After they were done, he got his turn to drink the cool, refreshing water. Patience is an important quality that helps us get along with others and makes our daily lives more peaceful.
1420	19400	7	3	Without patience, a person can be very easily broken. Without patience, a person can be easily triggered to do something horrible. Like myself, I have patience, but at certain times, I sometimes don't have patience. Without patience, the whole world would be out of control. So that's why most plans of business try to operate as fast as possible. In business, patience can mean waiting for the right opportunity, the right market conditions. But in our daily lives, patience helps us deal with difficult situations, with other people's mistakes. That's what all this was about - patience. It is a virtue that holds society together and helps us achieve our goals, both big and small.
1421	19401	7	3	When I was a patient young one, I vividly remember writing an article at Sea World when I was very little. I didn't complain because I knew I would get my turn. Sometimes, my sister was complaining as she was in a bad mood. We stood in line for @NUM1 minutes for a ride called @CAPS1 Drop, or something like that; I can't quite remember. Then there was a line at the entrance for tickets. We waited @NUM2 minutes plus the time for everyone to get out. After all that waiting, we finally got to experience the ride, and it was quite an adventure, making the wait somewhat worth it.
1422	19402	7	3	One time I had to be extremely patient for a plane to come in. We woke up at the crack of dawn and had to wait for @NUM1 to @NUM2 hours. Over @DATE1 break a few years ago, me and my family went to @LOCATION1. We had a great time and did lots of things while we were there. When it was time to go home, we had to wait for a plane. We got up an hour early so we could pack up and get to the airport. When we arrived, we had to be patient while we returned the rental car and went through security. After getting through security, we had to wait for the plane to arrive. We sat for over an hour before the plane finally came in. When the plane arrived, we had to wait for the plane to be cleaned, passes checked, and everyone to board. That was a long - drawn - out time when I had to be patient, and I managed to stay patient for a very long time indeed.
1423	19403	7	3	A while ago when I went on a trip to Cedar Point in @LOCATION1, it was an hour and thirty - minute @DATE1 drive to get there. The reason why we went was because of my dad's work @CAPS1 @CAPS2. I got out of the car with @NUM1 items, waiting for my entire family. Waiting was all I did until @DATE1 when we all burst out running into the park. My dad pointed out the height limits (I was only @NUM2 and “4.@NUM2” ft tall @CAPS2, so I wasn't tall enough for most of the @CAPS4 rides). My dad saw that I was tall enough for the @CAPS5 @CAPS6. We walked around looking for the ride and, more importantly, the line. So we finally found the ride. My attention was drawn from the ride to the line; my mouth practically hit the ground with the thought “@CAPS7 luck getting to that ride”. My father looked at me then at my sister and asked “where is mom and Will?” I pointed over by the Ferris wheel where they were, of course, being cautious. So we just got in the line and sighed. It was at least @NUM4 something degrees. We waited for almost two hours and finally got to the front. We got into the chair and a bar came over us. I remember one thing: set a quarter on your leg and gravity takes a hold of it. A minute later, we were going down like a meteor, and the quarter didn't float @CAPS9! At that split - second, we were on solid ground. The ride was not really worth the wait, but hey, I'm not a coward.
1424	19404	7	3	Over the @DATE1, me and my sister were going to go to the Gnat Wolf Lodge with one cousin, Grace, and one uncle, Rege. But then he had to reschedule because his plane was going to be late. Then he had to reschedule again because his car broke down. So, we rented a car. Then we had to pick up my uncle @PERSON1 and we went on one way. On that way, we got stopped by a cop and the cop gave us a ticket for speeding. After all these setbacks, we finally arrived at the lodge. It was a relief to be there, and it turned out to be the best two days of my life, with all the fun and relaxation we had.
1425	19405	7	3	The story I'm about to tell you is about patience, where a boy and his father went fishing and the boy was not patient. One day, a boy and his dad went fishing. When they got there, they put the bait in the water and started their trip. The boy was impatient and kept fidgeting. Unfortunately, he caught nothing. When he got home, his dad came over and said “son, if you caught something every time you fished, it would be killing, not fishing.” @CAPS1 they went out the next day. Since the boy was patient, he caught a fish @CAPS2 because he was patient. Well, as we can see what happened with the boy, he caught a fish @CAPS2 because of patience. Remember, “all good things come to those who are patient!” So, always be patient and good things will surely come your way.
1426	19406	7	3	My mom’s in the hospital! My mom was in the hospital! She was getting a life - threatening surgery. This is a story of a time I was patient. My mom didn’t feel good for two long years. And when she went to the doctors for a “check - up”, it turned out she had heart disease with @NUM1 main artery blockages. So I had to wait while she was getting “prepped”. Those two hours felt like an eternity! Then I got to briefly see her for five minutes before she had to be taken to the surgery room. The surgery took a long five hours. I sat in the waiting room right after school. I quietly did my homework and skimmed through some magazines. I was extremely worried about my mom. But then the doctor comes in and says no one can see her for a whole day! I had to be patient and wait till the next day. That was the time I had patience and it paid off, and I was relieved when I finally got to see my mom doing better.
1427	19408	7	3	There was a boy that really wanted to go to the gym. So when he got there, he was eager to start. But there was a certain basketball he really wanted. As he was getting dressed, other boys quickly got out there first and took the ball. Later when he finally got out, he saw they had it. So when he got over there, he was really mad and snatched it from them. After the incident, he realized his mistake and came back and gave it to them, saying “I can wait”. So when they were done, he finally got the ball. He was so overjoyed and proud that he finally got the basketball. When he got home, he told @CAPS1 mom all about it, and she said that she was happy because he was finally patient. He asked, “what is that?” @CAPS1 mom said “it is a thing when you understand and are tolerant”. The boy was very happy because he always used to take things without waiting, and now he can wait to use something to be happy. That boy now lives happily with @CAPS1 mom in high school, patiently moving along through life.
1428	19409	7	3	A time when I was patient was yesterday when I finished the @CAPS1 well before a lot of people and then had @NUM1 minutes to spare, so I started drawing. I was patient throughout this time because if I wasn't, I might've been very noisy and disrupted my fellow classmates. I started to draw or color, as some might call it. Instead of drawing a simple smiley face, I carefully colored in boxes on math graphing paper to make a sort of lime green and purple checker - board. It took the whole @NUM1 minutes and I am still not done with it. That is a time I remember when I was quite patient, and it made me feel good that I could stay calm and focused.
1429	19410	7	3	One time I was patient was at the doctor. When I was little and at the doctor, I used to run around without a care. I guess this time my mom did not trust me, so she sat with me wherever I went. Mind you, there were some girls around, so I got really embarrassed and asked mom, “why are you following me?” and she replied, “cause I don’t want you running everywhere”. That's when I told her, “mom, I'm older now. I'm not five years old, I'm mature now”. She said @CAPS1 go ahead. So I went over and sat next to some girls and started chatting with them. Then we got up and started walking around while talking. I felt a little tingle in my head saying “your mom is still following you”. So I turned around and she was not there. So we went to the snack room and sat down. We ate and had a good time, and I just happened to look over and my mom was sitting at the third table away from us. Then we went back on the elevator to our original place and sat down. To my surprise, she was already there. That's when I told the girl that I would be back and I sat next to my mom and said, “were you following me?” and she replied, “yes, I mean no”. So I had a calm talk with her and we came to an understanding. Soon enough, it was my turn to go see the doctor. That is the end of my story, and I'm glad I was patient through the whole experience.
1430	19411	7	3	One time I was patient when my brother was riding something really quickly. I had to wait and wait for my brother to be done. But he said, “I can't let you ride in yet”. I told him that I was going to wait. I waited and waited, and he had been riding it for hours. Finally, he had run it out of gear and said, “now you can ride it”. I coolly replied, “Alright”. I was happy that I waited patiently and finally got my turn to ride, and it made the experience even more enjoyable.
1431	19412	7	3	Patience is when you are understanding and tolerant. It is also about being a person who can experience difficulties without complaining. A time when I was patient was when my baby sister was born. I was eager to become a big sister, so I had to patiently wait until she was born. My little sister was supposed to be born on @DATE1, the twenty - second. On that day, I expected my mom to be in a hurry, ready to grab the bags she packed the night before and head to the hospital to have the baby. But surprisingly, she wasn't even breaking a sweat. One week and two days later, my mom finally went into labor and was ready to have my little sister. I waited patiently in the waiting room with my dad and big brother. Every passing minute felt like an eternity, but I held my composure. Finally, the nurse came out and said we could go inside the room. When I saw my baby sister's face, tears welled up in my eyes. I knew right then that I was going to love her, and I hoped she would be as patient as I was during those long days of waiting. This experience taught me that patience can bring wonderful rewards.
1432	19413	7	3	I am in the @LOCATION3 @CAPS1 sea cadet corps. When I packed my things into the truck, I knew I had to endure a @NUM1 - hour car ride to reach my training in port @LOCATION2. We were driving in a truck that was meant to fit five people, but we were squeezing @NUM2 people into it. I got stuck in the back, surrounded by all the gear. Someone's sea bag had a boat in it, and it was constantly jabbing into my back. I tried my best not to complain, using all my self - control. It was only after half the journey that I couldn't take it anymore. I moved the bag with the boat to the other side. Just when I thought things would get better, @CAPS2 and @LOCATION1 started singing a very annoying song. The constant noise was testing my patience to the limit. Finally, we reached port @LOCATION2. @CAPS2 and @LOCATION1 stopped singing, and I was relieved. But then, there was the check - in line. There were @NUM3 people in @CAPS3 in front of me, waiting to check in. I was worried my patience would snap, but I held on. The officer at the check - in desk was old and spoke very slowly, making it hard to understand him. After what felt like forever, I was finally checked in. My patience had withstood all the challenges during the ride, the check - in line, and throughout the training. This shows that with determination, one can maintain patience even in difficult situations.
1433	19414	7	3	@CAPS3 was about a @NUM1 hour drive to freedom hill and we had just left our house. Dad, mum, @CAPS1 and I were excited to go and see buddy guy, and @CAPS3 was going to be a @NUM1 and a half hour concert. As we pulled into the parking lot, the policeman on guard pointed to an open parking spot for the jeep, and we drove in. We got out, drank some pop, and ate sandwiches because we had about an hour before the concert started. After @NUM3 minutes, or maybe @NUM4 minutes, we bought our tickets and found a nice spot to sit on the hill. Once we sat down, time seemed to stand still. I kept waiting, thinking that any moment buddy would walk on stage, but @CAPS2 never did. After what felt like @NUM6 minutes, I nudged my dad with my elbow and asked, “How long has it been since we sat down?” “About five minutes,” @CAPS2 replied. I thought @CAPS2 must be lying. I asked again, “How long?” “Six now,” @CAPS2 said. I was starting to get really frustrated. I tried to fall asleep to pass the time, but the surrounding noise made it impossible. Minute after minute passed, and then someone stepped on stage and announced, “The performance will start in @NUM7 minutes.” It was so disappointing. The long wait was only half over. Finally, after @NUM7 minutes of waiting impatiently, @CAPS2 walked on stage. It was the most wonderful sight. The long wait was definitely worth it, and I enjoyed the concert even more. We had a great time for the rest of the night, and this experience made me realize that patience can enhance the enjoyment of an event.
1434	19415	7	3	A time when I am patient is at gymnastics. There are multiple ways you need to be patient in this sport. Your mind and body both have to exercise patience, and sometimes you also need to be patient with your coach. Your mind has to be patient when you want to perform certain skills but your current abilities don't allow it. You might be eager to do a complex move, but you have to understand that you need more practice. Your body has to be patient when it feels ready to execute a skill, but your mind warns you to stop and wait. This internal struggle requires self - control. You also have to be patient with the coaches because they are always busy helping other gymnasts. So, sometimes you have to wait @NUM1 minutes until they can finally give you their full attention. Patience is a very important life skill that everybody needs to have. It helps you progress steadily in gymnastics and in other aspects of life, allowing you to achieve your goals without getting frustrated.
1435	19416	7	3	When I was at universal studios, I showed great patience while waiting in the long lines to get on the rides. It took a long time, but I never got angry or impatient. My dad and I were in a line for a dragon rollercoaster. We were almost next in line when it started raining and there was lightning. A lot of people left the line, so we ended up at the front. However, the rain and lightning didn't stop, and we waited for another hour or two. In the midst of waiting, we even forgot about my mom and brothers and left the area. I remained patient throughout this whole ordeal. Then we went and got in line for one of the new rides they just introduced. Since it was new, the line was extremely long. We stood there waiting for quite a while, but we didn't lose our cool. Eventually, we got on the ride, and it was amazing. We realized that the long wait was definitely worth it, so we decided to go on the ride again. This experience at universal studios taught me that patience can lead to great fun and memories.
1436	19417	7	3	"When I was @NUM1 years old, I went to my first doctor's appointment and it was extremely nerve - wracking. I sat in a small, plastic chair next to my mom, shivering slightly, wondering non - stop for @NUM2 minutes. I was running around the small waiting room and when I finally sat down, I said, ""@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3!! I couldn't be patient any longer."" So I walked out the door, and when the nurse called ""Your next."" And I was like, ""Well that wasn't long, only about @NUM3 minutes and a bit,"" ""@CAPS4 it's only @NUM4 and we got here at @TIME1,"" ""@CAPS5 that wasn't long,"" my mom said. Next time when I go to the doctor I will be extra patient and try to control my restlessness."
1437	19419	7	3	"Being patient means that you are understanding and tolerant. A patient person experiences difficulties without complaining. I'm writing about a time when my friend @PERSON1 was patient. ""I'll be back soon,"" @PERSON1 said to @ORGANIZATION1 as he was leaving to spend his whole @DATE1 in the upper peninsula of @ORGANIZATION1. @PERSON1 and @ORGANIZATION1 were dating since the beginning of the year. She was sad as @CAPS2 weeks had passed and @CAPS4 was the beginning of a new school year. She had been patiently waiting all @DATE1, hoping to see him again. Finally, the first day of school came. She skipped up to him and he @CAPS3 called away. A couple of confused weeks later, she said to him, ""Are you dumping me or...???"" He thought about @CAPS4 for a long time. She had been patient waiting for an answer but @CAPS4 never came. Finally, she decided to confront him but, she never did. So @CAPS5, Gabby and I did. From afar, she seemed mad on the outside but on the inside she was probably screaming. Today she has ""moved"" on and now is dating a boy named @PERSON2, showing that patience can sometimes lead to new beginnings."
1438	19420	7	3	There was a day when I was super sluggish. I did everything slowly. I got ready for school slowly. I took my time putting on my clothes, tying my shoelaces. I walked slowly, dragging my feet along the floor. I talked slowly, each word coming out in a lazy drawl. My mom was very patient with me. All she did was encourage me to move faster. She tried to motivate me and help me get ready for school. She brought me my breakfast, a plate of warm cereal, and put all my books neatly into my backpack. I thanked her at the end of the day for being so patient with me. That was the day someone was patient with me, and it made me realize how much her patience meant.
1439	19421	7	3	"To @CAPS4, being patient means to not whine while if you ordered something and it's taking long to come to you. That's what kids do. I have been patient many times in my life but just one popped into my mind when I thought of patience. One @TIME1 I woke up at @TIME1 to go take pictures for our passports. @CAPS7 thought @CAPS8 wasn't going to be busy over there. Boys were @CAPS7 wrong. @CAPS7 started to get dressed up carefully, picking out the right clothes. By the time @CAPS7 were done, the clock hit @NUM1. @CAPS7 got into the car and @CAPS7 were on our way. @CAPS4 and my little brother cranked up the music and started singing loudly, ""I @CAPS1 YOUR @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4."" My parents got so annoyed and made us stop singing by turning off the music. ""Mom, that's our favorite song."" @CAPS5 our @CAPS6.PS. Said ""you have reached your destination. Finally, @CAPS8 was getting a little spiffed up back here."" @CAPS7 got into the waiting room. @CAPS5 @CAPS7 all almost fainted because of how many people there were. ""Let's just calm down. I mean how long will @CAPS8 take?"" Suddenly, a deep voice in my head said, ""@NUM2 hours later."" My brother decided to make a bet with @CAPS4. ""@CAPS8, if you don't crack and it's our turn to take the pictures, I will do anything for you whenever you want for a week. You have yourself a deal."" @CAPS8 took a while for another @NUM3 hours to pass and I was about to scream. I was then falling deeper into a sleep when, ""the @PERSON1 family, your next."" The man had a long white beard and glasses. @CAPS7 finally went in and got over with @CAPS8. ""@CAPS10, I win @CAPS11! I won the bet,"" with a big smile on my face, ""@CAPS12 you have to do anything I want."" I was so happy that I started doing my victory dance, while the man with the glasses and beard stared at @CAPS4 like I was a maniac. @CAPS7 took our picture and @CAPS7 were off. Patient means to wait and wait without whining. Everyone has to be patient in their life just like @CAPS4, and this experience taught me the value of patience."
1440	19422	7	3	"Over the @DATE1, my dad, my brother and I went to @CAPS1 point. It was really hot, the sun beating down mercilessly, but we didn't care. We really wanted to ride the millennium force. We found the ride but we first looked at the line. It was huge. It snaked almost around the whole ride twice. So we got to the end of the line and sat in the blazing hot sun for a half an hour till we found ourselves under a small tent they put up, so it was somewhat cool in line. So we waited longer and longer till my brother started to flip out, yelling and screaming at the top of his lungs, ""I can't wait here any longer."" @CAPS2 he went under the barrier and ran off. My dad told me to wait in line as he sprinted after him. So I waited an hour. When finally, it was time for me to get on the ride but my dad and my brother were not here. So I decided to wait in the line going to the front of the ride. When I got on they still weren't there. Well, the ride took off and it wasn't the best ride ever without them. This experience made me realize that sometimes patience isn't just about waiting in line, but also about understanding others' limitations."
1441	19423	7	3	My dad is in the @ORGANIZATION1, serving his duty. He goes away for long periods of time, leaving our family behind. The only time he comes to visit us is in @DATE1, near my birthday. I always look forward to that special time. But one year my dad wasn't able to come home when he was supposed to. He sent us a letter saying that they were keeping all the troopers for an extra six months. I felt depressed for the longest time. But then I thought about it. Even if it was delayed, he was still coming back hopefully. So I decided to be patient rather than disappointed. Our family sent him care packages over regularly. Eventually, he did come back. That was a hard time, but by being patient, we got through it, and it made our reunion even more precious.
1442	19424	7	3	When it comes to patience, you have to be relaxed and calm. You need to exercise your patience when you go to the doctor. When you're at the doctor's office, you may have to wait for a while, but you should stay patient until you're done. When you get home, you might also need to be patient for someone, like a family member or a friend. So remember, make sure you are patient in everything you do, as patience can make difficult situations more bearable and help you achieve better results.
1443	19425	7	3	To dedicate to write about a time when I was patient. One time when we went to @ORGANIZATION2 @ORGANIZATION2, an amusement park. My family and I couldn't wait to go on the @ORGANIZATION3, a popular ride. But the line was extremely long, humungous. I was the only one who got to go on the @ORGANIZATION3 because I stayed in line patiently to go on it. My family kept going on different rides, like the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 ride and the @CAPS3 or even the @ORGANIZATION1. While I stood in line at the @ORGANIZATION3 @ORGANIZATION3, there was a Ferris wheel and a fun - house. Later that very same day, I got to go to the store in @ORGANIZATION2 @ORGANIZATION2 and waited in the humongous line at the cash register. By the time I had got up to the cash register, my family was getting massages. I was patient at @ORGANIZATION2, and it was worth it as I got to experience the @ORGANIZATION3 ride.
1444	19427	7	3	RREEE! The bus stopped. We were finally here! It took lots of my patience to stay quiet and not scream to the world. I had to be patient through the entire trip, so I had to learn a lot. On @DATE1, I was with a bunch of other fellow fifth - graders. We were all divided into groups, unpacked our things, and were ready to go for our three - day stay at @ORGANIZATION1. I was so excited that my friends told me to calm down and be patient. I felt a little embarrassed, but I didn't care. I finally snapped to it and kept my cool. In @CAPS1 and @CAPS2, I was stuck on how to make my painting of @ORGANIZATION1. A friend in my group named @PERSON1 told me some ideas. Although I initially had my own thoughts, I stayed collected and listened to her ideas. I have to say, they weren't bad. I thought about some of the ideas and used them in my painting. Now we're at the nearly @NUM1 feet high climbing ladder. I already took my turn going up and zipping down the awesome yet scary @CAPS3. I was now helping keep people up the ladder. I was patient, but man, they took forever! I was about to scream at this one dude, but I said to myself “be patient.” Then there was this one kid named @CAPS5. Sometimes he just sat right on one of the big planks of wood. I asked why he was doing that and I thought their response was hilarious. They said he was trying to be like @CAPS6 and fly to the top. At the end of the three - day field trip, my patience grew significantly. And every time my patience would waver, I'd remind myself to stay calm. I learned to have patience with someone, even if they were being an idiot and not moving fast enough. I would stay calm and make sure to not let my frustration get the better of me.
1445	19428	7	3	One day I was watching @CAPS1 on TV. I was bored because there was nothing good on. So my mom was on the computer. I told her if I could get on, and she was like “ok, in @NUM1 mins.” I waited for her to be done patiently. Finally, she said “Ok now you can go on.” I said “Thanks mom.” She replied “You're welcome.” I was very patient during this time. This experience taught me that patience is important in daily life, as it helps maintain good relationships and makes waiting for something more manageable.
1446	19429	7	3	"One time when I was patient was a sunny summer day and my friends and I adventured! We were by the water park most of the day and, it was really fun. I spent more of my time in the big pool and on the exciting water slides - my favorite part. We were soon getting tired of the water park and decided to go on the rides! We were trying to decide whether or not we wanted to go on the big roller - coaster or the ""Crazy Twister""! I decided to go on the big roller - coaster and when we got there, the line was like an hour long. So, I endured the long, made - up mile and after a while, we were finally in line. Consequently, the roller - coaster ride was having some technical issues that were delaying things. When it was announced that we had to wait, we decided to go and check out something else. For the thunder of the approaching park closing, it was ""so bad we stayed in the water park too long!"" I waited and then thought that we'll come back next year and got in line and asked my mother softly. As you can see, I have experienced patience at the park."
1447	19430	7	3	One time I had to be patient was on my 10th birthday. One year my grampa and grandma were late for my birthday party. I had to wait a few hours sitting in the living room. I sat down quietly until they got here. I was looking at the beautifully decorated cake on the table, imagining how delicious it would be. When they finally got here, we all gathered around and got to eat the scrumptious cake. After that, I eagerly opened my presents. It took them about two hours for them to get here. This experience taught me that patience is indeed a virtue, especially when waiting for loved ones on a special day.
1448	19431	7	3	"We're here at Cedar Point. I was so excited I felt like I was going to go crazy. ""Can we go on the dragster first?"" My friend said, ""Why not? It'll be fun."" When we got in line, it was an estimated hour - long wait. ""Do you still want to ride the ride?"" my friend asked. ""Sure I do,"" I replied. So, I knew I would have to be patient before I could ride. While we waited, it was extremely hot and when fifteen minutes went by, it felt like an hour! But I knew when it was time, patience would pay off. When thirty minutes passed, the dragster was in sight. Cling, cling, we were second in line. Zoom! A car went by, primarily a blue long dragster car stopped and it had my name all over it. I got in and I was so patient that it was like ten minutes before the ride started. Finally, the ride began. At full speed, we went up the hill and it was like a meteorite crashing down into earth. When it was over, my patience paid off and I'll always be patient because of the Cedar Point dragster."
1449	19432	7	3	I am writing a story about a time when I was patient. When I was in third grade, I went to a fancy Italian restaurant in New York City. I ordered a delicious pizza with my mom and dad and then we waited. The waiter said the food would come in about fifteen minutes. Our food didn't come after fifteen minutes or twenty or twenty - five or thirty or even forty minutes. Our food came after an hour and five minutes. All the time I was waiting, my stomach was growling and I was getting more and more hungry. I didn't start complaining or yelling. Instead, I sat in my seat quietly and waited patiently. This experience taught me that patience can make the wait for something enjoyable more bearable.
1450	19433	7	3	When I hurt my hand on the same day of meaping, I was patient. I fell in the hall and I quickly went to the office. I waited patiently for them to call my mom to pick me up. I sat there quietly, trying not to think about the pain in my hand. When my mom arrived, she said she was going to take me to the emergency room. It took a while to find a parking spot when we got there. I was patient even though my hand was hurting a lot. We drove around the parking lot for a bit and then we finally found one and then went inside. My mom went to the front desk to tell them I was there. We waited for a little while and then a nurse came out and ushered us go in a room and talk. She said I would have to wait for a bed to open up for x - rays. I saw a lady through the window and I knew it was for me. She opened the doors and asked for me. She had us follow her to a room where we waited about forty - five minutes for a doctor to come in and take us to the x - ray room. When they finished, we went back to the room and waited a while. Until the doctor came in and said I didn't break anything. He gave me a brace and I went home. Throughout all of that, I was patient and learned that patience is important in difficult situations.
1451	19434	7	3	I was truly patient when my birthday came around. I am eagerly waiting for my party at my dad's house this @DATE1. My birthday was @NUM1 on @DATE2. I am getting a @CAPS1Æ from my dad for my birthday. I really tried to stay calm and patient as the day approached. I kept reminding myself that good things come to those who wait. I am still looking forward to having a great time at the party and receiving my gift.
1452	19435	7	3	ì@CAPS1 another @NUM1 days and I'll finally be on my way to Cedar Point. I'm really excited and I keep wondering what we'll do when we first get there. What will end up being my favorite ride? Maybe I can try to talk my mom into going on the trip @NUM1 days early.î ì@CAPS2 mom,î said @PERSON1. ì@CAPS3,î said her mother. ì@CAPS4 can we @CAPS1 go to Cedar Point now?î ì@CAPS5 sweetie, our tickets are for on @DATE1. You @CAPS1 going to have to be patient.î ìok, I'll do my best.î ìThat's a good girl!î As @PERSON1 was on her way up to her room, she was thinking that maybe if she tried getting her mind off of it, she would forget. So to do this, she called her friend @CAPS6 to see if she wanted to come over. @CAPS6 said @CAPS3! ì@CAPS7,î went the doorbell. ì@CAPS2, @CAPS6, wanna go play in my room?î ìor...î That night, @CAPS6 went home and @PERSON1 went to bed. @NUM3 days passed. Only one more day to go! That night, @PERSON1 went to bed around @NUM4 to get a good sleep for the trip. But to her surprise, she woke up @CAPS1 a couple hours later. She was so excited she couldn't sleep! She finally fell asleep, and they left early the next morning, ready to start their fun - filled trip.
1453	19436	7	3	Patience is truly useful in certain times, like when you're waiting for a blood test or to meet someone again. During a blood test, being patient helps you stay calm and allows the medical staff to perform the procedure accurately. When waiting to meet someone, patience shows respect and consideration. However, in other times, patience is useless. For example, in the army, any army, you sometimes wait in a situation where you might die by the hand of your enemy. In such a high - stakes and dangerous situation, patience might not be the most effective approach. Overall, patience is mostly good because if you rush, you might hurt someone, miss something helpful, or just something you enjoy. So, it's important to know when to be patient and when to take action.
1454	19437	7	3	A time when I was patient was when I was at @CAPS1 @CAPS2. I was really looking forward to getting on the dragster, but the line was super long. We waited for @NUM1 hours, and we still were in line, trying our best to be patient. Finally, we got up there, and they said that the ride will be closed for a while. They had to check something, and it took them a whole hour to fix it. So we went to the other side of the park and were waiting for the train to come. It took the train @NUM2 minutes to arrive. When we got to the other side of the park, the ride I wanted to get on, which was Shoot the Rapids, had a really long line. So we waited and waited, and finally it was our turn. We got on, and it was really fun. Then when it was over, we got back on the train and went back to the other side. We went back to the dragster, and the line was long again. We waited and waited, and then it was our turn. That day was the worst day because I had to wait and wait. It was my first day that I ever had to hold my patience that long. I was about to lose my mind, but we persevered. And we are going back this @CAPS3, hoping for a better experience.
1455	19438	7	3	It was a time when I had to be patient. When I went to a fair, we had to wait in line for like two hours. I was so bored just standing there, but I really wanted to go on the rides, and that's what I was waiting in line for. I was trying to be patient the whole time in line so I could get my @CAPS1 ticket and go on the rides. My feet started to hurt really badly because I was just standing there for so long. I finally got to the front of the line to get my ticket. I was so happy. It was a real test of my patience, but in the end, it was worth it as I got to enjoy the rides. That was a time when I was patient, and it taught me that sometimes waiting pays off.
1456	19439	7	3	A time when I was patient: I'm patient when my family, like my parents sharing their day, or friends, perhaps recounting an exciting event, or teachers, explaining a complex topic, are talking. I don't interrupt them while they are talking. I wait attentively to make sure they are done talking before I start to talk. Another thing is being polite. I am polite in class, listening quietly during the teacher's lecture, and at home, when my family is having a discussion, I don't talk when it's not my turn. Another thing is I am really nice to people. I don't be mean to anyone. I listen intently to what they got to say. When I'm at school sometimes you got to wait your turn. Like getting a drink from the water fountain, or getting your lunch from the cafeteria, or going in a single file line for a fire drill. You can also be nice and patient if someone isn't done. You can offer to help them out and that would be really nice and patient. These are the things I do to be patient, and I believe it makes my interactions with others more positive and harmonious.
1457	19440	7	3	"Hi, I'm @PERSON1 And this is a time when I was patient. My mom and my step - dad were going to take me and my step - sister to @LOCATION1 @CAPS1. But there was a twist: we couldn't ask ""Are we there yet"". So we had to sit in the car and wait a really long time. During the journey, there were moments when I was really eager to reach the destination, but I held my tongue. We passed by beautiful landscapes, which helped distract me a bit. But when we got there, it was so worth the wait. The place was amazing, full of fun activities and wonderful sights. It taught me that patience can lead to great rewards."
1458	19441	7	3	"Patience is tough to achieve sometimes. But that doesn't mean you should give up. Keep trying and you will succeed. Rush through life and become impatient and you won't succeed. I will tell you a popular virtue story to explain patience. Every year in the fall, a big race takes place. All the animals in the forest come to the event. It is an extraordinary event. It is a tradition that every year, one slow animal and one fast animal compete to see who is the champion. At the time, the hare was the fastest animal around. The hare signed up this year and won last time. The tortoise had signed up to compete this year. The hare was very confident in himself and was so full of pride because the tortoise was slow and the hare thought the tortoise couldn't be a champion. ""Runners get ready!"" shouted the announcer. The hare and tortoise lined up. ""On your marks, get set, go!!"" The hare rushed ahead, kicking up the air. The tortoise very slowly waited behind. The hare ran like he had never run before. He never looked back. He wanted to win. The trophy was rightfully his anyway. Right? I mean, he was the fastest animal. The tortoise continued on his way, slowly but surely making his way to the finish line. ""Growl growl."" The hare stopped and looked around. No one was around. ""What is that noise?"" he asked aloud. ""Growl"" it came from his stomach. He was so caught up in the race he didn't realize how hungry he was. ""Just one little handful of berries."" he decided. He picked a handful, then another and another. Finally, he was full and a little bit sleepy. ""I'll just take a little nap. After all, that tortoise ain't gonna catch up anyways."" he laid down and slept. Little did the hare know that the whole time he was eating and napping, the tortoise was catching up. The tortoise saw the hare sleeping and decided not to wake him in case he was sick. He continued to very slowly walk up the hill to the finish line. The hare woke to the sound of cheering. He stood up. The tortoise had won! He raced to the finish line but was too late. If the hare had been patient, he might have won. This story clearly shows that patience can overcome over - confidence and speed."
1459	19442	7	3	"In my thirteen years of experience, I have ridden many roller coasters, and when there is a rollercoaster, there is normally a two - hour wait. In the @DATE1 @NUM1, I took my best friend @PERSON1 to ""@CAPS1 @CAPS2,"" and we had just gotten in line for a ride called ""The @CAPS3."" When we got to the entrance, the attendant said a forty - five minute wait, so we got in line. Unfortunately, the ride broke down for over three hours. We stood there, chatting and trying to stay entertained. Finally, the ride was up and running, but it took another half hour for testing. When that ended, there was a two - hour wait in the back of the line. We were at the front, so it didn't really affect us. We finally rode that ride, and it was totally worth it. The twists, turns, and drops were amazing. Most of the lines later that day were small, but that still meant waiting about one hour each time. I just hope next time that ride doesn't break down so that the waiting experience can be more pleasant."
1460	19443	7	3	I remember a long time ago when I was patient for a long time. I was patient for about four months. I was waiting to get the video game system @CAPS1. And I was extremely patient for this. So basically what happened was that there was this new, high - tech, amazing game system coming out. The @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS1 was the talk of the town. Everyone was eager to get it. Including me. The only problem was that they were all sold out. So for Christmas, my dad told me that he would get me one. I was so happy. But we both knew that it would be a long time before he could get one. So I waited, and waited, and waited. During those months, I saw ads for the game system everywhere, which made the wait even harder. Then one night around @TIME1, my dad woke me up. He said that they were selling a lot of @CAPS3. So we got in the car, drove to the store, and waited in the line for a long time. There were other people in the line, all excited to get the game system. Finally, it was our turn. We bought the @CAPS1, went home, and set it up. The next day, I finally played my @CAPS1. It was so much fun. And that's a story about a time I have been patient, which taught me that good things come to those who wait.
1461	19444	7	3	My mom went to the doctors a couple weeks ago before school started. We went there at like 9:00 and didn’t leave till 11:30. So me and my little sister played a game to entertain ourselves. We watched some interesting shows on TV, played some simple games on our iPhones, and told each other funny stories. We were so bored. So once all that got boring, we just had to sit and wait and sit and wait. It felt like forever, but I just thought about how much fun it would be when we left. So I just sat there daydreaming until I felt like someone was about to come at our seats. But turns out it was someone else. Then my sister and I fell asleep. Then all of a sudden I feel someone shaking me and saying “Lexi, Taylor”. My mom called over and over until we woke up. So then now we are ready to leave and go to the mall. So we went and spent the rest of that enjoyable day at the mall. And that was my story about the time that I was patient sitting in a doctor's waiting room.
1462	19445	7	3	“Mom, can I get a puppy?” “No.” “But Mom,” “Just wait until Christmas. Just be patient.” “Okay.” Mom made her way down stairs to sulk. She thought of a brilliant plan to make the 25 days until Christmas go faster. “I will make a 25 - link long paper chain.” Each day or one of the 25 days she ripped one link off. She ripped one link on Monday, then another on Wednesday, and even one on the weekend. Before she knew it, it was December 25th. Mom sprang out of bed, ripped the last link off and said, “Mom, can I have a puppy yet? I was patient.” “Honey, you see,” said her mom. “Your dad and I have been thinking and it is a big responsibility, so wait until next Christmas.” “Okay, I'll be patient.” And although she was a bit disappointed, she knew she'd wait patiently for her puppy.
1463	19446	7	3	This is a story about a vampire named Jake who goes to a regular middle school. It was the first day of school and Jake was waiting in line for his schedule and later combination. And this line was really long. Jake was late on his first day and he had to get in the very back of the line. The person in front of him kept complaining and Jake was getting annoyed. “This will take forever!” complained the person in front. “Dude, shut up, man. I don't like this any more than you do but do you see me complaining?” exclaimed Jake. Everyone in the gymnasium stopped talking and looked in his direction. This was not a good sign. Jake stopped talking and just waited in line quietly. After 30 long minutes of listening to some cool music on his iPod, he was 5 people away from the front of the line. Then something bad happened. “Hey, this isn't my schedule!” said a blonde girl. The person who was giving out the schedules had to call everyone back up to see who had her schedule. So 30 more minutes passed until he finally got his schedule. If Jake hadn't had patience, he wouldn't have stood the 60 minutes in line! Good thing he brought his iPod to pass the time.
1464	19447	7	3	A time I was patient was waiting 8 to 9 whole months for my baby brother, Tom, who is 3 now. Those months felt like 9,000 years. It was so long I couldn't wait but I had to use patience to wait. He was due on June 15th, but instead he was born on June 20th. When I came to the hospital. Finally at 6 am on June 20th my brother Tom was finally born after 9 long months. That was a time when I used patience, and it was all worth it to welcome my little brother into the world.
1465	19448	7	3	I remember when me, my brother, my dad and my mom were at Cedar Point. I wanted to go on so many rides but they all had big lines. So we waited for the Raptor. It took one hour just to get on the ride. But when we got on it felt like it was even longer than the wait in line. It felt like 2 hours because of how intense it was. We walked and saw the Millennium Force. It had a really long line on it. So we waited. The line was much longer than the Raptor. It was like 3 - 4 hours. But when we got to the top of the stairs, it was so much fun because we waited so long. And my brother stopped complaining because he was so excited. The ride was really fun but when we were done we had to leave because it was getting late. We only waited on the rides but it was fun and memorable. That was a time when I was patient, and the fun on the rides made the long waits worthwhile.
1466	19449	7	3	My friend and a group of others showed loyalty in a play called @CAPS1 childrenís @CAPS2. This play is an annual event, and they come together once every year for it. Everyone gets fully prepared, carefully learns their respective parts, and within a week, we put on a remarkable show. We demonstrated loyalty by having unwavering belief in each other. When you're on a stage in front of an audience, you must whole - heartedly support one another. For instance, when someone forgot to enter on time, you'd gently remind them the next time. And when someone forgot their line, you'd smoothly say it for them. We showed each other loyalty throughout @NUM1 days. Thanks to this mutual support, the play turns out great each and every year.
1467	19450	7	3	I was patient when I was at the @CAPS1.R a week ago when I almost broke my finger. It was a rather painful incident, but I tried to stay calm and composed. Despite the discomfort, I waited patiently for the medical staff to attend to me. I knew that getting impatient wouldn't help the situation, so I just sat there, trying to distract myself until the treatment began. Eventually, I got the necessary care, and my patience paid off as the process went smoothly.
1468	19451	7	3	I am not a very patient person, generally speaking. However, there was a time in my life where I was extremely patient. I was in @NUM1th grade and was involved in an activity called helping Mrs. Bowos' @NUM2nd - grade class. We would regularly go down there to offer assistance. As you probably know, @NUM2nd graders are often not very proficient readers, and there was one girl who was really struggling. She needed a great deal of help from everyone. @PERSON1 would send us down to specifically help this girl. She faced numerous difficulties and would sometimes act out, like shutting the book as if it was on fire. But I remained patient. Every time she stopped reading, I would encourage her to keep going. Every time she threw the book on the floor, I would calmly pick it up. Eventually, the girl realized that such actions didn't achieve anything. So, she started to read. Then, I had to be patient with her slow reading pace. Whenever she didn't know a word, I would help her sound it out. Gradually, the girl kept getting better and better at reading until she no longer needed my help. I was truly proud of myself for being patient for once, as it made a real difference in her learning.
1469	19454	7	3	My own understanding about patience is that when somebody is doing something, you have to patiently wait until they are done. If you rush them, they probably will make a mistake or do something wrong. Being patient is a very important quality in life. It allows things to progress in a more orderly and successful manner. Moreover, being patient is also a very respectful thing to do towards another person because you're not being rude or imposing your own pace on them. By being patient, we can build better relationships and create a more harmonious environment.
1470	19455	7	3	There are many times I was patient, but this one was not too long ago. In fact, it was yesterday when I was taking the meap. I finished my part of the test early and just sat there. I tried to pass the time by reading a little and doing some drawing. It was absolutely boring, lame, and every second felt like an eternity. It was a truly terrible experience, but I didn't complain. I just sat there quietly and did nothing. It was probably the worst time when I really wanted to talk but couldn't due to the test rules. However, I managed to control myself and stay patient until the test was finally over. This experience taught me that I can be patient even in the most challenging situations.
1471	19456	7	3	The time I was patient was when I was in school. I was in math class and I was waiting to be dismissed so I could go to my friends at @ORGANIZATION1. So I was waiting and waiting and waiting and waiting and waiting. @CAPS1 The clock was not moving, so I started doing my class work. @CAPS2 When the @ORGANIZATION2 bell rang, I was @CAPS3 again. @CAPS1 There is one @CAPS5. @CAPS1 It was not a @CAPS7 @CAPS8 because we had the meap, so it was only a @CAPS9 @CAPS10 in all classes. So we only @CAPS11 had @NUM1 minutes left till the time was up. So I @CAPS12 sat and waited. And @NUM2 minutes passed and then me and my friend. That's good @NUM2 minutes too. So @NUM4 minutes, @NUM5 minutes, @NUM6, @NUM7, @NUM8, @NUM9, @NUM10, @NUM11, @NUM12, @NUM12 left now. @NUM1 seconds remained. Then the @ORGANIZATION2 bell rang and that's what @CAPS13 happened when I was patient.
1472	19457	7	3	Someone was in line for hot & ready pizza since they are advertised as hot and ready. A lot of people were in line and everybody was screaming and getting angry because they thought the pizza was supposed to be hot and ready right away. Everybody was throwing tantrums. The kids were sitting quietly at the little benches they have and watching the adults having tantrums. The people that work at the pizzeria were trying their best because there were a lot of people and everybody was yelling. Nobody showed any patience. They just cared about getting their pizza. The little kids that were hungry were showing more patience than the angry adults. They were all whining and everybody said they didn't want to hear it so they had to shut up. After that, he was there patiently waiting in line with his mouth shut. He didn't bother to speak. Eventually, everybody were back to normal and everybody had a smile on their faces and even the little kids. Everybody got their pizza really fast. Always be patient as patience often leads to a better outcome.
1473	19458	7	3	I asked my mom can I have something to eat. She @CAPS12 didn't say @CAPS1, so I waited, waited, then waited some more. Then I went up stairs and I waited @CAPS2 in my room. I was hungry then and I was being patient that whole time @CAPS3. I usually get the @CAPS4 used to @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8, I do. Another time, @CAPS9 on Thanksgiving, I was patient @CAPS3 as they were cooking the @CAPS4 and they @CAPS12 didn't cook the @CAPS4 yet. So we waited until the @CAPS4 was @CAPS16. Our stomachs were growling for @CAPS4, so I @CAPS13 showed patience. A man of patience @CAPS3, I waited until the @CAPS4 was @CAPS16. Patience in such situations helps us enjoy the end result better.
1474	19459	7	3	Patience is a quality that some people have and some people don't. It shows your character to people if you're patient or not. It can be hard at times, but we all get through it. For example, when I was at a restaurant that took forever to get our food to us, I had to be patient. I was sitting at the table after we ordered, and I got really bored. So, I decided to color with the crayons I got from the table. After I was finished with that, I decided that I needed to find something else to do while I was waiting. My mom was talking, so I chose to join in the conversation. I talked for a long time. Then our bread came. So, I ate that for a while and then got bored again. The waiter came and told us our food would be out soon. So, I continued to talk and then went to the bathroom. When I came back, our food was there! So I sat down and enjoyed the delicious meal. When I was patient, I got a good reward out of it. Good things always come to people that are patient. If you're not a patient person, then you can always try to become one. It's not very hard; just keep yourself occupied and remember that patience pays off.
1475	19460	7	3	A time when I used patience was when I finished my book. We have these things called teacher talks where you tell the teacher about the book you finished. I finished @NUM1 books called “The sisterhood of the traveling saint’s”. I finished the last two books. I wrote my name on the board for teacher talk. The teacher kept picking other people. I had to wait until I got called. Everyday I would go to @NUM2 and @NUM3 hour hoping I would be called. But everyday it wouldn't happen. I finished another book so I wrote my name again. But I still didn't get called. I put @PERSON1 @NUM4 which means I finished @NUM5 books. Eventually, on @DATE1, my name got called. I walked to the teacher with all @NUM5 books. I got to tell her about my books and I was very happy I got my name called. This experience taught me the value of patience in waiting for my turn.
1476	19462	7	3	I was a patient at the dentist office. When I went there, I was getting my braces put on. As I sat in the dental chair, the dentist told me they had to retrieve the brackets and wire. While they were gone to get these materials, I got to choose the colors for my braces. I patiently waited for about @NUM1 mins without uttering a single complaint. Next, they began attaching the brackets to the glue on my teeth. When they put the first bracket on, I had a strange feeling and it kind of tasted like heated metal. “@CAPS1,” I exclaimed. After they had placed all the brackets, they added the colored accents. My mouth ached terribly! When the entire process was over, I realized it had been @NUM2 hours! I was quite surprised as I didn't know I had sat there for that long. However, I was very patient and endured the whole time. That’s the time I was patient at the dentist office.
1477	19463	7	3	A time when I was being very patient was when I went to “@CAPS1” at Cedar Point. I went to Cedar Point with my @NUM1 aunties and my @NUM1 cousins. It was just the older girls going because we knew that if we took the little ones, we couldn't go into the haunted houses, although we did go inside one. It was extremely fun until we reached the lines. They were ridiculously long. I mean, it literally took us about an hour and a half to get on the roller - coaster. My cousins and I engaged in conversation for a long while. We were at the back of the whole area, called “The Dead Zone.” It was very terrifying yet fun simultaneously. What a strange sensation! We finally managed to get inside the place, but we still had a long way to go. There were stairs to climb and bars to pass through. It was dreadful. But did I complain? Not me. I was patient unlike my cousins. We finally reached the top floor, and can you believe it? We still had to wait. Then my cousins turned on some music to keep us occupied, but it didn't work for long. Then we looked over and realized how high up we were and started chatting about how scary it would be to fall. We just kept on talking. But soon after that, the staff said, “We're going to hold off for a minute to check and make sure that the @CAPS2 coaster doesn't have any mechanical problems.” That's when my cousins started to lose it. We tried to calm them down. So we all just sat down and waited. Finally, the line started moving forward again. Then we reached the top of the roller - coaster @CAPS3. We could finally see the @CAPS2 coaster. I guess at that point, time seemed to fly by, maybe because we were excited. We finally got on the ride, one of the most fun rides in the whole park called “The Mauerie.” I guess the wait was worth it. The ride went about @NUM3 per hour. It was jerky, had drops, and was a lot of fun. We were a bit patient, but did we have enough patience to get back on? I don't think so.
1478	19464	7	3	One day when I was buying a dirt bike helmet online, it stated that the shipping would take three days. To me, that didn't seem very long. When the third day arrived, I was eagerly waiting on my porch for my helmet. Then, my mom broke the news to me that my helmet got stuck in @LOCATION1 and it wouldn't arrive until next week. After she told me, I thought that I just had to be patient. So, during the next week, I went to work with my dad. After the week was over, I was sitting on my porch waiting and I almost dozed off when a @ORGANIZATION1 truck pulled up and delivered my brand - new helmet. It was a test of my patience, but in the end, I got what I wanted.
1479	19465	7	3	One time, my friend was waiting for me. I stayed in the bathroom for a whole hour, taking my time. My friend waited patiently, though they couldn't wait much longer. When I finally got out of the bathroom, I said, “Thank you.” They replied, “Anytime.” I was really surprised by their kindness and patience. It made me realize how important it is to have patient friends in life.
1480	19466	7	3	When it was @DATE1 @CAPS1, I was extremely excited and could not wait for @DATE1 to open my gifts. My mom and dad gave my sister, my second sister, and me money so we could buy things that we liked. Just like they usually do. I remember I wanted to buy a cute pair of cumformin boots and I couldn't wait to open them on @DATE1. I was jumping up and down, @CAPS2, and asking if we could open one gift. It was @DATE1 @CAPS1, but my mom and dad said no, and I got really mad. So, the next day, I woke up on @DATE1. It was above @NUM1 in the morning, and I looked in the living room. No one was up, so I had to wait until my parents woke up. I was so impatient and the time seemed to drag on forever. That was a time when I just couldn't wait. It taught me that sometimes waiting can be really tough, especially when you're excited about something.
1481	19467	7	3	I think that patience is about calmly waiting instead of hastily rushing things. If you are patient, things will actually come faster than you think. For example, if you want something and you have to wait in line, instead of running off and finding something else, just patiently wait. It will always help. Be patient with whatever you're doing. Just be patient even if it's waiting at school for things to even out. If you're waiting for a game at the STEM center to start, have patience and wait because it might keep you out of trouble. Be patient with whatever you're doing. Even if you're waiting for a turn, just wait. It's not a big deal. Stop rushing things and just be very patient. Patience is a virtue that can lead to better outcomes in various situations.
1482	19468	7	3	ì@CAPS1 on @CAPS2, where are you?î @PERSON1 said in a frustrated undertone. @CAPS2 was supposed to pick @CAPS1 up and take him over to his house. @PERSON1 had just gotten a new trampoline and they were planning on bouncing all day after school. @PERSON1 was starting to get worried but he patiently waited. Finally, his mom came and told him that @CAPS2 wasn't coming. That's when the phone rang. @PERSON1 answered it and heard @CAPS2 on the other end. ìSorry, @PERSON1,î @CAPS2 croaked. He didn't sound well. ì@CAPS2,î @PERSON1 shouted into the phone, ì@CAPS2, @CAPS2 where are you?î  ìI'm at my house. Get over here. @PERSON1's mom quickly pulled up at @CAPS2's house and let him out. @PERSON1 didn't care about manners at this point, so he opened the door and marched straight to @CAPS2's room. @CAPS2 was laying in bed, looking up at the ceiling with his face looking very swollen. He turned to look at @PERSON1, held his gaze, then looked back at the ceiling. @CAPS2 wasn't at school that day either. He went skiing up at his family cottage. I wasn't patient when I was in the air. I got crushed and none of it would have happened if I had waited. This shows that impatience can lead to unfortunate consequences.
1483	19469	7	3	One time I was trying to be patient was at my dad's house. Our power had just gone out, so we figured we'd wait up to two minutes, just like it always happened. After a couple of days, we still didn't have power and I became impatient. On day three, we called the power company and found out there was an issue with the power lines ahead. They fixed it and we got our power back. Patience is important in such situations as getting frustrated doesn't solve the problem.
1484	19470	7	3	There are two reasons why I think patience is important. The first is because if you are not patient, then you can end up distracting other people around you. For example, if you finished your @CAPS1 test early and you kept loudly telling everyone else to hurry up, it's very distracting. Now that you've interrupted everyone, they have lost their train of thought and now they might have to start over. A few weeks ago, my sister and I were out walking my dog. The dog pulled so hard that my little sister fell over and the dog ran away. We had to be patient and wait for him to return. My sister kept wanting to go call my mom to tell her the dog ran away again, but I told her it would be rude to call because it would distract her from her work. Another reason why patience is important is because if you are not patient, you can get hurt. Let's say you were going down the stairs and your sibling was in front of you and you needed to get downstairs quickly, but they were walking down the stairs very slowly. So, if you pushed them, they could get very hurt. In conclusion, patience is needed always and cannot be forgotten as it helps in maintaining good relationships and avoiding unnecessary harm.
1485	19471	7	3	ì@CAPS1,@CAPS1 ,@CAPS1î the clock was counting down. ì@CAPS1,@CAPS1,@CAPS1î So close, come on, I whispered as the clock kept ticking. My heart was beating like a race - car engine. I could hear my heart pounding, boom, boom. My mind raced with thoughts of what I was going to do. Should I jump in the pool, watch a video game? So many options. What should I do? ì@CAPS1,@CAPS1 @CAPS1î I could almost hear the pool calling to me, ìswim, swim swimî. What should I do? I looked at Mrs. Sprowl then back at the clock, then at Mrs. Sprowl again, then back at the clock and at Mrs. Sprawl. My heart was almost jumping out of my body with so much anticipation. ì@CAPS1,@CAPS1,@CAPS1 ì Almost there,î I said as I stared at the second hand. ì@CAPS1,@CAPS1,@CAPS1î So close, I said, so close. Just @NUM1 second left then I can swim in my pool. ì@NUM2î I almost jumped out of my seat and yelled ì@NUM3î@CAPS2,@CAPS2,@CAPS2îwe have some announcementsî said Mrs. White. I was happy and I quickly ran outside to wait for my dad so I could have the freedom to do what I wanted. Anticipation can be tough, but soon enough, I'd get to enjoy my time.
1486	19472	7	3	I was patient the whole entire time. I put on a happy face on the outside, but deep inside, I really wished I could have gotten a better score. It was a bit disappointing, but I knew I'd just have to work harder next time.
1487	19473	7	3	"As a child, my mom always told me to be patient. Well, I couldn't always do it. That's why I'm writing this about her. My mom is very nice, cool, wealthy, and most of all, patient. As many things as I did as a child, and still do some now, my mom just calms herself down like we didn't even do anything. It's kinda funny how much patience she has. Along time ago, I remember spilling grape pop on her new carpet! Wow, how scared I got. I think I even wet my pants! Instead of hiding it like any other kid, when she got home, I cried and said, ""I wasted pop on your carpet, don't get mad."" She replied in her soothing mother - loving voice and asked me to clean it up. I passed her a dry towel and smiled, saying, ""Just remember this time I'm a kid and I can't reach the sink."" Without yelling, she walked upstairs and wet the towel herself. I stayed downstairs looking at the big purple mess I made, trying to help my mom. She said, ""Just sit down,"" holding my hand. By this time, momma got done with the stain and I was fast asleep on the couch. My mom gave me a kiss on the cheek. She didn't wake me up! The gig was up soon as she picked me up. ""Is that you?"" I said in my morning voice. My mom being so patient. ""What's for breakfast?"" I asked in a high - pitched voice. ""I will get on it,"" she said while taking out my breakfast. I love my momo. Her patience has always been a great example for me."
1488	19474	7	3	"One year, we went to @ORGANIZATION1. It was about two weeks before school started. That day at the school by @ORGANIZATION1, since it had just opened, there were no lines to wait in. We couldn't have picked a better day. Then when we got on the ride, I didn't want to go on it, but my mom said, ""Nothing will go wrong."" I said, ""Fine, I'll go on the ride."" We were about to take off going up the hill and right when we got to the top, the ride stopped. I was freaking out at first but then I got over it. So we had been up there for about @NUM1 min or @NUM2 and we had to be patient. My mom and dad were on the inside of the ride area. We were sitting on bicycle seats which were not comfy. So then another @NUM3 min passed by and now we had been stuck at the top for @NUM4 mins. That was where we had to be completely quiet and patient. Then the ride started and we got down to the bottom and finished the ride. They gave us a pass for us to cut in line on the @CAPS8 force. That is all they gave us. So we had fun the rest of the day, but through that experience, I learned in life you have to have patience, and it can turn a potentially bad situation into a still - enjoyable one."
1489	19475	7	3	"Once upon a time, there was a princess named @ORGANIZATION1. She was invited to a royal ball where she awaited her handsome prince. As her carriage arrived, she stared at the people before getting out. Finally, she stepped out of the vehicle. @ORGANIZATION1 gracefully walked down the red carpet. As she arrived, the noise level increased. The princess finally approached the opened doors. The beautiful girl walked to her throne and watched the village people dance around her. @PERSON1 sat for two hours. She wondered, ""Will he show up?"" and ""Will he like me?"" She doubted her luck. The princess grabbed the microphone and said, ""Hello! Hello! Does anyone know where my prince is?"" ""Anyone?"" A complete silence went over the crowd. Finally at the last minute, an anonymous voice cried, ""I am the prince!"" A sigh of relief came over her. He said, ""I'm so late. I fought a dragon and a thousand knights to get here to meet my love!"" ""Awwwww!"" The crowd said softly. And they lived happily ever after, a perfect ending to a fairytale."
1490	19476	7	3	The one time I was patient is when my mom took me to go get my birth certificate so I could play football. When we got there, the parking lot was full. I mean, the cars were so close that you could hardly get in and out without scratching someone else's car. My mom parked across the street. When we got in there, there were at least @NUM1 to @NUM2 people. People were standing so close to each other that you could almost know their body temperature. The bench was full of people and they were packed like sardines. It was hot and smelled musty. We picked a ticket with @NUM3 on it and they were on @NUM4. We waited for two hours. My mum wanted to leave. When they got to our number, I was asleep. While we were in there, I felt like I lost ten pounds. In the end, though, we got the birth certificate, and it was all worth the wait for me to be able to play football.
1491	19477	7	3	I'm not a very patient person. I always whine and complain about little things. If being patient means you stay somewhere for a whole while without complaining, then I guess there are some times when I've been patient, but only if there is a friend there to keep me occupied. One time, my mom was at the hospital for a long time, about @NUM1 hours. My friend @PERSON1 was there, and we hung out together, chatting and joking around. It was actually a lot of fun. We ate in the cafeteria place, munching on sandwiches and fries. We stole some milk for no reason, and totally forgot that my mom was there. I didn't complain once. Then we got yelled at by a nurse and had to go back to the waiting room, but it still wasn't too bad. That was one of the few times I've been patient, and I don't know if it counts since I was with somebody. It just goes to show that having a friend by my side can make waiting a lot more bearable.
1492	19478	7	3	"@CAPS1!"" I yelled as the ball came over the net right to me, my voice filled with eagerness. ""That was @CAPS1!"" @CAPS2 said, looking a bit flustered. ""@CAPS3 I was already there."" I responded firmly. ""@CAPS4. @CAPS3 it's @CAPS1."" @CAPS13 argued, crossing her arms. ""@CAPS5 I said @CAPS1, you... Moved and let me get it then wimp @CAPS6 me. And watch the ball drop,"" I exclaimed, frustration in my tone. ""@CAPS7 I guess."" @CAPS2 apologized, looking a bit sheepish. This was at volleyball tryouts where I had to be patient and work together. ""@CAPS9 is @CAPS10 @CAPS11!"" the A team coach demanded, his voice booming. ""@CAPS12 partner up in groups of three!"" @CAPS13 said. My two best friends Sam and @PERSON1 were already together with this new girl, who was pretty good at volleyball. ""You want to be partners with me and make?"" @CAPS14 asked, smiling. ""@CAPS15,"" I responded. When it was our turn on the @CAPS11 we were going against @CAPS16, @PERSON1 who spiked it at us. Katie missed the ball totally. The new girl, @PERSON1 and @CAPS16 all cheered. ""@CAPS18! Very nice job ladies!"" One of the coaches praised. It was the end of the second @DATE1 tryouts. There was only one more @DATE1 left. It was hard for me @CAPS3 I managed to keep together and patient. On the @DATE1 of tryouts we got to know our teams. We all got envelopes and opened them up at the same time. Me, @CAPS16, and @PERSON1 plus some other good girls made the A - team! So that's a time where I had to be really patient and stay together, @CAPS3 I still came through and succeeded, which shows that patience and teamwork can lead to great results."
1493	19479	7	3	Once upon a time there was a boy named @PERSON1. Well, he was right and he was at the secretary of state office. He tried to be patient so he walked in and took a number from the machine and got his paper from the woman at the front desk. He sat down and started filling it out. The numbers were being called out slowly, and he could feel his impatience growing. It was only on @NUM1 and the counting seemed so slow, so he was getting angry! Time passed by and there were still a few people in front of him. They left to go get their secretary cards. Finally, the person in front of him was up and the lady behind the desk opened up and called @PERSON1. He greeted her with a polite smile. She took his picture and he got his licence. In the end, even though it was a struggle to be patient, he managed to get what he needed, which shows that patience can pay off.
1494	19480	7	3	I was patient when my dog had to go to the @CAPS1. He was really sick because he had heartworms. My mom and I just waited for about two hours. I was not as patient as my mom because I kept asking my mom what was going on, every few minutes. After the operation was done we had to wait even longer until we got my dog back, almost @NUM1 hours. We sat in the waiting room, looking at the clock anxiously. After the @CAPS1 called us we went and got my dog. The doctor said that he had to rest until he could be up and moving. Finally, it was okay and we played in the snow all @CAPS3 long. My dog seemed so happy to be out and about again, and it made all the waiting worth it. It taught me that being patient in difficult situations can lead to good things.
1495	19481	7	3	AHH! Oh hi my name is @CAPS1. I'm going to tell you how I waited @NUM1 @NUM2 @CAPS2 to do something sweet. Ok I heard about this awesome but scary place called the @CAPS3 @CAPS4! Me and a few friends of mine @PERSON2 and @PERSON1 plan to @CAPS7 there in @DATE2. So far me and them have been just doing the ordinary. Waking up, taking a shower, getting dressed, going to school. Today @DATE1, we are going to my parents’ house and going online to see when it opens. We found out in two days the new location will open up. It is near the parlor and down the road of @ORGANIZATION1. So we check it out and it's nearby so we are so ready to be screaming like a baby when it gets its bottle taken away. Today is the day we are on the road but what we did not realize was how many people would be there. When we got there it had at least @NUM3 people waiting! We sat in line and about every @NUM4 minutes the line decreased by @NUM5 people. Then finally about @NUM6 and a half @CAPS2 of waiting we were in the to @NUM7. It was just our luck too, @NUM1 people were not patient enough to wait but we were respectful. Then @PERSON2 had to go use the rest room so we walked across the street so he could go. Then when we came back we ended up in the top @NUM9! We waited another @NUM10 then we were in! By the time we were done @PERSON2 was crying (he is @NUM11!) @PERSON1 wet his pants (he is @NUM12!) and @NUM13 and I didn't do anything. We had one heck of a night but it never would have happened if we were not so patient. Our patience allowed us to have this amazing experience, and it's a memory we'll cherish.
1496	19482	7	3	Patience is an important virtue to possess. It helps you and others respect yourself. If you are not patient, things will only deteriorate. My cousin is an avid @PERSON1 fan. She desperately wanted tickets to his concert. However, when the tickets sold out online, she was at a loss as to where else to obtain them. She saw on the news that they were giving away tickets on the morning of the concert. Eager to be first in line, she arrived at @NUM1 am. To her dismay, there were still at least two hundred people ahead of her. She had to endure several hours of waiting in line until she could reach the ticket booth. Finally, when she reached the front, she successfully got her tickets. She remained patient and did not utter a single complaint. Later that night, she scored fifth row seats, close enough to see the sweat on @PERSON1’s face. This incident clearly shows how being patient can lead to a favorable outcome. Maybe if my cousin hadn't been so patient, she wouldn't have gotten the tickets. Patience will take you a long way, especially when trying to gain respect. My cousin has inspired me to be a more patient person, and perhaps I will get concert tickets someday too.
1497	19484	7	3	"When I went to the game with @LOCATION1, @PERSON1, and his mom and dad, I had a great time. @PERSON1 has Down syndrome. He is an enthusiastic fan and loves to watch games. He enjoys cheering the players on while they are playing and giving them high - fives after they finish. I didn't laugh at him; instead, I thought he was a pretty cool guy. He likes to talk a lot about things like sports or cartoons. I never made fun of him when he talked, walked, or made funny noises. He considers everyone his friend, and indeed they are. When standing in line, he doesn't move very much. He yells when @DATE1 port has the ball and is heading for a touchdown. He gets mad when @DATE1 port doesn't have the ball and the other team scores. I comforted him, telling him that we will get it next time. He replied, ""Yeah, I know that."" He likes to go onto the field to watch, but they won't let him on yet. So I encouraged him to be patient, and he eventually calmed down. When the game was over, his mom took us to @LOCATION1 house. We sat in the car, chatting and having a good time. She didn't get mad even though we had to sit in an hour - long traffic jam. After all that, I realized what patience truly means."
1498	19485	7	3	Are you patient? Well, I am always patient. I'm going to tell you about a time when I was patient at school. One day, I had to register for school. The place was extremely busy. I had to wait in each line for at least ten to fifteen minutes. When I finally completed all my paperwork, I had to take my ID picture. After taking the pictures, I went to get my ID. All of a sudden, it came out, but my eyes were closed. So I had to wait in the line again to take more pictures. Then I went to get my other ID. I waited for a very long time, about twenty minutes. My second ID came out messed up. The lady told me that when I start school, I will get the correct one. This is a time when I showed patience in my life, and it taught me that patience can help us deal with unexpected situations smoothly.
1499	19488	7	3	A time when I was patient was during last @DATE1. My friends and I were excitedly waiting in line to get an autograph of the Detroit Tigers @NUM1 baseman @CAPS1 @CAPS2. It was going to be an exciting experience to meet the players. We stood there, chatting and sharing our anticipation. As the line slowly moved forward, we kept our eyes on the players, imagining getting their autographs. After what seemed like a long while, we finally got our turn. We got the autographs and then left. This was a day when I was patient, and it made the experience of meeting the players even more memorable.
1500	19489	7	3	"I was patient when I went to the doctors. When I went with my mom, we patiently waited for a long time. It felt like an eternity, but in reality, it was just about @NUM1 hour. Then, when the doctor called us back to the room, we waited for another half - hour. I was getting a bit impatient and asked my mom, ""Why did it take forever?"" My mom calmly replied, ""Because there are other people before us."" ""Oh,"" I said, and I understood. I realized that patience is necessary in such situations as everyone has their turn. This experience at the doctor's taught me the importance of being patient in daily life."
1501	19490	7	3	"One day I was a patient visitor at a water park, and I was eager to get on a water slide. But there were like twenty people in front of me. At the same time, it was extremely hot. I felt that the ground was scorching hot if you had no flip - flops on. But, I really wanted to get on this water slide no matter what. So I stood there patiently to get on the water slide. Then I said to myself, ""This better be worth it, or I'm going to be furious."" But it's okay, I'm gonna be patient about it. I hope I have fun on this ride, and when I finally got on, it was really exciting."
1502	19491	7	3	I was patient last year when I was taking a long - awaited test and it was not done yet. I hate being patient, and when I am, it is incredibly boring. Periods of patience seem like they take forever. And then people just start getting headaches from the long wait, and then you get in trouble by your mom or dad or teachers for talking too much while waiting. That's why I don't like being patient as it brings so many discomforts and troubles.
1503	19492	7	3	Patience is when you can wait for a long period and not complain. I don't think I have very much patience. I think patience is like waiting in a line for hours and not caring because you are very patient. In fact, everything takes patience, like playing games, driving a car, eating slowly, waiting for a bus, and even being at school all require a lot of patience. So, patience is an important quality in our daily life.
1504	19493	7	3	Every school year I wait patiently for the summer vacation. It feels like an eternity waiting for the summer, but it is worth it. The summer vacation allows me to relax, travel, and do the things I like. So, despite the long wait, the anticipation makes the arrival of the vacation even more enjoyable.
1505	19494	7	3	"Hi, I'm John Smith. I have green eyes, blonde hair, and I have a good personality. Okay, so I'm going to tell you about a time when I was focused. Okay, so it was Tuesday last year, around June 15th, I think. My mom and I left for a doctor's appointment. So we left around 3:30 p.m. after school started. So when we got there, I was just waiting for like two hours, bored out of my mind. I didn't know what to do, so I saw the fish tank. I was watching the colorful fish for about half an hour, doing nothing. Then finally, the woman at the counter desk said, ""John Smith."" Then I knew it was our turn. So we went into the room and I layed on the bed. I went to sleep on accident, but while I was sleeping, they gave me a painful shot. It hurt so bad. Then I woke up, and that was the time ""when I was patient"", and I learned that patience can sometimes lead to unexpected pain but is still necessary."
1506	19495	7	3	One time when I was being patient, I really wanted to get a @ORGANIZATION1 last @CAPS1. I specifically asked for a @ORGANIZATION1, and my @CAPS2 just said maybe. So, I waited throughout the whole year. Deep down, I knew I would get one, but I just had to keep waiting. And you know what? Eventually, I got a beautiful blue @ORGANIZATION1. On top of that, it came with @NUM1 new goues. During the long time I waited, I was going a little nuts because I was so sure I was gonna get the @ORGANIZATION1. But when I finally received it, I was truly glad I had been patient. The wait was definitely worth it, especially considering how much I had really waited for my @ORGANIZATION1. It just goes to show that patience really pays off.
1507	19496	7	3	ì@CAPS1  @CAPS1 @CAPS1!! ì@CAPS3 @ORGANIZATION1 while quickly running down the stairs in excitement. ì@CAPS4 have to get this cool new book! It looks really, really good. Please, please, please! ì@CAPS4 have to do errands before @CAPS4 go.î replied @ORGANIZATION1ís @CAPS1 in a calm voice. ì@CAPS6 you are patient @CAPS4 can get the book.î persuades her @CAPS1 gently. @ORGANIZATION1, who wants the book badly, replied ok and they went to do errands. First stop, they drove to the gas station to fill up the car. Then they went to the post office to mail some letters. After that, they headed to the car wash to clean the car. Finally, they made their way to the grocery store. At the grocery store, @ORGANIZATION1 helps her @CAPS1 shop by pushing the cart and grabbing items from the shelves. All day, @ORGANIZATION1 was incredibly patient and didnít complain even once. ìThe last item on the list is pasta for dinner,î @CAPS8 @ORGANIZATION1ís @CAPS1. ì@CAPS7 I canít seem to find it.î ìIíll go find it.î @CAPS8 @ORGANIZATION1 who was eager to get her book. @ORGANIZATION1 looks down every aisle carefully until she finally finds the pasta her @CAPS1 wants. When @ORGANIZATION1 finally finds her @CAPS1, she is in the checkout line. When the cashier is done ringing all the items, @ORGANIZATION1 and her @CAPS1 go to their car and unload the groceries. When they get to their house, @ORGANIZATION1 forgot about the book until her @CAPS1 came over to her and gave it to her. @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS8 her thank yous and then realized it isnít hard to be patient. This experience taught her that patience can lead to great rewards.
1508	19497	7	3	I was patient when my mom went to the doctors because she was having a baby. I had to wait in the quiet waiting room for @NUM1 hour. As I sat there, I looked around at the other people in the room. Some were reading magazines, while others were just sitting quietly, lost in thought. I tried to keep myself occupied by looking at the pictures on the wall and imagining what my new sibling would be like. Time seemed to pass very slowly, but I knew I had to be patient. Finally, after what felt like an eternity, the doctor came out and told me that my mom had a healthy baby. I was so happy that my patience had paid off. It made me realize that being patient in difficult situations can lead to wonderful outcomes.
1509	19498	7	3	Patience, itís something that my family doesnít have. Here is the story. While I am doing the dishes, my little brother, @CAPS1, is crying loudly because my little sister, @PERSON2, hit him. So, since @CAPS1 is crying, @CAPS3, my other little sister, starts to cry as well. Meanwhile, my step - dad is sitting on the couch, playing on his iphone. I can tell he is getting annoyed and is going to yell at @CAPS1 pretty soon. And what do you know, he does. He raises his voice and tells @CAPS1 to stop crying. Okay, you think itís going to get better? Nope, youíre wrong. I manage to get @CAPS3 to stop crying. But @CAPS1 just wonít stop. So I call @PERSON2 in here, and then @CAPS1 gets to hit her. This makes the situation even worse, and my step dad starts to go crazy because @CAPS1 is still crying. Now @PERSON2 is being a brat and stomping up the stairs. It takes a while, but finally, when @CAPS1 and @CAPS3 got calm down. Now just as I am about to go crazy myself, @PERSON1 (my older brother) comes in and takes  @CAPS1 downstairs to calm him down. Thank @CAPS7, for @ORGANIZATION1. Then I calm @CAPS3 back down. What a day. Well, I guess my family does have a little bit of patience, well, not my step dad. But it shows that even in a chaotic situation, some of us can find the patience to handle things.
1510	19499	7	3	We all have our times when we are very patient, and the times when we lose all patience we have. Well, yesterday, I was very patient with my sister, @PERSON2, who throws tons of fits and is very bratty. I donít know what it is that ticks her off so much. She gets very mean and violent. Hereís the story. We were walking home yesterday at a leisurely pace. Everything was going fine, and we were chatting about our day. When we got home, mom told us we had to clean. Well, our room was already clean, and I wouldnít let @PERSON2 go up to clean it because there was no need. She then screamed at the top of her lungs and started crying hysterically. @MONTH1 I remind you, sheís ten. She stormed up the stairs in a huff and she was on the phone with her. ìfriendî @PERSON1. I calmly told her to hang up because we had to clean. Yet again, she screamed. So our sister, @ORGANIZATION1 got @NUM1 and firmly said to knock it off, hang up the phone, and clean. Then @PERSON2 made us listen to @PERSON1ís  text messages. Iíll admit @PERSON1 wasnít being very nice. So we told @PERSON2 to not answer the phone. We werenít yelling; we were being very calm and patient. She was still screaming, so we just left her alone to scream. Then, our mom came home. @PERSON3 and I told our mom what had happened in detail. Then our mom told @PERSON2 she is grounded, no longer allowed to talk, text, or even talk to @PERSON1 at school. My mom also thanked @PERSON3 and I for being so patient. So that is my story about how I was patient. Iím not the most patient person, but I have my times, and so should everyone else. Life is so much better in the long run if you are patient! It helps avoid unnecessary conflicts and makes the home environment more peaceful.
1511	19500	7	3	A time when my @CAPS1 was patient is today last week and yesterday. My @CAPS1 was so patient today as I was late for school and there was a rather slow - moving man about to cause a bit of a hold - up, but he was hesitant. Still, @CAPS1 was patient enough to wait and not go in front of him or blow the loud, irritating horn. The next time my @CAPS1 was patient is when I was in a basketball game. My @CAPS1 was outside waiting for me and the game went into overtime, so she just waited until I came out of the building. The last time my @CAPS1 was patient is when we were in Subway. I ordered a cold cut and it took about one minute until I got my food. I was so hungry that I could hardly feel my tummy. So, in conclusion, there were several times when my @CAPS1 showed great patience.
1512	19501	7	3	As we walked in, the strong smell of mouth - wash filled our noses. We walked to the front desk where a short little lady with gray hair and glasses greeted us. “@CAPS1, take a seat in our waiting area and your dentist will be with you shortly.” said the lady at the counter. We walked to the waiting room. My mom and brother sat on the waiting couch and I sat in the little tan chair in the corner. My brother got some papers and crayons while my mom was looking at a magazine. But I was wrong. Fifteen minutes went by and my mom and my brother were still doing the same thing while I was looking around the room, bored out of my mind. I kept asking my mom when the dentist would come but @CAPS4 just told me to be patient. About twenty minutes later, I was about to lose it. I could no longer understand how my brother could just sit there and color for twenty minutes. I wanted to ask my mom when the dentist was going to come, but @CAPS4 would just tell me to be patient. I got up and started pacing back and forth. After five minutes of that, my mom told me to sit down and find something to do. But there was nothing I could possibly do that could entertain me. Finally, when I was about to go crazy, a little lady stood in the doorway. “@CAPS3, for your appointment.” said @CAPS4. I got up and followed her to a small room, happy that the long waiting was finally over.
1513	19502	7	3	Being patient is waiting quietly for something to happen. A lot of times, you have to be patient for a lot of things, such as long lectures, birthdays, and orchestra concerts. Sometimes, no matter how patient you are, the thing you have been waiting for does not happen, and you'd have to leave without doing what you wanted to do for the whole time (and that has happened many times with me). For long lectures, sometimes you get the strong urge to leave. You have to be patient and wait for the lecture to end. For birthdays, you really want to dig into the cake. But, yes, you do have to wait until your annoying sister finishes blowing out the candles and makes her wish. I am part of the orchestra, and we have an orchestra @ORGANIZATION1 about every two months. The first @ORGANIZATION1 is an open @ORGANIZATION1, and they are usually in @NUM1. Last year it was the @NUM2. At the end of the @ORGANIZATION1, there is a cheese - cake sampling station, along with cookies, donuts, and all these delicious cakes. But first, I must endure playing through many pieces, watch the beginners play, and deal with the video camera that might videotape my face, waiting for a mistake so some annoying person can laugh at it and call me an “epicfail”. But I still manage. Playing the piece isn't so bad; it's just some pieces of paper with notes. Watching the beginners play might be torture, but at least I don't have to play. Video @CAPS1? No pain at all. Who says I'm going to mess up? All I have to do is to sit in the back row, and my mom might not even see me. My sisters might not even care. And then soon comes the cheese cake, at around @NUM3 at night. That is the good part, but to get to the good part, I must be patient. I'm not really looking forward to this year's @ORGANIZATION1, on @DATE1, because on that day I have a final cross - country meet after school. Where all five middle schools come together for a big district meet at a place called @CAPS2 @ORGANIZATION2. After that meet, my parents have to bring me to that @ORGANIZATION1 at the high school at @TIME1. The @ORGANIZATION1 closes down at @NUM4, like always, and I am hoping I'm not going to get any homework. But if I do, I'll just have to be patient. That day is like any old day. @NUM5. I'll have to wait until school ends, the meet ends, and the @ORGANIZATION1 ends to go home, but I can manage. All that is on my mind is to live through the whole school year, patiently, without messing up or failing badly.
1514	19503	7	3	Even though you @MONTH1 may not know @CAPS1, there is patience all around us. You @MONTH1 may not even realize you're using patience, like when you're in a line or waiting for something, but you are. Here is a story of when I witnessed patience. One day, on a hot @DATE1 day at Wilder Point, we decided that we were going to go to the water park. As soon as we got there, we jumped into the first pool and I waited for my dad. After a while of playing, we decided to go on one of the water slides. @CAPS1 was the main water slide at the park. @CAPS1 was so big that you had to take @NUM1 flights of stairs to get to it. But after I went down it, I knew it was worth the wait. In the end, patience paid off and I had a great time at the water park.
1515	19504	7	3	My story is about a time when I was patient, which was in (@DATE1). I was waiting for “@CAPS1” to come. I was being patient because we were going to @LOCATION2. I couldn't wait to go but I remembered to be “patient”. The less I thought about it, the faster time passed by. Then it came; it was time to head to “@LOCATION2”. When we were in the car on our way there, I couldn't wait any longer! More and more roads passed by. We passed from city to city; state to state. It was the next day already and I still couldn't wait. During the long ride, I fell asleep. When I woke up, we were already there. I had to show patience because riding in a car from @LOCATION1 to @LOCATION2 is a long drive. While being patient, I got to see many beautiful landscapes and travelled through different states. In conclusion, being patient during that long journey allowed me to enjoy the process and reach my destination.
1516	19505	7	3	Patience is something that most people don't have. In the bustling pace of daily life, patience often becomes a scarce virtue. In the story I'm about to share, patience was something that I desperately needed. If I didn't have patience in the story, I truly don't know what I would do. This is my story. A couple of years ago, I was picked up from school as usual. My mom was supposed to take me straight home, but she suddenly decided that she wanted to go grocery shopping first. When we arrived at the grocery store, she asked if I wanted to come in. Thinking about all the reasons why I didn't want to, like the stuffy air inside the store and the long aisles of products, of course I said no. I sat in the car when it was at least @NUM1 @CAPS1 outside. The heat was almost unbearable, and I was sweating within just ten minutes of waiting in the vehicle. My mom still wasn't out of the store. There were so many times where I felt the anger rising inside me, but I didn't let myself get that way. I even saw people come in and then come out before my mom got out of the store. It was at least two hours before my mom had finally come out. I wasn't mad at her. I just understood her reasons and accepted her apologies for being late. Most of the time I am not a patient person. Actually, I am never patient for situations like that. I was so glad I was patient for this story, as it taught me the value of self - control and understanding.
1517	19506	7	3	Sometimes on days when I have @CAPS1 patience at @CAPS2, I have to really control myself so I don't just go off on someone or totally say something mean to them! It's like a battle inside me to keep my temper in check. Like @DATE1 actually we are going camping up in @LOCATION2. We always go for about a one to two hour hike. And when we do, we go to lake @LOCATION1 but just before that to get there we take an “adventure hike,” so my dad calls it! This so - called adventure takes you through the thick woods and over or even through the river. But there are two ways you could take; a five - minute hike straight to lake @LOCATION1, or an hour to two - hour hike through the woods and over logs. And on days when I have @CAPS1 patience at @CAPS2, and just want to get straight to lake @LOCATION1 we always have to go the long way around! And everybody hates it by the time we get to the lake, because I will just complain and complain some more! (@CAPS3 sometimes I get annoyed at myself!) @CAPS4 on the way back it's more fun after we go swimming in the @CAPS5 cold water! (@CAPS3 my dad says it clears my head! But it really doesn't!) And by the time we get back, we are ready to have dinner, but dinner isn't ready yet. @CAPS4 I get to be in a bad mood… again! And have to wait some more. It's clear that I need to work on my patience during these outings.
1518	19507	7	3	Two years ago, my two - year - old cousin @PERSON1 was adopted from @LOCATION3. My aunt, uncle, and cousin had to endure a long and frustrating wait. They had to wait three years before they could even see a picture of her and start doing the necessary paperwork. The people at the orphanage were not being very fair to them. They let almost @NUM1 people who had tried to adopt a child a year later after my aunt and uncle tried go first. It was really disheartening for my family. They had to go all the way to @LOCATION3 from where they lived, which was @LOCATION1, and wait three days until they could just see her. The orphanage made them wait another week to adopt her. Finally, after all that waiting, they adopted her and named her @PERSON1. They went through more paperwork, signed all the documents, and promised that they would always take care of her, and then went home. After that, @PERSON1 didn't sleep at all the first week or so. Since @LOCATION3 is @NUM2 hours ahead of @LOCATION2, her body clock was all messed up. She would sleep during the day and wake up at night. But my aunt and uncle patiently taught her to sleep during the night. That girl took a lot of patience, but she was finally adopted, and now she is a beloved part of our family.
1519	19508	7	3	The time I was patient was last @DATE1 when we went to the cedar point. When we went to cedar point, there was a long line at the entrance of the ride we wanted to take. The excitement was building up as we inched forward in the line. When we finally got to the front of the line, the machine broke. @CAPS1 we had to go to another ride. I was really looking forward to that first ride, but I knew there was nothing I could do. And I couldn't wait @CAPS1 long because I had to go to the bathroom @CAPS1. So I walked out of line and went to the bathroom. When I came back, there were more people in line. The line seemed even longer than before. But instead of getting angry or frustrated, I just waited. I told myself that it was all part of the experience, and eventually, I would get to enjoy a ride. In the end, my patience paid off, and I had a great time at the park.
1520	19509	7	3	My dad @PERSON1 is patient everyday. He goes to work and can't wait to come home, but he doesn't go crazy like me because I always want to leave early. No, he does his work with dedication and waits till @NUM1 when he can leave and go home. Every day at work, he faces various tasks and challenges, but he remains calm and focused. He always patiently waits till @NUM1. My dad has always been a patient person, and I look up to him because of that patience. His patience is like a guiding light for me. It shows me that with patience, we can handle difficult situations and achieve our goals. I hope that one day I can be as patient as my dad.
1521	19510	7	3	I was at the great wolf loge, and we were really looking forward to jumping into the pool. However, we could not go in because some careless kid had pooped in the pool. A big part of the pool was disgustingly brown. As a result, we could not go in for three long hours, and it was incredibly boring just standing around. Then we decided to go outside, and surprisingly, there was a pool there the whole time. We finally got to enjoy a swim and made the most of the rest of our day.
1522	19511	7	3	A time when I was patient, I have been patient plenty of times, but one instance I mostly remember is when I was waiting for a friend to get home from school (I missed school that day). While waiting, I did plenty of things to pass the time. I played my Xbox for a while and then got on the computer. But while on the Xbox, I saw one of my friends from Moures, @CAPS1, come online. After he got online, we played for most of the day. Then I got off and watched @CAPS3 because I was bored. Nothing interesting was on, so I got back on the computer, still feeling bored. So I tried to take a nap, but it didn't work. After that, I tried to play my Xbox again, but after another hour (around @TIME1), I got bored. I still played for about another half - an hour until I just redid my account while listening to music and played some more until he got online again. We played all day until night, and it was a long but fun wait.
1523	19512	7	3	"My friend @PERSON1 was patient last week in the lunch line. He waited about @NUM1 minutes. I got to the cafeteria quite early, before many of the other students were in line. He was standing behind the @NUM2 and @NUM3 graders. @PERSON1 was patient by not cutting in front of them and didn't complain at all. The line was longer because there was a presentation first, and then it was lunchtime. The @NUM2 and @NUM3 graders didn't have lunch yet, so that was why @PERSON1 had to wait. I thought he did a good job waiting. When many students were filling up the tables, I quickly saved @PERSON1 a seat next to me. @PERSON1 finally got his lunch and I saw him go over to the @CAPS1 and milk cooler and grab an orange @CAPS1. I waved to him across the room and he saw me. When he came and sat down next to me, I told him he did a good job being patient and waiting to get his lunch. I was almost done with my macaroni and cheese when @PERSON1 said, ""Thanks for saving a seat for me."" When we both finished, we took care of our trays and walked down the hall to the gym. We were glad we didn't have to be in that loud, crowded cafeteria. In the gym, other kids were playing a small basketball game. @PERSON1 grabbed a basketball. I waited until the @NUM2 graders were done, being patient as the teacher then told the younger students to go back to class. When I got the ball, I asked @PERSON1 if he wanted to play around the world, which was one of our favorite games."
1524	19513	7	3	"Boom! Boom! I knew my cousins were at the door because they were all heavy - handed. So I quickly ran down the stairs and opened the door, and it was really them. Then, we all got into the van. My mom said, ""You all ready to have some fun?"" We replied, ""@CAPS1!!!"" It was so boring in the van, but I had to be patient. After we got to Ohio, we stopped and got some food. After @NUM1 minutes, we got back into the van. When we got to [destination] point, we were all excited. I thought it was going to be a good day, but I also knew that it was going to take some time and patience. Next, when we got into the park, we all went straight to the reptor. It was a half - an hour wait. This was going to take a lot of patience, so we waited and waited. When we got on and off, we realized it was worth it. Then we got on a lot of rides, but the best one was the diagster. When we got to the van, we all said it was fun. Then I realized I was very patient throughout the whole day, and it made the experience even better."
1525	19514	7	3	One day, me and my friend @CAPS1 were going to @CAPS2 to Alabama. It was the most boring thing ever! Imagine just driving in a car for @NUM1 hours, just driving and stopping to use the bathroom. And to make matters worse, I had the smallest bladder there, which was as annoying as I can imagine! But we did find a little fun in counting waffle houses because the farther south you go, the more people like waffles. I'm not kidding; there was at least one waffle house every few miles. And a kind of twist was that we weren't just going to Alabama; we were going to the @CAPS5 of Alabama. So when we finally arrived at the general area, we still had to wait @NUM2 more hours. But when we finally got there, we had a blast! And I have to admit one good thing came from this experience: long car rides don't bother us as much anymore, and it was all worth it for the great time we had in Alabama.
1526	19515	7	3	I am going to tell you about a time when I was patient. My young cousin was at my house and was really struggling with his math homework. Because no one else was home, I took on the responsibility to help him. We sat comfortably on the couch, and I began to assist him. The reason I had to be extremely patient was because he didn't know how to do any of the problems. So I had to sit there patiently and teach him step - by - step how to do each one, and then carefully explain how I got the answer. And did I mention that he had three full pages to complete. It was almost two hours of focused work before we were finally done with it all. And that was a time when I had to be patient, and I'm glad I could help him.
1527	19516	7	3	@CAPS2's father has recently lost his job. It has been a really tough time for the family. It has exactly been @NUM1 since @CAPS2's father has had a job. @CAPS2's father has been constantly and diligently applying for jobs. Despite facing numerous rejections, he didn't give up. He kept on trying and trying with unwavering determination. Fortunately, @CAPS2's father has a job interview in San @CAPS1 in a couple of weeks, and he is looking forward to it. Hopefully, he will get the job. Thankfully, @CAPS2's father has been very patient throughout this difficult period. Even though he is being rejected constantly, he still tries very hard to get a job. @CAPS2's father is @CAPS2's role model because of his amazing level of patience. Thank god, I have someone to care for me who is as patient as @CAPS2's father. Without the patience of @CAPS2's father, @CAPS2's family would be in a very difficult situation. Well, job or no job, I will always love @CAPS2's father. This would be true because of @CAPS2's father's great level of patience. For that main reason, that is why @CAPS2's dad will always be @CAPS2's hero and number one beloved role model.
1528	19517	7	3	"Patience is a very difficult thing for some people. One time I was at a huge and noisy party. But none of my close friends or cousins were there. I was extremely bored the whole time. I politely asked my mom if we could go home, and she firmly said ""no"". Then I sat down quietly and waited and waited for a really long time. I tried to find something to do to pass the time, but it was still tough. Then finally, after what seemed like ages, we went home. The next day, my mom sent me over to my cousins' house for a sleep - over. This was because I was being patient at the party. I learned that being patient isn't always a bad thing. You receive good rewards when you are patient, and this experience taught me the value of waiting."
1529	19518	7	3	Melay was a little girl, nervously waiting for her parents in the @CAPS1 bush. She didn't know why she had to wait there. Her parents seemed so distressed all the time now. “It must be something I did,” she thought. Her sister was not as patient as she was while waiting. Her sister had to be doing something all the time. So when her parents didn't come and somebody else did, she wasn't happy. A group of boys came walking along the road where they were hiding, carrying @NUM1's. Melay was thinking, “These are boys waiting along the street. Are they crazy!” But their parents always told them to hide for a good reason. She sat quietly in the bush thinking about this when she heard a loud crack! “What was that?” she thought. She looked to where her sister was supposed to be and she wasn't there. “Where was she?” As she looked out, she saw the boy soldiers were standing around laughing. “What were they laughing at?” She looked closer and saw that it was her sister. “No!” she cried out. “Where are my parents? They should be here by now,” she thought. The boy soldiers were walking towards her. That's when she saw another two lifeless and depleted bodies. She found out that it was her parents. She started running, running away from the tragedy. She made it about a mile before she had to hide. She hid in a bush. The boy soldiers were walking around looking for her. Suddenly one cried out, “There she is!” They dragged her out of the bush, and walked for what seemed to be forever. Finally, they reached a building. Melay was screaming at herself, “If only I had waited differently.” They took her into a room, and the boss raped her. Then they quickly shot her to death and dragged her into a dumpster. If only she had waited in a better way.
1530	19519	7	3	I remember this hot @DATE1 day I was on my way to the @CAPS1 / orthodontist. I left school because it was the second - to - last day, and I left school about forty - five minutes early. My appointment was at @CAPS3 @CAPS4 - thirty. So when I arrived at the @CAPS1, there were about @CAPS4 people ahead of me. So I sat there patiently. And @CAPS4 - thirty passed, so I went across the street and ordered @PERSON1 @CAPS14. After having my @CAPS14, I bought some gum. It was now @CAPS15 on the dot. I was still waiting, so I went up to @CAPS16 @CAPS17, the front - desk manager, and asked how long it would be until I go in. She said she would go check for me. She came back and she told me I could go right on in. I felt so happy for myself for being so patient, and I got a tooth - break as a little bonus for being patient! This experience made me realize the rewards of patience.
1531	19520	7	3	A time when I had to be patient was when I needed help with my schoolwork. My dad is very smart, so whenever I needed help, I usually asked him for it. Well, I get out of school at @TIME1, and my dad gets home at @TIME2. So, if I wanted his help, I would have to wait. At that time, I didn't understand why I had to wait. I just left the homework that needed help in my backpack until my dad got home, while I wished I could finish the homework that didn't need help first. After I finished all my @CAPS1 homework, then it was time to eat. As I ate my dinner, I kept waiting for my dad. By the time I was done with dinner, I was really ready for my dad to help me. It was finally over waiting for my dad to help, and I understood the homework so much more. This experience taught me the value of patience when seeking help.
1532	19521	7	3	Once there was a lonely puppy who often felt sad because he had no friends to play with. One day, he decided to send a letter to a random address in the hope of finding a friend. He put the letter in the mailbox and then waited and waited and waited, constantly looking out the window for the postman. A few weeks later, he finally got a reply to his letter, and it was from another puppy! They soon became best friends, playing together and sharing their stories. The puppy learned that patience usually pays off. This little adventure brought a lot of joy to the lonely puppy's life.
1533	19522	7	3	On @DATE1, my friend @CAPS1 and I climbed onto the bus headed for @PERSON1 at @CAPS2 @CAPS3. @CAPS1 and I were part of our church group, and we stuck together till @NUM1 am. We had been riding all different rides throughout the day, and then we got in line for the @CAPS4. The sign out front clearly said “wait from this @CAPS3 is @NUM2 hours”, but we were determined to wait it out. I was around @NUM3 then, so that would put us on the ride around @NUM4. We soon found out that @PERSON1 also had an event starting at @NUM5 p m, and lucky for us, we were standing right next to a haunted house. Around @NUM6 pm, all of us were getting pretty bored, so we played different hand - games like slide and lemonade. Every five minutes or so, we would hear loud, obnoxious screams, and it seemed like everyone around us was chattering non - stop as if in a race. Then at about @NUM4 pm, we finally got on the ride, and we all loved it. When we got off, someone said “@CAPS5 go on the @CAPS6” and all the adults loved the idea. As we walked over, I could smell the sweet treats in the air and could almost taste an elephant ear on my tongue. Little did we know that we would have to walk through @CAPS7. It was filled with evil clowns and other spooky creatures. It wasn't a good idea given that half of us were afraid of clowns. When we got to the @LOCATION1, there was a giant line, but it was only going to take forty - five minutes. The ride was over, and my head really hurt from hitting the headrest so many times. On the way to the exit, we saw a lot more spooky things. We found out later that we had waited in line for five hours. We finally got on the bus and headed home. That day, I learned that I have a lot more patience than I thought I did, and the experience was truly worth the wait.
1534	19523	7	3	A time when I was patient was when we were leaving on vacation. It seemed like I had been waiting forever to go to @LOCATION1. In reality, it had only been about a month, but the anticipation was killing me. I was so excited, but I had to be really patient. Sometimes, it's hard for me to be patient because I like things to happen right away. So, waiting a month to go to @LOCATION1 was a real challenge. The night before we left was probably the hardest. I was so excited that I tossed and turned in bed and couldn't sleep at all. The day we left, I was running all around the house, yelling with excitement. Finally, we loaded up the car and left for @LOCATION1. We drove our car there, and it took almost @NUM1 days. But it was all worth it. @LOCATION1 was really fun and beautiful. We also went to @ORGANIZATION1 and had an awesome time. At @ORGANIZATION1, there were long lines for the rides, so I had to be patient and wait. I had a really great time in @LOCATION1, and this vacation taught me that patience can lead to wonderful experiences.
1535	19524	7	3	Everybody uses patience sometimes in their life. I have to use it every day, especially for basketball. There could be a lot of different reasons that someone would need to be patient. Well, I have @NUM1 reasons in particular. My first one is when people don't pay attention. It really frustrates me. When the team members goof off, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 gets mad. She will either tell us to knock it off or make us run a couple of laps around the gym. This first issue leads to my second. The second thing that irritates me is when people don't pay attention, they get lost and have no clue what is going on. There are a lot of people who take a long time to catch on. My second reason leads to my third. My third is when somebody new joins the team. We just had two new people join the other day, and the season is half - over. The newest member of the team can hardly make a shot. She doesn't put all of her effort into it. There are only like @NUM2 out of @NUM3 or @NUM4 people that are actually good. Looking over my paper, I realize that I have to be patient about all of this. If I wasn't, I would be in trouble and it would mean I would have bad sportsmanship. I deal with it and put up with all of this. Over the years, I've learned about patience and how to be patient. I'm glad I know how to be patient now, or else I probably wouldn't be on any teams or in any clubs. Patience is truly an important quality in sports.
1536	19525	7	3	I remember a time when I was patient. It was at the doctor's office, and it was kind of hard just sitting there waiting for the doctor to call my name. The waiting area was filled with the soft murmur of other patients and the occasional cough. But I suffered through it. Instead of getting mad about how the lady hadn't called my name yet after waiting like @NUM1 minutes, I just turned my @NUM2 player on and listened to my favorite music while flipping through a magazine. The music soothed my nerves, and the interesting articles in the magazine kept my mind occupied. Before I knew it, @CAPS2 called my name, “@CAPS1” @CAPS2 said with a warm smile on her face. So I got up and went to the room @CAPS2 directed me to. When I left the doctor's office and was on my way home, I thought to myself “maybe being patient isn't that bad after all!”
1537	19526	7	3	Almost every time you need to be patient when you are at the doctor's or in the hospital. The waiting rooms are often filled with people of all ages, and the wait can seem endless. What I do to pass time when I'm at the doctor's is play I spy. I play it with my mom every time. We sit in the cozy waiting area, looking around at all the different things. There is usually a lot of people at the doctor's when I go. The room is bustling with activity, with kids running around and adults chatting softly. There are magazines, but I think they are boring. The pages are filled with old articles and pictures that don't interest me. Therefore, I play I spy to stay patient. Otherwise, I would be very, very bored. Playing this game makes the time pass much faster and makes the waiting more bearable.
1538	19527	7	3	@NUM1. Last year, I had to go to the doctor on my birthday. It was such an unexpected turn of events. So after I came home from school, I left right back out. When we got there, we had to wait in the lobby. The lobby was filled with the sound of crying babies everywhere. Their wails echoed through the room, making it even more difficult to wait. We still had plans to go to the movies and do some shopping after the doctor's appointment. @NUM2. There were still too many people in front of me. The line seemed to move at a snail's pace. I started to get mad. My patience was wearing thin, and I was getting frustrated with the long wait. Finally, they called my name. I was so happy I didn't know what to do. All my anger melted away, and I was relieved that I could finally see the doctor and get on with my birthday plans.
1539	19528	7	3	A time when someone was patient was when a guy named @PERSON2 was driving and a little girl named @PERSON1 was walking on the sidewalk, and it was a red light. The traffic was stopped, and everyone was waiting for the light to turn green. She yelled out loud “go old man!” in a shrill voice. The old man, @PERSON2, calmly went when the light turned green, and she followed him to the store. Once they reached the store, she asked what was that, and @PERSON2 said that was nothing. “No, you tried to hit me!” she exclaimed. “No, you were rushing me, so I went,” @PERSON2 replied patiently. @PERSON1 said to @PERSON2 “I was losing my patience.” @PERSON2 told her “well, learn how to control it.” Despite her outburst, @PERSON2 remained calm and tried to reason with her.
1540	19529	7	3	“@CAPS1!” @CAPS2 whined, her voice escalating into a high - pitched wail. Her face was flushed with frustration as she stamped her foot. “You can't do this to me. I'm ten!” “@CAPS2, calm down. I know you are ten, and at that, a very responsive ten - year - old. @CAPS4 @CAPS7 I have told you before, I can't leave you at the house all @DATE1. Your father and I have work, honey!” @CAPS2's mother's voice was gentle but firm. “@CAPS4 can't you just hire a babysitter? What about @PERSON3? @CAPS13 babysitted last year!” @CAPS2's mother sighed. “I know you liked @PERSON3, @CAPS4 @CAPS13 just wasn't fit to the requirements I was looking for. Besides, you @CAPS21 you wanted to be a babysitter! Why not try and help at the @CAPS16?” @CAPS2 used her well - practiced glare at her mother that @CAPS21 “@CAPS7 if!” This conversation had been held two weeks ago in the kitchen of the Fullers. The kitchen was filled with the smell of freshly brewed coffee and the soft hum of the refrigerator. @CAPS12, @CAPS2's mother, @PERSON1, was taking her to @CAPS9 county's only day care, @CAPS10 and @CAPS15 @CAPS16. The name made @CAPS2 want to gag. “@CAPS12 remember sweetie, be nice and try to help out a bit. I love you!” @CAPS13 called @CAPS7 @CAPS13 started to pull out of the driveway. The car made a soft crunching sound as it rolled over the gravel. @CAPS2 turned to face the small building. The sign above the building stated “@CAPS10 and @CAPS15 @CAPS16. A friendly and loving environment” @CAPS13 had that gagging feeling again. @CAPS13 turned back to see if @CAPS13 could spot her mother's red, battered, @LOCATION1 speeding down the poorly paved road. @CAPS4 all @CAPS13 saw was a trail of dust. Great, @CAPS13 thought @CAPS7 @CAPS13 entered through the double doors that had a picture of a big, grinning, clown. “@CAPS12, why don't you play with little @PERSON4?” @PERSON2 @CAPS21, comforting “little” @PERSON4 in her arms. Actually, @PERSON4 was seven, which @CAPS2 thought was a big enough age to not cry when someone yells at them when they've asked to play “one” for the billionth time. “@CAPS2 we need to talk.” @CAPS21 the middle - aged woman, shunning @PERSON4 to the side, “honey, you've got to understand that kids need patience and love. Heck, I remember you @CAPS7 a kid! Boy were you an attention hog!” @CAPS2 looked like @CAPS13 regretted yelling. @CAPS13 smiled and went to find @PERSON4. Maybe he'd still be game for a play.
1541	19530	7	3	I was patient about getting my phone. I had to act extra special so my mom can decide when I would get my phone. It was a @DATE4 @TIME1 and I had to go to school. Despite my excitement for the phone, I was acting very patient that morning, making my bed neatly and greeting my mom with a big smile, so my mom would think itís time for me to have my new phone. When I got home I was acting like a pleasant little angel, helping with the dishes and doing my chores without being asked. But she still didnít say it was the time to get a phone. The next @TIME1 @DATE3 I acted the same way but better, even offering to run an errand for her. I still didnít get it. I wanted to scream at the top of my lungs but held it in. The next day @DATE1 I cooked my mom some delicious breakfast, with eggs, toast, and coffee. I was satisfied that it as the day to get my phone. Nope, she just hugged me and thanked me with a smirk on her face. She was waiting for me to burst one shouting, but I knew what she was trying to do so I said your welcome, although I was feeling intense. The next @TIME1 I was feeling a little better and I was ready to improve how patient I am. So I dressed very professional\ casual and I had made my own breakfast and I was ready to impress. I ate, and I had walked to school. My mom was up when I got home and she said ì@CAPS1 on, I have to take you to get somethingî I smiled so  hard that I felt like my mouth was going to fall out. I dropped my backpack and we stopped at my friends house. I wondered what it could be. My ma said ìwait @CAPS2î me still wondering, watching her go into the house. She came out and gave me my brown shire I left at my friends house. I was so eager and now my smile turned into a fake smile. We got home and I ran straight to my room. I was doing my homework. @DATE5 the last day for the week. I didnít do anything but mop all day.  I was still being patient though. Then @DATE2 and @DATE6 I stayed at my friends house. @DATE4 my mom was up when I got up for school and she said ì@CAPS2 you can have your phone now. I hugged her tight and ran out the door very eagerly to try it out. It was all worth the wait.
1542	19533	7	3	A time when I was patient I was patient on @CAPS1. I got to open our presents at nine thirty in the morning. I had to wait and wait. So for two hours I watched television, flipping through channels and trying to distract myself. I thought @CAPS2 would be hard, but @CAPS4 I made @CAPS2 through. That @CAPS1 I thought was the funnest @CAPS4, but I lied. I think this year will be even better. That day I made breakfast in bed for my mom, carefully arranging the plate with pancakes and fruit. I actually had a lot of fun. I got my mom a couple things of perfume. @CAPS4 of course she doesnít use them, I do. I got her some candles. We got my dad a bright orange sweatshirt. We also got him some @PERSON1. It was a great @CAPS1 filled with patience and surprises.
1543	19534	7	3	One time me and my family were at @CAPS1 point over the @DATE1. My sister really wanted to go on all of the small kiddie rides with me but I didnít feel like it. I wanted to go on one of the fastest and tallest rides there. The @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4. It looked really cool with its loops and high drops. So my dad and I ran over to the entrance, but when we got there the wait time on the board said one hour and forty - five minutes. I really wanted to go on this ride but really wasnít worth standing in that long line. So when the line started moving and we were half way there the signs said @NUM1 minutes. I told my dad maybe we should do this another day. But my dad said that weíll be through soon and he told me to just watch the people on it go by and not talk. We moved up only a little and the time was still at @NUM1 minutes. So my dad said maybe we should do this another day and then we left the line to find my mom and sister. In the end, it was probably a good decision as we could enjoy other things at @CAPS1 point instead.
1544	19535	7	3	I was patient once when my dad had said he was going to give me a letter every @DATE1 because he was too far away for me to visit. He lives all the way in @LOCATION1. He told me I had to be patient because Iím not really the patient type. I guess being patient is not all that hard. For me to be patient I have to be doing something. So I get myself to rest by writing stars and drawing detailed pictures, reading interesting books, going around my mother's house to help with our animals, feeding the chickens and brushing the horses. And when he finally comes, I didnít even get the letter right away. There was some milk delivery delay on @DATE2 so I had to wait even longer. Within that wait, I guess one just has to have their mind on the thing you have to be patient about it. In the end, when I finally got the letter, it was really worth the wait.
1545	19536	7	3	I was patient one time, really patient but kinda went like this. It was @CAPS1 and my mom and I went shopping for presents. So my mom and I went to the mall and walked into target. As soon as we entered, I already knew what I was going  to get my brother, the new game @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @NUM1. It was perfect for him as he loved that kind of games. But my mom wouldnít let me buy it, saying it was too expensive. So I just bought him a target gift card for @MONEY1. I had to hide it for almost a month, putting it in a secret drawer. But I really wanted to know what my mom got for my brother and I, but she wouldnít tell me. So I  had to be patient. I distracted myself by thinking about how excited my brother would be. And when @CAPS1 came I was so surprised because my mom bought @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @NUM1 for me and my brother. It was a great @CAPS1 and my patience paid off.
1546	19537	7	3	Once my friend @PERSON1 was incredibly patient. He waited @NUM1 long months for the highly - anticipated xbox @NUM2 game @CAPS1 v.s @CAPS2. Every single day, he quietly sat around, his mind often wandering to the exciting battles and adventures the game would offer. But one day, right after school, the game finally arrived. He was overjoyed and immediately dived into the virtual world it presented.
1547	19538	7	3	The patient player. Once when I was four and my sister was two, I was out in the backyard playing basketball. My sister, being the younger one, always wanted whatever I had, and we constantly found ourselves in little tiffs. One day, as I was dribbling the ball, she came up and suddenly grabbed it from me. As we were in the middle of our scuffle, my mom, who was watching nearby, told me to just stand still and let her have the ball, saying she'd get bored and walk away. So, I stood there patiently, my eyes fixed on the ball but my mind calm. Sure enough, my sister ended up getting so bored that she just dropped the ball and walked off, exactly as my mom had said. Then, when I started playing basketball again, she ran up and took the ball once more. This time, rather than getting into another fight, I just went inside and played videogames, realizing that patience was the better option.
1548	19539	7	3	When I had to go get my check - up for my asthma, a routine appointment in a familiar setting, I found myself in the waiting room. The waiting room was filled with all sorts of things to do in case the doctor didn't call your name right away. So, I got myself busy. First, I tried my hand at crossword puzzles, which were a bit challenging but fun. Then, I spent some time looking at the fish tank. The fishes were truly awesome; there were different kinds of fish, some with bright colors and others with unique shapes. Mostly, though, I was engrossed in my book. I'm not just a reader but also a writer, and I found great comfort in the pages of my book. Finally, after what seemed like a long while, the doctor came in to call my name. I was still busy with my activities. He apologized for the long wait, and I just said it was fine. He saw all the things I had been doing while waiting and said I was a very patient and nice girl. After that, I always made an effort to be more patient when waiting for others. I loved getting those good compliments, which always brought a big smile to my face. And ever since then, whenever I see that exact doctor for an appointment, he always gives me a treat or a sticker. But to me, it doesn't really matter what the reward is. As long as I'm treating other people fairly and being patient, I know I'm doing the right thing because people will look up to me for having that patience.
1549	19540	7	3	When my mom, @PERSON1 and I went to @ORGANIZATION1, it was an incredibly fun trip. However, @CAPS1 since I had my eyes on a lot of stuff that my family couldn't afford, my mom showed remarkable patience. She's just naturally patient; I really don't know how she manages it. Anyway, @ORGANIZATION1 is a pretty big store. It's two stories tall, filled with all kinds of interesting items. As we walked through the store, my mom got a little angry with me because I kept getting mad at her. @CAPS1 even though she was really annoyed with me, she did her best to hide her anger in the store. By the time we got home, I was so exhausted that I felt like I could sleep for a solid two to three days. We managed to get everything that we needed that night when we went to @ORGANIZATION1. The next day, we had to put up our night stands. @CAPS1 I was really eager for my dad to put up our new bunk bed. @CAPS1 but my mom said that he might not get to it that day. I was practically hounding my dad to get it done. @CAPS1 when dinner time came, I was fed and my mom was a bit mad at me because I was still insisting on sleeping in my new bed that night. I eventually realized that I needed to be more patient and understand the situation.
1550	19541	7	3	A time when I was patient was when @DATE1 we drove to @LOCATION1. It was an excruciatingly long ride. The reason it was so long was that the navigation system took us on the long - winded route to Six Flags and to our hotel. I tried my best not to complain and stay patient, considering it was a day - long ride, which meant sitting in the car for almost an entire day! We got lost in @LOCATION1 for almost an hour, driving up and down the streets, looking for our cousins who were also coming. I was itching to get out and move around, to run and jump, but there was no space to do so. It was @NUM1 in the morning, and I was dead tired. We still had to find our hotel, and it seemed to be taking forever. Finally, when we reached the hotel, as I was unpacking my stuff, I realized that I had been patient for almost a whole day. I had always thought I'd never be able to stay patient for such a long time in a car, but that day, I proved myself wrong. That was the time I learned that I could be patient when I put my mind to it.
1551	19542	7	3	Not long ago I went to the pumpkin patch with my mom, my sister, my grandma, my aunt, my uncle, my @NUM1 - year - old niece, and my baby cousin. We spent a pleasant time there, wandering among the pumpkins, looking for the perfect ones. When we were done, we went to a cozy little restaurant to eat. After @NUM2 minutes of waiting patiently for the waitress, she finally comes over just to tell us she will be with us “ì@CAPS1î”. So we sat there, growing a bit restless, and waited for half an hour just to put our drink orders in. When we finally got to order our food, it took them an hour to bring it. By the time the food arrived, we were both hungry and a bit frustrated, but we still managed to enjoy the meal together.
1552	19543	7	3	Will I was patiently waiting for my little sister to arrive that Father's Day morning in @DATE1. I was so excited that I kept fidgeting in my seat. I'm not a very patient person, so when it came to this, it was so hard to sit still. I kept looking at the clock, counting down the minutes. Waiting for my turn to hold her was hard, but when she was finally in my arms, it was the most amazing feeling in my life. It's always hard having to leave her when she's calling your name. It's like a little tug at my heart, and I want to cry. I don't always get to come home to a little girl saying my name, but I love every minute I do. I always patiently wait to see her again, but it is hard if you know what I mean. It makes me cherish those moments with her even more.
1553	19544	7	3	At the @CAPS1’s office, I had an important @CAPS2 appointment. At the @CAPS2 office, I was sitting in the room, feeling a bit nervous, waiting for her to come back. Then the @CAPS1 entered the room and asked me some questions and also asked my foster mom some questions. She listened carefully to our answers. Then she left the room and went to find the other @CAPS1 and had a serious conversation with him. After a while, they came back and said “@CAPS4 you. Here goes the papers you need.” The foster mom said, “ok @CAPS4 you.” Then the @CAPS1 said to me, “@CAPS4 you for being patient @PERSON1. I appreciate that so much.” “@CAPS5 to. I’ll see you guys next time, ok.” “@CAPS5,” we said, “bye.” And with that, we left the office, feeling relieved.
1554	19545	7	3	Patient people are the people that tolerate life's little annoyances. If you're not patient, you won't get through things very well. I learned this when I was little. There was this thing I really wanted, and I was so eager to go and get it that I was about to drive myself there. But just before I got out the door, the phone rang. My @CAPS2 picked up the phone, “@CAPS1 oh hi @PERSON1 no not busy @CAPS6 did not! no!” and the conversation went on for so long. Every minute that passed, I kept getting less and less patient. I started tapping my foot and looking at the clock. I finally burst out, “@CAPS2 @CAPS3’@CAPS4 @CAPS5!” @CAPS6 said, “hold on @PERSON1 I'm on the phone, I'm not gonna take you now!” and walked away. That's why patience is important. It helps us avoid unnecessary outbursts and disappointment.
1555	19546	7	3	In the @DATE1 time, my mom had planned a wonderful trip for us to go to @LOCATION1 for two weeks. We were on our way to the airport, and there was heavy traffic. The cars were barely moving, and we were trying so hard to work through it, but we could not. My mom started getting really stressed and yelling in frustration. I told her just to calm down and that we would make it. I tried to distract her by talking about the fun we would have in @LOCATION1. So finally, after what seemed like ages, we got to the airport. There were a lot of people there, rushing around. We had to quickly find our way through the crowds and check - in. Finally, we made it to the boarding gate. I taught my mom that being patient and staying calm will help you get where you're going. So finally, we made it to @LOCATION1, ready to start our two - week adventure.
1556	19547	7	3	"A time I was patient was when I was at a dentist office. I had a rather daunting task ahead as I had to get six teeth pulled. When we were waiting in the somewhat cramped waiting room, I kept anxiously asking my mom, ""When are we going? When are we going?"" Finally, when they said ""@CAPS1"", I nervously walked into the room. I timidly asked if it was going to hurt, and they reassuringly said, ""You won't feel a thing."" The doctor then carefully put a tube on my mouth and gently said, ""Close your eyes and breathe."" Without even realizing it, I fell asleep from the gas. I was asleep for two hours. When I groggily wanted to get out of the chair, they firmly said, ""No, no, no."" So I sat there, feeling a bit dazed, until @NUM1 minutes later they let me out. I was all loopy and had to be put in a wheelchair. When I got to the front desk, they kindly let me take two toys, and my mom gave me a wrestler toy. When we were about to leave, my mom started talking to the doctor, and they took forever. When we got in the car, my mom took the wheelchair back, and we were off. During the ride, my mom told me I couldn't go to school that day because of my teeth. She said not to look in the mirror, but I couldn't resist and did. It was a bit of a shock. I had to wait three hours for food and drinks, so I was really thirsty. When she finally said I could eat, I was so happy. I am still patient because the doctor said that grown - up teeth would come in a few months, but it has been two years and nothing. So I am disappointed, but now I have to be patient and wait for my mom to take me to get braces, which is gonna hurt really bad, but I'll bear it."
1557	19548	7	3	On a fine @DATE1 day, I was slowly heading toward the @CAPS1 office. I was in a rather gloomy mood as I really wasn't pleased. I secretly hoped that the sun wouldn't let the time pass so quickly and that we wouldn't get there. But unfortunately, time went on and we arrived. When we got inside the somewhat busy office, my mom briskly went to the check - in lane while I just plopped down on a chair. When my mom got done with the check - in, she sat right next to me, and we started waiting. And we waited and waited. The minutes seemed to drag on. We waited for about @NUM1 minutes until the @CAPS1 finally came and called us in. Right when we got into his office, a nurse came in. She carefully checked my temperature, listened to my heartbeat, and did other routine checks. When she was done and left, we continued to wait. We sat there for @NUM2 minutes before the @CAPS1 finally came in. When he finished examining me, we checked out and left. I sincerely hope that @CAPS2 don't have to go there again as the long wait was quite tiresome.
1558	19549	7	3	"When I was in the @NUM1 grade, I was tasked with putting a mobile set up. I carefully started the process, but unfortunately, when I was trying to adjust one part, it broke. I was a bit disheartened but decided to move on. Then we went to the park. I had to wait for the ""shag"" (maybe it was a particular event or a friend). After that, we went to the ice - making area. I had to stand in a line of people. It was a bit crowded and a bit boring waiting. Then when we finally got there, we paid them our money. After that, we went ice - skating. And then that was all we did that day. Then we went back to the house. We first tried to build our mobile again. After that, we played both outside and inside the house. It was an eventful day with its share of setbacks and fun moments."
1559	19550	7	3	"My friend and I were excitedly waiting to go on a new ride at @CAPS1 front. The ride was called ""Cold Shooting the Cat"". Since it was a water ride, we knew it would be a lot of fun, but the wait was excruciating. We waited for over @NUM1 hours to go on it. It was so boring as we just stood there in the long queue, watching the time pass slowly. Finally, after that long wait, we got to go on the ride. After that, we went on the ""Cowrcscrowe"" (perhaps a roller - coaster). It was a thrilling experience full of twists and turns, and it was really fun. Even though the wait for the first ride was long, the overall day at the place still had some great moments."
1560	19553	7	3	One early @TIME1 in @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1, I participated in a @ORGANIZATION1 skating competition. I was on pins and needles, waiting to hear if I made it to the @DATE1 part of the event. I had given it my all during the competition. It was seven in the @TIME1 when we left the rink. We were all hungry, so we went to get a bite to eat at a nearby diner. After we were finished, we went back to the rink. My best friend @PERSON1 also was in the same event I competed in. I had full confidence that she would make it to the @DATE1, but I wasn't sure about myself. After an endless and nerve - wracking wait, they were about to call out the people who made it. I kept repeating my number over and over again in my head, as if that would somehow make them call it. They called @PERSON1's number, and I felt a pang of anticipation. I was still waiting for my number to be called, but they never did. I had not made it. I was extremely disappointed, but I knew that in the world of competitions, there are winners and losers. I realized I had to accept it and use this as motivation to do better next time.
1561	19554	7	3	@CAPS1, @CAPS1 is a huge part of life that is sometimes hard to grasp. While you encounter problems and obstacles, they actually mold you into a good person. To have @CAPS1 means to persevere and to get the job done, even when the process is long and you might have to wait. For example, I need to have @CAPS1 all the time, especially for activities like football, hockey, and all the other active things I do. As you know, adults probably possess more @CAPS1 than teenagers like myself. For instance, if I were to sit in my blind with my father all day, like he does, it never seems to happen. Now, when I become more grown - up and an adult, I'll hopefully have way more @CAPS1 and be able to sit in the blind all day with my father. I also have to say I'm getting better with @CAPS1 because my dad constantly preaches to me about it. @CAPS2, hopefully when I'm a grown adult, I'll be able to have some good @CAPS1 like my dad, which will surely benefit me in various aspects of life.
1562	19555	7	3	To say really, I'm not a very patient person, but there was once a time when I showed patience, though I don't really know how. I was waiting in line to pay for some earphones. I adored those earphones; they were blue, my favorite color. So, I was waiting. @NUM1 minutes passed, then @NUM2, and then I lost track of time, but I knew it had been a long while. Then, the cashiers were having trouble with the registers. So, I waited longer and longer until some people were called to try and fix it. Then, I had to wait even longer. I guess I stayed in that line for more than an hour. I really loved those earphones, but as much as I desired them, I just couldn't wait any longer. I angrily said “@CAPS1” and put the earphones aside and left the store. I was really mad that day. Two weeks later, we came back, and luckily, the earphones were just where I put them. Yesss!! This experience taught me that sometimes patience can pay off, even if it seems impossible at the moment.
1563	19556	7	3	One day, my mom was really patient. We were outside chatting with each other. My grandma and grandpa called to see if we wanted to go to their house. Of course, my mom cheerfully said “yes”. So, I went and packed some things to take because they don't have much there. So, when we hopped in the car, turned on the radio, and everything seemed fine. It was fine for five minutes until traffic was backed up in my neighborhood. I was okay at first, but then I got a text saying my cousins were over there. I was so mad, but my mom calmly kept her eyes on the road. I kept on screaming and saying, “Mom, go faster!”, but she simply ignored me. It was like my words went through one ear and out the other. Then, I got a text saying we were gonna be playing football in like @NUM1 min. He asked me when I was gonna be there. I said “I don't know”. Of course, my brother was already over there because he spent the @TIME1. It was a frustrating @TIME1. I was still trying to tell mom to hurry up, but she didn't listen. So, then I decided to ignore her. That didn't work because she didn't talk. So, I fell asleep at @NUM2. I thought I'd be asleep forever, but I woke up at @NUM3 in the same spot. I was devastated. I yelled out the window and said “why”. Then I went to bed again. When I was sleeping, I felt the car go faster. The traffic was all gone, until we turned the corner and got stuck in traffic again. I asked my mom how much longer, but she didn't reply. So, I screamed it again and she yelled back “here”. I looked out the window and we were there. And I got to play football. Then I heard my mom laughing in the house. I don't know why she didn't talk. Maybe she just wanted to see her mom and dad. I never found out. That was the time my mom was patient, and it showed me the power of remaining calm in difficult situations.
1564	19557	7	3	Awhile back, my friends and I made a @CAPS2 game called “@CAPS1 n go @CAPS2”. I had just taken a great sniping position. I had a great angle in all but one direction. The great thing about this spot was that everyone walked past it to get around in the woods. Usually, it didn't seem to require any patience. That's the part I was wrong about. I ended up waiting over twenty minutes until I saw one of the people that were playing. I aimed my weapon and fired. According to the rules, he was now on my team and under my command. We waited for a while before another player was seen walking close to us. Then my partner got up to fire his weapon at the other player and got shot. He didn't notice me when I crawled away from him, so I was safe. The only problem now was that I needed a new place to @CAPS1. @CAPS6, I found one quickly. Again, I was waiting for over twenty minutes. Finally, I saw another player and got ready to shoot. When I finally picked up my weapon from the ground, the person was gone. This made me pretty mad since I had waited so long and didn't have a single person on my team. I got up and went looking for someone for my team. I was losing my patience and getting frustrated. “Is anyone even out here?” I whispered. “Gotcha! I got you @CAPS9!” someone shouted from above. Then @PERSON1 jumped down from a tree. He told me that the whole time he was watching me. He was waiting for me to get close enough to shoot. This whole time he was waiting with just enough patience to shoot every single person one by one, which clearly shows the importance of patience in this game.
1565	19558	7	3	One time, I was really excited about getting a cool @CAPS1 game; it was sooo awesome. And my mom said we will get it on Fri. It was @DATE1, and I was so eager for her to get off work. And she got home and said we'll go on Saturday. I was a little mad, but then I thought, “But how cares”. Anyway, we got the game on the next Saturday. I couldn't believe I was patient. This experience made me realize that sometimes waiting can be worth it, and learning to be patient can lead to getting what you want in the end.
1566	19559	7	3	A patient person in my life is my mom. Specifically, my mom, Aicason, is patient because she always drives me to various soccer - related events. Whether it's soccer practice, games with friends, or just getting me home, and other places if I need to go there. Also, she spends money on our soccer activities, our hobbies, and other things we need or sometimes just want. She is never irritable and is always kind when we're sad or angry, and she takes a lot of time to do stuff for us. Whenever we're having trouble in school, she helps us study. For example, she spends @MONEY1 on our sports every year, and that's not including additional things like gear, uniforms, and team - related stuff. An example of her driving us places is that she dedicates about an hour, even more sometimes, to driving me and my brother to places like cross - country meets, soccer games, and basketball practices. She also helps us with our homework @CAPS1. When I needed help with a test, she stayed with me for exactly @NUM1 hours. Also, whenever I do bad in school, she just encourages me to do better, though she's still a little discouraged because she wants me to do well. She also supports me being a vegetarian, even though it means making two different meals. In conclusion, my mom is one of the most patient people I know, and I'm really grateful for her.
1567	19561	7	3	A time when someone else I know was patient was when my mom was looking for a job. My mom is extremely busy. She was the president of a club named @CAPS1 - @CAPS2 for about one or two years. During that time, she had to handle numerous club - related tasks. But now that she is no longer the president, she is less busy, yet she still holds an important position that demands a great deal of work. With either position, the income was not sufficient. So, she decided to get an additional job. She started her job search by looking online on various job portals and in the newspapers and other relevant sources. She faced a tough time as she couldn't find a job that was right for her. Despite the difficulties, she never once complained. She kept on looking and looking, spending hours each day going through job listings. She continued this search for about another year until, finally, she found a job at @CAPS3.C.C. Now, she teaches a computer class for college or older people. If she hadn't been patient, she might have ended up with a job that she didn't enjoy. In the end, her patience paid off.
1568	19562	7	3	"I hate weddings. I truly love when people get married, but I hate the ceremonies. They're so incredibly boring. Especially those @CAPS18 long weddings that make people just stand there for about two hours, doing nothing. I'm not the most patient person, so that's probably why I hate long weddings. ""Do we have to go?"" I moaned to @CAPS4 mother. ""@CAPS1, it's @PERSON1's wedding and it's important."" ""@CAPS2."" I had no choice but to surrender as I put on @CAPS4 new dress and got in the car. The wedding was all the way in @LOCATION1. Usually, it takes only an hour to get there, but not this time. Our family was about a quarter of the way there when we got into a major traffic jam. ""@CAPS3 on!"" @CAPS4 sister yelled in frustration. I just kept quiet, trying to be patient. Finally, when the traffic jam cleared up, a new problem arose. The road we had to go down was closed. So much for taking the short way. We had just entered the town next to @LOCATION1 when we got a call from @CAPS4 grandma. ""@CAPS5?"" @CAPS4 mom answered. ""@CAPS7 are you? The ceremony just ended,"" ""@CAPS8. That's bad. We're in @LOCATION2, why? Has the reception @CAPS9 yet?"" ""@CAPS10, but I'm sure you'll make it in time to be there,"" ""@CAPS11. That's good. @CAPS12."" ""@CAPS12."" @CAPS13. As if on cue, we finally reached the reception. I was so happy to be there, even if I do hate weddings. ""@CAPS14 you have @CAPS16?"" @CAPS4 mom asked as we arrived home. ""@CAPS16?"" I asked. ""@CAPS17, I guess I @CAPS14, even though the car ride was kind of @CAPS16."" ""@CAPS18? You tend not to be the patient type."" ""@CAPS1,"" I said, and I was really proud of myself for being patient this time."
1569	19563	7	3	A few weeks ago, we had a garage sale and a mom - to - mom sale. I had to be patient because there were customers just driving by without stopping at the garage sale, and at the mom - to - mom sale, we had to wait patiently for people to come to our table. At the garage sale, I set up a lemonade stand to attract more customers. We spent a lot of time preparing for both sales. We had to go through all the stuff, clean it up, and price each item. Out of both sales, we made a decent amount of money, but still, we had to take some unsold stuff home and donate it. The sales were fun, but the process was time - consuming. We just sat there waiting for customers, but sometimes I was really happy when the people bought the stuff we had put up for sale. We had a great time doing a mom - to - mom sale and a garage sale! I think that we did pretty good considering all the work involved. Although we did sell some stuff, there was still some left that we had to pack up and take home to donate. We had to do a whole lot of work, from sorting to pricing, but I liked it a lot as it was a great experience and taught me the value of patience.
