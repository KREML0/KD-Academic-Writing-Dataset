1	1	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I think the effects that computers have on people are great in terms of learning skills and social aspects because they give us the opportunity to leisurely chat with friends or new people at our own pace. They also help us learn about the globe, including fascinating aspects of astronomy, and keep us out of trouble! Think about it! Don't you think so? How would you feel if your teenager is always tied up on the phone with friends, leaving no time for family interaction? Do you ever have time to chat with your friends or business partners about important things? Well now - there's a new and convenient way to chat, the computer. There are plenty of well - known sites on the internet to do so: @ORGANIZATION1, @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS1, facebook, myspace etc. Just imagine, while you're setting up a meeting with your boss on the computer, your teenager can have fun on the phone without rushing to get off because you need it. How did you learn about other countries or states outside of yours? Well, I've learned through the computer and the internet. It's a new and efficient way to learn about what's going on in our time! You might think your child spends a lot of time on the computer, but ask them some questions about the economy, sea floor spreading or even about the @DATE1's, and you'll be surprised at how much he/she knows. Believe it or not, the computer can be much more interesting than sitting in class all day reading out of books. If your child is home on your computer or at a local library, it's better than being out with friends getting into trouble or being pressured to do something they know isn't right. You might not know where your child is, @CAPS2 forbid, in a hospital bed because of a drive - by. Rather than that, it's far better for your child to be on the computer, learning, chatting or just playing games, safe and sound in your home or community place. Now I hope you have reached a point to understand and agree with me, because computers can have great effects on you or your child as they give us time to chat with friends/new people, help us learn about the globe and, believe it or not, keep us out of trouble. Thank you for listening.
2	2	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I believe that using computers will benefit us in numerous ways, such as talking and becoming friends with others through popular websites like facebook and myspace. Using computers can help us precisely find coordinates, locations, and expose ourselves to millions of useful information. Also, computers will benefit us significantly in our jobs, for example, in planning a detailed house plan and typing a @NUM1 - page report for one of our jobs in far less time than writing it by hand. Now, let's explore the wonderful world of technology. Using a computer will assist us in life by enabling us to talk or make friends online. Many people have myspace, facebook, aim, and these all benefit us by allowing us to have meaningful conversations with one another. Many people believe computers are bad, but how can you make friends if you can never talk to them? I am very fortunate for having a computer that can help with not only my school work but also my social life and how I make friends. Computers help us with finding our exact locations, accurate coordinates and access to millions of information online. If we didn't go on the internet frequently, we wouldn't know how to access websites that @MONTH1 effectively help us with locations and coordinates like @LOCATION1. Would you rather use a computer or be lost in @LOCATION3 when you're supposed to be vacationing in @LOCATION2? Millions of information is readily available on the internet. You can ask almost every question and a computer will have the answer. Would you rather easily draw up a house plan on the computer or take @NUM1 hours painstakingly doing one by hand with ugly eraser marks all over it? You're guaranteed that it would be difficult to find a job with a drawing like that. Also, when applying for a job, many workers must write very long papers like a @NUM3 - word essay on why this job fits them the most, and many people I know don't like writing @NUM3 words non - stop for hours when it could take them much less time on a computer. That is why computers are needed a lot nowadays. I hope this essay has impacted your decision on computers because they are great machines to work with. The other day I showed my mom how to use a computer and she said it was the greatest invention since sliced bread! Now go out and buy a computer to help you chat online with friends, find locations and access millions of information with one click of the button and help yourself with getting a job with neat, prepared, printed work that your boss will love.
3	3	1	3	Dear, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 More and more people are using computers, but not everyone agrees that this is beneficial to society. Those who support advances in technology firmly believe that computers have a positive impact on people. Others, however, have different viewpoints. A large number of people in the world today are using computers, some for work and some just for the fun of it. Computers are truly one of mankind's greatest achievements. Computers are helpful in so many ways, such as providing @CAPS4, news, and live streams. Don't get me wrong, too many people spend excessive time on the computer and they should be out interacting with others, but who are we to tell them what to do? When I grow up, I want to be an author or a journalist, and I know for a fact that both of those jobs involve spending a significant amount of time on the computer. One might require more time than the other, but you know exactly what I'm getting at. So what if some experts think people are spending too much time on the computer and not exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. For all the experts know, it's how many people make a living, and we don't know why people choose to use the computer for a long time. To be honest, it's none of my concern and it shouldn't be the so - called experts' concern either. People interact countless times a day on the computers. Computers keep lots of kids off the streets instead of being out and causing trouble. Computers also help the @ORGANIZATION1 locate most - wanted criminals. As you can see, computers are more useful to society than you might think. Computers truly benefit society, and we should embrace their positive aspects.
4	4	1	3	"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 I have found that many experts claim that computers do not benefit our society. In some rare cases, this might be true, but in most cases, studies show that computers can greatly help people. While nothing can truly replace talking in person, computers can come really close. Great examples are webcams or e - mail. @PERCENT1 of students who get good grades refer to reliable websites for research or to help find good books. Also, online catalogs or advertisements significantly help the economy of stores worldwide. If people were not allowed to use computers, most of the modern world as we know it would not exist. @PERSON1 said that the best form of modern communication is the computer because of the ability to write, talk, or write back at a much lower cost! Almost every single event I go to is planned on a computer through communication such as e - mail. If a student ever needs homework because they're out sick or needs help studying for a test, then they can contact their teacher through the best form of communication for them, which is always e - mail. Even the post office uses computers to get letters and boxes to people. The president of the post office, @PERSON2 said ""It would be impossible to get mail to our customers if it were not for computers telling us where a zip code is or how heavy a box is."" News outlets that tell people what is happening around the world would not exist if it were not for the modern communication abilities that computers provide us. Because information can be communicated so quickly, so can research. When the country of @LOCATION2 took a poll, @PERCENT2 of people used computers for any type of research. Of those, @PERCENT3 were students currently in school and @PERCENT4 of them have good grades. When the same survey was taken in the @LOCATION1, @PERCENT5 of people used computers for various reasons and @PERCENT2 were students who had good grades. If it were not possible for me to access documents in the @CAPS5 @CAPS6 online, I probably would not have gotten an A+ on my @CAPS7 assignment! Could you imagine if suddenly your Newspaper reporters couldn't use the internet to work on their reports? The articles would probably be @NUM1 days after the events occur. Most businesses, including the Newspaper, use the internet to advertise, shop, or read. The association of @ORGANIZATION1 reported that in @PERCENT1 of @ORGANIZATION1 used a website and of them @PERCENT5 were in good positions. The president of @CAPS8 @NUM2 imports said that they use an online catalog because it is cheaper, but they can also promote that it is to save trees, or for the customer's convenience. Small @ORGANIZATION1 can make websites to promote themselves and explain their story to potential customers. @PERSON3, the owner of @ORGANIZATION2, said that the internet saved her restaurant. If it were not for the internet, @NUM3 more people would be jobless in @LOCATION3. In conclusion, computers help everyday people and without them, most conveniences would not exist. They help us communicate around the world, assist people in researching subjects for school reports, and make the current economy better every day."
5	5	1	3	Dear @LOCATION1, I know having computers has a positive effect on people. The computers effectively connect families, contain a vast amount of information which is excellent for people's education, and are extremely convenient. Computers are a step into the future, and we should take full advantage of them. First off, the internet or e - mail will help family members stay connected. My family, which lives @NUM1 hours away by car, loves to talk with me by e - mail. This helps me maintain a close connection with my family and is just another compelling reason why we should have computers. Another reason that involves family is when the family is just sitting around and is calling everywhere just to find a particular board game. It would just be much easier to go online to find it. This way, it would be quick and effortless to find that one board game. The last reason why a computer would help a family is if a family wants to get into any kinds of activities and they need the contact number. They could just go online. On the internet, the family could find the numbers, and some useful information about it. This way, more and more families can engage in activities together. As one can clearly see, the computer is bringing more and more families closer. Another reason why the computers are good for society is in the field of education. With information readily available at the tip of your fingers, more and more people will be motivated to learn. Nowadays, people try to find things out, and all the tools on the computers enable people to get a better education. Secondly, computers are another way to attend college. If you aren't up to going to school/college because you're sick, you wouldn't have to miss anything because with a click of a button, you will have the materials needed for what was missed. Lastly, everyone knows that in @LOCATION2, most classrooms can't afford one computer. The children long for computers so much. If they were to get one, it would change so much. They would be able to learn so much more than before. The children could learn about different countries far away. As a result, computers would greatly improve the way we learn. The last reason why computers are so helpful is convenience. Nowadays, the world is extremely busy, so if we don't have to go out or talk to someone, we won't. The computer will offer the ability to conference with other people so that there would be smooth communication between work partners. With the ability to talk with another for work would make our work - load lighter. This is only one of the many reasons computers are very convenient. Subsequently, computers are convenient because you could book flights, vacations, rentals, and much more. With a click of a button, you could be on your way to @CAPS1 or a wonderful vacation. In conclusion, computers are an essential part of our lives, enhancing family bonds, education, and daily conveniences.
6	6	1	3	Dear @LOCATION1, I think that computers have a negative affect on us! How many people have access to a computer daily in America? It's @NUM1, and how many people go on for at least an hour a @NUM2. That means that @NUM3 people can't exercise and are wasting many hours. They also have the possibility of physical @CAPS1. Does that sound good to you? Think of everything you do when you write a letter. I got up and got all the necessary materials like paper, pen, and an envelope, and then sat back down. After I'm done writing, I have to put all the materials away and then put the letter in the mailbox and walk all the way back. Well, this is what I had to do. Now think how you write an email. You just sit down and move your fingers. Do you see the difference? Instead of getting a good walk to your friend's house to talk, you just message him/her. Did you know that you can literally be at risk from being on your computer? Instead of being active around with things, your computer gives away information. This information can lead to problems, and then everything you have would be gone. All this so you can go online. Believe it or not, you can physically get hurt from being on the computer too long. Another thing is that when you're at a computer, what happened to my grandpa is that when you are sitting in a wood chair all day, you can get arthritis in your muscles. In conclusion, computers clearly bring many negative impacts, and we should be more aware of these issues.
7	7	1	3	Did you know that more and more people these days are depending on computers for their safety, natural education, and their social life? In my opinion, the increasing use of computers is not benefiting society. Initially, one's safety while using a computer is at risk. To begin, when someone is talking to another on a computer, they @MONTH1 never know who is at the other end of it. For example, if a small girl was playing a game on the computer and a person began talking to her, it could be a predator. She will never know unless they meet in person somewhere. At this point, it may be too late. Moreover, studies show that @PERCENT1 of people's information is more widely exposed in the last @NUM1 years due to the new chat websites, such as Myspace and Facebook. In these websites, people share their personal information. With this, their safety is at risk. Finally, people should stop using computers as much as they are now, in order to keep their safety intact. Furthermore, enjoying nature is a must in our world full of immense landscapes, wide waters, dense forests, and lush valleys. If you depend on your computer to teach you about the world, you should cease this use. One must actually be outside, experiencing the feel of the grass underfoot, the smell of the fresh air, and even the taste of the natural environment. A recent study shows that people who actually went to the Grand Canyon could write a @NUM1 - page essay on what they had learned. The people who didn't go and simply read information off their computer could not write this much. Finally, society needs to back away from their computers and step into the real world. Thirdly, a person's social life could be ruined from the use of computers for many reasons. One reason for this could be that a person spends all their time on their computer instead of spending quality time with their family and friends. Sure, you can chat with people online, but that's nothing like chatting in person. There is no need to talk to a friend or family member online when you could do it face - to - face. Finally, if someone takes an embarrassing picture of you and puts it on their computer, it is there forever. Thus, you can lose friends, whether you're the person in the picture or the one who put the picture on. With this, you can easily ruin your family/social life by using your computer too often. How would you feel if it was your fault that someone's safety is at risk? Wouldn't you rather enjoy nature in person instead of watching it on your computer and not getting the full effect? Couldn't you talk to your friends and family in person rather than ignore them to use your computer? There are numerous ways in which the increasing rate of computer use does not benefit society. I encourage you to agree with me that computers can put one's safety at risk, decrease their education of nature, and ruin their social life. We should be more cautious about our computer usage.
8	8	1	3	"@PERCENT1 of people agree that computers make life less complicated. I also agree with this. Using computers teaches hand - eye coordination, gives people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and lets people talk online with other people. I think that these are all very important. Why wouldn't you want to have strong hand - eye coordination? I think this is a very important skill. Computers help teach hand - eye coordination and they keep it strong. While you're looking at the screen, your hand is precisely moving the mouse where you want it to go. Good hand - eye coordination is used for a lot of things; in fact, it's involved in mostly everything. If you play some sports like baseball, hand - eye coordination is one of the most important elements. Why not make that stronger off the field? Also, hand - eye coordination can be used when taking notes in a @ORGANIZATION1 class. Hand - eye coordination is involved with almost everything you do. You can't have a poor hand - eye coordination or else you won't be able to function properly. @NUM1 out of @NUM2 doctors agree that hand - eye coordination is very important for healthy living. ""I love to travel, but I want to know about the place I'm going to before I get on the plane to go there,"" said @PERSON1, a science teacher at @ORGANIZATION1. He feels the way, I'm sure, a lot of people feel. They want to know about the place they are going to and they want it to be current. The computer has plenty of information about a lot of different places in the world. Some books don't offer as much information or they need to be updated. Computers are also very good for learning about other cultures and traditions. No one wants to be ignorant, right? People want to know what's going on in the world quick and easy. The computer does this. I remember when I was about @NUM2, our phone broke in our house. We couldn't go out and get one right away either. The only way we were able to communicate with our family and friends was by computer. The computer made it easier to e - mail everyone and tell them why we weren't answering our house phone. This happens more often than you think. People need to communicate through the computer a lot. At work, if you need to talk to an employee or co - worker and you can't leave your desk, you can just e - mail the information to them. @NUM4 out of @NUM2 employees say that it is much faster and easier to e - mail information as opposed to talking to them on the phone or in person. A lot of people agree that computers make life a lot easier. Computers teach hand - eye coordination and they let you communicate with other people. The most critical reason is that computers let people learn about faraway places and people. You can make a difference in the way people feel about computers. Write to your local newspaper. It's now or never! By sharing your positive experiences with computers, we can encourage more people to embrace this useful technology."
9	9	1	3	"Dear reader, @ORGANIZATION1 has had a dramatic effect on human life. It has changed the way we do almost everything today. The most well - known is the computer. This device has allowed people to buy things online, talk to people online, and also provides entertainment for some people. All good qualities that make everyone's lives easier. Imagine you look into your refrigerator and you notice it's almost empty. Someone is using the car and you need to go grocery shopping and the store is too far. What do you do? Well, you could go on a computer and look for food online. There are many great deals and some companies even deliver for free! It's an amazing and easy way to buy food without leaving your house. But food isn't all you can purchase. Many products are sold through the computer. Need new toys for kids? Or how about a new hat for your friend? Maybe even more curtains for your room? Well, with the easy access of the internet on a computer, you can buy all those items and more. The computer has also changed the way of communication. Let's say someone wants to talk to a friend or relative that lives far away in another country. If someone doesn't own a phone or if they can't make the call, all they need to do is be on the computer. You can communicate with anyone just by using your email address. Now friends and families can talk to each other over the ease of the computer. Just type what you want to say and ""boom,"" instant communication on the chat. Let's face it. No matter what a child or even a teenager wants, entertainment is always a priority. But now with a computer, all that can change. With just one click, you could actually be watching a movie from the comfort of your own home. But what if you don't want a movie? There's other entertainment like listening to music, watching funny videos, and probably the most popular, playing games. Everyone loves to play a game every once in a while, and with the selection of thousands of online games, there isn't a person who can't find at least one game enjoyable. There are even games for educational fun that many kids love. With all the entertainment a computer can produce, who could hate it? All in all, the computer is a revolutionary device that has changed the way we shop, communicate, and find exciting entertainment. To be able to do so much with just a couple of clicks, I find that truly extraordinary. It makes me wonder what other amazing things we can achieve with this technology in the future."
10	10	1	3	In the @LOCATION1 we have the technology of a computer. Some say that the computers are good for the society. I disagree. I believe that it is bad for a few reasons. Some of the reasons are obesity, cramps, more sexual harassment, and even cyberbullying. First, if people don't get off the computers and go out to exercise, then it will cause obesity. Think of it this way. If you watch a kid that didn't have to go to school his entire life and he started off at @NUM1 pounds. The only thing the kid will want to do is play on the computer and he will gain weight steadily. Next, tip - top - tip - top, that's all you hear when a kid is on the computer. If teens come home from school and go straight to the computer and don't get off until late on a school night, these are the kids that are more likely to get bad cramps. They get the cramps from typing too fast, too hard, and for too long. They also can get the cramps from just sitting down for too long and then trying to get up but can't because it hurts too much to even move. There's also a lot more sexual harassment that is going on. Some kids go into a chat room to talk to their friends about some great news, but when they get out of the chat room they are all mad and frustrated. The reason is because someone was making inappropriate comments or making fun of them and they didn't like it. This happens maybe close to @PERCENT1 of the time that teens and even parents go into chat rooms online. This is the third reason on why computers have a huge effect on people. The last reason that computers have a huge effect on people is because of cyberbullying. Cyberbullying is when someone bullies you but just online instead. Have you realized that children become withdrawn or even sick because they don't want to be hurt or ridiculed over something very stupid? Well, I have and it's not nice. And now the bad thing is if a kid goes to school online, he/she may get cyberbullied because he's not smart enough or if he/she doesn't have the money to go to a certain school. The cyberbullying normally occurs in a chat room online. There, a family may either become broke with no money or food. They may even lose their kid's trust or the house that they live in because someone wanted to act all big and bad to be popular in school. In conclusion, these are only a few ways that computers affect people. The obesity, cramps, sexual harassment, and cyberbullying are not a joke and it's not fun to go through. Now it's your turn to tell us what you think about the computers. Do you think computers are good and benefit society or are they bad and rot little kids' brains to make their lives horrible for them to live with? We should all carefully consider the impact of computers on our lives and take steps to mitigate the negative effects.
11	11	1	3	Dear @LOCATION1, @CAPS1 people clearly acknowledge the great technological advances that computers give us, but they also unknowingly put us at @CAPS1 disadvantages. Computers have long been known to contribute to the development of various health issues. As people become more deeply in tune with the online world, they gradually tend to interact with their family less frequently. Don't forget the ever - present danger of online predators - they're truly deadly. @CAPS1 people who do nothing but sit and watch television are often referred to as couch potatoes. Those who are constantly glued to their computer screens are no better off. It is clearly stated by numerous of @LOCATION2's top medical doctors that spending too much time on the computer can cause significant damage to your health. Exercise is highly stressed by doctors around the globe, and the only 'exercise' a computer addict will be doing is typing at a rapid pace. They can easily submerge themselves into obesity. This often causes depression as the realization begins to sink in. Addiction itself is a serious health issue. I wouldn't be surprised if they add a dedicated computer wing to rehab centers sometime in the near future. These problems are slowly but steadily spreading, and we must come together as a community to abolish them! Family time is a treasured value to the @CAPS2 people, but lately, computers are steadily ruining this long - standing tradition. With so many @CAPS1 people completely absorbed with online drama, virtual friends, and even video games, family interaction is on a sharp decline. People slowly remove themselves from reality and enter an alternate world of cyberspace. They @MONTH1 only emerge from their rooms to use the bathroom and eat, scarcely getting any proper rest. This can cause great tension or deep sorrow in @CAPS1 families. Who can ever erase the horrifying stories of abduction from their memories? Online predators are highly dangerous and extremely clever. Your children could be talking to someone they believe is another teenager looking for a friend to confide in when, really, they are a forty - year - old serial killer waiting to find the right time to attack. Studies show that one fourth of online users have had an encounter with a dangerous person. We must take action to protect ourselves and our loved ones from these perils.
12	12	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I firmly feel that computers do take away from people's lives and aren't as important as the other crucial factors of life. First of all, you're well - aware that the world is becoming increasingly obese because of the lack of regular exercise. Also, people don't seem to realize that @CAPS3 warming is becoming a huge problem. Finally, families aren't as close as they used to be. These are all the compelling reasons why computers aren't essential to human society. First, the world is becoming obese, and computers play a huge contributing part in this. Computers don't encourage people to exercise; instead, they simply sit down on their couch and use the computer. This sedentary behavior won't help America get back into shape. Also, computers can easily become a habit. If a person uses a computer every single day of their life, it will quickly become an addiction, and then they won't be able to stop. Finally, when people use the computer, they don't realize the severe lack of exercise they're getting. This is the first significant reason why computers are a bad thing. Next, @CAPS3 warming is melting the polar ice caps at an alarming rate. Computers play a part in @CAPS3 warming because they consume a large amount of electricity, and then the generation of that electricity contributes to the melting of the polar ice caps. If this keeps happening, then they will all melt, and we will not have a proper shoreline, and half of the world will be flooded. Finally, computers play a huge part in @CAPS3 warming because of the fact that they are so extremely popular. This is another strong reason why computers are bad. Finally, the last reason why computers are bad is because they take away from your family life. For instance, there are more and more families splitting up now, and scientists state that @PERCENT1 of the time it's because of technology. When one person is engrossed in the computer, the other people feel that they love the computer more than they love themselves. Then they split up for good. This is the last reason why I firmly feel computers are bad. In conclusion, you can clearly see that computers are a bad thing. First of all, you can see that America is becoming obese because of the computers. Also, computers are causing @CAPS3 warming and are eventually going to flood the earth. And last but not least, computers take away from people's family life and cause them to split up and become unhappy. These are all the reasons why computers are bad, and we should be cautious about our computer usage.
13	13	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I read your argument on the computers, and I whole - heartedly think they are a positive effect on people. The first reason I think they are a good effect is because you can do so many diverse things with them. For example, if you live in Maine and your cousin lives in California, you and him could have a convenient web chat. You can see each other's faces and have a real - time conversation as if you were in the same room. The second thing you could do is look up news from anywhere in the world. You could be stuck on a plane, and it would be very boring, but when you can take out your laptop computer and go online. You can even use your computer at work and start doing productive work. When you said it takes away from exercise, well, some people actually use the computer for that purpose too. They use it to chart how fast they run, how many miles they want to cover, and sometimes even what they eat. They can keep track of their fitness goals and progress. The third reason is some people's jobs are entirely on the computers or involve making computers. For example, when you made this article, you didn't use a typewriter; you used a computer and printed it out. If we didn't have computers, it would make your @CAPS1 job a lot harder and less efficient. Thank you for reading, and when you are thinking about it again, please seriously consider my three valid reasons. Computers have become an indispensable part of our lives, and their positive impacts far outweigh the few drawbacks.
14	14	1	3	My three detailed points for this newspaper article are: first, state your opinion about the effects of computers. Second, give detailed reasons that will persuade the local newspaper to agree with your position. These are my three key ideas for the newspaper article. To begin, my opinion about the computer effects is that they are a huge waste of time. Many people waste an inordinate amount of time on computers. Take fat people as an example; instead of sitting in front of the computer, they should go out and run or engage in some form of exercise. Instead of being glued to the computer, they should go out with their girlfriend, family, or friends to have some real - world fun. So, being on the computer for too long is bad. Many kids watch inappropriate bad stuff that is meant for adults. It is good to be on the computer, but not for an extended period. You should start by agreeing with me because of my detailed points and valid reasons. My reasons are that there is a lot of base stuff like porn on the internet. Many kids watch that, and it ruins their moral values and their future. They get addicted to that kind of watching. So, for people who use the computer for good stuff, it's great, like for educational games or useful information. These are my detailed points and reasons for you to agree with me. I am going to organize my ideas well and present them clearly. It is good to be at the computer, but not for too long. Instead, go out, play, and exercise. And you can enjoy life instead of being cooped up in front of the computer. The bad things are that many kids watch bad stuff, and the computer really has a lot of inappropriate content. The computer is used for everything these days. This is how I will organize my ideas. In conclusion, these are my ideas for the newspaper. I stated my opinion on computer effects. I gave detailed points and reasons that will persuade the local newspaper to agree with me. I think I organized my ideas well and presented them clearly. These are my ideas so that the newspaper can see the real effects of computers. We need to be more aware of the negative impacts and use computers more responsibly.
15	15	1	3	Dear, In this world today, we should encourage everyone to use computers in a balanced way. Computers have a significantly positive effect on people. They effectively teach hand - eye coordination, as users need to precisely control the mouse and keyboard while interacting with the screen. They also give people the remarkable ability to learn about faraway places and different cultures. You can explore the ancient ruins of Rome or the modern skyscrapers of Tokyo with just a few clicks. Moreover, computers even allow people to talk online with other people from all corners of the globe in real - time. Today, computers are like the world's biggest and most accessible book of knowledge. Everything you need to know, from historical facts to the latest scientific research, is stored in a computer. You can look up faraway places, and in an instant, all the relevant information is right in front of you. Computers are fast and easy to use, and almost everyone can learn to operate them. Today, kids are so fascinated by computers that they are on them every day. There are so many popular websites that kids and teens frequent, like @CAPS1, and Facebook, etc. On these websites, kids as young as ten years old are chatting with friends, sharing photos, and even learning new things. There are also web - chat websites that allow you to use a webcam and have face - to - face conversations with people anywhere in the world. Computers are a great way to get in touch with people, expand your social circle, and gain new knowledge. Everyone should have a computer in their home today to keep up with the ever - advancing world and make the most of the opportunities it offers.
16	16	1	3	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, The computer blinked to life, and a clear image of a blonde - haired girl filled the bright screen. It was incredibly easy to find out how life was in @LOCATION2, thanks to the actual @CAPS1 girl vividly explaining it. Going to the library wouldn't have provided one with this priceless information and real - life human interaction. Computers are a necessity of life if society wishes to grow and expand. They should be supported because they teach hand - eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places, and allow people to talk to others online. Firstly, computers help teach hand - eye coordination. Hand - eye coordination is a highly useful ability that is used to excel in sports. In a recent survey, @PERCENT1 of kids felt their hand - eye coordination improved significantly after computer use. Even a simple task like tying can build up this skill. Famous neurologist @CAPS2 @PERSON1 stated in an article last week that, ""@CAPS3 and computer strength the @CAPS2. When on the computer, you automatically process what the eyes see into a command for your hands."" Good hand - eye coordination can improve people's performance in sports such as baseball and basketball. If someone wants to become better in these sports, all they'd need to do was turn on the computer. Once people become better at sports, they're more likely to play them and become more healthy. In reality, computers can help with exercising instead of decreasing it. Additionally, computers allow people to access information about faraway places and people. If someone wanted to research @LOCATION1, all they'd need to do was type in a search, and a vast amount of relevant information would be presented to them. It would link forever, enabling them to search through countless things. Also, having the ability to learn about cultures can make people more understanding. When people learn about others and their cultures, they understand others better and increase tolerance. Computers are a resourceful tool that can help people in every different aspect of life. Lastly, computer and in technology can allow people to chat. Computer chat and video chat can help people from all different nations get on good terms. When a story comes out about something that happened in @LOCATION3, people can just go on their computer and ask an actual @LOCATION3 citizen their take on the matter. Also, video chat and online conversation can cut down on expensive phone bills. No one wants to pay more than they have to in this economy. Another good point is that you can access family members you scarcely visit. It can help you connect within your own family more. Obviously, computers are a useful aid in today's era. Their advancements push the world forward to a better place. Computers can help people because they help teach hand - eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and allow people to talk online with others. Think of a world with no computers or technological advancements. The world would be fragmented and unified, contact between people scarce, and information limited. The internet is like thousands of libraries put together. Nobody would know much about other nations and news would travel slower. Is that the kind of place you want people to live in?"
17	17	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, I believe that computers have a negative effect on people's lives. I believe this because those who spend too much time on the computer don't get out as much as they should, don't spend enough time with their family, and the computer can't do everything. My first reason is that I believe people need to get out more. When they don't get out, they don't exercise, and that is very unhealthy. Instead of just watching the games or the scores on the computer, they should get out and play the game themselves. I also believe that they should enjoy nature because I feel like they are wasting the beautiful scenery of nature all around them. We wouldn't want to waste our abilities and privileges, would we? Another reason is that they do not spend enough time with family. If you have family near you, then you should take full advantage of that and interact with one another. You can have a great deal of fun with your family by playing games. You can also have fun by just hanging out together, which boosts your social skills. And the computer can't always achieve that, which brings me to my next point. The computer can't do everything, so take advantage of what you have now. Some computer time is fine, but it can be very dangerous by getting addicted to it. The computer @MONTH1 has lots of information, but there is nothing that you can't find in a well - written book. Your computer can't love your dog, so there is a good reason why we should get off the computer. There are plenty of other things that you can do that you can't do on the computer, including participating in sports, taking good care of family, and engaging in any of your hobbies. Remember that the computer @MONTH1 can be great from time to time, but it can not live your life for you. That is why I believe that we should spend less time on the computer, and more time getting out, and having fun with family, and that the computer can't do everything. In conclusion, we should strike a balance and not let the computer overtake our real - life experiences.
18	18	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, I must admit that the experts are certainly right cause I know people that stay on the computer all day, and that’s really not good if you ask me. Instead of being on computers learning about faraway places, and talking to other people, you should go exercising, you should relax, and you should interact with family and friends. Exercising is much better than being on a computer, and I say that to say this. When you're on a computer just sitting there playing online games and checking other things out, or whatever the case @MONTH1 may be, you get bored, and hungry, and I know there are some snacks around you while you're doing whatever you're doing. Instead of being on a computer for @NUM1 or @NUM2 hours or maybe even all day and getting fat, there are many ways you can exercise. You can take long walks in the park, you can go jogging on the track, you could play a sport like basketball or football. I mean there are a lot of things you can do when you're not on a computer. I know some people that could be working all day and still come home to their computer. Rest is good also. You don't always have to jump on your computer. You could just relax, watch a great movie, eat some delicious popcorn and just enjoy yourself. You could even take a short nap for a little while or something but you don't always have to get straight on your computer if you really don't have to use it. The way I see it is family, and computers are always going to be there but at the same time which one is more important. Friends aren't always dependable so you really don't need them around only a selected few, but that's not the point. Both family, and your true friends have feelings, and if you're not spending time with them over a computer that you're gonna have when you leave, and come back home to, something isn't right. Tomorrow isn't promised, we live for today. So enjoy life while you got the chance, and spend time doing something active, with family and friends, and if you're really into computers, try to balance your time out. By doing so, you can lead a more fulfilling and healthy life.
19	19	1	3	I agree with the advancement of technology. The advancement of technology is beginning to help find a cure for illnesses. Without technology, we would not have gone to the moon. Technology advances as we make progress. The people involved in technology are working towards the future for the betterment of life. Famous inventors use technology like Leonardo da Vinci advanced and created his flying machine. Technology is truly great. It has changed our lives in countless ways and will continue to do so in the future, bringing more convenience and progress to our world.
20	20	1	3	Well, computers can be a good or a bad thing. I don't really see how computers can be a bad thing for me. I also know that computers can or will help people all around the world. I think computers have positive effects on people like me. Computers teach hand - eye coordination. It can be extremely helpful if you need to find out research for a school project. You can create lots of amazing things on computers like beautiful music, designer @CAPS1 - shirts with unique patterns, eye - catching logos, colorful banners and lots of other creative things. With a computer, you can look up available homes and apartments in different areas. You can even go online and fill out a job application and save trips to stores. How cool is that! Well, I'm a regular person, not rich, not famous, but computers provide a lot of useful information that people use today. That's why I think that computers have positive effects on people, and you don't have to be super smart to use one. In conclusion, computers are a valuable asset that can enhance our lives in many ways, making various tasks easier and more accessible.
21	21	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 of the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 daily, I am writing you to address the issue of computers in our society today. Each day, new discoveries are made by the people who use computers in our society. However, many people say that computers are harmful to our community. Today, I am going to convince you and society that computers are not as much of an issue as some people say they are.  To begin with, discoveries in our nation have been advancing rapidly. Each day, new discoveries are benefiting our society, and they are only being made possible with the help of computers. Without computers, some cures for diseases would have never been discovered, and more people would have died.   Secondly, computers have also enhanced medical care and have often been the difference between life or death. For instance, they help in accurate diagnoses and the development of new treatment methods.   Finally, computers help speed up the production rates of cars, household necessities, and many other objects. They streamline manufacturing processes and improve efficiency.  Have you ever been bored at home on a dark, rainy, chilly night, looking for something to do? Yes, exactly what I thought. Well, the new technology advances in social - networking can even help the most bored and loneliest people and give them something to do. Even if you're just looking to talk to someone, you can easily do that on the internet. So, you people out there looking for that special someone will always have somewhere to look. With all the social networks like Twitter, MySpace, Facebook, and YouTube, you will always have something to do.  During this economic recession, it seems that finding a job is so hard. However, the internet comes to the rescue yet again. The internet can help you find a job twice, if not three times, as fast. Many people also speed up their work by using the computer. With Microsoft Office, things are a lot easier to do the work that you need to complete.  I hope that everyone can understand how much the computer helps you, rather than hurts you. @CAPS1 of the newspaper, I hope you and the rest of the community can see that computers help you more than they hurt you. Thank you very much for your time and effort that you put in to listen to me.
22	22	1	3	Dear local Newspaper @CAPS1, I think a great idea would be to take all the computers and distribute them to the people around the world so that they can stay in their houses, chatting with their family and friends. Computers are powerful tools that help people around the world connect with one another. They also assist kids in doing their homework and looking up information about what's happening around the world. By having access to computers, people can bridge the distance between loved ones and gain knowledge easily. It's a simple yet effective way to make the world a more connected and informed place.
23	23	1	3	Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1, have you ever seen a child on the computer for hours, and nothing could get them off? Well, I believe that this is very harmful for the child since it doesn't allow them to exercise, interact face - to - face with people, or use their minds to the best of their ability. As we advance more and more in society, we become lazier and forget about these essential things. I think taking a step back from using computers could benefit society more than using them.  Obesity in the @LOCATION2 is at its highest. @PERCENT1 of kids in the @LOCATION3 agree that they only exercise once a week and would rather spend time on the computer. Think of this: @PERCENT1 of kids. That's more than @NUM2 of @CAPS2 children. I took the data and compared it with @CAPS3 children who don't have the benefit of this technology. I learned that @PERCENT1 of children there exercise only once a week. That's far less. What these computers are doing to @LOCATION3 is concerning. @PERCENT2 of children are overweight, and @PERCENT3 of them develop heart or blood problems as adults. By exercise, I mean going out to play with friends, riding a bike, or going for a jog. It doesn't sound hard, does it? If we make an effort to spend more time exercising than on computers, I think we can reduce this obesity amount, and I believe @CAPS2 can run as a healthier overall country.  On the computer, we have popular websites like @CAPS5, @CAPS6, and @CAPS7. These websites allow you to interact with people from afar. This can be in various ways. These computer websites are allowing anyone to talk to people who may not have the best intentions in mind. More than @NUM3 out of @NUM4 people in my school say they have one of these accounts and have personal information posted on them. With this personal info at risk, and with these websites, the crime rate has gone up @PERCENT4. Also, these websites cause people to lose their social skills. People spend hours on these websites talking to people and forget how to talk face - to - face. @PERCENT2 of @LOCATION1 students say they would say something online that they wouldn't say to someone's face. This creates more problems in schools and could possibly make someone hurt someone else or themselves. I've heard all over the news about suicides because of computers, and I believe with less of them, people would spend more time with their family, and our nation would be closer and safer.  Computers don't allow you to explore nature and use your mind to the best of its ability. Computers make things too easy. I myself think it makes me lazier because it allows me to read a book online or read about other people, instead of going to a library and getting a book. Computers take away time to actually use your mind and solve problems in real - life situations. There have been times when I've spent hours on the computer and realized how much time has passed. I've learned I can be on the computer for hours playing games and not realize it at all. Without excessive computer use, things would be different. Kids are living through computers, and we can change this situation.
24	24	1	3	"Dear local newspaper, I've heard that not many people think computers benefit society. I disagree with that. Computers benefit society by teaching hand - eye coordination, allowing people to learn about foreign places, and enabling people to communicate with others online.  Some people were basically born with good hand - eye coordination, but most people weren't, like me, for example. But, thanks to computers, my hand - eye coordination has improved! ""On average, computers can increase a person's hand - eye coordination by up to @PERCENT1,"" says @PERSON2. Think of it, just by learning to type, your hand - eye coordination can go up @PERCENT1! That's amazing! Having good hand - eye coordination will get you far in life, and it helps with small, everyday things such as playing a musical instrument, or doing household chores. It also plays a crucial role in sports. You need good hand - eye coordination to throw, catch, and aim accurately. If more people spend more time on the computer, then the population's hand - eye coordination would increase, and who wouldn't want that?  Have you ever heard of @LOCATION1? It is a country in @LOCATION2 that not many people really know much about. By looking it up on the computer, you can become an expert on the country! The computer gives us access to a vast amount of knowledge, and it will make us more informed about people around the world. This can improve our travel experiences. Instead of going to the same place every vacation, you can go to a place you saw online that looks just as exciting. Also, by learning about other countries and the people in them, we gain respect for them. We can also learn about their traditions and culture. ""The internet gives us access to the world,"" says @PERSON1, ""we can learn so many new things that will make us more aware of people, countries, and the environment."" @CAPS1 is right, we can also be more aware of the environment. Since global warming is a problem, we can learn how to preserve foreign places by learning about them on the internet. With a click of a mouse, you can virtually have the whole world at your fingertips!  In a recent study, @PERCENT2 of people said they don't have time to meet with old friends. The internet, however, has made it quick and easy to talk to people online. Websites like @CAPS2, @CAPS3, and @CAPS4 can keep your social life intact, and can even reunite you with old friends. For example, @CAPS2 suggests family connections. You can keep in touch with many people through @CAPS2! Also, you can make new friends. Most teens say they are always willing to meet new people, and the internet is a great way to do so! Sites like @CAPS7, and @CAPS8 can help you find friends by connecting you in a chat room to a random person, just to talk. I once talked with someone on @CAPS7 for over an hour! We found that we both have @CAPS4 accounts and keep in touch there! This also helps you gain confidence because you might have the courage to say something over the computer that you wouldn't say in real life. The computer can really boost your social life.  As you can see, computers don't just ""fry your brain."" They improve hand - eye coordination, help you learn about far - away places, and enhance your social life by allowing you to talk to others. Computers benefit the society more than anyone will ever know."
25	25	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, off the bat, I believe that computers are very helpful to many people. They can be used for looking up information or talking to friends. Although many kids should be spending their time outside, the computer is a well - occupied environment that helps kids learn and interact with others.   I believe kids should have the right to stay on the computer as long as they desire, but with a reasonable limit. They should always make time to go outside, hang out with friends, etc. The computer can be fun, but it's always important to get outside and enjoy nature. For instance, going for a walk in the park or playing a game of soccer can be both refreshing and beneficial for physical and mental health.  Another reason why students should not spend all their time on the computer is because of their health. If a child gets addicted to the computer, it will affect how they interact with others and may even do serious damage to their brain. Prolonged screen time can lead to eye strain, sleep problems, and a lack of physical activity.   Although, I believe children should have the right to use the computer, it's always important to spend time outside enjoying nature. The outdoors offers a wealth of experiences that can't be replicated on a screen, like feeling the sun on your face or the wind in your hair.  Another reason why I think children should have the right to the computer is because of the information they learn and discover. Many kids grow up to have a career in computer - making or program designing. Some kids may even have their education online or use the computer to teach others. The computer is a non - stop source of intelligence, designed to help people learn, play, and discover. Many people have dreams to one day build a computer or make new programs.  All students should have the right to spend time on the computer, but they also need to save time to spend outside and with friends. Everyone has their own perspective on how they think, and whether staying on the computer all day is a good thing. I do not think kids should do this because it might affect their health and how others think of them. We should find a balance between computer use and real - life experiences to ensure the well - being and development of children.
26	26	1	3	"Do you think that computers are useless? Or do you think they could be useful in many ways? I remember back then when my older sister had to do some in - depth research on a specific historical event, the computer gave her all of the detailed information she needed. The issue to grapple with is, more and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. I strongly think that using computers does benefit society in many ways! Here's why, the computer allows you to easily get in touch with friends, thoroughly research people, places or things, and relax and enjoy playing on a fun, entertaining website! My first reason is that using computers allows you to talk to family or friends so you all get back in touch. If a friend of yours moved to a different state, then you can easily get back in touch straight from the computer. ""Using computers is nice to send emails or pictures to friends, but if you do it from the computer then it gets done so much faster!"" said Mr. Johnson, one of my neighbors. My next reason is that you can research anything you want like people, places or things and all relevant references will come up. Using computers is good to research for any projects, or school assignments you have this month. I remember when my brother was working on his project. Everything he had trouble with, he found directly on the computer! My final reason is that there are a lot of fun and exciting websites that you can relax and play on! These websites can keep you busy, and you won't be bored while playing! ""When I'm bored I go on the computer and play games, that I find on gamingzone.com,"" said my younger cousin, Lily. Computers may make people become addicted to them. Yes, but you will be learning some interesting things on how the internet works. More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. I strongly believe that they do benefit society, here's why you can get in touch with people, you can research, and play fun games! It's now or never to decide what you think! Call me and we will talk this through."
27	27	1	3	Computers are good because you can get a vast amount of information, you can play a variety of games, you can get high - quality pictures. But when you are on the computer you might find something or someone that is bad or is a virus. If there is a virus, you might want to quickly shut off the computer so it does not get worse. There are specific websites for kids, like colorful and easy - to - play games, there are teen - oriented games, and there are adult games. Also, some pictures are bad for kids because most of the time they lead to inappropriate pictures. You should only look up information that you actually need, not things like weapons or knives. Also, there are different kinds of companies like TechPro&t and CompuBest. CompuBest is a good place to get reliable computers, and so is TechPro&t. In conclusion, while computers offer many advantages, we need to be cautious when using them, especially when it comes to the content we access and the security of our devices.
28	28	1	3	Dear Newspaper, Computers are high - tech and have become an everyday essential. They play a big role in society. Computers have been improved to do many different things. Without them, we would barely get anything done. Although kids should start going outside more often, computers teach kids new things, and they are useful. With computers, kids are rarely going outside. A large portion of our population in the city are obese, including kids. Because of this, they are staying inside and on their computers. Kids need to go outside every once in a while to get some fresh air and exercise. If they limit their time on the computer and engage in some active games, it would be better for the child. Since computers are rapidly growing and adapting, kids spend half of the day just staring at the screen playing some flash game, like RuneScape. Instead of wasting their time doing that, they should go outside, take a walk, just do something! Computers teach kids new things. If you Google something like trees, you would get a bunch of well - written websites containing detailed information about trees. Kids also play games, and if they don't know it, some of the games they play are teaching them stuff. For example, my little sister goes on a site called Nickelodeon.com, and I see that it teaches her things she didn't know before. From those types of games, it prepared her for kindergarten. Nowadays, more and more sites keep adapting and becoming well - known like Bing. Computers are really useful. Suppose you want to know what's going on at work. So you click your mouse on Internet Explorer and get your email. With computers, you could go on social networking sites, like Facebook and connect with friends. You can also go on instant messaging sites to talk to friends and see what they're up to. For your entertainment, you could play games. Remember though to not stay on too long. Computers are a big deal in our community. Life would be very difficult without them. But remember not to stay on too long! Although kids should start going outside, computers teach kids new things, and are useful. In the end, we should strike a balance between computer use and outdoor activities for a healthy and well - rounded life.
29	29	1	3	Dear local newspaper, A large number of people throughout the world use, or own computers. Although there are many people who think computers are good for you, others could say different. While you are on the computer you can become more social by having in - depth conversations with friends or family. Also, while you are on the computer you may not notice it but; your hand - eye coordination is improving, and finally, you are able to search with a click of a button, instead of painstakingly searching your topic through dozens of books. Computers have very many benefits. One being chatting, or talking online to friends, and family. You may have a distant friend that you haven't talked to in a long while. With a computer you are able to re - connect with your buddy. If you have an account that is safe to chat on, you may be able to make new friends. That would be good for you, socially. It is always good to have friends, and stay in touch with family. Some people find it hard to play a piano because they cannot look at the music and have their hands be doing something else. On a computer your hand - eye - coordination improves over time because, you are searching a topic as your hands are typing. Also, this is a great memory exercise for your fingers. You eventually memorize where all of the keys are located. People without computers have to search through numerous books to find information on their topic. Others with computers, just have to type in their topic and all the information they need is right in front of them. You are able to see high - resolution pictures of your topic or even high - quality videos! Not many books that I know, can search a topic, show you pictures, and videos of it with one resource! Many people debate the fact if computers are good for you or not. If you ask me, computers are great for people. It allows people to be social, and talk to old friends; it also improves your hand - eye coordination, and finally; it gives you the option to search a topic without all the hassle of searching through dozens of books. So now the question is up to you; are computers good for people, or not? In conclusion, despite the debates, the numerous benefits of computers suggest that they can be a valuable asset in our lives when used appropriately.
30	30	1	3	Dear Newspaper People, I think that computers do benefit society for a few reasons. Computers make work easier as they can do things people can't, like solve extremely difficult problems, and kids like playing games on them. Computers make work easier and neater. Typing is often significantly faster than writing, and is always easier to read. Studies have also shown that people who use computers to do work finish faster and have up to 20% more free time to do whatever they want. Computers also have e - mail, which allows you to send work that you have done to your boss without printing it and wasting a large amount of paper. Computers can solve difficult problems that people either can't do, or don't want to waste their time doing. If you need to solve a complex math problem you use a calculator or a computer. So you don't have to figure it out yourself. I have to do a lot of math problems for homework and I think it is much easier to use a calculator. My last reason why computers are good is that kids like playing games on them. A lot of people say that kids shouldn't play computer games but some of them are highly educational. Even non - educational games help kids to have fun and have something to look forward to after their work is done. 80% of kids say that they are happier when they have something fun to look forward to, and happier kids do better work. I hope that after reading this you will understand how much computers contribute to society. In summary, computers bring multiple advantages to both work and the well - being of kids, and are an important part of modern society.
31	31	1	3	"I wholeheartedly agree that computers definitely are an advantage to our society. I firmly think this because they serve as excellent tools for us to communicate and engage in video chats with family and friends online. They are also a great asset when it comes to school work, like researching for essays or doing math calculations, or for work purposes, such as creating presentations or handling data. Most of all, they offer enjoyment for children. Now, the fun computer games help them prepare for real - life consequences, like how the game Webkinz teaches kids to care for pets responsibly. ""@CAPS1 you have a @CAPS2?"" @CAPS3 @CAPS4, my @CAPS5. ""@CAPS6, please friend request me"", I replied. Later that night, I get home and check my @CAPS2. A new notification pops up and I am now friends with my @CAPS5 @CAPS4. My entire family is on @CAPS2 and I think it's so useful for several reasons, like making plans for family gatherings and parties. I hate writing invitations, but now every year for my birthday party I just type them up, taking less than five minutes. Or, for an even simpler way of sending invitations you can even just type an email or @CAPS2 message. In fact, I just got invited to a party yesterday over @CAPS2. It's so easy, you just create an event and tag all of your friends in the note. Also, it's so easy to get @CAPS13's because you automatically get notified. Technology like this drastically makes life easier. For example, have you ever gotten something new and just can't wait to show your friends? Well, now you can, in the comfort of your own home. All you need is a webcam and you can instantly connect with one of your friends that have one too. ""@CAPS14, @PERSON1! I love what you've done to your room, the pink wallpaper is so cute!"" I said. ""@CAPS15 you! I love your hair today. It's so pretty,"" says @PERSON1. I love webcamming with my friends because you can see and hear them as if they were in the same exact room. As you can see, webcamming is so much easier than spending more time, money, and my mom's time and getting a ride over to her house. Computers make life so much more convenient. Another example of how this is so much easier is now computers help you with school work. Have you ever had to write a report? Well, now many times teachers especially enjoy them typed because many students have messy hand - writing and most kids won't like writing it anyways. Like myself, I type faster than I write and that's why I agree @PERCENT1 that computers benefit society. Most importantly, computers can help you find a good job online and even help type a great resume for you. How impressive would that be? If I was applying for a professional position of a job, I know I'll type my resume. In conclusion, that's how computers are so helpful, beneficial, important and fun to our society."
32	32	1	3	"Dear Local Newspaper, my name is @PERSON1 and I am a proud @ORGANIZATION1 citizen. I firmly believe that computers do NOT benefit society at all! In my opinion, they make our town worse. People spend an excessive amount of time on their computers and less time engaging in activities like exercising, enjoying the beauty of nature, and interacting meaningfully with family and friends. All of these negative impacts are what computers are doing to our society and it's high time to put a stop to it! First of all, people are glued to the computer way too much. Teens are constantly on social networking sites, adults are immersed in chatrooms, and kids are engrossed in playing computer games. Instead of that, people should be playing outside, breathing in the fresh air, or going for a relaxing walk in the park. Did you know that @PERCENT1 of adults are overweight? If people cut back the amount of time they spend indoors on the computer, we could probably bring that number way down. Also, who knows what teens are up to on the computer. Computers have their good aspects but they can also be a source of trouble. For example, in chatrooms, who knows what kind of people are lurking there. Children need to be extremely careful about what they say or show on the internet. Instead of playing games or chatting with their boyfriends and girlfriends, teens should go outside and get some exercise. Second, more citizens need to take the time to enjoy nature and the beautiful scenery around them. We're all so busy rushing to check our e - mail that we don't even notice what a beautiful day it is outside. On a nice @DATE1 or @DATE2 day, people should take their kids to a local park or pond. This reminds me of last @DATE2 when I went to my cousin's house. My aunt only allowed us to use the screen for one hour a day, that included the computer. We were outside every single day, even if we were just lying on the grass and staring into the clouds. This kept us active and helped us enjoy the environment. My last reason why computers are badly affecting society is that computers take precious time away from interacting with family and friends. I know what you're thinking, when you're on the computer you are talking to family and friends, but it isn't the same as face - to - face interaction. Instead of instant messaging, pick up the phone and call them. Maybe even invite them out to talk face to face. That reminds me of my sister. When I get home, she will normally be on @CAPS2. Now, instead of getting up and coming to talk to me she will text me ""@CAPS3's up?"" or ""@CAPS4 was your day?"" Computers help people communicate, but they also take away the real essence of communication. As you can see, I have given you three solid reasons why I strongly believe computers are having a negative impact on @ORGANIZATION1. Not only @ORGANIZATION1 but everywhere! You need to open your eyes and understand that people spend way too much time on computers, they prevent people from enjoying nature, or interacting with their families. Please, I'm asking you to understand that our society will face problems if we don't fix this issue. So what are you going to do about it?"
33	33	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I truly think the effects that computers have on people are really positive. Computers can be utilized for all sorts of valuable things. For instance, they are great for finding out in - depth information about history, like the stories of people who changed the world and other interesting historical facts. Computers give children the power to learn in an engaging way. There are lots of educational websites that offer online tutoring or provide good ways to help students pass school. Another positive aspect is online dating sites. You can meet new people and it can be a great way to make life even more fulfilling. Popular sites like @CAPS1, @CAPS2, @CAPS3, and so on offer a good way to keep in touch with friends from your past, or even make new ones. But the most beneficial thing, in my opinion, is going to school online. Once you're done with college and you're a nurse, for example, you can get a higher degree like a registered nurse instead of just being a @ORGANIZATION2. This kind of educational advancement is made possible with the help of computers. I firmly think computers have a positive effect on people.
34	34	1	3	Dear @LOCATION1, there is a rumor going around saying that computers are a negative affect in a child's life. I completely disagree. A computer can assist a kid in numerous ways. It can help students with their homework, enabling them to solve difficult math problems or understand complex social studies concepts. It also allows students to talk to friends, which is crucial for their social development. Moreover, it can be a great aid in school projects. And besides, most kids don't stay on the computer for an overly long time anyways. Homework is a big part of school. If you don't do it or worse, don't understand it, it can bring your grades down. That's why computers have websites that help a child learn how to do a problem or answer a social studies question if they're unsure. If you go to the school web page, then there's a link that leads you to math games. There's even a link to a science website. This helps a child so they don't get stressed out over homework. A computer also helps a student interact with friends. A social life is very important to a @NUM1 grader. This is where a computer with applications like AIM, Facebook, and even MySpace can help a kid connect with friends. If a kid got into a fight at school, they can come home and use the computer to work it out and not leave it unsettled. A computer also helps kids make new friends from other towns. Teens need to expand their social circle and making new friends will be beneficial in life. If a teen is working on a project, they can ask a friend for help. Every student gets a take - home project at some point. Instead of running out to the store to buy paper and pencils, you can stay home, save money, and type the essay. Computers can help with a social studies or a science project. You can print pictures and find detailed information. Drawing can be a hassle and messy, so using a computer saves time and avoids the mess. If there are words you don't understand, then you can look them up right away. Computers are the best way to do a project. Computers, everyone uses them, and they help our parents just as much as us. They help us with homework, let us talk to friends, and even help us do our projects! Computers are one of the best technologies we have @DATE1.
35	35	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I whole - heartedly think computers have a positive effect on people. Where would we be without them? Computers teach hand - eye coordination, which is a vital skill. They give people the ability to learn about any subject they desire on the internet. And they allow people to communicate with each other, no matter how far apart they are. Obviously, computers are highly beneficial. I think computers have a positive effect on people. They teach hand - eye coordination, as I've mentioned earlier. I know people say that when you're on the computer, you spend less time exercising, but computers can actually improve your hand - eye skills, like in some action - based games that enhance your throwing or aiming abilities. Hand - eye coordination also has practical applications, like if you want to be a surgeon or doctor. You need to have steady hands and be ready to do whatever is required with precision. See, they do have a positive effect. I think computers have a positive effect on people. They give people the ability to learn about anything they want on the internet. Say you want to be an engineer when you grow up, you might want to learn every single detail you can to be successful later on in that career. What about a doctor? You would want to know exactly how many years of college and med school are required to get your medical degree. A computer helps you learn about those things comprehensively. It can also teach you about tons of other things, from art history to space science. Again, how could they not be positive? I think computers have a positive effect on people. Another great thing they can do, out of a hundred other useful functions, is let you communicate with other people no matter how far away. Regular mail can get the job done eventually, yes, but @CAPS3 - mail is free and gets there in less than a minute, while regular mail can take weeks to reach far - off places. For example, what if you came from another country. You wouldn't want to lose touch with the people you grew up with. With a computer, you could use Skype to see how they've changed. Talking on the phone or mailing doesn't even come close to the experience of seeing someone in real - time. You could never lose touch! Computers help people do all kinds of amazing things. In conclusion, computers have a positive effect on people. They teach hand - eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about any subject they want, and allow people to communicate with each other, no matter how far away. There are no bad reasons that could outweigh any of these benefits. They make perfect sense. So, what do you think? Do you think they are good for us, or do we need less computers?
36	36	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Have you ever wondered what effect computers have on people? It is a very negative effect. Computers are one of the main reasons why kids do not exercise and become obese. They can also affect students' grades. Moreover, by being on the @CAPS6, you are isolating yourself from your loved ones.   First of all, more and more kids are using computers way more often than they should. The result of this, you @MONTH1 ask? Since computers are used daily, especially by young adolescents, it is highly likely for that child to become obese. Researches from well - known colleges, such as @ORGANIZATION2 and @LOCATION2, discovered that @PERCENT1 of kids who spend more than two hours on the @CAPS6 are obese or will become heavier when they are older. After speaking with @PERSON1, a graduate from @LOCATION1, he told me that when children spend more time on the @CAPS6, they are doing nothing but staring at a bright screen that can damage their eyes, instead of spending their time outside enjoying the beautiful weather. As a consequence, kids start to gain body fat from sitting on a couch staring at the @CAPS6 all day instead of exercising!  My second reason of why computers have a negative effect on kids is that it can harm your grades! After I spoke with a current student at @ORGANIZATION1, she told me that the reason why her grades dropped is because she is too busy on @CAPS3, @CAPS4, @CAPS5, etc. She does not focus on her @ORGANIZATION1 work like she should and because she doesn't, her grades go from @NUM1's to low @NUM2's. This shows that even ""A"" students are getting bad grades from being on the @CAPS6. Additionally, from being on the @CAPS6 so much and not paying attention to @ORGANIZATION1 work, it can affect your best grades on the @ORGANIZATION3's! This shows that by always going on the @CAPS6 you hurt your academic skills.  My last and final reason of why computers have a negative effect on children is because it harms your social skills of being an outgoing, talkative individual! Every time you log into that death - trap device, your self - esteem becomes lower because you never talk to friends or call them. You just sit on a hard chair, looking at an electronic device that is going to take you nowhere in life. Also, you are pushing your loved ones away by being on @CAPS6 @NUM3. You will end up never spending time with them and you will never call your friends to see what they are up to if you keep on going on the @CAPS6. Furthermore, if your mom or dad tells you to get off your @CAPS6, you become cranky and rude to your family just because you want to go back on your favorite electronic device. Do you really want to act that way to your family?  So, in summing up, computers are a negative effect on many young individuals, and the reasons for this are that you have less time to exercise, it harms your grades, and you are not able to be as interactive with people by being on the @CAPS6. The real question is, though, do you think computers have a negative or positive effect on people? We should be more aware of the negative impacts and use computers more moderately."
37	37	1	3	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 has been brought to my attention that some people feel that computers are bad for us. Some people say that they are a distraction to our physical and mental health. Although I can see how some people would think this, I believe that computers are a good benefit to all society. I believe this because computers can help people learn, stay in touch with friends or family that live far away, and stay organized.  Sometimes people are on the computer, learning and they don't even know @CAPS1. Simply by visiting the @ORGANIZATION2 homepage, you automatically see the news feeds of things happening around the world. Other times people go online deliberately to learn. If someone is thinking about going to @LOCATION1 then they would probably go on the internet to learn about @CAPS1. Simply by searching ""Ecuador"", many choices will pop up, like climate, seasonal weather, hotel options, and other details. But that's not the only way people are learning on the internet. Now, many college students have the option of taking their lessons online. This is because some students like the calm quietness of their own house rather than the distractions of sitting in class. Friends could be a big distraction in class, but how can you stay in touch with your friends if they moved away?   I remember in second grade my best friend, @LOCATION2, moved away. I was so sad. I hardly ever talked to her, but then one day our parents set us up on a video chat! I felt like I was right there with her! This was great, and I thought about how many people could use this to talk to relatives or friends. Another great way to stay in touch with friends and family is through e - mail. By writing a message and sending @CAPS1, it can make staying in touch so easy, and your personal wants can be shared. Chats and emails are an easy thing to send worldwide. So many people love to type on a keyboard as well, but so many different papers that you type could be lost. I, for myself, hate clutter, and I have so many school binders for papers to be lost in. This is why I take great advantage of typing my paper every chance I get. My computer keeps me organized because I could never lose my work. File save is an idiot - proof way to keep all your files in a safe place. Then all you have to do is press print to get a hard copy. I am sure that many people love using their computer for the same reason. Also, I myself am a much faster typer than I am a writer so my work is a lot neater on the computer.  As you can see, there are plenty of reasons why using a computer is good for our society. You can learn, stay in touch with friends and family, and stay organized. Many people could agree with me. Don't you think computers are indeed a valuable asset to our society?"
38	38	1	3	"Dear local Newspaper, @CAPS1 in the society we live in, more and more people are using computers, including me. The computer, in my opinion, has to be one of the best inventions ever. The bad part is that these ""experts"" think spending time on the computer is a bad idea when they fail to see the good in computers.   Students can use computers to get information on almost anything. You could use a computer to talk to friends and family members. Moreover, you can use it as a navigator to find directions to a certain location if you can't find your way or if you're lost.  One of the best things about computers is that you can find various amounts of information. This option is extremely useful for children who attend school and are looking to find information for a certain project they need to finish. You can also use the information on the computer to study if your textbook isn't helping you much. Also, if a student is looking for a job in their local area, they can look on the internet for jobs needing employees.  Computers also can be used for communication. You could have a long - lost relative you haven't spoken to in a while, and you can easily find him on the internet. Online communicating is also good for chatting with schoolmates if you forgot the homework or need help with it. I'm not a big fan of this, but online chatting can be used for online dating if you're too lazy to go out.  One of my favorite options on the computer is that you can use it to navigate to a certain location you want to go to. Let's just say you forgot where a relative's house is. You can easily type in your address and his address and easily get directions. You can use this method for almost anywhere you want to go.  If this did not convince you that a computer is a great piece of technology, then you're crazy. The computer is like a magical box that can be used for anything. So, I advise you to get one and experience the convenience it brings to your life."
39	39	1	3	Dear local Newspaper A lot more people use computers daily, but not everyone agrees that it benefits society. Those people who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on the people. I agree in some circumstances, but looking at the situation clearly, I don't agree due to the fact that it's better not spending too much time on the computers.   First, because it's useful to exercise. Taking a walk around the neighborhood or just going for a hike with people you know is a great idea. Even better, going to the gym is such a better way to spend your evening instead of sitting in front of a computer doing nothing but looking at a screen all day. Plus, exercising makes you stay in perfect shape, healthy and strong for as long as you live. A computer can just make you lethargic. Not in reality, but sitting all day only on the computer, eating when you feel like it and without any exercise, that is what's going to make you become so lazy that you won't want to do anything. I know nobody would want that for sure.  Secondly, enjoy nature. Live life the way it should be. God's creations of nature are the most beautiful thing in this world. Don't let it all go to waste. Jump off a waterfall or go to the park and let the wind hit your face. Make your imaginations become real and just enjoy what nature is all about.  Third and last, interact with your family and friends. Spend time with them and watch movies or any sports channels together. Go with them for some ice cream. Don't let them feel left out or unloved. The mall is a great way to spend time with your friends or family. Also, going to water parks like Six Flags or lake compounds, or places like Nomads or Chuck E. Cheese are great places to spend and interact with your family and friends. It can also bring you closer as well.  This is why I think sitting in front of a computer screen all day is a waste of time when you could go do some exercise, enjoy nature, or interact with your family and friends. It's a waste of time and a negative way to spend your days of living life. Technology holds you back from the real things in life.   Thank you for reading my letter and I hope you take it into consideration. Good day!
40	40	1	3	Dear local newspaper, my name is @PERSON1. I am @NUM1 years old and I go to Naylor School. I am writing to you to convince you that computers have a positive effect on people. Please read the following reasons.  Computers have a positive effect on people. You're able to communicate with people all over the world. When my brother goes on the computer, he gets to talk to my family in @LOCATION1. I like to use Skype because when we talk to family in @CAPS1.R, we use a webcam to keep in touch with my family. It's like having them right in front of you.  Computers also teach hand - eye coordination. They help me in ping - pong. I've noticed that it helps me watch the ball on the computer screen, and I can apply the same focus in real - life games.  You have lots of access to different information. My mom found a job on the computer. Everybody has access to weather or news.  Some say it's a lack of exercise. People get addicted to the computer. Some can get obese and it can mess with your love life. However, these are just potential drawbacks that can be managed.  These are the reasons why I believe computers are good for society. This is why people should agree that the advancement in technology is a positive thing. Technology keeps on upgrading, and with proper use, computers will continue to bring more benefits to our lives.
41	41	1	3	I think computers are good because you can conveniently talk to your friends and family on the computers, sharing daily experiences and keeping in touch. People need computers to look for a job as many job opportunities are posted online. However, some people spend too much time on the computers rather than on homework. People need to stop this excessive computer use and balance their time properly to ensure they can also focus on important tasks like studying.
42	42	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3: Computers have a negative affect on people and their ability to connect with others because they always are glued to the computer and rarely go outside. My first reason is that computers hurt your eyes after a long time sitting at them. People I know have complained of their eyes hurting, feeling dry and strained after using the computer. Studies show that @PERCENT1 of all people who use the computer after a long time are more likely to lose their eye sight than people who are outside all day. Another one of my reasons is people who are inside on electronics all day are less likely to have good people skills. If you don't have good people skills then you probably won't have a lot of friends and if you need them it would probably be over the computer. And you never know what they could be like in real - life. Also if you're inside all day then you will not get the proper exercise which could be very bad for you and others as it may lead to health problems. My third and final reason is that people will make fun of you if you sit inside all day and don't come out because you're on the computer. If you are on the computer you are more likely to fail in school as you don't do your homework or projects but instead your on the computer playing games. And your more likely to get into fights with your parents or guardians because you're on the computer and they never see you or hear from you. Also they won't be able to go online and pay their bills which could be bad for everyone. So these are just some of the reasons I think computers could be bad. Thank you.
43	43	1	3	The effect of people using computers isn't anything bad because you can learn a great deal from it. In some ways when you use the computer and you type, the typing exercises your fingers. Your fingers will gradually build muscle and will teach you to remember where to type without looking down on the keyboard, which is very useful for efficient typing. People sometimes find using a computer is good because if you're writing letters you don't have to use a pencil; you can just type it and print. The typing does all the work for you so you won't spend hours writing to someone. Computers are helpful to people. For example, if you're researching about @CAPS1 or @LOCATION1 you can find almost all the information on the computer with an instant click. Computers save time and do a lot of work. Computers are a helpful piece of technology and one of the best, making our lives more convenient and productive.
44	44	1	3	People are spending too much time on computers. People that spend too much time on the computer do not have time to interact with family or friends, missing out on valuable face - to - face communication. People spend too much time on the computer. The kids that spend time on the computer get bad grades. They also get tired very easily. First of all, people spend too much time on the computer. @PERCENT1 of kids spend @NUM1 to @NUM2 hours on the computer. I once spent @NUM3 hours on my computer on @CAPS1, completely engrossed. A lot of kids go on @CAPS1, @CAPS2 and iTunes. My friend spent @NUM4 hours on those websites, neglecting other activities. People spend way too long on the computer. Another reason, kids that spend time on the computer get bad grades. @PERCENT2 of kids that spend a lot of time on the computer forget to study for tests. Once I spent all night on the computer and the next day I failed a test. Kids forget to do homework too. My friend was having so much fun on the computer he forget to do his homework. Kids should get off the computer and worry about school. My final reason, kids get tired from being on the computer for so long. @PERCENT3 of kids get so tired they can't do anything once they get off the computer. I got so tired from being on the computer for so long I took a nap. @PERCENT4 of kids forget they made plans after school. One kid was so tired he blew off the plans that he made with his friends. Kids need to get away from the computer. In conclusion, kids spend too much time on computers. People spend too much time on computers. Kids end up getting bad grades because they spend time on the computer. Also, kids get tired very quickly from being on the computer. Something has to be done about this to ensure kids have a balanced life.
45	45	1	3	Dear @LOCATION1, @CAPS1, do you really think the computers don't help you with research? Well, if you really think about it, computers definitely help you. You can't always gain weight by just looking or staying on a computer. And you can definitely still talk with kids, friends, and family members on the computer. @CAPS1, do you know if books have all the information you need for a school project, or your own family history? Maybe books have our history of wars and of our heroes. Try and see if you can find the first ancestor of your family. The computers are the reasons why we know our history and know about actors, slaves, sergeants, and much more. Have you gained weight just from staying on the computer for too long? I haven't gained a pound or an ounce since I've been on the computer. Not only can you not simply gain weight or lose weight just by being on the computer. How do you know if the person on the computer is not looking for diet foods or fat - free things? Or if the person is eating while being on the computer. @CAPS1, do you get large phone bills just for a two - minute long - distance call? Why do you think we have internet websites such as myspace, facebook, twitter, msn and lots more. Most of my family members live in @LOCATION3, @LOCATION4, and @LOCATION2 and just for a call it's like ten dollars for a minute. While you can be on the internet for about day to night and still pay the same price. So what will you choose: pay over thirty dollars just for a long - distance call or stay on the computer? Or get bad grades for doing bad research. It's your choice. Choose now whether to talk with family and friends on the phone and pay over your bill money or stay on web chat for as long as you want and still get the same bill price. Make a wise decision based on your needs and circumstances.
46	46	1	3	Dear, Local Newspaper @CAPS1 here to inform you that the time we spend on computers is truly needed because it offers a wealth of benefits. It helps you access a vast amount of information, it aids you in becoming smarter, and it enhances your hand - eye coordination. I will now explain to you why the time we spend on computers is needed by stating these three reasons. My first reason that will convince you that the time we spend on computers is needed is that it helps us with information. It teaches us about places, people, and different cultures in great detail. It provides us with useful information which often takes a while to learn thoroughly. So, the time we spend on computers is essential to absorb this new information. My second reason that will convince you is that it helps us to become smarter. Say if you're struggling with fractions, you can easily go on a math site, and it will offer step - by - step guidance to help you understand. Computers make you more knowledgeable. And at the end of the day, it's about who has more knowledge, not who does more exercise. My third and final reason that contributes to why we spend the time we do on computers is that it teaches you good hand - eye coordination. It helps with typing, allowing you to become faster when writing essays. When you have good hand - eye coordination, you make fewer mistakes while typing. So, I have come to the conclusion that a lot of computer time is needed because it helps with information acquisition, makes you smarter, and teaches good hand - eye coordination. This is why a lot of computer time is necessary, and perhaps even more computer time could be beneficial as it not only helps individuals but also benefits society as a whole.
47	47	1	3	Dear newspaper, I feel as though the internet or computers act as a significant advantage in society rather than being a problem. They offer great assistance with school work, whether it's researching for projects or sending emails to teachers. You can even take college courses online now! People also use the internet for media consumption or simply to catch up with friends. One of the most important reasons to have a computer is for school - oriented purposes. For instance, when you have a project and need to gather notes, or when you're making a PowerPoint presentation, a computer is indispensable. Another great reason is for teachers. Their computers can help them teach a class in a way that is both engaging and easy to understand, like using interactive teaching software. The increasing use of computers has brought about new ways of obtaining a college degree. Now, you can simply get in bed, turn on your laptop, and take college classes right on your computer! I don't know about you guys, but I'd much rather take college in the comfort of my own home than drive to a campus all the time. Another great use for the internet is email. It makes our lives a lot easier now that more people use it. It can inform us about school - related matters like an early dismissal or serve as a way to catch up with old high - school friends. Another great reason for the internet is for entertainment or just to relax. A large percentage (@PERCENT1) of people who have computers use them for media or fun reasons, such as playing games or watching videos on YouTube. Please add this article to your newspaper so that the computer can be presented as a helpful tool, and not something that will make the whole world obese because that's not solely due to computers. It's the people who use computers and may neglect exercise, not the computers themselves. So, there's no reason to portray them in a bad light.
48	48	1	3	"Have you ever had the time completely fly by while you're on the computer? You go on at @TIME1 pm and all of a sudden, it's seven at night. People should spend less time on the computer because they should be outside enjoying nature, it takes away precious time with your family, and there are other ways to look up information. You should be outside, breathing in the fresh air and playing sports. Instead of being stuck inside all day with your eyes glued to a screen. When you're on the computer all day, you're just sitting there motionless. A staggering seventy - two percent of kids who spend all their time on the computer are overweight. Being on the computer on a beautiful day is like ignoring the birds' songs on the first day of @DATE1. Nature is truly amazing, and you should be outside experiencing it, not cooped up in a stuffy room hunched over a man - made machine. People should significantly reduce the time they spend on their computers. When you're on the computer, time really slips away. You end up losing your whole day to it, and surely you'd rather be doing something more enjoyable. You can be all alone on the computer in a dark room. You should be with your family and friends. Computers are going to be around for a long time, and they'll only become less popular when something better comes along. Your baby brother won't be a baby forever, and your grandparents might not be with you tomorrow. Don't you want to spend as much time as you can with them? You're also growing and changing. Before you know it, @MONTH1 you'll be off to college or have to move far away for business. ""They grow up so fast. They're adults in a blink of an eye,"" my grandma said to my mom. Almost @PERCENT1 of parents feel the same way. So, don't waste all your time alone with a machine. Be with your loving family and cherish each moment. People should spend less time on the computer because there are other ways to look up information and learn about new places. There are countless books in the world, covering any topic you can think of. Using books to look up information is better than just typing a word into Google because it's important to learn how to use an index and find the book on the shelf. A trip to the library @MONTH1 might not be the most exciting thing, but if you want to learn about a place, why not go there? If you're doing a report on @LOCATION2 for school, it would be a lot of fun to take a few - day trip to @LOCATION2 to learn about it firsthand. And you can take pictures with your own camera, not just rely on pictures you find online. It would be a really fun family trip. Even if you're doing your report on a place as seemingly boring as @LOCATION1, you could still have a great time hanging out with your family. In conclusion, people should spend less time on the computer and more time being outside, with family, and at really fun places. Why would you want to stare at a screen all day when you could be having this much fun?"
49	49	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I am writing this letter to you to show how people are positively affected by computers. It impacts people in a very beneficial way and teaches people many things, all from just one technology. Computers influence many people through what they can do. Computers have numerous advantages that people can pick up on very quickly. Many people adore computers. It is one of the greatest inventions for everyone around the world. They teach positive skills for people to learn. Computers even have a positive impact on people across the globe. They teach many things, whether it's something new or reinforcing what people have already learned. For example, they improve hand - eye coordination. When you type up words, it trains your eyes to focus better and your hands to move accurately. Computers also give people the ability to see, understand, and access information about people across the world. Celebrities are highly popular on computers and other technologies. Computers help you learn things more effectively than any other technologies. Whatever you can get on other technologies, there's a high guarantee you'll find it on your computer. Computers are similar to other technologies, but in some aspects, they're far superior. Computers are extremely important in life because without them, we would struggle to communicate with each other. If we didn't have phones to call someone, on the computer, if you go online, you can communicate with someone via their email address. You can talk to someone you haven't spoken to in years. You can view images or videos that you haven't seen in ages. On computers, you can find out information from the news, whether it's from that week or even that day. In conclusion, all I can say is that without computers in this world, it would be a very different place. Many technologies that aren't as good as computers might not be as popular without the foundation that computers have laid. I really wonder what it would be like.
50	50	1	3	Computers are the greatest tool mankind has ever created. They give people access to an unimaginable amount of information, more than any other source in the world. They allow us to connect with far - away places with just one click of a button. Without computers, people would never be able to know, learn, or achieve as much as they can today. Modern planes and cars, which rely heavily on computer technology for design and operation, would not exist. Without computers, this very text probably would not have been created. So, it's not about spending too much time on the computer because there's so much more to do and learn than one can possibly accomplish in a lifetime. The opportunities and knowledge that computers provide are endless, and they have become an integral part of our lives, enabling us to explore, innovate, and connect in ways that were once impossible.
51	51	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, Have you ever found yourself in a situation where you needed to get somewhere, but there was no map or GPS device near you, and the only thing close at hand was a computer? Well, I'm suggesting that you should turn it on and search for your destination. Computers are incredibly helpful in everyone's daily life. They are filled with countless facts and interesting information. For instance, when trying to figure out where someone lives, it's a breeze. Just go on Google and type in someone's address, and there you have it.  The computer is also very useful in another aspect. Have you ever thought about one of your friends or a special someone whom you haven't seen in a really long time and miss them? Well, no problem. Most computers are equipped with some sort of camera, allowing you to have a video chat or just chat regularly on the internet. This is extremely helpful because although you could simply pick up the phone and call them, it's better to do it online. For example, if you haven't seen them and want to see a picture of them, they can just send it to you on some sort of chat page or via your email. It's so much better than mailing one picture, which can take days to arrive. If you can do it the faster way online and through video chat, it will be far more convenient.  The computer is also very helpful when it comes to checking the weather. Suppose one day you want to go somewhere, but you don't know what the weather will be like. You could turn on the TV to check, but there are so many commercials and the weather updates move quickly. On the computer, you can type in the weather forecast for one week, and it will display the information. You can look at it for as long as you want, and it will stay there, allowing you to see the whole week's forecast clearly, without having to worry about the screen being too bright or too dark.  The computer is truly a great tool. People do say that it's good to get off the computer and go for a walk outside in nature, and I do agree with that. However, people and children also get their exercise by walking around the house and going outside for shopping. Computers are not only helpful but also convenient. Another advantage is that say one day you're online, looking at clothes or shoes and want to buy them, but you don't want to make the half - hour journey to the mall from where you live. You can simply buy them online, and they will be shipped to your house. You don't even have to lift a finger. Moreover, computers have a built - in dictionary. If you don't know how to spell a word, you can type it in the best way you can, and it will correct your spelling and tell you what the word means. They also have pictures of everything. If you want to see how something looks like, you can just type it in, and it will show you. With all the facts I've presented, I hope you agree with me that computers are very helpful, nice, and safe.
52	52	1	3	Dear Leaders of society I am writing this letter to you to explain the many benefits towards computers. My first reason will explain the many ways computers help you focus. Experts believe that people using computers is a very good idea. They hold this view because when using a computer, you really have to focus and pay close attention. This kind of focused interaction gives you really great eye - sight and amazing hand - eye coordination.  An important ability that computers have is they are able to teach you about far - away places depending on where you live. The reason people would probably want to visit one of these places on a website would likely be for vacation purposes. For example, if you live in a cold region, you can explore tropical destinations online and plan your next holiday.  My third reason for why I feel we should keep computers is that there are a lot of websites you can join so that you can speak to your friends as long as they're online. Instant messaging platforms like AIM, Yahoo Messenger, and Skype are all great uses for computers. Also, people who own a well - paying business often rely on the email system on these computers. It tells them who wants to sell a piece of machinery or anything that involves business ethics. For example, a factory owner can receive offers from suppliers through email.  Now you know my three very important reasons for why computers are a great way to get hand - eye coordination, a great way to learn about other states, and so you can talk to friends and have an email for business purposes. I hope you have enjoyed reading this and hope to see you on my side toward this topic.
53	53	1	3	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, To begin, I understand that people don't like computers because they are over - used. If the computers are so bad then they shouldn't be used, but in my view, they bring more good than bad. These points regarding computer welfare are that they provide sources, there is interaction between people, and computers are going to advance more over time. Even though these people think they are overused, they still use them. So, even I use the computer a lot, but it can be used for good.  First and foremost, these computers can get sources online that can't be found in books. There are powerful search engines like Google and Bing where you can find your topics. Then, when you find your source, it has information that could have been skipped over in a traditional book. They can show the other side of the story that wasn't mentioned in the book. Your projects that you used to have to go to the library for, you now can do from home. That itself is a significant step that you aren't considering. For instance, if people are on the computer a lot, approximately 70% of the time is spent on research.  Furthermore, people can interact with friends over the computer. They can talk, send pictures, or play games. For example, I play Xbox and I talk to my friends over that a lot of the time. Even a video game can be as fun as being with them in person. As quoted from a well - known entrepreneur @CAPS1 @CAPS2, ""I have a computer not for friends, but for work"". This shows that even large and important figures still use it for work. People say using a computer is like learning to ride a bike. My mom told me a story that she met my dad because he fixed her computer at her job. So, I am here with my parents because of a computer.  None the less, the computers are at their beginning and they will further improve. So people who are on the computer have a reason for why they are on it. This advancement is going to continue again and again, so there won't be a way to stop it. Thus, people will be on it only more and more, so there is no chance of stopping the spread of computers. Then you might try to stop them with the claim ""computers eat your brain"". We all know that is nonsense.  To conclude, I implore you not to try and change the habits of others. I firmly believe that if people want to use computers, they can. I say this considering the sources, the ability to connect with friends, and the future advancement of computers."
54	54	1	3	"Dear Local Newspaper, Greetings! I am an 8th grade student at @PERSON1. I was reading your paper and I noticed you had an article on how people are spending too much time on the computer and not enough time going outside, getting exercise, enjoying nature, and that it doesn't benefit society. I completely disagree with these comments. Let me explain...  Having computers definitely benefits all students. Sometimes kids forget their textbooks at school. But if they have a computer, they can simply Google the information. That way they can get their homework done and avoid getting a zero. Another thing is, I'm sure you have heard of a website called Study Island. If you haven't, it's a website for all the students in the @LOCATION1 to take online courses for math, reading, and science. These courses are time - consuming, but they count for a huge chunk of our grade. So, if we get an A on Study Island, we get an A in one of our classes.  Not only does the computer help students but it helps me in a kind of personal way. I love the piano. But, there are no piano instructors in my area. However, there is a program on the computer called Synthesia. It helps you learn all kinds of songs on your keyboard or piano. Playing the piano helps my hand - eye coordination as well as it teaches discipline and dedication. Now, Synthesia isn't the only free instrument learning program. There are many others! This helps people who can't afford lessons, and learning an instrument can help you achieve things later in life, such as performing in concerts or joining a band.  Now, one thing you said in your article is that people aren't getting enough exercise because of sitting in front of a computer all day. This is not completely true. In fact, most people go on the computer researching diet plans or local gyms. How do I know this? Well, one day when I went on Google, the top search of the day was, ""Weight Watchers diet plan"". Also, my mom uses an online video workout website for her bad back. So not only does the computer help for diets, it can also assist with physical therapy.  So with this letter, I hope you realize that the computer does benefit our society. Yes, we should not spend too much time on it. But, online learning sessions can be time - consuming. It helps many people figure out the right diet and workouts so they can stay happy and healthy."
55	55	1	3	ARE YOU KIDDING!! Computers are great, they're great because of these three reasons. Kids can do homework on computers, also you could video chat with friends and family, and finally because you could look up just about anything you want on the computer.  Computers are great because kids can do their homework on the computer. This is good because if they forget their book at school or something similar, then they could just get the answers from the computer. It's also beneficial for business men because they rely on computers for all their important files. For example, a business executive can access financial reports and client data on their computer.  Computer are also great because you can video chat with friends and family. Video chatting is awesome because if a friend or relative goes out of town, they can just bring their laptop or use a webcam, and then you can talk to them whenever. Video chatting is also good for companies. If their buyer is in a different country, they can just video chat all the necessary information, saving time and travel costs.  Finally, computers are great because they are so resourceful. There are hundreds of websites where all you have to do is type in what you want to know, and there will be thousands of links for you to search and get your answer. They are also useful for finding pictures or creating powerpoint presentations. For instance, a student can easily find images for a school project on the computer.  In conclusion, computers are great because kids can get their homework done, it's good for video chatting, and the internet is very resourceful. They have become an indispensable part of our lives, making various tasks easier and more efficient.
56	56	1	3	Over the past decade, the percentage of people using computers has increased by approximately @PERCENT1. This significant rise has led to a situation where, all of a sudden, the world and its people have become highly dependent on the information that computers provide. The vast variety of databases and resources, along with the increased communication capabilities, and the skills that computers allow you to showcase clearly prove that they are essential for this generation. Communication over computers is highly beneficial as now society can interact with one another easily. Personally, I have been able to talk and see my family who live overseas through the advanced video - conferencing technology on computers. Different communication programs include @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and e - mail, the most commonly used platform. Without having access to a computer and its contents, residents have a difficult time integrating themselves within the rest of society, whether it's for school events, sport schedules, or keeping in touch with far - away family and friends. Computers allow all of these essentials to be part of modern - day society, and this is the way this generation has decided to start our lives. Parents and teenagers these days have become very lazy in comparison to the way they used to behave. They are not interested in going to the library in order to research information on people, places, and family heritage. Computers have been a huge convenience in a person's life by allowing all the information that was once in books to be contained throughout the internet. For example, if you are doing a project for school, the internet will provide you with any information you need in a matter of seconds. It is truly astonishing how much one electronic instrument can impact and influence a life. Being a student, I am commonly curious about what references teachers are making and additional information that is not provided in class. The internet allows any person in possession of a computer to research what they have wondered about and to give a response on the subject almost immediately. The benefits of computers can practically cover the few negative effects as it is a way to let a person discover various information on any desired subject. Besides searching for information, computers can be used to document data of your own. Microsoft has invented several applications which allow you to graph information, design presentations, and neatly record drafts of writing. No person is flawless and is incapable of mistakes. Microsoft helps take your exaggerated imperfections and hide them by doing things as little as making a neater copy of your essay, or putting your lists of data into graph form to make it more eye - friendly to viewers. Society has become reliant on sources scattered throughout the databases on computers. By directly looking at the negative effects that a computer can have on a person and therefore putting reasonable restrictions on this information source, society can fully enjoy the positive contributions that computers these days have on our way of life.
57	57	1	3	In @DATE1, technology has become far more advanced. Computers are one of the most futuristic objects. The computer is excellent for connecting to people around the world. However, computers have bad effects on people's lives. Children are taking time out of their homework to go on the computer, citizens are gaining weight, and children are being kidnapped. School is very important and valuable if you want to succeed in life. However, computers have made it difficult for students to concentrate on their homework. This is a horrible habit and a bad effect on students everywhere. Students' grades will suffer and they will not obtain class credits if this problem is not addressed. Obesity is a huge problem in @LOCATION1. Five out of every ten @CAPS1 are either overweight or obese. This can lead to serious health issues and even death. The problem is that people are spending hours on the computer each day. Most of that time can be used to exercise. Exercising can be an important benefit to someone's life, such as improving cardiovascular health and boosting mood. If this problem is not addressed, millions of Americans will be overweight. @CAPS2 is a very serious and dangerous topic. Every month, dozens of kids are kidnapped. Since the internet was invented, there is a twenty percent increase rate of kids going missing. Children will go on popular networking websites such as @CAPS3, @CAPS4, and Twitter and give out their important information. Pedophiles use the internet to trick children into giving their address. This problem needs to stop and be addressed by the police. Everyday, more and more people use computers. Computers have good and bad effects on people's lives. The bad effects are very serious and dangerous. How would you feel if your child fails school, gains weight, or gets kidnapped because of the computer? We must take steps to mitigate these risks and ensure the safety and well - being of all computer users.
58	58	1	3	"Dear Newspaper, I'm writing to you about the debate that you are having asking if people should use computers. The article stated ""more and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society."" I think people should not use computers. Also, technology needs to slow down as it's getting too advanced. My first reason why people need to stop spending time on computers is that you don't want to always say on your honeymoon ""we could see @LOCATION1 from our computer."" And your life will go by fast and you won't notice it. Before you know it, you're all fat and old. Also, @PERCENT1 of people who use computers are overweight because they don't exercise. Sitting in front of a computer for long hours leads to a sedentary lifestyle, which is harmful to health. Secondly, the more technology there is, the less we experience the real world. In addition, it feels better when you work hard and not just sit on your computer, getting a monthly check without much physical effort. In conclusion, you live a happier life when you explore the real world. @PERCENT2 of people who use computers commit suicide. This could be due to the isolation and stress that excessive computer use can bring. Also, if it were up to me, I would limit the use of computers. Read all the facts about computers and you will think the same way as me. I use to be a computer geek, but I've realized the negative impacts and changed my ways. We should all strive for a more balanced life away from the over - reliance on computers."
59	59	1	3	You @MONTH1 might find this hard to believe, but many people think computers put a negative attitude on people. Now you @MONTH1 may be saying that's not true, that everyone has a computer, but the truth is they don't and they believe it puts a negative attitude on people. People have many reasons for owning a computer and one is friends. Did you @CAPS5 know that some people own computers because they want to stay in touch with friends from different states who live far away? For example, many people use @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 to connect with friends. I can make a connection because I have both a @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 account that I use to stay in contact with family and friends from all over. Some people, like myself, even have friends from different countries! I @CAPS5 believe that many people want to learn about people from different countries and this is one way to do it. Right now, I am learning some new things about the @LOCATION1 because I am friends with someone who lives in @LOCATION2. While on this wonderful adventure of learning, you @MONTH1 might even get yourself into a vacation adventure. A recent test was taken stating that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people like to travel but don't @CAPS5 know where. Some people say that people spend too much time on the computer but not enough enjoying nature. These people are wrong. If one is on a computer and they are chatting with someone from a different state or country, then that person might persuade them to take a visit there. For example, they would be able to go to the internet, type in the place they want to visit, and get detailed photographs and information about the place. As a result, people would still get to enjoy nature when they actually travel there. Sometimes using the computer could be educational. Many people @MONTH1 may disagree with that statement but it's true. For example, when on the computer, many people in their senior year of high school use it to take online college courses to get their degree because going to a regular college @MONTH1 may affect their work schedule. This could also help students in any grade learn more about the topic they are studying. It would also help them on their reports. For example, they would be able to get pictures and other information anytime they wanted to. As a result, the students' grades would increase. I hope many of you agree with my statement and help spread the word that computers could have a positive impact on the mind. As a result, for those who didn't agree with the statement that they are positive not negative, I hope that you will reconsider your opinion and see the many benefits that computers can bring.
60	60	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, I whole - heartedly agree that computers are beneficial to society. The computers have positive effects on people, such as enhancing hand - eye coordination through various games and tasks. They also help you learn about other countries' religions, cultures, and traditions. You can communicate, meet other people, and chat through computers. With just a few clicks, you can connect with someone on the other side of the world. Another positive fact about computers is that you can find all the information you need quickly and efficiently. Whether it's for academic research, professional development, or just for personal interest, the internet provides a vast amount of knowledge at your fingertips. In other words, computers help a lot of people in numerous aspects of their lives. They have revolutionized the way we work, learn, and socialize. We should embrace the positive impacts of computers and continue to use them to improve our lives and the world around us.
61	61	1	3	Do you spend all or most of your free time sitting idly at your computer? Nowadays, people are spending an excessive amount of time on computers. Obesity is a burgeoning problem in today's society. People need to interact with one another, and we all need to get some fresh air. Computers are ruining these aspects for people. It's time to unplug yourself from your computer. More and more individuals are becoming obese. This is due to spending too much time sedentary in front of computers. There is absolutely no physical exercise involved when being on your computer. People should get outside and go for a jog, play engaging games or ride their bikes. Cutting back on computer time would undoubtedly cut back on the obesity problem in our society. Renowned top scientists and researchers assert that it is extremely crucial for people to interact with others face - to - face. Throughout our entire lives, we will have to interact and socialize with others. If you don't develop these skills, you won't be content with where you end up. Talking to people over the computer is nowhere near as meaningful as talking to someone face - to - face. Get out and soak in some fresh air. Go and experience the beauty of nature. Whether it's lying on the beach, hiking in the woods or even just sitting on the swing in your backyard, it can be truly rejuvenating. Fresh air clears your mind. A study by Time magazine indicates that kids who spend time outside receive better grades than they would if they were inside on the computer. People need to relieve stress, so step outside. Simply click to turn off your computers and get out of your chair. Go get some exercise, go interact with friends and family, or even just go outside and get some fresh air while relaxing. People are squandering too much time on their computers, and it's having a detrimental impact on our society. So, just turn off your computer and embrace a more active lifestyle.
62	62	1	3	"I think it is perfectly okay for people to use computers because they get to learn a wide range of new things and meet diverse new people. I don't think it's a bad idea to use computers because some people who have jobs work on computers all day long. Admittedly, sometimes computers can be a distraction, but they can also help you a great deal. I firmly believe that using computers can assist you in learning new things and meeting new people. The rhythmic clicking sound of people typing on the computer is like the sound of new friendships being formed and good times being had. When you learn something new, like the fact that a rat can be as big as a house, you get excited and feel like you're the smartest person in the world. I don't think it's a bad idea to use computers because some people who have jobs work on computers throughout their workday. I think people who use computers all day while they're at work don't have to be overly stylish, popular or trendy; they're just working to support themselves and their families. Yes, at times computers can be a distraction, but the benefits they offer are substantial. They can help you learn new things, meet new friends and give you something to do when you're bored. I vividly remember the time when I was bored and I went on the computer to google who @PERSON1 was. I was pleasantly surprised to find out she was a famous singer, someone I had heard about but didn't know much about. Chantrail @CAPS1, a @NUM2 grade student, says ""only people who want to learn something or meet new friends will use the computers. If you want to learn something new or meet new people, then I suggest you stop munching on those chips, get off that couch and start using the computer to enrich your life."
63	63	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I think that computers have a highly positive effect on people. They are excellent because you can learn a wealth of educational things. You can stay updated with the latest stories on every topic, and you can organize and keep your information neatly for yourself. Computers are a great asset to have because they provide a vast source of information. Whenever you have a question or don't know what something means, you can quickly find out on the internet. There are numerous reliable internet sources that are readily available to answer questions. If we didn't have computers, then whenever you had a question, you would have to painstakingly go find a book to read through, and that takes much more time and effort. Another reason why computers are a great thing is because you can catch up on all of the recent stories. You can learn about what's happening in other parts of the world, you can discover interesting things about celebrities, and you can check the weather. You can find some of this information on television, but you never know exactly when it will come on. With computers, you can search for all the latest stories and find the information you want right when you need to know it. With computers, you can also keep your information well - organized. You could use @ORGANIZATION1 and keep everything you need to know in a neat and efficient manner. You can also create professional - looking graphs on the computer. This way, your graphs will look great every time. If there were no computers, then your information would not be as well - structured and accessible. I firmly believe that computers are a wonderful thing to have because you can stay informed about the latest stories, and you can keep your own information in an orderly fashion. I am convinced that computers have a positive impact on people's lives.
64	64	1	3	Dear news paper, I think computers are really good for you because you can use the internet to explore various things like MySpace, watch interesting videos and even complete some school work such as math problems and essays. So, yes, I do think that computers are good for you because you can do all kinds of useful things on them. And computers can help you with school a great deal. You can print out lots of important materials. The reason why computers can help you is that they can assist with your math, writing, spelling, and most definitely science and also literature. The reason why I chose those @NUM1 things is because you can look up those @NUM1 topics on the computer and get the correct answers for math and spelling. For example, Read @NUM3 is a great tool that helps you write and spell better. That's one of the reasons why I like computers so much because I can get on Read @NUM3. I really enjoy using Read @NUM3, and I also like the Read @NUM3 class. Sometimes I like reading on the computers, although not all the time. But I first learned how to read by forcing myself to read on the computer. That's how I took my first steps in learning to read, by using the computer and pushing myself forward. That's why computers are so important to me, as they allow me to look up words and expand my knowledge. In conclusion, computers are an invaluable resource for both learning and entertainment, and they play a significant role in my educational journey.
65	65	1	3	"Dear Newspaper, People are spending an inordinate amount of time on the computer, and it is simply not right. They should be engaging in physical exercise and interacting meaningfully with friends and family. Having a computer also often distracts them from their schoolwork. Computers typically have these negative effects on the people who use them. Instead of sitting at the computer all @DATE1, people should be out getting some much - needed exercise. The @LOCATION1 is one of the countries with the highest number of overweight people. Many teenagers are cooped up inside all @DATE1 at the computer, patiently waiting for their friends' screen names to pop up so they can start chatting. They don't need to completely abandon their computers, but while they're waiting for their friends, they could be getting some exercise. All they need to do is put on some lively and fun music and start dancing around the room. This simple activity will get them the exercise they need for the @DATE1. They also could do ten push - ups and twenty sit - ups, or even more if they are up for a greater challenge. Instead of sitting idly at the computer all @DATE1, they should make an effort to exercise. Having a computer affects the owner because they don't have enough face - to - face conversations with friends and family. You can pick up the phone and call your friend and invite them over to your house instead. If they can spend hours at home on the computer, then they surely have the time to hang out in real life. Instead of video - chatting with your cousins in another state, plan for them to come and visit you one @DATE1. That way, you can actually talk to them in person and see what they've been up to. You could also play exciting board games or have a game of hide - and - seek. It is far more enjoyable to be with someone in real life than to talk with them online. The last, but definitely not least, effect that computers have on people's lives is that it distracts them from school. Once you start chatting with one of your friends, it's quite difficult to stop. Many people don't know how to break away, so they end up not doing the homework they were supposed to do, or they don't study for the big test the @DATE1, and as a result, they end up failing it. Some kids will try to do homework while being on the computer at the same time, but the homework is probably incorrect because they aren't concentrating on it hard enough. Having a computer affects your life in many different ways, some positive but also many negative. Some of the negative ways are that it ""stops"" you from exercising, it limits your face - to - face interaction with friends and family, and it distracts many kids from school. We should be more mindful of our computer usage and strive to find a healthy balance in our lives."
66	66	1	3	Wouldn't it be great to use computers in everyday life? In this country, we have the wonderful opportunity to do so. You can use it to talk to people you never thought you would see again, rekindling old friendships and connections that might have otherwise faded away. Looking at places far away is always an option, allowing you to explore the world from the comfort of your own home. You can even simply use it to help with homework essays. Locating and researching, even virtually traveling to different countries, even different continents, is possible to do on the computer. You can buy plane tickets, reserve rooms in cozy hotels, and even reserve tables at restaurants in different countries by just a few clicks. Another thing is, you can research countries, towns, and cities with Google instead of having to go out and get books. Reading about and talking to people from different countries is always an option. Being able to talk and read about people and go to countries just by clicking a button is pretty amazing. Computers also allow us to talk and communicate to people when there is no other way. The computers give people the ability to talk and see people they thought they would never communicate with anymore. An example of this is my father hadn't seen his father since he was two, but he started communicating with him and we were able to see him and chat with him through web chat. So these web chatting websites; ooVoo, Facebook, MySpace, Skype, etc., are allowing people to reconnect. This advantage is allowing friendships and relationships to continue. Is that really bad? Computers can help people with their homework and essays. For instance, they can type and print their essays instead of having to write it on paper. This helps because first it makes their work neater, and it also can be changed quicker and easier. They also can get information about what they are studying quickly and more efficiently. Instead of searching for a word in a big dictionary, they can use an online dictionary and just have to type in the word. Online dictionaries also have pronunciation help and support different languages. This helps so much so they can get their work done and then have time to exercise, enjoy nature, or interact with family and friends. I hope you will take my opinion seriously and think about it. Is using computers for daily needs really that bad?
67	67	1	3	Do you think computers affect people's society? Computers are beneficial for people of all ages. First, computers let you chat with friends and family. You can have long - lost conversations with friends you haven't spoken to in a long time, sharing memories and catching up on each other's lives. Also, it helps you meet new friends and to keep in touch with them in the long run, expanding your social circle beyond geographical boundaries. Finally, the computer technologies are outstanding because it allows you to chat with family members across the state through video chat or even on websites such as MySpace, Facebook, and Twitter. Secondly, the computer is a great way to learn about history. You can find history on almost everything from the past to the present. You can learn about the history of famous people, places, and events, getting a comprehensive view of different eras. That's why I think the computer technology is so outstanding. What do you think would happen if we didn't have it today? Finally, the computer is a great way to keep busy because you can take the time looking up information for school projects, gathering data and insights to make your work more comprehensive. Also, you can spend your spare time playing games that help you learn or even book flight tickets for a vacation. Finally, the technology is here for a reason, so we should use it for anything like catching up with friends or just going on to look up information on anything you need to find out. In conclusion, I just told you why computer technology is good to have. First, it lets you connect with friends and family. Also, computers let you learn a lot about history. Finally, the computer is a great way to keep busy. Now I've just told you why computer technology is a good thing to have. I hope you agree with my point of view.
68	68	1	3	"Dear Local Newspaper [CAPS1], I am writing to you about my opinion on the effects computers have on people. I believe that there can be both good and bad effects. Computers make things easier for people, but they are also over - relied upon. Mankind should use books for research also, not just computers. Computers are very helpful for people. For example, if you really wanted to see a certain movie but you don't want to stand in line, people can go to movie tickets.com and purchase their tickets. Then, once you get to the movie theater, all that's left to do is walk over to the kiosk and redeem your tickets, saving you time and hassle. Another example is that computers allow people to pay their taxes. There is special software that is able to be downloaded onto your computer. Once the software has been installed, it will usually lead you, step by step, through the process of paying your bills. It's much faster and much easier than paying ""manually"". These are some really good effects that computers have on people. Computers also have their flaws. Over time, computers have caused most people to be lazy. Some people have become too dependent on their computers. Business owners, or businessmen and women in general, are constantly on their laptops or Blackberries. Everywhere you look there is another adult on the internet or e - mail. Not only adults do this though. Students are becoming more dependent on the internet. For every assignment practically, students use Google or Bing. Sometimes they use Wikipedia. Students should just take the time to use their textbooks. The student body would rather watch [CAPS3], play video games, or text than do homework. This is understandable because homework can be boring but it all pays off in the end. Taking the extra [NUM1] minutes to use a textbook won't kill anyone. No one has died yet from using a book instead of Google. Also, in using a textbook, you will understand how to do whatever you're doing. That isn't so bad, is it? Computers, as you can see, have both good and bad effects. It's easy to use the internet for homework but that doesn't really help you learn deeply. Making purchases is fun though. It saves gas money and time. I hope you and the readers of this paper see my point of view and understand that we should strike a balance in our use of computers."
69	69	1	3	Some people think it is a good idea and some do not. My opinion is that people spend a lot of time on computers for good reasons. Here are three reasons why: grownups working, students learning how to type, and communicating with others. My first reason is that parents do a lot of work on the computer. For example, they do their taxes, handle paperwork, book airline tickets, and manage their bank accounts. And those are usually all done on the computer so it would be easier if people don't have to drive to different places. My second reason is students need to learn how to type so they can email or even write neatly on paper. It helps them build their learning ability and also, so they can know how to use the [ORGANIZATION1]'s features. Computers are supposed to be fun for people of any age. My last reason is, communicating with others is a great skill to have so you can talk in person. Computers help because if you mess up what you're trying to say then you could just erase what you're trying to say. And in person, you can't easily take back your words. Also, you can make plans with one of your friends on something if they live really far away or something like that. In my opinion, I think people should be able to go on the computers to do work, play games, visit various sites, and many more other things, only if you have a computer at home. We should embrace the computer's potential while also being mindful of how we use it.
70	70	1	3	"Dear [CAPS1] [CAPS2], imagine life without computers. There would be no quick access to information, no way to socialize, and no way to keep your health records or other personal information safe. Without this technology, where would we be? I believe that the world is benefiting from the advances in technology today. As a student, computers are a crucial element to allow me to get my work done. Without the guidance from [ORGANIZATION2] [CAPS7], [CAPS4] [CAPS5], or other applications, it wouldn't be possible for me to reach my full potential on assignments. How could a student be so certain their grammar is perfect on their homework without asking a teacher? There is a way. It is called [ORGANIZATION2] tools. However, the only way to access this is through a computer or [ORGANIZATION2] [CAPS7]. [ORGANIZATION2] tools allows you to check your spelling, grammar, and punctuation with just a click of your mouse. Computers are an essential learning tool for the school system today. Not only are computers used to educate, but they are helpful in the real world. Many businesses rely on the work of computers entirely. In fact, according to [PERSON1] [CAPS9] [ORGANIZATION1], a local business ""[LOCATION1]"". In our job, we continuously work with computers. This wouldn't be possible without the effort of our typists on the computer. Since so many businesses and companies around the nation are relying on the advances in technology, why change anything? We should continue to progress in this growth. [PERCENT1] of businesses in [LOCATION1] say they would have to close down if not for computers. With so many businesses doing this, our economy would drop. This would not help. We all know computers and other technology are great sources of entertainment. What you might not know, however, is that they supply a great amount of knowledge to the average person. For example, let's say you finished watching a special on the Discovery Channel about [LOCATION2]. You want to know more, so you pull out your iPod touch. All you have to do is log on to the internet and search ""[CAPS11] of [LOCATION3], [LOCATION2]"". In just a few seconds, you would have your information. People might not believe so, but it is true that you can learn a great deal of information from various forms of technology. You can have all the resources you'll ever need right at your fingertips. Computers supply so much more than just entertainment. All reasonable people would agree that advances in technology are extremely helpful to the public. There is so much guidance for our daily lives through computers, and we should continue to support and develop this technology."
71	71	1	3	Computers have helped people tremendously over the past years. Thanks to computers, scientists have found cures for diseases, and jobs have become easier. I believe that computers have a fundamental effect on people. Because they educate people in their jobs and give people a chance to talk to others without having to pay for anything. If someone travels to a country they're unfamiliar with, they might go on the computer to learn more about that country and its culture. Another thing they might do is go to a website that could help them find affordable accommodations. If a child is doing a report about a country in [LOCATION1], they can go on the computer to find out facts on that country. Computers educate people about places all over the world. You can go on a website that has videos and written articles about what has been going on around the world and learn about current events. My grandmother would tell me stories about [CAPS3] [CAPS4] before they had computers. Now my dad works on [CAPS3] [CAPS4] and he tells me stories about his day. When you compare the two different decades, it seems like computers help out a lot within [CAPS3] [CAPS4]. Before computers, stores would have to do math on their pads when they were giving change back to people. Now people save time by punching in the numbers in the computer. I think the computers have helped people with their jobs. When you talk on the phone to someone, it costs you money. When you just want to see someone, it costs you money to get on a phone call. With computers, you can video chat or instant message people at no cost. If you want to see a friend far away but don't have the money to fly halfway around the world to see her, you can video chat with her. Computers help people save money by talking on the computers with friends, family, and even co-workers. Computers have been very helpful ever since they were invented. They help people learn about places all over the world and about anything you want to learn about. They also make jobs and work easier and also help people save a lot of money by talking to people on the computers instead of on the phone. Computers have improved dramatically over the years. The screens used to be so small and you would have to press all these buttons just to open it up. Now computers can be as big as a flat [CAPS10] and can be turned on with just a push of a button. Who knows what computers will be like [NUM1] years from now? It's clear that computers will continue to play an important role in our lives, bringing more convenience and opportunities in the future.
72	72	1	3	"Hello, I decided to write in to the paper on the topic of computers, and how they benefit society. Computers are powerful machines, and can be used for completing otherwise menial and boring tasks. They benefit people in many ways, like they are very useful in business, helpful in education, and connect friends and family together. Computers are useful in business and are an extremely important tool in a common workplace today, and make work get done much more efficiently than if they didn't have computers. One reason computers are so useful in the workplace is because computers can store far more data than can be put on paper. Also, they can do jobs and processes very quickly, which is important in the workplace. They can also be used for sending important information quickly and without much trouble. For example, sending an email with a large file can be done in seconds, while sending a physical document would take days. These are all valid reasons computers are beneficial in business, and help things get done. Computers are important in today's schools and educational programs because they can help students work in a more efficient fashion. ""80% of all surveyed students said they would rather type a paper for school than write one by hand, and this shows that they value them in their education,"" said [PERSON2], a professor at [ORGANIZATION1]. This shows that computers are important to students, and are used to their benefit. In addition to students writing papers, computers are being used by teachers and school systems for grading, attendance records, and more. The teachers at my school are using [CAPS1] [CAPS2], pieces of hardware that are directly connected to computers, and can be used instead of white [CAPS2]. I see that students are getting more involved in class and more focused because this computer technology is being used. All of these factors are reasons computers are helpful in educational processes, and should continue to be used. Many people want to be able to talk to their friends and family when they are bored. Because of computers and social networking websites, and instant messaging programs, this is made much easier. ""90% of teens have at least one social networking site they visit on a regular basis,"" said [PERSON1], a psychologist who specializes in teens. This shows that people use these sites, and that they like them. Families that are separated because one [MONTH1] has moved out of the house recently might want to communicate with one another, and because of computers, they can. There are multiple ways that they could use their computers to keep in touch, like instant messaging systems mentioned before. Being able to communicate with one another makes these people happy, and benefits society. Overall, being able to communicate through computers is an enjoyable thing for many people, and is important to society today. To conclude, computers contribute to society in ways that make it much better for everyone. Whether it's through helping businesses be more efficient, giving students the ability to work faster and in a way they prefer, or if it's helping people stay in touch, computers are always benefiting society. These machines hardly ever slow people down more than manually doing the work would, and the positive influence they have far outweighs the bad they do. It's evident that computers will remain an essential part of our society, continuously enhancing our lives in various aspects."
73	73	1	3	"Dear The [ORGANIZATION1], ""[CAPS1], [CAPS1], [CAPS1]"" goes the floor. ""[CAPS4] oh here comes pete."" ""[CAPS5], is he getting fat?"" ""All he does is play on the computer all day long."" There is an increasing number of teenagers throughout the [LOCATION1] who are playing on the computer too much. This needs to stop. ""[CAPS7] playing on computers is one of the worst things that they can do with their time,"" said [CAPS8] [PERSON1] of the international health committee. There are always going to be obese people around the world, but in the past [NUM1] years, [LOCATION2] has doubled the amount of obese [CAPS7] in all of [LOCATION3]. Statistics show that over 30% of the American population is obese and very much so. The future of America is looking like a nation of obese, lazy [CAPS7] who only want to sit down in front of a screen all day. 70% of [CAPS7] who don't experience nature at a young age never fully appreciate it. Since they play on the computers all day, they don't ever use nature. They won't care for it and will litter and pollute even more. Just [CAPS7] playing on the computer can be very bad for the environment, just like it is bad for themselves. Not only do the computers hurt the [CAPS7] and the environment, it hurts the family and friends. [CAPS7] who are on the computer all day aren't spending enough time with their family and friends. Families are supposed to be close, and they can't be if someone is playing on the computer all day. Just a couple of weeks ago, [PERSON2] Rayfield said that he got grounded because he was playing on the computer so much he didn't talk to his mom in two weeks. 20% of people who get divorced happen because of the arguments over the amount of time spent on the computer, said [CAPS8] [PERSON3] from the Yale marriage research center. If [CAPS7] knew that they might cause their parents to divorce, they might stop playing on the computer so much. Therefore, [CAPS7] shouldn't spend that much time on their computer because of the health, the environment, and their families. So it's up to the people really. Do you want a nice, physically fit nation where every family is close, or a rundown, obese hole in the wall that is ""called"" the [LOCATION4]? We should all take action to limit computer use and create a healthier and more connected society."
74	74	1	3	I believe that computers have good effects on people. Computers allow people to stay in touch with long - distance friends or family. Computers have games for kids that help them learn, and also, people learn new things, too. My first reason is that computers allow people to stay in touch. If someone in their family lives long - distance, then they could always use e - mails to talk. That way, they won't lose each other. Also, sometimes, friends move away, and you always want to keep in touch. Moreover, if they want to send photos to each other, they can use e - mail. This is much faster than sending physical photos through the mail, which takes forever. Please, let the people stay in touch! My second reason is that computers have games for kids to play. The games kids play could help them learn more. Sometimes watching TV doesn't help as much. If they actually play the game and see what they're doing, then they will get smarter. That's what we want for our kids, right? Also, kids have fun playing these games. Do you really want to take the learning experience away? My third reason is that computers help people learn new things. Like, they could go on the computer and learn what's happening in the world. People can learn new words they never knew about. Also, pictures on the computer help, too. For example, if someone is traveling somewhere and they don't know the prices, they can get on the computer and check it out, right? So, in conclusion, I believe that computers are a great use. They help people stay in touch, help kids learn by playing games, and help people learn new things about the world and more. So, I'm saying, please, keep the computers. They are not a waste of our time. Trust me. Computers will continue to bring positive impacts to our lives and the development of our society.
75	75	1	3	Dear [ORGANIZATION1], In the past ten years, advances in technology have completely changed the world. Technology makes people's lives much easier and helps keep more and more people connected throughout the world. More jobs are created and help speed up ordinary events such as taxes, messages, news, and teaching. However, many people have proven that too much use of technology can make teens and adults addicted to the internet. In this addiction, many people can lose time with their family, time to exercise, and time to enjoy nature. Since being part of the generation growing up in the new technology era, I have had a first - hand experience with the benefits of the new technology. I believe that this technology is a great help to society today. Many more jobs are being created because of this technology. For example, think about how many people could be employed if a new computer system was created. There would be thousands of people working on many things such as the founder, manager, creator of new ideas, or just working at the new company's retail store. Running a business or a corporation is a very difficult job to do. But because of the advances in technology, running a business can become much easier and not as much time is wasted. With the new technology, people can send emails within seconds instead of running around the entire office giving out memos. Also for businesses, their stocks of the company can be updated every minute. These advances will make it easier to run and make them more efficient. For instance, a small business owner can manage inventory, sales, and customer data all in one software system. With the advances in technology, average people can be updated on the news around the world every minute. Also, when it comes time to pay taxes, they can fill them out and pay online. None the less, there is more entertainment open to everyone. Through today's new technology, people's lives are made much easier. They can work faster, get more errands accomplished, learn more, connect to people around the world, and be caught up with local and international news. Technology is benefiting society and will hopefully continue making life easier. We should also be aware of the potential negative impacts and use technology in a balanced way to ensure a better future for all.
76	76	1	3	"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1's best friend, @LOCATION2, was once a complete nerd with absolutely no hand - eye coordination. However, @CAPS2, he began to use a computer regularly, and now he has better hand - eye coordination than me. A computer not only teaches hand - eye coordination but also, @CAPS3, gives people the ability to learn about far - away places and people, and allows millions of people to talk online with others. @CAPS1's friend wasn't the only person who learned hand - eye coordination. About @PERCENT1 of people learn hand - eye coordination using a computer. @CAPS3 might take some months to learn, but once a child knows @CAPS3, they will be more active outside for hours. Who wouldn't want to learn hand - eye coordination? In addition, a computer gives people the ability to learn about far - away places and people. Computer engineer, @PERSON1, says, ""@NUM1 in every @NUM2 people learn about places and people through the internet."" @CAPS3 will take a few hours, but you will be educated. Why would someone think we are spending too much time on the internet if we are being educated? Additionally, don't you have a friend who lives more than @NUM3 miles away from you? If you do, @CAPS2, a computer will solve your problem of communication. @CAPS1's friend, @LOCATION1, lives @NUM4 miles away from me. We communicate using hotmail, yahoo, and facebook. The best thing of all is that it is free, unlike a telephone. Furthermore, computer specialist, @PERSON2, says, ""I learned hand - eye coordination using a computer. Most importantly, I was able to hand in @CAPS1's essay on time because of the information a computer provides, and I was able to communicate with @CAPS1's family."" I didn't want to tell you this, but I was also a nerd with no hand - eye coordination, and I learned just like @LOCATION2 did. We aren't spending too much time; we are just being educated. In conclusion, the benefits of using a computer are clear, and the so - called ""too much time"" is actually a valuable investment in self - improvement and connection."
77	77	1	3	Dear Newspaper, In @DATE1's modern world, we are highly dependent on computers. @DATE1 computers have truly become the most helpful and indispensable source of technology. We need computers for a multitude of things, and they bring significant benefits to society. They can help people talk online conveniently, they are extremely educational, and they improve hand - eye coordination remarkably. It has been truly amazing how computers assist us in so many aspects of our lives. We need computers as desperately as we need water. If we didn't have them, how would we possibly survive? Computers have become the strong glue that holds friendships together. They help maintain friendships even when you don't see your friend constantly. I have a friend who moved to @LOCATION1 last year. It was prohibitively expensive to just call or text her. So, as a result, I keep in contact with her through the computer. Every day we @CAPS1 and use skype to stay in touch. Those services cost @MONEY1 per year. If I were to call her, each call would cost @MONEY2. If it weren't for the internet, I seriously believe that our friendship would have collapsed. Computers have been so helpful for many people facing this same problem. Computers have become the number one source to find information. They have become more popular than the library and text - books combined. So many essential resources are readily available on computers. Text - books, calculators, and even homework are all online. Many people say that computers aren't educational, but scientists say it can move a student's grade from a @CAPS2 - to an A+. Teachers say the same thing too. One of my fellow students said that computers changed his life. He used to forget to write down his homework, but now he looks online and has all of it. Now he knows exactly what pages to read from the science book. If you don't think that computers have changed students' lives, well, think again. There are also games that improve hand - eye coordination. Many sports teams like the @CAPS3 use this. It has increased their hand - eye coordination by @PERCENT1. The team says if it wasn't for the hand - eye coordination game, then they would have never won the @CAPS4 @CAPS5. This game is also free online for anyone to use. Everyone that has used it said it really improved their reaction time. The games are also fun and non - violent. They have games like baseball, hockey, and hurdles. This game has made a great improvement on people's lives. If we don't have computers, then our hand - eye coordination will decrease by @PERCENT2. Would you want to be the person to take away computers? In conclusion, computers have made a great and far - reaching impact on @DATE1's society. Computers are educational, you get to talk to friends, and improve your hand - eye coordination. Computers have made a big and positive improvement on how we live, and it's definitely for the better. If we didn't have computers, then friendships would break, grades would decrease, and hand - eye coordination would plummet. We need computers as they have been so beneficial to billions of people across the globe. Many people depend on computers. So, if we take away computers, then you'll be letting many lives down. No sane person would want to take away computers. Computers have benefited society in so many wonderful ways.
78	78	1	3	"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1's opinion for using ""too much"" computer time is an absolute outrage. I think people should come up with more diverse ideas. Such as exercising, socializing with family and friends, and lastly, ""you time"" which means to do whatever you would like to do indoors BUT @CAPS2 using computers. For exercise, you can engage in any sport that you like outside. For @CAPS3 and spending quality time with family and friends, you can have a nice family reunion at their house or simply ""hang out"" with your friends. For ""you time"", you can draw a beautiful picture or read an interesting book. There are a lot of great ideas instead of just spending ""computer time"". When it comes to exercising, you can go outside and play sports such as basketball, soccer, or baseball, etc. You could even play hide - and - seek with your friends or even tag. Anything that keeps you moving out of the house instead of using computers! If you exercise every day, such as having a proper ""workout"" to get fit, you will definitely manage to achieve that instead of using ""computer time"". Exercising is a great idea instead of using ""computer time""! Socializing with family and friends is a good alternative to ""computer time"" because you can finally have the time to spend with them, like talking to them, playing games, or eating dinner together. That's what we call ""@CAPS3"". Your family and friends will love to spend time together by eating dinner and having a nice conversation. You could also play any board games such as ""monopoly"" too. With your friends, you can go to the movies, have a sleepover, or play outside. There are many good little ideas to do with family and friends instead of using ""computer time"". The last idea instead of using ""computer time"" is doing ""you time"" indoors. WARNING! But avoid @CAPS2 computer time! You could do something quiet like draw a nice picture. That's something nice and relaxing to do instead of using ""computer time"". Or you could even read a book. Maybe you have to catch up on your nightly reading for language arts and you want to start reading your goal book. If you choose to do ""you time"", you will definitely manage to replace that useless ""computer time""! All of these ""ideas"" for not using the computer are very easy to implement. It's not healthy to sit around the computer all day! Instead, you can exercise. You could also socialize with family and friends. Lastly, do ""you time"", but don't use a computer!!! If you want to achieve a goal, you can manage that! In conclusion, there are numerous alternatives to excessive computer use, and by choosing these, we can lead healthier and more fulfilling lives."
79	79	1	3	Computers have caused many people to lose money, friends, and time. In fact, since computers came out this year, lots of people have been spending way too much time on the web. Which can cause people to lose time and friends. Computers and technology today have had a very significant influence on a great many people. Spending too much time on computers can cause people to lose time and money. For example, my oldest brother was very overweight at the age of @NUM1 or @NUM2 because our computer started working, but this had a positive impact on him. He started participating in sports such as basketball and lacrosse, and he was very good at them and continued with lacrosse through high school. While doing this, he saved my parents money. This is @CAPS1's reason how computers have had a negative effect on people. The new technology has caused people to lose lots of time when they could be doing other things that would benefit them in life. For example, many people in the @LOCATION1 spend half of their day on computers, and as a result, they are not getting the exercise they need. One of the reasons for this is the video games that are available on computers all day. This is @CAPS1's way that computers can have a negative affect on people, which is losing touch or having issues with friends. For example, I used to be friends with a person, but then he did not talk to me for almost the entire @DATE1 because he was always on the computer. This made me think that he did not want to be friends, but actually he just dedicated almost all of the @DATE1 to the computer. Since then, I have been over to his house about @NUM3 times this year as opposed to every @DATE2. This is @CAPS1's way computers can change your life. The time has come to decide whether to have a computer or not to rely so much on computers. In my mind, I think that it would be best for everyone if we did not spend all our time on computers, but if we do use them, we should have a certain limit and put a specific time - limit on computer use. So that you and your family members don't lose time, exercise time, or friends. Overall, I think that it would be best for everyone if we had a time - limit on computers instead of spending the whole day on them. In conclusion, while computers have their uses, setting boundaries on their use is essential to maintaining a balanced and healthy life.
80	80	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2's name is @PERSON1, and I firmly do not believe that computers are very beneficial to our society. Computers do not benefit us because they are preventing many people, especially the younger generations, @CAPS3 from exercising and leading a healthy life, playing sports, and enjoying the outdoors. Computers are keeping many people, particularly the younger ones, from exercising. Nowadays, instead of going to the gym, many people stay home on the computer, either talking to friends or playing computer games. As a result, many people are not as healthy as they should be. It's also been recorded that any person who spends large amounts of time on the computer is hurting their eyes, resulting in an increase in the number of people wearing glasses. If people were to go and start doing things other than sitting in front of the computer, they will live a happier, healthier, and better life. Unfortunately, many young people are not getting involved in playing sports. During this decade, many sports - themed games have come out for the computer. Now, instead of pushing themselves to work hard in real - life sports, kids either play with no enthusiasm or don't play at all. The reason for this is that they can instead work extremely hard on their custom @CAPS4 or @ORGANIZATION1 teams in @PERSON2 or @NUM1. Also, the computer is not the only electronic device stopping kids @CAPS3 from playing sports. Xbox, playstation, xbox @NUM2, psp, @NUM3, gamecube, and gameboy are some of the few console systems that play games that distract kids. I myself have been caught thinking more about an xbox game than @CAPS2's own hackey game! Not only are these electronics pulling kids in like magnets but the parents are also partly to blame as they are allowing their kids to play video games or stay on the computer for hours on end. Many of us don't know what it's truly like to go outside and camp, and we don't spend enough time with our family. I came across @CAPS5 family and many @CAPS5 families are very close, so it's natural to be doing things with @CAPS2's father, brother, or cousin. However, not too many families are as close, so they don't do things together. If some fathers took their sons fishing or camping, it would get them away @CAPS3 from computers, and the father - son bond will become stronger. These are @CAPS2's reasons, sir, and they should be thought over for quite some time. Just remember that many people need to exercise, many should play sports, and many families need to experience the outdoors. In conclusion, the negative impact of computers on the younger generation and family life is evident, and steps should be taken to encourage a more active and family - oriented lifestyle.
81	81	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, I think that using computers is a good thing and it has no negative effect on exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. Here are three reasons to support my opinion: people can learn more on the internet, children at school can go online to find out what their homework is, and how the internet doesn't negatively affect everyday life. My first reason why I think using computers is good is that people learn more on the internet. You know what people say, you learn something new every day. Well, if you're wondering about something or thinking about something, the internet can help you find what you're looking for. @ORGANIZATION1 is a great site to find what you're looking for. It also has its own images if you need a picture for the project you're working on. My second main reason why using the internet is good is that if you're a @CAPS1, you can go online to check what you have for each subject. If you're a @CAPS1 and you don't want to do homework at recess the next day because you were sick. No problem, you can go online to your school's website and click on your teachers' names to see what you have for homework. This way you can still have time to go outside, play with friends, and interact with family members. My third and final reason why using the internet is good is that it impacts everyday life in a positive way. If you don't have a TV and you have no idea what the weather is like, you can go online to see if it's going to be snowy or rainy. This can tell you if you need a jacket or a raincoat, if you need to use a shovel or hold an umbrella. The internet can be useful in everyday life. In conclusion, I think using the internet is very good and will not affect your exercise or your interaction with family. To support this, I've stated that people learn more on the internet now, children can access homework if they missed a day, and how the internet affects your everyday life in a good way.
82	82	1	3	Do you remember the last time you locked something up on the computer? Many people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. Those who support a trend in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people. I support computers because they help with writing, looking up information, and provide communication. One reason I support computers is because they help with writing. You can tell I don't have the greatest handwriting. To help with this, I type almost all of my papers. Computers can also help people with spelling and grammar. There are even systems now that let you say something and @CAPS1 will appear on the screen. This is just one reason I support computers. Next, computers are beneficial because of the information they can provide. Before computers, you would need to go to the library and find around ten books that might not even have what you're looking for. Now you can find hundreds of articles on any topic in minutes. The amount of information out there is unimaginable. I think computers are a great piece of technology because of the information they can provide. Finally, I believe computers are a benefit to us because of communication. One form of communication that came out recently is @CAPS2. @CAPS1 is a website that lets you send messages to a friend, share pictures, videos, and many more things. E - mail lets you send letters to people via the internet instantly. I could go on forever about forms of communication on the internet. This is the last reason I support computers. Computers are a great benefit to society. They help with writing, communication, and everyone could benefit from computers.
83	83	1	3	Dear Newspaper, Computers have been a great learning source and I think it's time we give them some credit instead of worrying over them. I will be telling you about how I think computers are great. One reason they are very helpful is that books don't always have all of the information. So if you need to know a fact or need more information for a project, you can go on the computer and it's all right there and you will know more facts than when you started. The second reason is that you can be almost anywhere and have access to a computer and you might not have a phone, but you can talk or send a message. Not everyone has a phone, but computers are a secondary way to have a conversation with someone. Another reason is that it's not always sunny outside and when it's a rainy day, you have a fun way to play and learn without having to be outside. The computer doesn't replace the outdoors or exercising; it is just a pastime when you don't have the opportunity to be outside. I hope you liked and understood my reasons and will take them into consideration when going over the topic.
84	84	1	3	I think computers help people out because you can learn about all sorts of things. For example, if you want a job, you can look it up on the computers. Also, if you have a problem, they will help you out. If you want to go somewhere, you can be on the computer and look at how it is. If you like it, you could go there; if not, you can look somewhere else you want to go. I think it's a great thing to look for people on the computer because you could talk to them and see them. It's really cool. You can look for cultures on your computer if you want to learn. Like if you have a favorite person you want to know about, you can look it up on the computer and see videos or look up different sites. It's really cool. There are games you can play online. There are a lot of games, fun games and learning games like math games, science games, different games you want. Also, you can play with other people who are playing the game at the same time as you. It's really cool. I think the computer isn't bad for people; computers help them a lot.
85	85	1	3	"Dear local newspaper, Computers - are they a good benefit for society or a bad benefit for society? What do you think? Would you enjoy always being on the computer? I wouldn't, so this is why I believe that computers have a negative impact on society. First, the reason why I think computers have a negative impact is because you can become addicted to always having to be on the computer. Becoming addicted to the computer leads to serious consequences. For example, you spend less time exercising and that isn't healthy for your body physically. Not exercising leads to many things like being overweight, health problems, diseases like diabetes, and many other things, but usually these are the main problems. You can avoid this by turning off the computer and just going for a small walk, but because of what computers have to offer these days, people don't want to do this. That's one reason why computers have a negative impact on society. Another reason for why computers have a negative impact on society is because you won't spend as much time with your friends and family. Even if you don't realize it, if you spend more time on the computer than with your family and friends, this affects them in many ways. They can feel disappointed, worried about you, even concerned. When you're always on the computer, you're ignoring your family and this hurts them emotionally. Think about how you would feel if you had a best friend you always hung out with. You two did everything together, and then all of a sudden your best friend suddenly stops calling you, visiting you, and hanging out with you. You would feel disappointed because you lost your best friend over a computer. These things can happen if you go overboard when using the computer. This is why I think computers don't do good; they do more harm in my personal opinion. The final reason why I say that computers aren't all that good is for a main reason - safety. These days, computers have all the websites like @CAPS1, @CAPS2, Twitter, and others. There are so many kids who chat with people they don't even know. Also, they're posting pictures of themselves without even thinking that this is a dangerous thing to do. Once you post those pictures, they will always be there no matter if you even try to delete them. Another thing is that when you're on the computer, people don't even think about their safety and that's how things happen. For example, you can think you're talking to a friend but as it turns out, you were talking to some stranger. Then you go meet up with your ""friend"" when it really wasn't. So you see, safety is a real big problem with these computers. In conclusion, do you still believe that computers are a good benefit for society or a bad benefit? My opinion still remains the same and I'm sure that there are others who believe the same. So this is why I think that computers are a bad benefit for society, and that computers can lead to more harm than do any good for people who use the computer."
86	86	1	3	"Dear Newspaper, as computers become more and more a part of everyday life, people begin to question whether or not they have a positive impact on people. Computers are a remarkable technological wonder that has a positive effect on people. The world - wide web, unlimited socialization, and simulations are just a few of the significant benefits of computers. The internet provides easy access to the world - wide web. Infinite amounts of detailed information can be quickly found on your computer. As education secretary, @PERSON1 stated, ""In almost every school, students rely on the internet to gain information."" Also, search engines provide access to thousands of information - loaded pages. In addition to unlimited information, the web holds thousands of different and diverse web pages. With these, people can learn about other people's unique opinions or spend enjoyable time playing games. The web is only one thing out of hundreds of great things about computers. Socialization is a huge part of the modern lifestyle. Web - based games on computers allow people to talk with friends who live miles away. No longer will people have to take an airplane to talk with friends on the other side of the world. Also, instant messaging and email are the main communication systems for thousands of people. It is the most efficient way to talk to friends. In fact, I became re - connected with a lot of people I hadn't talked to in a long time by getting emails. Everybody loves talking with their friends and family, and this is made much easier by using computers. Simulations are a huge benefit of computers. Many simulation programs are used to help people in their lives. Many professions use simulations on computers to help learn how to do their job. Nine out of ten medical schools have the use of surgery simulations as part of their training course. Also, simulations and gaming on computers reveal interests for many people. I myself have a greater interest in history now after playing many historical - themed computer games. Also, many games and computer simulations have helped many people learn new things. There are countless learning games and simulations that are accessible by computer. Simulations add huge benefits to owning a computer. As technology advances, people are opened up to many possibilities such as information via the web, unlimited socialization, and simulations. The benefits of computers are many, and the problems are few. So, how can you keep up in a world where computer users hold the advantage if you deny the benefits of computers? Computers clearly affect people in a positive way."
87	87	1	3	"Computers. One of the much - enjoyed pieces of technology. But it is also one of the many distractions. Many people ponder if computers are really beneficial. I am one of those thinkers. I think that computers don't always benefit society. They have numerous distractions such as Facebook, various online games, and even inappropriate images and videos. If you really think about it, are computers as beneficial as we think? My friend, @PERSON2 was just told about Facebook and got a membership. It just started out as a 'no big deal' kind of thing. She went online often, just to check on her status and if she had any messages in her inbox, and that was it. But then, she became full - blown addicted. She applied for all the clubs and groups on Facebook, and she started getting behind in school. She was obtaining a plethora of low grades on most of her tests after not studying because she was on the computer for almost six hours every day. @PERSON2 would come home and not even bother to do homework but would just immediately go online. After one month of being a member, she was failing most of her classes, and her mom took her computer privileges away. See, she was distracted by one, little thing, and her whole life was almost destroyed. ""But, mom, I'm in the middle of a game! And I'm winning!"" @PERSON1 says victoriously. @PERSON1 loves online games and he wins almost @PERCENT1 of the time. But, that's not the point. He plays games all the time. @PERSON1's game - playing gets in the way of the interaction between him and his family. He hasn't played with his four - year - old sister, @PERSON3 since she was two years old. His mother also often eats dinner alone. Sometimes, he even views inappropriate pictures when his mom is out shopping. When he's playing a game, a girl messages him, ""Check out my pics. They're hot!"" and he looks at them. He thinks they're harmless, but that's not what his mother thinks. His gaming has gotten in the way of his family and social life. Most people think that computers are beneficial because you can find cool information. But, you can get all kinds of information from books. Instead of typing '@ORGANIZATION1' on the computer, you could just look for it in a library. It takes less time, and you won't get carpal tunnel as easily. See? Computers aren't as beneficial as most think. There are all kinds of distractions, and these are only a few examples that clearly show the negative impacts of computers."
88	88	1	3	"Dear Newspaper, ""Oh no!"" I forgot the definition to this homework problem, and I don't have my notes. Now, in this situation, a computer would be very helpful to just type in the word and get a whole bunch of accurate results. This is why I believe having access to a computer at all times is very helpful because you can quickly find the information that you've been needing. You can get in touch with a friend if you need to or just to have a friendly chat. If you are just sitting around with nothing to do, you can just go on the computer and discover things you might not have known. Having access to a computer is really and very helpful because if you're just having a conversation with someone and you forget the name of an important fact you want to tell them, you can always just look it up. For me, a lot of the times I just need information about maybe a well - known sports player or facts about a famous historical event. Since our technology is so up - to - date, the computer is right there, loaded with many of the helpful facts we would like to know. Friends are a big part of my life, and I love just to talk to them and see how they are doing. Again, our technology is so advanced now that there are a bunch of user - friendly websites where we can talk and see how we are doing. A big reason why being able to talk to friends and family is helpful is for talking to people that are very far away and the ones you don't normally see. On a computer, you can talk to people from not only all over the U.S.A but even in other countries! Finally, the times I find having a computer around me most helpful is when I am just bored with nothing to do! I can just visit a whole bunch of interesting educational websites on things I might not have learned in school or wanted to learn. On the internet, there are many things to keep you occupied like various games, or you can even watch high - quality movies from your home onto the computer! If you have a computer around your house, you should not be bored because there are many things you can be doing or even learning! Having a computer around your house is so helpful. You can have fun, but you're even learning how to be good with technology at the same time. Computers are the future, and it's a bright one. So I suggest you pick one up and just have a great time. You won't be sorry."
89	89	1	3	Computers do benefit our society. They have significantly changed the world. You can do a wide variety of things on the internet. On the computer, you can easily chat with people everywhere. The computer helps the world in multiple ways. These are the ways how computers do benefit our society. There are many interesting things you can do on the internet. You can play exciting games with people from different places. You can talk to people on certain well - known websites. You can look up detailed vacation spots. If you're tired of being home, then just go on the internet. These are the things you can do on the internet. On the computer, there are many useful settings. Out of all of them, chatting is the best. You can be playing a game and still chat smoothly. If you're chatting with someone, you can still start chatting with another person. You can chat with people from across the world in real - time. This is why chatting is the best setting. The computer helps the world in many ways. It helps kids if they need to research something thoroughly. It helps the cops catch the bad people more efficiently. The computer helps parents get information about vacations through attractive vacation ads. This is how the computer helps the world. The computer clearly does benefit our society. It has transformed the world. You can do many things on it. On the computer, you can chat with people from anywhere effortlessly. The computer helps the world every single day. This is how the computer benefits our society, and it will continue to do so in the future.
90	90	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 of the @LOCATION1 @CAPS3, I think that computers are a good thing to use. I know that some people do use the computer instead of enjoying outdoor activities or exercising, but not everyone does that. The computer is a good resource to invest time in. The effects computers have on people are good (for the most part). The statement is true; people that use the computer can talk with people online and get information more quickly than from the library. I believe that the effects a computer has on a person are good effects. When people use a computer, they can get useful information which is essential for research and work. That's because, when you're on a computer, you can simply relax but still get a considerable amount of work done. You can also do other things while you're on the computer, like hold your dog gently, hold your cat affectionately, eat a snack, drink a beverage, text a friend, or make a call. It's very multi - purpose. But some might say that computers are a bad thing because they are very expensive, and some people don't have the money to buy a computer. However, if you do have one, it can be very beneficial. For example, @CAPS4 achieved great success. If he didn't have a computer, he might not have become so rich. Rumors say that the computer is what he needed to be successful with Microsoft. So, overall, computers are useful, and the effect they have on people is a positive one. In conclusion, we should embrace the use of computers as they bring more good than harm.
91	91	1	3	Dear local Newspaper; @CAPS1, did you know that computers can teach you to do many things? You probably do! I understand you would like to know my opinion on whether or not computers have a positive or negative effect on people. Well, I think that it has a positive effect. Computers teach you how to type and learn the main keys. It also helps you to look things up like famous people, states, countries, and etc. Lastly, it helps you to interact with other students when not in school. I encourage you to continue reading to hear my wonderful and strategic ideas.  First of all, I think that computers have a positive effect on people because it gives you the learning skills to learn how to type. I remember last year in @NUM1 grade, the tech ed teacher, Ms. @LOCATION4, told us to go on a website that was all about learning how to type. It told us that the main keys were A, S, D, F and J, K, L, and colon (;). It was very helpful. From then on I typed like that. I think that learning how to type is an excellent thing. Typing helps you if you want to become a secretary or even a newspaper editor. My mother is a secretary downtown at the law firm called: @ORGANIZATION1. She works for three offices so she learned to type really fast. Typing is a big part of your life. You can use it for a project that you have to do for class, or an essay that you have to type to apply for a scholarship or college. Typing is used everywhere, even in math class my teacher types up things and puts them on the Smart Board.  In addition, computers have a positive affect on people because they help look up famous people, states, countries, and etc. I remember in @NUM2 grade I did a project on @CAPS10, and in @NUM3 grade I did a powerpoint on I've also done a project on @LOCATION1 in @NUM1 grade, I did one on @PERSON1 this year for music, and I'm beginning one on @LOCATION2 and @LOCATION3. As you can tell, I've been using a computer, basically my whole life, except when I was a baby, but now that I think about it, when I was a baby I got a little fake computer. I know computers are everywhere but they do have a positive effect on people. When was the last time you needed a computer to help you look up something or someone? Probably not too long ago. Computers are the real deal. They can help you do anything. They've helped me my whole life.  To be continued, computers have a positive effect on people. They help interact with other people, students, and family members, when not in contact. I remember when my cousin moved away. I was so sad. I didn't want her to leave. So then she gave me her email to contact her on the computer so I could talk to her. The computer has many websites where people can interact like: Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, aol, msn, yahoo, g - mail, twitter, and many more. I like talking to people from all over the country. I talk to my friends when I'm at home. I talk to family members. My favorite website is Instagram. I am a fanatic of it. It's so much fun. Do you have a favorite interaction website? Do you have any interaction websites? If you don't you should get one.  In conclusion, I think that computers have a positive effect on people. One because they can interact with others. Two: they can look up things to help them. Three, they can develop a sense of typing. Thank you for reading my letter which I'm sure has persuaded you to agree with me on how computers have a positive effect on people.
92	92	1	3	"Readers of ""@LOCATION2 @CAPS1"" should be well informed of the benefits of computers to society. Not only do they teach hand - eye coordination, but they give people the ability to learn about faraway places and provide a means to easy, online communication.  In this day and age, good coordination is essential to prospering in society. Using computers provides a method of both establishing and improving hand - eye coordination from the comfort of your own household or workplace. Dr. @DR1, of @ORGANIZATION1 medical center, says that a recent study shows @NUM1 out of every @NUM2 computer users have better hand - eye coordination than people who do not operate on a computer regularly. In a local primary school, students have begun to ""Type to learn"", a program that promotes quick typing. School officials have seen a dramatic increase in the typing speed of children since the program was started in @DATE1. In this way, the computer provides a secure route to better hand - eye coordination. Even more importantly, the hand - eye coordination gained from using a computer can increase the chances of getting a job involving computer hand - eye coordination as an adult such as the position of a secretary or graphic designer.  While hand - eye coordination is a factor of computers that has an extremely positive effect on people, the ability to learn about distant places with the touch of a keyboard is even more beneficial towards all users. Websites such as Google and Yahoo can track down millions of results in a matter of seconds if you search the name of a city or country. This can be handy when working on school projects as well; instead of having to lug tens of heavy books home to finish an essay on @LOCATION1, you can simply look up the information on a computer at your house. When summertime comes around, and the last school bell rings, you can instead research faraway places that could turn into vacation spots instead of homework assignments. All of the travel information from plane tickets to the right currency is at your fingertips on a computer. If ""@LOCATION2 @CAPS1"" readers were aware of this, lots of trouble would be prevented and lots of time would be saved.  The one component of computers that is used even more than research is online communication. State officials, governors, and even the president can post messages on websites for citizens to view while they check the weather or their email. This is a much easier way to hear government statements than waiting through endless commercials to hear speeches on the TV. Social networking sites are also immensely popular, and on pages like Facebook and Twitter you can reconnect with people who you don't have the chance to see everyday, or don't live in relative vicinity. If your cousin is going to school abroad, and did not have access to an international phone, you could communicate with them through email on the computer, and it would be as if they never left.  It is ridiculous to think that someone could find computers - the gateway to faraway places, good hand - eye coordination, and the connection to distant friends and family - a concern to society. They help us in countless ways and ""@CAPS5 @CAPS1"" readers should be aware of this."
93	93	1	3	Dear Newspaper people, I'm here to tell you that computers have a bad effect on people. The computer may hold lots of information but does it always hold the right information? You could do lots of other stuff than just lay around on the computer.  Also, the computer is very distracting. The computer may give you the wrong info. Instead of going through the process of turning on your computer, searching for the info and turning it off, which takes more time than finding a book, opening it, finding the info, closing it and putting it back. Books more often are correct. Computers take more time to find info than a book. Computers give you too much information compared to a book.  There's plenty of other stuff to do than play on the computer. You could read an interesting book or draw a beautiful picture. You could also play outside and shoot hoops or take a nice bike ride. You can call up your friends and play games with them. If you're really bored and you don't know what to do, you can make up a new game.  At times, computers could distract you. If you want to get homework done and you have a computer, it easily gets you off topic. If you're at work with a computer, it's very tempting. Even seeing other people on computers is distracting. If you're working on the computer, it does not take much to take the thing you need to search like @ORGANIZATION1 and change it to something you want to search like @ORGANIZATION1 company.  See what I mean by a negative effect? It doesn't give you the right info always, you could do better things in life and it is very distracting. It is what makes the workers turn into procrastinators and the fit turn into the lazy. Computers have entered our world and have altered all of our lives! Computers have made a big change to everyday life. Please agree with me.
94	94	1	3	"Although some people believe that computers turn us children into zombies, I believe that they affect us in a positive way. Computers can help us explore far - away places that we may never go to. Maybe help us connect with an old friend or just give a little help on homeworks.  One reason why I think computers are only helping us is they help us explore other places. I know for a fact that every kid dreams of a place that they would love to visit. But not all of us can afford to travel far away. Most families however, do have computers. With these computers, kids, with a parent's permission, can use the internet to learn tons of cool facts about their dream place. ""I have always wanted to go to @LOCATION1 but my parents just don't have the proper income"" said @PERSON1 of @CAPS1 - @CAPS2 @CAPS3 school. ""I used my computer and the internet to discover hundreds of amazing facts on it."" As you can see computers can help people realize their dreams.  Another reason why I think computers are good is they help you connect with friends. If you are like me, you like to talk to your friends a lot! But sometimes they are too far away to call if you don't want to pay for it. A solution is a new wonderful machine called the computer! You can chat long distances without paying for it. This is especially good for me because not too long ago, one of my best friends moved away to @LOCATION2. I thought I would never talk to him again. Then I learned about instant messaging. It allows you to talk whenever you want, wherever you want! Now, me and my friend can stay in touch and so can you!  My final reason as to why I think computers are good is they can help you on homework too. Ever have a tricky math problem you couldn't figure out? How about the capital of a state that you've never visited slipped your mind? Well the computer can solve both of those problems and more! @PERCENT1 of computers these days come with software in them that comes with a calculator. For the other @PERCENT1 you can download and install software onto your computer for a low price. And every computer made in this world has internet capabilities. All you need to do is turn it on and get ready for a ride!  Don't worry about too much computer use, because computers can only help us not hurt us. Remember, computers help us live our dreams to the full extent. They also help us connect with one another, and help us excel in school. So get on, and get going. Have you used your computer today?"
95	95	1	3	Dear Newspaper, I think computers are great. They are really helpful. They can teach us about various things. Also, they have fun games and interesting websites, which is always a plus.  Computers are helpful in lots of things. For example, if you need to look something up for school, you can just easily go on the computer and find it. Also, some teachers have websites now. Instead of bringing a big and heavy social studies book home, you can go on the internet and use the online book. Did you know that @PERCENT1 of @CAPS1 students would rather use the internet book than taking the actual one home? Also, if you forgot to write down your homework, there's a website to look up all the homework you have.  Computers can teach us things. There are websites that have math games and other school - related things. Also, you can easily go on Google and look up things, and it can give you thousands of pieces of information.  Lastly, the internet is a good source for fun. There are millions of games on the internet and also fun websites like Facebook. Did you know @PERCENT2 of @CAPS1 students use the computer for the games and online talking? This also gives kids lots of things to do on a rainy day.  So whether you're using the internet for its helpfulness, its resources, or just for the fun games and websites, computers are really helpful. They have become an important part of our lives and bring a lot of convenience and joy.
96	96	1	3	The use of computers is definitely correct. It is extremely helpful as you can discover new things and much more. Computers make people's lives just so much simpler. Computers can assist people in magnificent ways by looking for things you desperately need. For instance, if you were a student and you had to write a paper on @PERSON1, the computer has the internet which contains billions of facts about @PERSON1 and a vast amount of information about everything. It can also be useful by looking up the weather, the news, even things that are happening around the world and answering questions you have. Discovering things on the computer is an everyday occurrence. For example, I read an article about the @CAPS1 and the @CAPS2 @CAPS3. The next day, my teachers gave us a pop quiz on that and I got @NUM1. If a computer can help someone get a @NUM1 on their test, think of what else it could do for the world. It might even help save lives. Of course, a computer can be helpful. In ways like checking the score from yesterday's game, seeing what's going on in your community, watching videos, listening to music, talking to your friends and relatives, getting information on places and medical stuff. A computer can basically do everything from looking up the game scores to saving a life. The use of computers is, obviously, the best decision. In conclusion, computers have become an indispensable part of our lives, offering numerous benefits and making various tasks easier and more efficient.
97	97	1	3	Dear Local @CAPS1, I think computers benefit society greatly. Most of what we do today could not happen without computers. The biggest use of computers is communication. If you're in @LOCATION1 on a business trip but need to send a letter to your company, you can send an email which is much less expensive than paying for a piece of @CAPS1. The experts' concern that people aren't spending enough time with family and friends is a valid point. Many people communicate with family and friends through computers. I hardly ever get to talk to my cousin if I couldn't go on Facebook. I would have had to wait another month to find out my other cousin was engaged if I didn't follow her on @CAPS2. If the concern is face - to - face contact, the computer has a solution for that too, a video messaging site called ooVoo. Another way computers allow communication is through the sharing of information. Many facts needed for school are spread out in hundreds of books. Over the @CAPS3, I've done research for a project and have been able to get facts from the @ORGANIZATION1 and @ORGANIZATION2 about crime stats. Many times, researching an animal will lead you online because more modern books note good websites to visit for more information. Without the @CAPS3, a simple research project could take months. Some scientists think people are spending too much time on the computer. This is both right and wrong. Sitting at a computer watching YouTube for hours is not necessarily the best thing. However, the @CAPS4 has also designed a game so that you can have fun while getting exercise. Computers are like chocolate. They can be good, but too much is a bad thing. In conclusion, while computers have some drawbacks, their overall contribution to communication and information sharing in society is undeniable, and with proper use, they can be a great asset.
98	98	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, In this new digital age, computers are becoming more and more advanced. You can do just about anything with computers now, from talking to people to learning about faraway places. It is not all as wonderful as it seems, though, as people's lives have been ruined because of the internet. It is for that reason that computers are not a benefit to our society. With computers, we can learn anything, go shopping, and contact friends. For many, this eliminates the purpose of going outside. You can live your entire life indoors. This lack of exercise can lead to obesity. Also, living this secluded lifestyle can cut off ties with your friends and family. In order to use computers wisely, we have to learn how to balance computer time with an active lifestyle. The problem is, not many people do that. Furthermore, going online too much has been known to create a second life. With websites like @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and @CAPS3, you can have a whole different online life, with friends that you haven't even seen before. Sometimes, people have even been known to think that their online life is better and get sucked into it. Take @CAPS4 of @CAPS5 for example. It is very popular but also extremely addictive. Some play until their entire lives are devoted to playing. The same goes for @CAPS6 of @CAPS7. This obsession with online games or @CAPS8 is not what the internet was made for. Also, people's lives and reputations have been ruined by computers. Cyberbullying is spreading like wildfire. It's anonymous and can be detrimental to the lives of others. Internet videos of people acting foolishly never go away. There is one video of a college guy playing with a golf ball retriever like a sword called @CAPS9 kid. The video has been viewed over @NUM1 million times. The guy in the video was made fun of for years, sued the people who put the tape online, and was forced into depression. Moving on, people can literally have their lives taken away with computers too. Identity and credit card theft is becoming more and more common. Even my dad had his credit card account stolen last year. Computers may have some uses, but they can cause much more harm. In conclusion, while computers offer certain conveniences, the negative impacts they bring, such as addiction, cyberbullying, and theft, far outweigh the benefits, making them a detriment to society.
99	99	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1: Have you been sent a photo of a @NUM1 - year - old child with no clothes on? Well, if you have, this is called sexting. It can be put on the computer or any type of device. People should limit their children's use of computers more because it can lead to bad things like sexting from teens, being bad for the younger kids, and teens could be talking to someone they don't know. Lexi @NUM1 says that ""she has been getting Facebook texts to her cell phone of other teenage kids that are explicit"". @PERCENT1 of the @LOCATION1 population of teenagers have @CAPS2, @CAPS3, and @CAPS4 chat. Any of these websites can forward photos to their mobile devices. This has gotten out of hand, and whatever is on the computer now will be there forever. More children under the age of @NUM3 years old are on the computer now. There are chat rooms where they can interact with others. For example, @PERSON1 is a children's game that has a chatting interaction, where you can talk to whoever. But when you create this @PERSON1, your child has to give a parent's email address where they have to read the following terms to choose for their child. But most parents don't even read it. @PERCENT2 of these parents just agree to these terms and don't even read them. @PERSON2 was followed home from soccer practice when a man about @NUM4"" and around the age of @NUM5 said ""@PERSON2 come get some candy"". @PERSON2 said ""how do you know my name""? ""@CAPS5 said cause I play with you all the time"". @PERSON2 quickly ran home and told his parents. @PERSON2 plays on @CAPS6, another interaction game, and told this stranger that @CAPS5 lives in @LOCATION2 field and @CAPS5 goes to @LOCATION2 @CAPS7. Giving strangers your information, they can trace you down and find the street you live on. We need to keep our children safe and limit their computer use so that sexting stops, young children stay away from potential dangers, and kidnapping attempts are reduced. Help @LOCATION1, @CAPS8 to become a safe place for our children. In conclusion, protecting children from the potential risks associated with computer use is of utmost importance, and we must take steps to ensure their safety in the digital age."
100	100	1	3	Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1, do you know how long you go on the computer for? Well, get up and go outside. That's one of my reasons why I think people spend too much time on it. Another reason is that it can damage your eyesight. It's a nice sunny day, don't waste your time on the computer! Go outside! All kids @CAPS1 are just sitting on the computer all day without getting exercise. Did you know that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 kids that sit on the computers all day gain at least @NUM3 pounds? @PERSON1 told me that. I mean, I believe him because it's true that kids don't get up. They're missing a nice day out. Would you want to miss a nice sunny day? My final reason is that kids' eyesight can go bad. I mean, having them stare at a screen all day is really bad. @PERSON1 told me that if you're on the computer for @NUM4 hours straight, your eyes can get worse. I remember one time when I was on the computer for @NUM4 1/@NUM4 hours, my eyes were killing me every time I blinked. I know the computer is fun for playing games, talking to friends, but you should take a break and do something else. In conclusion, spending excessive time on the computer has negative impacts on both physical health and eyesight. We should make the most of nice days outdoors and limit our computer usage for a healthier lifestyle.
101	101	1	3	"Dear Local Newspaper, Have you ever gone somewhere exciting, snapped some great pictures, and then posted them on the computer? If you have, you'll vividly remember the wonderful places you visited. But at least you went to @ORGANIZATION1, or @LOCATION1 or some other interesting place. There are some people who are glued to the computer all day. Instead of experiencing the beauty of nature and embracing the adventures that @CAPS1 life brings to them, they are mindlessly scrolling through facebook or youtube all day. This disgusts me because there are so many fun, beautiful, and entertaining things to do out there. In @CAPS2 opinion, I firmly think computers have negative effects on people. People miss out on the joy of enjoying nature or having meaningful interactions with friends and family. Some people don't get any exercise anymore, and it's truly sad to see obese people just sitting there, doing nothing to improve their lives. First, I'd like to talk about obesity. Did you know that @PERCENT1 of children are obese at a young age? Computers take the place of physical activities for young boys and girls. They should be outside, playing exciting sports like basketball or soccer. Another concerning thing is those game websites. Children get so engrossed in a computer game that everything around them just fades away. All they worry about is winning the game. While playing this game, they might be munching on doritos. Sooner or later, they gain five pounds. Then they'll regret not exercising and will find it difficult to move. Later in life, when things go wrong for them, they'll realize how many fantastic things they missed. Then they'll say, ""@CAPS1 did I do with @CAPS2 life?"" @CAPS2 next point shows that people are not enjoying nature. Have you ever taken a leisurely walk in the park, breathing in the fresh air and feeling the gentle breeze? I know I have. Well, people just sit inside all day, only taking a quick peek out the window, without even thinking about going outside. Nature is incredibly beautiful, it has a lovely smell, and it can be so refreshing at times. But no, people just plop on their butt all day, on the computer, accomplishing absolutely nothing. Why can't they go outside for a nice walk or a brisk jog? People could see cute animals like squirrels climbing up a tree. How adorable. But instead, they play a virtual game where you shoot squirrels with a paint ball gun. So much is missed because of computers. As much as not enjoying nature upsets me, some people even blow off their own family just to watch a re - run of family guy on youtube. @CAPS1 have we come to? Some children even hit their parents because the parents shut the computer off. I'd rather enjoy a delicious meal with @CAPS2 family and then just sit down, relax, and have a heart - to - heart talk. Also, some people don't get enough sleep because they are ""doing something important"" on the computer and end up missing a family trip or even school. In conclusion, I firmly believe that computers are bad because of obesity, missing out on nature, and not enjoying the company of family & friends."
102	102	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, Experts should not be overly concerned about other people who stay on the computer for a while. Maybe people know exactly what they are doing and have valid reasons to stay on computers for a long time. They also might have a genuine interest in learning things that they never thought about learning before. Most people actually make an effort not to be overweight. Experts should not try to reduce the number of people using the computer. One reason is that people can have meaningful chats with one another. It can be with friends, families, and even colleagues. About @PERCENT1 of people regularly chat online with their families or friends. Chatting can also be extremely helpful in case of an emergency. You can quickly tell someone what is going on and then call the cops if needed. Without a doubt, chatting online is a great way to use the computer during the time you're on it. Another reason is that you can search for any information you need to know. Maybe if you have to search for something for school, like a complex topic for a project, the computer can provide you with a wealth of knowledge. This can have positive effects on people. It can expand someone's knowledge and make them a better - informed person. You can't deny that having the ability to search for anything is a fantastic way of using a computer for a while. A third reason is that it can teach you hand - eye coordination and gives people the opportunity to learn about faraway places and people. You can learn about things you have never even dreamed of learning. There are so many unique people and beautiful places in the world that you still have to discover. Is it surprising to you that almost everyone and anyplace that is famous is on the internet? Using the computer in this way is another terrific idea. These are all great ways of using the computer. Being on the computer for a while is not a waste of time. People can use their time wisely on the computer. Surprisingly, it is true that all of these reasons are beneficial for the time spent on the computer. So, instead of trying to make people be on the computer less often, we should encourage them to use it in these positive ways.
103	103	1	3	"Dear Local Newspaper, Have you ever been running late to a party and suddenly just realize you don't have the directions to the person's house? Have you ever had to write an important paper and there weren't any books or encyclopedias available nearby? Or have you ever just wanted to catch up with an old friend from your childhood? @CAPS1 you answered yes to at least one of these questions, there is a high probability that you have used a computer in your lifetime. Computers have positive effects because they can give you quick and reliable @CAPS2 and they can be a lot of fun too. To begin with, let's go back to that example in the paragraph above. Have you ever been running late to a party and realize you do not have the directions to the person's house? @CAPS1 you have, there are two things you can do in that situation. You can call up the person, but they probably won't answer because they're having @CAPS4 fun at their party, or you can go on the computer, type the person's address in, and you will have your directions in just a few seconds. Call me crazy, but this way seems quicker, more efficient, and far more reliable. My mother always says to me, ""@CAPS1 you're in @CAPS4 trouble finding @CAPS2, go on the computer,"" because she knows that there is all the @CAPS2 that is in books, and even more, on the @CAPS3, and it's just one click away. Once you're sold on that, it's clear that the computer has positive effects on you because it gives you quick and reliable @CAPS2. In addition, computers have positive effects on you when you're trying to have fun. For example, @CAPS5 is a popular platform. @CAPS5 is used by both teens and adults alike, and for one main reason only, to socialize with friends via computer. @CAPS1 you're waiting for another date and you're eager to see what your last friend's been up to, the best thing to do would be to go on @CAPS5 and ask. A @ORGANIZATION1 shows that in a family of five, four of them use the @CAPS3 to communicate and socialize with friends. Obviously, this is how computers have a positive effect. In conclusion, whether you're bored at home on a rainy day, or @CAPS1 you have to write a research paper that you saved until the last minute, a computer will be there for you. The positive effects that computers have are that they are quick and reliable sources of information, and they are also a lot of fun to use."
104	104	1	3	Dear The @CAPS1, @CAPS2 has been an ongoing argument whether computers do or do not have a positive effect on people. Some believe that computers have negative effects on people, for example, spending too much time on them, not getting enough exercise, and not interacting with family and friends. However, I firmly believe computers have a positive effect on people because it teaches hand - eye coordination, lets people know about faraway places, and allows people to talk online. To conclude, computers have a positive effect on people. Did you know hand - eye coordination can be extremely helpful at times? Well, it's true because if you are in a difficult situation and the phone is broken and you don't have a cellphone, then you can send an emergency e - mail to one of your friends informing them to call for help. Since you have hand - eye coordination, you can type without having to look down, which can save precious time. Also, if you're in college and have an important essay due tomorrow, hand - eye coordination can really help you write down notes quickly without having to constantly look back at the writing paper. Finally, with hand - eye coordination, it can be a great asset if you join the army. If you spot a threat, you can aim and shoot quickly without having to take out the gun after the threat attacks. To conclude, computers teach hand - eye coordination. Have you ever had a strong desire to go to a foreign place, to experience a different culture and see new sights? Well, with computers, you can do that. You can just search the place and see what the place has to offer, from its famous landmarks to its local cuisine. Furthermore, if you want to learn to speak a foreign language, you can easily do it. All you have to do is type in the language with a question and search. It's so easy that even a child can do it. Finally, if you want to learn how to cook like they do in foreign places, just type in the type of food or its name and search. To summarize, computers let people know about foreign places. Have you ever had that feeling that you really want to talk to somebody, share your joys and sorrows? I know I have. This is why computers can help you talk to people online. Just type in the person's e - mail addresses and start typing the message. Also, you don't have to waste money on paper and envelopes. Finally, having an e - mail is free, so you can talk as much as you want. To conclude, computers help people talk online. In summarization, computers have a positive effect on people. It helps them develop hand - eye coordination, learn about new places, and communicate with others.
105	105	1	3	"Computers are used worldwide every single day, and most of the time @CAPS2 is used for a very good reason. Computers help out by making it possible to get all the information you want, like when you're planning a trip. @CAPS1 you wanted to go to a close but fancy restaurant, you could @MONTH1 use a computer so you know exactly how far it is. Computers also help out, making it possible to talk to friends that you haven't seen for years. @CAPS2 is also a great way to meet new people. Let's say you are really stressed at work or school and you forget your book, you can usually bring up @CAPS2 on the computer and do @CAPS2 there. First, computers help out with traveling, sight - seeing and lots more. When you travel, don't you want to know every single detail? And the biggest detail you want to know is the cost, and the computer can usually give you a close - to - exact price for everything, from flights to hotel rooms. Now that helps out a great deal when you're traveling the world. And also when you're sight - seeing, you usually want to find either the most amazing or romantic spot where you are. And @CAPS1 you type in ""the most romantic spot in somers"", @CAPS2 should come up with a bunch of wonderful spots. So don't drive for miles just to get a map or brochure, use your computer and print one off. Second, @CAPS1 there was a friend you haven't seen in years and you want to talk, you can go on the computer. The computer helps in so many ways. @CAPS2 could even tell you where this person lives and you could surprise visit him/her. When you're on the computer, you can even meet new friends and have interesting conversations with them, and even meet them someday in person. And @CAPS1 you and that new friend get along well, then maybe you and that person could become best friends. So @CAPS1 you haven't seen or talked to someone in a while that you knew, use the computer to have a chat. Third, say your teacher or boss yelled at you today and no one has been nice to you all day and you forget your homework book or paperwork. Where do you go? The computer. @CAPS2 can bring up most any paper work or work book you need to get the job done. @CAPS1 you forgot your homework book, you don't want to get a low grade on this homework. So you go to your computer from there. And @CAPS1 you forgot your paper work, and @CAPS1 you didn't finish this project for work tonight you would be fired, you could just go on the computer, find the work and finish @CAPS2, and also save your job. So that's why computers help out so much in this lifetime. Last, that is why in this lifetime you need computers. They help us with our vacation trips, providing us with essential information. They help with conversations with old friends we haven't seen for ages. Also, they help with your school and job work. At least @PERCENT1 of our population use computers every day, and without them, our society would face many difficulties. So we should recognize the importance of computers and make good use of them."
106	106	1	3	"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, I firmly believe that computers are highly beneficial to today's society. Not only do computers help us easily connect with people across the globe, but think of how incredibly efficient they can be in various tasks. And you can't neglect the fact that computers offer a rich profusion of entertainment options. So before you say, ""Computers are ruining our society."", please carefully read my reasons why computers are essential. What is the first thing that comes to mind when you hear 'computers'? Many people think of the chatrooms and @CAPS2's. Those are two prime examples of how a computer can bring people together. Imagine you're doing a detailed report on life in @LOCATION1. However, all you can find are those generic articles in old books. A simple and effective solution is talking online to an actual person who lives in @LOCATION1. Computers can even help connect family members who live long - distance from each other. I know that I would be overflowing with bliss if an aunt or uncle contacted me through '@CAPS3' or e - mail. In addition to connecting with people, computers are very efficient. As students mature, homework is taken seriously. For instance, one of my friends handed in an essay and our teacher did not accept it. Her penmanship was not legible. Typing homework is an easy alternative to handing in messy, unsophisticated work. The efficiency of a computer is also recognized when trying to accomplish seemingly simple tasks. Just imagine how often you'd get lost without your digital directions. Or how much you'd mess up if you didn't print out a well - formatted recipe for dinner. Most importantly, computers are the virtual gateway to all sorts of entertainment. Whether you like playing exciting computer games or even if shopping for the best deal is your game; a computer will suit you perfectly. There are thousands of interesting websites to visit and even more engaging games just waiting to be played. A computer is anyone's passport to leisure and enjoyments. So you make the choice. Is a computer going to benefit society, or will they have catastrophic results? I urge you to remember; computers are a great way to connect with people and they are highly efficient. Most of all, remember how much you can achieve with a computer. In conclusion, computers are an indispensable part of modern society, offering numerous benefits in communication, work, and entertainment."
107	107	1	3	Dear @LOCATION1, have you ever had your computer crash, and you needed to do a crucial presentation? Well if so, that means you probably had to do your presentation on paper, the old - fashioned way. Recently, there has been a heated debate going on between experts about computers. Some think they make your life more efficient while others think they make you spend too much time on them rather than outdoors. I firmly believe that computers make our lives easier and that the advances in technology have a positive effect on people. I think this because it teaches you valuable skills and updates you on info around the world, it's efficient for work and helps the environment, and lastly, it lets people stay in touch. Computers have a positive effect on people because it lets family members stay in touch. Emails are an excellent example of this. Instead of mailing a letter, you are electronically sending it. The person receives it quicker and can answer in a more timely manner. Also, social networking sites help families keep in touch. One well - known example of this is Facebook. You can see what the person is doing and chat with them using Facebook chat. I relate to this. My cousin lives in @LOCATION2, so I don't see him a lot. Through Facebook, we can talk and update each other on our lives. Lastly, you can see pictures of your family. Many families have accounts on photo - sharing sites. This enables them to see pictures of recent vacations or sporting events. They can comment and every member of the family can see how everyone looks and changes throughout the year. That is how computers let people stay in touch. Another reason why computers have a positive effect on people is because it teaches you skills and updates you on information. Computers teach you hand - eye coordination. When you type with a keyboard, you have to know where each letter is. This makes it possible to look at the screen to recognize your errors. Hand - eye coordination is a good skill for everyone to know. Computers update you on world news. Many homepages on the internet have news engines built into them. These news engines keep people updated on major news events. For example, the war in @LOCATION5, or more recently, the @LOCATION3 and @LOCATION4 earthquakes. Without the internet, we would be very behind on important news updates around the world. My last reason why computers have a positive effect on people is because it is efficient for work and they help the environment. Computers help the environment because you are not using as much paper. Throughout the year, @CAPS2 use billions of sheets of paper to write letters. With computers, that number goes down into the thousands. Why, you may ask? Emails don't require paper. They are electronic, which means no paper. They are also environmentally friendly because newspaper companies are going out of business. Due to online newspapers, printed newspapers are becoming less and less popular. Computers are efficient for work because it is so easy to make presentations. There are so many useful programs to use, that making a big presentation could take just minutes. In conclusion, computers are a boon to humanity, offering benefits in communication, knowledge acquisition, work efficiency, and environmental conservation.
108	108	1	3	"I saw in one of the news papers I got in the mail that had an overnight opportunity for people to state their opinion on kids' computer usage. I took the idea and decided to write this letter. Multiple people do have to use computers for multiple important things. Such as: homework assignments such as detailed essays, sometimes family members go off to war but can't use cell phones, also online job applications. To start off with, kids have homework assignments, right? Most of the time people have to do long and complex essays. I often ask my mom if I can do an essay for school, and she says, ""Why don't you stay after to do it?"" But kids have busy lives so they can't stay after school. Also, at school the computers don't let you go on most websites unlike at home which does. That's mostly one main reason kids use computers a lot. Next, some family members go off to war. Normally for safety and privacy, they won't let the soldiers carry their cellphones, but for other reasons they can use their computers. Usually your family members know that you have a computer and want to contact you so that they can let you know they're okay so you don't have to worry for two years. So, at the base they are at, you can talk to them over video mail. I have an @CAPS2 that went to @ORGANIZATION1 and is now in @LOCATION2, and we sometimes talk to him over chat when he was in @LOCATION1. Lastly, job applications. Most of the time people are home - bound but need a job. Tons of @CAPS3 commercials show advertisements for jobs online. This is good for all types of people, home - bound, elderly, etc. But mostly it's good because they sometimes let you have your own business and you still get good pay. In conclusion, some people don't go online just to be online; they actually are doing something important such as talking to their loved ones that they won't see for a long period of time, also completing school assignments. Plus, if people don't know others very well, how do they know if they're active or not? Kids and adults should still be able to use computers whenever they want. In essence, computer usage serves many practical and necessary purposes in our lives."
109	109	1	3	"Dear editor, my name is @PERSON1, and I firmly believe that computers are a great benefit to the world, and people as well. I say this because lots of people can easily talk to family or friends long - distance. Also, the computer can teach you lots of useful things. Finally, it makes you more social. In my strong opinion, computers are better for the world. Firstly, many people can talk long - distance with family or friends. You have a webcam and that allows you to have a face - to - face chat and clearly see the person. Also, @CAPS2 is another popular site where you can talk to friends. You can have a profile and put pictures of yourself and even interesting videos. Even though you can talk on the phone and do some of these things, but on the phone it costs money for a plan. When you use a computer, it is completely free. Secondly, the computer teaches you things that help you later on in life, and it lets you know things as well. The computer experts made programs that are really cool. The programs teach you how to type, for example, there are programs called ""Type to Learn"" or ""Type for Fun"". Also, they have programs that let you know how to read. It is great for kids because they need to know these things anyway. Finally, the computer makes you more social. This is because you have @CAPS2 and it lets you know things that happen in school or out of school. You can talk to people on @CAPS2 or email each other and have a meaningful conversation with them. You can also meet new people from other places and have a good relationship with them. You get to know your friends well and won't need to figure out who they are. So, this is why I believe that having a computer is a good idea, and good to have. You can talk to people long - distance. The computer teaches you things for life. Finally, it makes you more social with people. So, in my strong opinion, it is a great idea to have a computer. In conclusion, computers are a valuable asset, enhancing communication, education, and social interaction in our lives."
110	110	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I think computers are extremely good to society, because you can conveniently read the news paper online, easily email your friends and family, and can enjoy playing games and watching interesting videos or movies. Knowing the latest news is very important. Newspapers are okay but you have to pay for them. With the online newspaper, you can get the latest news for free! This way you can not only save money but also save trees. Here's another way of saving trees. E - mailing is a great way to talk to someone far away and it's a lot faster than just regular old mailing. E - mail is also good for e - mailing links to cool websites. On e - mail, you can send a funny picture or a video or an important notice. So, computers can be your news source and a good and fast way of communication. It also can be useful for entertainment. Computers are one of the most popular entertainment sources. Computers allow you to go on exciting game sites, watch high - quality videos or movies or play on an online game on just a regular @CAPS1 game. I know whenever I'm bored I go on my computer and I can always find something interesting to do online or find a great movie to watch. So, computers are very popular. In many areas, computers are helpful in news, communication, and entertainment. People just need to look at the positive aspects of computers, then they will see how great they are. In conclusion, computers are an all - in - one solution for news, communication, and entertainment, making our lives more convenient and enjoyable.
111	111	1	3	@CAPS1 judgment comes from experience, and experience comes from bad judgment, as quoted from my uncle's dad. Computers haven't been accessible to the public for a long time, so the public has limited experience with them. Therefore, the public also lacks @CAPS1 judgment in using computers, and the detrimental effects are starting to become evident. Computers have caused harm to people! To begin with, computers can be a @CAPS2 concern for people. In studies conducted in @LOCATION1, @NUM1 out of @NUM2 @CAPS3 who spend their time (@NUM3 or more hours) in front of the computer are wearing glasses. This is because of the adverse @CAPS2 effects the screen has on your eyes. Furthermore, computer games are designed to be addictive, which causes @CAPS3 to sit in front of the computer instead of engaging in physical exercise. This @MONTH1 be one of the biggest causes of obesity in @LOCATION2! My little brother used to be addicted to a flying game, and he sat in front of it for hours every day and started to gain weight. As soon as he stopped playing it and started going outside more, he immediately started to lose weight. Therefore, people need to move around more instead of sitting in front of the computer. To continue, my second argument is about the detrimental effects computers have on the environment. First, computers need electricity to operate. That electricity comes from power plants. Over @PERCENT1 of @LOCATION2's power plants are coal, petroleum, or natural gas - based. When people turn on the computer out of boredom, it wastes electricity that is not necessary. Furthermore, scientists suspect that humans are now a major cause of global warming. It is common sense that those power plants burn their respective fuels to generate electricity. In other words, there is a definite connection between computers and global warming. Also, the power plants release pollutants into the air that can eventually cause acid rain. To end with, my last argument is about people's skills. In a school survey, @CAPS3 who used their computers for more than @NUM4 hours per day didn't know how to cook or how to even light a match! There is a definite connection between the two as most people just put something in the microwave to eat so that they can go back to the computers as quickly as possible. The matches are usually lit by parents to light fires or candles. But what happens when a natural disaster strikes like in @LOCATION3 or @LOCATION4? How will @CAPS3 be able to take care of themselves? The only way to cook would be with fire. There wouldn't be microwaves to cook canned food with. Furthermore, how would @CAPS3 be able to even start a fire without @CAPS4 how to light a match? Evidently, excessive computer use could have very detrimental effects in a natural disaster, even to adults, so we need to stop it! Do you want @LOCATION2 to be thought of as @CAPS5 and @CAPS6? Should the environment, our only home, suffer because of a few bored people? How will we handle a major natural disaster? In conclusion, people are spending too much time on their computers, and they need to stop! People are becoming @CAPS6, @CAPS7 the environment, and losing important life skills. We need to all come together and cooperate to keep people healthy, to retain our life skills, but most importantly, save our one and only beautiful @LOCATION5.
112	112	1	3	"Dear @PERSON1, @CAPS1 these days are advising kids to go outside instead of just sitting idly in front of a computer. Computers can often promote bad habits. I try not to use the computer unless it is necessary for school or to complete homework. Please consider the negative effects, which include inappropriate content exposure and less interaction with friends and family. Yes, the internet can be used to find diets and exercise plans, but if you would simply go to the gym to burn off those pounds, everything would be just fine! The internet and computers are designed to captivate your attention and draw you into all the websites and interesting things. It is more effective just to go to a local @ORGANIZATION2 or @ORGANIZATION1 to work out. I swim on a swim team for a @ORGANIZATION2. I love swimming more than going on the computer. It meets my personal needs for exercise. I lost @NUM1 pounds by just swimming for a month. I also run on the treadmill to help me relieve stress or anger. Gyms are far better than computers. I know most of us have seen something inappropriate on the computer. Yes, computers provide people with jobs, but there is no need to post pictures or messages that will hurt people's feelings. I know the other day I saw a really mean comment that made me feel bad for the victim. I know YouTube is trying to stop inappropriate content, so that's good for them. Once you share something on the internet, it is there forever. Yes, computers have ways to keep in touch with friends, but it is better to @CAPS3 or visit in person. Like my @CAPS2 always said, ""@CAPS3 more, it builds character!"" @CAPS4 ever I get the chance, I @CAPS3 my best buddies instead of using the computer. Kids these days can be mean without even trying. You disconnect yourself from your family. Because computers attract users, there are times when you don't pay attention to others around you. @PERCENT1 of kids do not do their homework because of computers. Thank you for your time. I think computers are bad, and everyone would be happier without them. They contribute to the obesity level in the nation, allow cyber - bullying and inappropriate content to spread around the internet, and lastly, block you out from the world. ( @CAPS5.S someday computers are going to take over the world, and you will be sorry you didn't listen to me.)"
113	113	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 paper, @CAPS2 name is @PERSON1, and I am writing this letter regarding the computer issue. @CAPS2 view on this subject is the opposite. People @MONTH1 spend more time on the computer than exercising, but they could still be social. There are platforms like Facebook, @CAPS3, and chat rooms. You can talk to your friends on them, so they are being social. Not being physically social but verbally social. The experts say that we are not enjoying the outdoors, but they overlooked something. If we were not enjoying the outdoors, then half of America would be as pale as can be. Then there are laptops. You can use them outdoors. People with laptops can go outside on a sunny day, grab some fruit, and relax. You could stay out there until the battery drains. Then just plug it in and keep relaxing; it's easy. Computers also help stimulate your imagination. Some computer games help expand your imagination because when you are playing games, you think of things that could enhance the game. Simulators help you design or even control things. Some games allow you to design and play as a character you created. They can give you an idea about jobs that you might be interested in. For me, computer games expanded @CAPS2 drawing skills. All these things can be reversed. No one is a robot that repeats the same actions over and over again. Humanity has the power to get off the computer and go outside or be social. As I just demonstrated, everything you can physically do can also be done in some way on the computer. In conclusion, while there are concerns about computer use, it also offers many benefits, and we should not overly demonize it.
114	114	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Computers have a positive impact on people and also serve as a teaching tool. So I think computers are very important and are needed in people's lives. We can learn information about the world and what is happening around us. It also helps us communicate with friends and family. Lastly, it can assist us in gathering information for homework and projects. First, while we are on the computer, it provides us with details about the world and different countries. The computers tell us about the status of wars and what the president is doing. The computer also gives us information about local news, such as the weather, traffic reports, and if there has been a crime that has occurred. We can also find out about the stock market, which is very important to many people. Second, the computer enables us to talk with friends and family. AIM, @CAPS3, and @CAPS4 are all different means of interacting with each other. Also, if we forget to hand something in at school, we can always just email our teachers the information they might need by a specific date. If a student forgets what the homework was, we can just ask on the computer. Many people find old friends that they haven't seen in years, and getting to see them again and learn about their families can make someone feel happy about knowing that their old friend has had a good life. Lastly, if students have a project or homework that requires information, the computer can always be of help. On the computer, there is a vast amount of information about people, places, things, and anything you want to know. The computer provides answers to questions you @MONTH1 have. You can get pictures and information about the thing you are looking up. It also gives you the location and dates of different events that have happened in what you are researching. Computers are very useful when it comes to students' education. In conclusion, Computers are a very important part of everyone's life. They help us learn about information happening in the world, talk to friends or family, and assist with school work. Even if people aren't exercising as much, they are increasing their knowledge by finding information. You can still enjoy nature, but perhaps not as much as usual; you still spend time with family and friends by communicating on the computer. Computers are one of the greatest inventions and have a positive effect on people. We should continue to make good use of them while also being aware of potential drawbacks.
115	115	1	3	Dear Newspaper people, @CAPS1! Isn't it great that we have computers? I mean, one, you can enhance your knowledge; two, you can play a lot of fun games; and last but not least, we can talk to our friends. Well, I hope you enjoy my essay about the computer world. Have you ever had any difficulty finding something in a library? Well, forget your library cards and just go on the computer's @CAPS2. On there, you can find whatever you are looking for. One time I was doing a project on my favorite rocker @ORGANIZATION1. So my mom told me to check the library for a book on him, but I couldn't find one. So instead, I just got on my computer (not literally jump on it, of course). And guess what! I found all I needed to know about him, which helped me get a great grade on my project. I mean, there's a lot more you can learn with the computer, like what's going on in the world around us or even learn about small insects to big plants. Well, that's what I have to say about using the @CAPS2 for knowledge. Welcome back! Well, now I'm going to tell you about a few games you can play on the computer. The game I'm going to tell you about is my favorite game and @CAPS4's called Left @NUM1 Dead @NUM2. If you've never played the game, you're probably thinking that the game sounds really hard and scary. Well, it can be. I'm just kidding. It can be hard at first and a little scary, but it's still fun. Another game I enjoy playing is an online game called '@PERSON1.' The game is fun, but it takes a while to progress, and sometimes it can kill the fun. For example, I'm a lvl. @NUM3 mage, and I can take on lvl. @NUM4 @CAPS7 because I can use high - leveled spells. But anyway, there are a lot of things to do on a computer. Like me, you can fight zombies or just do a quest or two. It's up to you; have fun. Now, the last thing I'm going to tell you about is how you can talk to your friends over the @CAPS2. Well, like me, I moved, so I couldn't really hang out with my friends. So I got their @CAPS9 - mail, and now I can talk and see my friends on a webcam. Another good reason to be able to use the @CAPS10 or computer is that you can talk to family members who joined the @ORGANIZATION2. My uncle joined the @ORGANIZATION2, and he's going to be leaving soon. So I'm looking forward to seeing him on the webcam or being able to chat with him. Well, those are my reasons why having a computer is a good thing. One, you can use it to learn; two, you can engage in some challenging gaming; and three, you can just talk to friends. Thank you and have a nice day.
116	116	1	3	I agree with the newspaper; people these days are spending an excessive amount of time on the computer and neglecting exercise. Everyone is well - aware that computers are addictive. However, people really need to get out more often. The problem is that developers are making it even more addicting by creating things such as never - ending games. These games are distracting people from their real lives, their families, their work, and their physical exercise. We must break free from this digital trap and prioritize a more balanced lifestyle.
117	117	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper: @CAPS1, do you truly think computers are great for everyone? I firmly believe that computers are one of the greatest inventions ever. What's truly remarkable about them is the vast amount of knowledge one can acquire. You can learn hand - eye coordination, explore faraway places, and engage in online conversations with people. Surely, continue reading to discover why computers are extremely important to us all. Many people wrongly assume that computers are bad for our minds, but in fact, they're not. When using computers, you can enhance your hand - eye coordination. After some time, you'll be able to type well and very fast, and you can also improve your eyesight by reading your writing or notes for a paper. Moreover, you can have fun, relax, and efficiently type out your papers for reports. Definitely, keep reading to see what else computers can @CAPS1. There are numerous faraway places that have their own special ways of offering a great experience. On the internet, there's a comprehensive list of vacation spots or places that can capture your interest to visit. They provide detailed reasons on why to visit and offer a fair price. Just think about it, wouldn't it be amazing to visit a great place like @LOCATION1? Without a doubt, keep reading. Have you ever wished to play outside but it was raining or your friends were unavailable? Well, on the computer, you can easily talk online to your friends. You can find out how they're doing and still have a great time. Not to mention, you can even make new friends. A large number of kids and teens go online to expand their social circle. Surely, you should agree that computers are truly great. I think computers are very unique and important. That's why so many people, from kids to adults, use computers so extensively. They use them to learn hand - eye coordination, learn about faraway places, and communicate online with others. Thank you for taking the time to read my paper, local newspaper.
118	118	1	3	"Dear Local Newspaper @CAPS1, as our technology advances, so does the quality of our lives. Computers are an ideal way to improve our way of life in ways that are beneficial to us and future generations. The use of computers, and the @CAPS5 alone, allow us to learn about the way of life in other places on @LOCATION4, communicate with people far away, and express ourselves freely. Computers offer us a bright future. First, many people, actually @PERCENT1 of the world's population, generally lead a sedentary lifestyle and live in local town or city environments. This is precisely why computers are so helpful because they provide @CAPS2 with a means to research other places around the globe. This exploration can create an interest in other cultures and shape our opinions as @CAPS2 @CAPS3 discover things about other places. From there, @CAPS3 can view different topics from a wide - spread perspective. By doing this, @CAPS3 will establish connections with other ways of life. As the philosopher and poet @PERSON1 stated, ""@CAPS3 learn about ourselves through the discovery of others."" Additionally, another particularly useful function of the @CAPS5 through computers is that @CAPS3 can communicate with people who live far away, when @CAPS3 couldn't visit them otherwise. A @LOCATION2 study showed that actually @PERCENT2 of computer use is for communication on sites like Facebook or @CAPS9. A scientist in @LOCATION3, @PERSON3, says that @CAPS3, as humans, tend to enjoy communication because it gives @CAPS2 a sense of unity. This is why so many companies are realizing that sites like @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS6, and @ORGANIZATION1 are becoming increasingly popular. And this is indeed true. It is enjoyable to chat, talk, or email others. Without computers, this kind of interaction wouldn't be possible. Lastly, computers give us the opportunity to express our ideas like never before. Now, stars aren't only made in @LOCATION1; now you can make yourself famous on @CAPS8 or @CAPS9. Just ask @PERSON2, whose voice reached out and caught the attention of a major record company. Now, everyone knows his name and listens to his music. Like @PERSON2, those who are more verbose can express themselves by blogging their opinions. ""About half of computer use,"" says @CAPS1 to Computer Weekly, @PERSON4, ""is using blogs and videos to state one's ideas."" @CAPS3 can persuade others to think as @CAPS2 @CAPS3 do and discover things that @CAPS3 have discovered. Self - expression is very important to society, and this is why computers have such a profound impact on people. Clearly, computers have a positive impact on people and society. They allow us to learn about faraway places, communicate with others, and inspire the world around us with our ideas. Welcome to the future."
119	119	1	3	"Dear People of @LOCATION2, @CAPS1, how many hours a day do you actually spend being physically active? Now, answer me this: how much time do you spend on your computer? Too many @CAPS2 these days are sitting in front of a computer, laptop, or other such devices, while not enough are lacing up their shoes for a jog. Computers are ruining our lives; they are deterring our social skills, damaging our health, and making us lazy. They are not beneficial to our society. To start with, millions of people sign up for @CAPS3, @CAPS4, and other similar websites to reconnect with people. Do you realize the implications of this? Now, no one has to get in a car and go visit others. There is no longer a need to interact with other people in person, nor is there a desire to. Let's say there's a woman sitting on her couch. All of a sudden, her face lights up at the thought of her friend @PERSON1. She gets up to start the car, but her eye catches the computer. She bites her lip, trying to decide whether to go see her friend or have an online chat. Feeling lazy, she sits back down. Do you really want this to happen to everyone? Well, it's already happening. Moving on, I'd like to take a moment to talk about our health. As most of us know, fresh air is good for us. Imagine walking through the woods on a trail. The crisp, cool air tickles your skin, and breathing it in makes you smile. Your entire body feels energized from the walking. With many days like this ahead, you can't wait. Now, imagine sitting in front of a computer, in a hot, stuffy room. Your back aches from being in this position for so long. You think you're getting a cold and you have a migraine. You'd get off, but you have another app request. You just don't feel like moving back to reality. Which scenario do you prefer? Above all this, there's the issue of exercise. I mean, when's the last time you yourself went on a bike ride? I'm sure you know that exercise is good for your body, but you're too busy on the computer. I think it's safe to say that half of @LOCATION1 would rather update their @CAPS4 than get up and move. It's crucial to our health that we get active. To sum up, a lot of us are wondering whether or not to spend more time on the computer. Well, here's your answer: ""Don't."" Not enough people are interacting these days. They're spending the best years of their lives cooped up in a house, and most importantly, let's face it, they're getting out of shape. Computers are taking over our lives. It's now or never; make the change to a better and more satisfying lifestyle. Please, @LOCATION1, turn off the computer and embrace a more active life."
120	120	1	3	Dear @CAPS1: The effects that computers have on me are quite significant. It teaches me hand - eye coordination. I learn a great deal from the computer, and it is a really fun thing to use. But, of course, these are only my opinions. Well, I'm just going to go ahead and explain them to you. The good thing about computers is that it enhances your hand - eye coordination, which helps you see better with your eyes. Also, it improves your hand skills by teaching you how to catch things and how to react quickly with your hands. For example, I was playing baseball and I wasn't very good at catching. At the same time, I was learning how to use the computer and became able to type fast. As a result, my hands reacted better when grounders and pop - fly's were hit to me. I was so happy that I learned how to use the computer and type. Without a doubt, the computer is the best because you can conduct research and find out more important facts. Also, you learn more whenever you research anything. I'll tell you one thing, I like the computer so much because it helps me find out important details and facts about the person I'm doing my project on. Yes, I know the computer is so much fun because you can visit different websites such as myspace.com, youtube.com, and funnyjunk.com. I go on MySpace to talk to my friends and to meet new people. That's what I really like about MySpace; I can expand my social circle and make new friends. I go on YouTube because I like to listen to music and watch music videos. I also watch skateboard videos because I love to skate! But one thing for sure is that I go on funnyjunk.com to play games because they have so many fun games to play. But my favorite game is @CAPS2 the hedgehog. In conclusion, these are my opinions and the reasons to support the effects of computers. So, I want you to think about the effects of computers and your own opinions about them and compare them to mine. But hey! That's up to you; it's only if you want to.
121	121	1	3	Do you think computers are helpful? Well, you should because they are the most helpful object on the market. Also, if family members live far away, you can instant message, Facebook them, or even send emails to them. The main thing for teens or children is easily the enjoyment. You could watch your favorite shows with a click of the mouse or even play free - fun games. The computer is a very helpful object. If you have bad handwriting and a report is due, you go and type it up on your computer, and your teacher will think you spent all night doing it when it was easy. You will also get a better grade. If a big family trip is coming up, you can go online and plan the trip more easily than you would have, and at a low price. Also, you can shop. If it's a birthday of a loved one, you can get gifts for a very low price, even at a discount! If your family lives far and you don't get to see them a lot, the internet is the place to go. You could talk to them with instant messenger or you could Facebook them. You could video - call them, or also you could talk to them and see them on your screen and they can see you on their screen, and it would be like they're in the house with you. If you're on vacation, you could send them photos and maps of where you're going, even info about the places. Enjoyment is the teen's favorite. If you missed your favorite show, you could go to the streaming platform and see the show for free! Youtube is where you could see something funny, exciting, or just plain gross. If someone like a famous athlete did an awesome trick and you missed it, look it up. There are two types of games. You could play games on the internet like at addicting games com or play multiplayer games online or play with friends. Now you know why the internet is great. It has games, helps you be close to your family, or even helps you get help. So, choose to say you think the internet is good. It's your decision.
122	122	1	3	"Dear Local Newspaper, approximately 80% in town use the computer for at least five hours each day. The people are spending way too much time and not benefiting. Computers have an effect on people but in a negative way. People get addicted and distracted and can't get work done. Many inappropriate things are written on computers that children and adults shouldn't read. Lastly, people stare at a computer screen all day which can cause brain damage. Effects from computers can be very negative and not beneficial at all. With children at school and adults at jobs, there is most likely a lot of work to get done, but computers should not make a person not get the work done. The other day in class the teacher was collecting homework, but 5 out of the 20 kids in our class didn't have the homework. When the teacher asked why the kids didn't do their homework, they said that they were on the computer and forgot about the homework. When the children and adults don't get their work done, then grades could be dropped, or people could get fired. The effect is very harmful, and all this happened just because of the addiction and distraction of computers. Since some internet sources are very social, and not all people are kind, mean and inappropriate articles and language could be read. Many children don't know a lot of bad words and certainly no one wants them to be exposed to learning more, so why let them go on the computer and read about these bad things? Adults usually know more about the harmful language, but why influence them to write the bad things or comment using mean tones. If adults and children aren't exposed to these bad uses of language, then our world could easily be made up of better and kinder people. Studies show that if a person stares at a computer screen for at least three hours a day, then in about two weeks' time the person's brain could be damaged. The screen of the computer interacts in some way with the human brain and if stared at for too long the screen could permanently damage the brain. A University of Tech student, who studies computer mechanics, quoted, ""We should help prevent brain damage by limiting the use of computers to only what needs to be done. The mechanics to make the computer screen are not healthy for you!"" Who wants to have a damaged brain? Surely this effect could be very serious. So, in the end, people should know that computers are not beneficial. Computers affect people for sure, but not in a way that people would want to be affected. Addiction and distraction from the computer could cause important work to be ignored. Children and adults do not need to learn or be influenced by inappropriate language on the computer. Brain damage could be a serious problem that could be caused by something as simple as looking at a computer screen. Therefore, try to prevent all these negative effects by limiting the use of your computer. It is very easy to stay clear of any negative effects, but it is your choice whether to do so or not."
123	123	1	3	Everywhere you look, people are using computers. Just about everyone has one. Some say that computers are bad for you, but they can really benefit society. Computers are used for research, socializing, and almost all of our government work is done on computers. One of the main things that computers provide is research information. If you want to find out anything, you can find it on the internet. It is an efficient way to study or find information for school. Before the internet and computers, it would take weeks to find enough information for a paper or business work. This was because all information was found in books. Books did not always give you the information you needed; whatever was written was all you got. Because of search engines and websites, you can type in whatever you want to look up. It is much easier to log onto a computer and type in a question than search an entire book to find an answer. Computers are the best way to research a topic. Computers are also used to socialize. You can chat with almost anyone on the internet. Being social is one of the most important parts of life. It has been proven by science that social people live longer than people who never talk to anyone. A phone only gives you audio, and that doesn't give you the same experience. Video chat can allow you to show someone a picture or an expression. Computers allow you to see people that you can't see otherwise. For example, if you have a relative that lives far away and you can't visit him or her, you can see them through video chat. This shows that socializing through computers is one of the best ways to talk to people. Our government is mainly run on computers. Without them, it would be very difficult to be aware of an on - coming attack or threat. The government uses computers to store their legal files of court cases, laws, etc. It is much easier to transfer files digitally than actually sending a paper copy. The store market is also run on computers. You need them to see how you are doing financially. Computers are essential to our government and economy. Although some experts say that computers do us no good, computers benefit our society very much. They help us research, socialize, and they help our government and economy. Computers are essential to our way of life.
124	124	1	3	I think that the computers are good to be used because anybody can use them at any time or go on them whenever they want to. The reason why I think it is good is because you can contact someone that you know and talk to them whenever you want. Another reason is because you can play games, look for something, or even make a research on stuff that you want to know or about something that you were always curious about. A computer is also useful for better things like using it when going to work. For example, office workers can use computers to create presentations and manage data. Or when a kid in school needs to do a report or project and needs to type it up, and also to save stuff that you don't want anyone to use. Computers can sometimes be helpful to people that really need it and that actually need to use it. But it can also be a fun activity to do if anybody has nothing to do. I think that the computer is awesome because anybody with enough knowledge can open up their own website and create something unique. A lot of people can go on the internet and open an account on a website; for example, a social media platform, a blog site, or an e - commerce site for those who want to have an account. These are a lot of people that use the computer in a good way and use it for things that it can actually be used for. So I think that the computers are very helpful to people that like searching for stuff that they're curious about or to have to use it for good needs. In conclusion, computers have become an indispensable part of our lives, bringing both practical benefits and entertainment.
125	125	1	3	Computers don't have any negative affect on kids. We just love going on them because we use them for help. This should persuade the readers of the local newspaper because we need to be able to communicate. For instance, we can talk to classmates about group projects. Also, we use computers for writing essays and doing social studies or science homework. My ideas are that you should let us use computers because we're not bothering you. You can just leave us alone and let us do what we need to do. Computers are what give us information for what we have to do and where to do what we gotta do. And you people can just leave us alone because computers aren't addicting to me or anyone. And if we were addicted, it still wouldn't matter because a computer is a computer. You don't punish the computer; you punish us from using the computer. But it's not the computer's fault if it can be addicting. The computer is a device that gives us what we need and the information we require. Also, the computer does favors for us. It can quickly find answers to our questions. The computer is an amazing thing. In conclusion, computers are valuable tools for kids, and we should be allowed to use them appropriately.
126	126	1	3	Dear, @ORGANIZATION1, I'm deeply concerned about an issue where people are overly reliant on computers and neglecting exercise. This is a truly bad thing, and we need to spread the word about the potential consequences of a sedentary lifestyle. The first reason I disagree with the notion that computers are all - helpful is that they severely affect your health. You'll gradually gain weight, start experiencing heart - related problems, and in the worst - case scenario, it can lead to something fatal. Another reason I believe computers are not entirely healthy is that they impact the economy in numerous ways. For instance, computers consume a large amount of electricity, which can strain the power supply in all states. Moreover, they disrupt the job market. People become so addicted to computers that they lose the motivation to look for jobs and instead stay glued to the screen, gambling or shopping. The last reason I think computers are bad is the prevalence of illegal activities on them. There are many cyber predators who target kids, and they may end up kidnapping them. There are also inappropriate websites and pop - ups that can land you in legal trouble. If kids use computers without proper guidance, they might click on something they don't understand, which could traumatize them for life. So, @NUM1, I hope you can take this letter into consideration and take action because these computers can affect my health, your health, and even the health of your children. That is why I've written this letter to you. If you agree with me, I sincerely thank you.
127	127	1	3	Computers can significantly affect the way people behave and interact. Why waste your precious life sitting in front of a computer all day when you could be getting exercise, like going to your local gym? Computers often become a major distraction to your social life. That's why you should use them only in emergencies and spend more quality time with your wonderful family and friends. Additionally, you can take the time to enjoy your surroundings and truly appreciate life and nature. Computers are primarily designed for business purposes, not for people to sit around and do meaningless things. Exercise is extremely important as it helps the human body grow and stay in shape. If you're sitting in front of a computer all day, your body will gradually become inactive and won't get the proper exercise it needs. Sports can be just as enjoyable as using a computer and are far more beneficial for the body. They build hand - eye coordination, unlike simply sitting on the couch using a computer. In conclusion, exercising can offer all the same benefits that computers do, but it also provides greater advantages to citizens. Family is a precious part of life, and they won't be with us forever. That's why we should cherish every moment we have with them. Computers can take away your social life, preventing you from going out and meeting new people. To sum it up, computers can be a hindrance to citizens and drive them away from their family and friends. Nature is exotic and beautiful, and we should all take care of it and appreciate what we have. Computers can be harmful to nature, such as when you print something from your computer, which requires paper and leads to more trees being cut down. We should use paper only in emergencies and not waste it. We all want the world to be a better place, so let's stop destroying it for our own short - term benefits! In conclusion, computers, in the long run, will cause chaos and destruction. Instead of using them excessively, we could be getting the right amount of exercise, spending time with family, and enjoying nature and our surroundings. I strongly urge you to take my ideas into consideration and hopefully agree with them.
128	128	1	3	@ORGANIZATION1, In my opinion, computers can be both entertaining and educational, but they should not replace everyday living. Therefore, I think that computers harm people in ways they may not realize. Three reasons that support my view are the blurring of reality and fantasy, the impact on family and friends, and the effect on your health. Many children and young adults are easily influenced by the assumption that everything on the computer is true. However, as some eventually discover, it's far from the truth. The addictive games and electronic features make you believe that the scenarios and characters you see are real - life situations and activities. Computers are instilling the wrong mindset in kids, which affects their schoolwork and behavior. They need to get back to reality and be in the right state of mind. Your family and friends have always stood by you, even during your toughest times. Unfortunately, the addiction to computers has distanced you from them. They're unhappy with the way you treat them and hope for a change so that you can enjoy life again. Interact with real human beings, not just graphic - designed computer pictures. After all, those pictures won't be there for you when you need them, while your family and friends will last much longer. Your body is precious, and your health is of utmost importance. A computer might suggest exercise, but you're unlikely to actually do it. You know this, and so do the people who create computer sites. You'll just sit there, straining your eyes by looking at the screen all day. It's not healthy for you or anyone else. Moving your fingers and pushing buttons is not exercise. Since you're sitting still, you're not doing anything beneficial for yourself. You should go outside, breathe in fresh air, and be in nature. Run around or play a ball game, but not on the computer. In conclusion, you can clearly see how a computer can affect a person. Not only do people mistake fantasy for reality, but they also lose interaction with their friends and loved ones. Your health is also at risk when you spend hours staring at the screen and barely moving. Please consider the risks and believe the facts because, honestly, we're losing the chance to live and enjoy the world to the fullest.
129	129	1	3	Hi! My name is @PERSON1, and I firmly believe that computers are not bad. Yes, some people use computers too much, but they can also learn a great deal from them. Another reason is that bullies and others can use computers to relieve stress. You can also communicate with your friends and even have video chats with them. Computers are excellent learning tools. For example, if your computer breaks or has a virus, you can figure out the problem on your own. You can also catch up on the news you've missed. You can ask questions that you don't understand, and people will answer them. In modern times, kids, teens, and adults use computers to look up information. For instance, when I'm reading a book and come across a word I don't know, even after looking around, I can go to @LOCATION1 to find its meaning. Bullies and people like street - dwellers who have computers should use them to play games. They can play action games like hitting and shooting games, or more relaxing board games. You can even watch fights if you want. Whatever you desire, the computer can provide. This is a great thing because then no one will get hurt, and everyone will be happy. Bullies can also use the computer to relax and avoid people they dislike. The computer can make you relax as you don't have to be around others and can simply tell it what to do. Kids, teens, and adults don't have to leave the house just to talk to friends. Most computers have a webcam, allowing you to communicate with others. For example, my dad is trying to get a computer with a webcam so that he can stay in touch with my mom, my brother, my sister, and me. He has to do this because he doesn't live with us anymore. He had to go back to @LOCATION2. Another example is that if one of your friends moves far away, you can talk to them via the webcam or send messages back and forth. So, I think computers are a great idea. They allow you to learn, stay calm, and communicate effectively.
130	130	1	3	Dear Newspaper of @LOCATION1, The use of the computer is a highly controversial topic, with many people holding different opinions and beliefs. But I personally believe that computers have a positive impact on the people who use and operate them. These remarkable devices give people the ability to communicate and be social with friends and family members. They keep people informed about what's going on in the world and provide updates on the conditions of countries and events. They also offer a wealth of information and enable people to research and learn more about various topics and ideas. A computer is an essential part of today's society, and opposing its use is a preposterous idea. Many people, young and old, are increasingly using computers to socialize with friends and family through various websites and programs. A computer allows you to talk to someone without being physically present. The social aspect of computers is growing in popularity, and many people are using them to stay connected. Social networking sites and instant messaging programs are just two of the many ways to be socially active on a computer. A social networking site is a platform that lets you create an account, post pictures, and share information for your friends to see. Taking away the computer would mean taking away the social lives of many people. The computer benefits people socially, and this has a positive effect on their well - being. Today's news is full of exciting events and tragic disasters, and many people like to stay updated. Most people don't want to wait for the newspaper to arrive to read the latest news. So, they check online and find it there. Online news is extremely popular and beneficial to many. It provides them with the latest stories and updated events. Online news was extremely crucial during the latest disaster, the earthquake in @LOCATION2. Because online news is so fast and easy to access, people were donating and helping @LOCATION2 just a day after the earthquake. The quick response is what's helping @LOCATION2 rebuild from the rubble. Computers provide people with online news, and this is definitely beneficial to their lives. Before people started using computers for research, they used books. They had to sift through piles of pages and articles in newspapers, which was an inefficient and disorganized way to conduct research. Now, with the computer, you can access endless information and topics. It's easy to find information for an article or essay as it's always available in one place. This allows for guided and efficient research. There are also online databases on the internet. All you have to do is type in a keyword or phrase, and you get instant research on whatever you need information about. This saves a lot of time on research and allows you to focus on other things, whether it's writing a paper or giving a presentation. The computer enables quick and beneficial research. The computer hasn't been in use for a long time, but it's already helping society expand and grow. It provides a social platform, access to the latest news, and efficient research capabilities. Without a doubt, a computer has a positive effect on society and us as individuals. The experts can have their opinions, but the computer is and will always be a benefit to society.
131	131	1	3	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Computers are beginning to be a significant problem in many households. I feel that an alarmingly large number of people are becoming overly addicted to computers. People in this situation are more likely to gain weight rapidly, have extremely little social time, and spend excessive time inside their homes. In @CAPS6 article I have recently read in the well - known @ORGANIZATION1, it was about @CAPS6 in - depth experiment on computer use. Dr. @PERSON1, a highly respected @CAPS3 professor, stated that his findings showed that people who are addicted to computers only leave their homes reluctantly to run essential errands. When this occurs, it severely interferes with their lives as well as their bodies, because our bodies genuinely need sunlight for proper functioning. Furthermore, his study also showed that people who go outside more frequently and not on the computer as much tend to be significantly happier. @PERCENT1 of the study's patients started to be more joyful once they stopped going on the computer as often. I like when the people around me are happy, full of energy and not grouchy, don't you? I have been noticing some kids in my school that are gaining weight at an alarming rate. These are kids who have recently started going on the computer for a couple of hours at a time, every single day. This is extremely bad for your health and body. If someone sits at their computer all day, the food they consume is not being worked off, so it all quickly turns to fat. Moreover, statistics show that @PERCENT2 of all obese people in a weight - loss class had gained their extra weight from sitting at the computer all day. If people treat their bodies this way, they could end up with some serious type of health condition. Last week, @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @NUM1 interviewed a @NUM2 - year - old @PERSON2. @PERSON2's best friend has been completely ignoring @PERSON2 because he got a brand - new @ORGANIZATION1 computer. Now, @PERSON2's friend doesn't want to hang out with @PERSON2, or any of his other friends. In addition, when people become addicted to computers, they become much less social with friends and other important people like parents, teachers, and more. When people push aside their precious social time for computer games, chat rooms, or movie websites, they lose a large and valuable portion of their life. This can be stopped if parents firmly put their foot down, set reasonable limits, and make kids spend more time outside. As you can clearly see, computers @MONTH1 have some benefits, but they have numerous and significant disadvantages. Addicted computer users become less social, they don't go outside and start to ""pack on the pounds"" rapidly. @CAPS6 effect of this is a world full of people who sit on the computer all day, mindlessly eating food and gaining excessive weight, which is truly a concerning situation."
132	132	1	3	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I understand that the idea of advances in technology benefiting society is a very controversial topic. However, I whole - heartedly support these advances in technology and I firmly believe that computers have a positive and far - reaching effect on people. They allow friends and family who live far away from each other to communicate easily and stay closely in touch. Computers also, @CAPS7, offer easy access to the latest news and a vast array of online textbooks which provides an enormous amount of benefits to today's fast - paced society. In the long run, doing more things by computer instead of on paper will save billions of precious trees! @CAPS7, computers teach us hand - eye coordination which is a tremendously important and practical skill. These advances in technology are extremely beneficial to our society and should be fully taken advantage of! ""@CAPS1, @CAPS1!"" @CAPS3 computer emits a friendly wail as I receive a video call from @CAPS3 dear cousin, @PERSON4. The remarkable advantage in technology has provided many new and convenient ways for @CAPS3 family and I to communicate with each other. @CAPS3 cousins and I rarely see one another due to geographical distance, but computers make it possible for us to stay closely connected. Four out of five teenagers would whole - heartedly agree that without computers or technological advances, their long - distance relationships with family and friends wouldn't be feasible. For example; I go on oovoo once a week to have a warm and engaging video chat with @CAPS3 cousin whom I only see on special holidays. Teen @CAPS4, @PERSON2 says: ""Technology such as computers and cell phones are great for teens, but it should be carefully monitored and not used excessively."" Computers are indeed great for keeping in touch with family and friends at a distance! Next, computers allow easy and instant access to the news and a wealth of online textbooks. @CAPS5 more people took full advantage of this, we could save millions of trees and have a much healthier environment. Environmentalist, @PERSON3 says: ""@CAPS5 more schools switched to online textbooks they would end up saving thousands of dollars that can be put to better use elsewhere."" I whole - heartedly agree, @CAPS3 friend @PERSON1 says. ""@CAPS5 we didn't have to take home so many heavy textbooks everyday, I might not have developed scoliosis!"" @CAPS7, computers allow quick access to the news, so we can find out about accidents right away instead of waiting for the traditional newspaper to come. @CAPS7, computers help children develop hand - eye coordination, which is a very important and useful skill. Computer activities keep our brain actively exercising and @MONTH1 even help us hit more accurately next baseball season! Three out of five kids at @ORGANIZATION2 say that @CAPS5 they didn't have a computer growing up, they wouldn't be as good at their sport. Computers are an extremely useful resource for many things that we need to fully take advantages of, and they play a crucial role in our modern lives."
133	133	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 of the Newspaper, there is no doubt that computers don't always benefit society. First of all, most people only have a limited and precious amount of time to do things. Secondly, many friends would get really mad if you can't spend time with them. Last but not least, you have to watch out for your health carefully. To sum up, computers aren't always a good thing. From my point of view, time is a big and crucial thing. When people get so deeply involved with something, it's extremely hard to back away. That's just like smoking. The nicotine attracts you so once you start, it is very difficult to quit. Many lazy people like to put important things on hold. In other words, you waste valuable time. The time that you could be spending on homework or even working on a job, you're mindlessly wasting it. Other people know that they need to do something but keep procrastinating. For example, you need to paint your house or fix the motor in the car but you keep putting it off. @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people do this in the busy @LOCATION1 every single day. As you of all people can see, many @CAPS3 don't think too much about the importance of time. The next big topic is social interaction. You and I both know that every one needs a good social life. When you don't interact with your friends, your friends might not bother trying to talk to you. They might not even go near you if you forget about them. Pets on the other hand need you desperately. They usually just sleep around the house when they are lonely. I'm sure that you know pets need love and need you to play with them. Parents need to be there for their kids. When you were little, didn't you need help? I know I did. That's why parents need to interact a lot with their children. In conclusion, the more you stick with your friends and stay away from the computer the better you will be. That leads us to the next big topic, health. Staying healthy's no joke. If you want to live long and watch your kids grow up, the healthier you are the better off you'll be. Everyone needs regular exercise. Exercise helps prevent against various diseases as well as keeping you in good shape. @NUM3 out of @NUM1 people are overweight. When you are sitting in front of a computer screen playing games or sending e - mails, that's just as bad as playing video games on your @CAPS6.V. You know as well as anyone, most video games are not good for you. Last but not least, most people don't eat healthy when they play video games or go on the computer. You and I both know, a healthy diet and regular exercise will give you a happy and fulfilling life. From my point of view, computers don't benefit society. Time is a big thing which many @CAPS3 don't realize. Secondly, social interaction which everyone needs is another important thing to look into. Last but not least, everyone everywhere needs to stay healthy. For a long and happy life, we should be more cautious about our computer use, and it's clear that many people would be better off without excessive computer usage.
134	134	1	3	Computers are the way of the future. I firmly believe that computers benefit society in numerous ways. I believe this because computers enable you to talk to family and friends online in a very convenient and efficient manner. It also gives you access to thousands of well - curated websites to learn valuable information from. Lastly, it teaches hand - eye coordination. First, computers allow you to socialize online effectively. I know that @CAPS1 I get home from school, I can talk to virtually any of my friends online. People against computers say it takes away time from interacting with family, however, this is not true at all. I talk to all of my aunts via popular social websites like facebook and other similar platforms. Also, @CAPS1 my parents are at work, they are able to message me over the computer without having to go get a phone and call my house. My last reason for this is that it helps me and my friends get in touch easier. Let's say I'm having a friend come over, but he got sick. He wouldn't have to go through the hassle of looking up a number and calling me, he could just send me a quick message on the internet. My second reason is that computers help with education significantly. I know that @CAPS1 I'm stuck on a problem at home, I'll just go on the computer and look up the answer. Also, @CAPS1 I have to do projects, the computer is very helpful for me and many other kids. @CAPS1 doing a project, I can't get all of my information from one book, so I go on the computer and look up detailed information about the subject. This really improves students' grades, because they have more resources and more in - depth information to choose from, instead of only relying on the limited information in the book. My last reason is that using a computer can help with hand - eye coordination. On the computer, there are many high - quality sites that have very interactive features that you can really benefit from. I know of one well - known website that was able to help me with my fielding in baseball because it had engaging interactive games that would actually help with things in real life, like fielding in baseball. I know there are other similar websites like this for many other sports like basketball and football. So the computer actually helps with real - life activities. To sum it all up, I think computers can benefit society a great deal. Like being able to communicate with your friends easily, also being able to look up school work efficiently, and lastly helping with hand - eye coordination. Computers are an essential part of our modern lives and their positive impacts on society are undeniable.
135	135	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I am writing to tell you about the positive effects computers have on people. They teach hand - eye coordination, let people search for new and interesting places, and allow them to talk online with people like family and friends. First, the computers teach hand - eye coordination. It helps you become a better speller and type fast or type without looking at the keys. I know it helped me a great deal and I'm sure it will help you too. It's like a skill - building tool that sharpens your typing abilities over time. Secondly, computers let you interact with family and friends and let you make new friends. For example, on platforms like myspace, you can talk to your friends and make @CAPS1 new ones. Facebook is more mature if you ask me, and twitter is also a great way for you to talk to your friends. There are also email services like yahoo, gmail, aol. Even teachers can use computers to communicate with parents, so it helps you communicate without everyone being in your conversation on the phone. It provides a more private and convenient way of interaction. Next, it helps you search for new and old places like famous landmarks or businesses like salons, nail parlors. Gyms and @CAPS1 restaurants. You can even search when a movie is going to come out. A computer can help you very much in this type of case. It's like having a personal information - finder at your fingertips. In conclusion, computers are good. They help you, inform you, and they can teach you. I love my computer as it helps me with homework and helps me study. Say you can't talk with someone over the phone, you can email or chat with them. It's so cool, fun, and interesting how you can learn @CAPS1 new things. It lets you upload pictures, music, videos, and you can type essays. The computer is a very educational and versatile tool that enriches our lives in many ways, and its benefits are truly remarkable.
136	136	1	3	"There are so many different sides to this computer problem. Well, it's simple—computers ruin our lives. Now, think about it. How many hours do you see your kid on it? Computers mess up kids' grades. It stops people from taking a car ride to a friend's house at @ORGANIZATION1. Also, people don't ride their bikes as much anymore. Computers are an outrage. It first starts off with grades. The parents tell their kid, ""Go and start your paper."" They say ""ok,"" and then they end up down there on Facebook. More often than not, kids and parents abuse the computer. In fact, @PERCENT2 of America uses it. That might seem like a small percent, but that's more than half the country. Me, I don't abuse the computer because I need to keep my grades up. Most students have below - average grades because studies show it's because of computers. Also, if your son has a laptop, they're not doing work if that's what you think. I have computers, but we have books for a reason—no spam, no pop - ups, or no distractions while working. Like one time I was working on a project, a pop - up came up and read ""Traffic Rush free to your computer."" So, dumb me downloads it and my parents caught me playing. Has this changed your mind? Since you probably haven't changed your mind, here is another reason why computers are bad—your car. All guys love cars. Computers are holding more than @PERCENT3 of people from working on or driving their cars. The only person it hasn't affected is my dad. He works on his cars day in and day out. My grandmom said something interesting to me the next day, ""@CAPS3 your dad comes up to visit me more than your other sons. Your other sons are crazy for computers."" People go bananas for computers today. Lately, I have seen less and less people outside anymore. There is only one reason for that. All people are holed up in their basement in the dark, so when their light comes on, their eyes are so sensitive it's blinding. Come on, did this change your mind yet? Well, since you are still reading, that means you cannot make up your mind. Well, here's this: people are starting to not want to ride their bikes anymore. That's because of Facebook. This is what they think, ""@CAPS4 it's all talk now. Why do I need to ride to talk in person?"" That @PERCENT1 is right for what they are thinking. Because we took a test of all the kids who have Facebook, and that's what around all of them said. I know it's amazing. A stay - at - home mother said, ""My son's gaining weight. All he does is eat and go on Facebook. When he's not on during the day, I catch him at night too."" That is a sad story for that mother. I ride my bike a lot. This is a real - life story: once I was sitting around doing nothing really, and my mom said we are riding bikes for @NUM1 miles. I got up and did it too. That had to change your mind, or nothing will. So, in conclusion, I have no more ideas for why we should ditch computers, but just remember your grades, cars, and your weight. So, please, change your mind."
137	137	1	3	Dear, newspaper, I think computers are good. This is because you can learn a great deal about faraway places using them. You can also stay informed about the most recent news, and you can communicate with people easily. In school, a lot of the research projects focus on other places around the world. When you use a computer, you can read detailed articles about the place and also get high - quality pictures and use them in a slideshow or photo story. There are also educational websites that kids can go on to learn their math facts, from basic arithmetic to multiplication tables. Clearly, the computer is a good learning tool. The computer can keep you up - to - date with the news too. There are news websites that post minute - to - minute updates about world news and tell the world what kind of disaster happened in some far - away place on the other side of the world. A lot of the time, families are spread all over the world. You can chat with family or friends that have moved by using a simple chat room, and you can catch up on what has been happening in each other's lives. That's a great tool for families to stay in touch. In conclusion, the computer has lots of benefits that a lot of people all around the world can use, from learning about a faraway country to chatting with a cousin that lives in California and also knowing what's going on in your own hometown.
138	138	1	3	@ORGANIZATION1, there has been a lot of discussion of whether computers affect people in a positive way or in a negative way. I believe that computers affect most people negatively. I think this because people lose their people skills by talking through the computer. Computers, especially in @MONTH1, also lead to danger, and because people tend to forget about their priorities in life. From what I know, most people that use computers use them to talk to friends and other people around the world. Instead of hanging out with their friends, they talk through the computer. If that's what they do more than hanging out in person, then they won't recognize the facial expressions given to them by certain people. While talking in person, you get the full - on experience of communicating with them. You get the tone of voice in addition to the facial expressions. You also get the body language, which you can't get from on the computer unless you are using a webcam. Computers have led to many dangers. These dangers affect every user and their families. There have been many cases of young teenagers being tricked by older users. They are tricked into showing them parts of their body or making the teens believe that the older user can relate to their problems and are the same age. Sometimes the teen is persuaded to leave their home and neighborhood to meet the other user. Also, another type of danger is cyberbullying. Cyberbullies lower your self - esteem. The bullies call you names and pick on you and sometimes make you feel suicidal. If we hadn't had any computers, then none of these dangers would be occurring. With computers, people have lost their judgment in top priorities. Some computer users tend to forget about the important things in life such as family, school work, and their own health. Some people would rather stay on the computer than hang out with family and friends. Others tend to choose not to do their homework and work on their social life on the computer instead. Since they are on the computer a lot, they seem to ignore their health. They don't exercise as much and don't eat as healthy. So, in my opinion, life without computers would be good for everyone. People would still have the people skills they had before, there wouldn't be as much danger, and people would focus more on the important things than their online social lives.
139	139	1	3	Dear, @ORGANIZATION1, I think computers do have a positive affect on people, but I don't think that computers are the reason people don't exercise or enjoy nature. People make their own choices in life. The computer is just there as a tool. If somebody chooses to be on the computer instead of spending time with their family, well, that's their choice and their problem, not the computer's. Me, for example, I love working and playing on the computer. Even though I'm on the computer quite a bit, I still do things like talk to my family, I play basketball regularly, and I hang out with my friends. That's my choice to do all of that. I can easily just sit up in my room and be on the computer all the time. There's nothing wrong with doing that because that is my choice in life. Nobody should be able to tell you to get off the computer because that is your choice in life. If you want to be on the computer instead of going outside, that's your choice. Only you know what is best for you. In conclusion, we should respect everyone's choices regarding computer use as long as they are aware of the consequences.
140	140	1	3	Dear editor, I have heard that some experts are saying that @CAPS1 spend too much time online. I thoroughly believe they are mistaken. With the use of the internet, people can learn about faraway places without spending a fortune to go there. Our military uses the internet to talk to their family and friends stateside. Also, it helps us acquire great hand - eye coordination. If someone was planning a trip to @LOCATION1, they would check the internet often. Firstly, they would check out interesting sites to visit in @LOCATION1. They'd look for historical landmarks, beautiful parks, and popular tourist attractions. Second, they would check and compare hotels in @LOCATION1. They'd consider factors like price, location, and reviews. Thirdly, they would check the weather in @LOCATION1. Knowing the weather helps in packing the right clothes and planning outdoor activities. Finally, they would check airports for flights going to and from @LOCATION1. They'd look for the best deals and convenient flight times. Without the internet, planning vacations would be close to impossible. People not only use the internet for pleasure but for communication purposes too. They use webcams to talk online to people in faraway places. It is a fast, free, and convenient way to communicate with other people. Our military uses webcams to let the soldiers talk to their families. How would you feel if you were a soldier fighting for your country and the means to talk to your family is out there, but you could not use it? It is cruel and unjust to keep soldiers from talking to their families. The internet also gives us something useful. It helps us build hand - eye coordination. Hand - eye coordination is used in many things. In basketball, you need to be able to look up and dribble at the same time. When you are driving, you need to be able to look up and still be able to steer the car. Without hand - eye coordination, many more accidents would happen from careless errors. The internet helps people make the world a safer place. In some aspects, the experts are right. We should go out and enjoy nature, but we also need to enjoy and use the internet as well. Some people use it for pleasure and build hand - eye coordination. While others use it to talk to their loved ones or use it to plan vacations. No matter who you are or what you do, the internet plays an important part in life. So, we should embrace its benefits while also being mindful of the need for a balanced lifestyle.
141	141	1	3	"Dear @PERSON3 of the @LOCATION1, I strongly believe that computers affect us in a positive way. Computers are constantly advancing, and so are their numerous uses. They are truly great tools, yet they are not a replacement for our natural thought processes or the joy of going outside to run around and play sports.  Computers help us find and communicate with relatives and friends. They also allow us to learn different things about far - off places. They are also excellent for research! First and foremost, computers are having a positive impact on us, especially when it comes to finding and talking to family and friends. My mom was adopted, and @NUM1 years ago, she really had a strong desire to find her birth family. One year later, her birth father found her on a well - known website where you can locate family members. She found her family, and I now have two more @CAPS1, @PERSON1 and @PERSON2, and a cousin @PERSON4. I love them all very much. I would not have been able to get to know them if it weren't for the computer.  Speaking of communication, I was working extremely hard on a big science project I had. We weren't able to meet in person, and it was simply impossible for one person to coordinate a three - way or four - way discussion. So we emailed our ideas and thoughts back and forth, and were able to get the project done. ""There are never enough hours in the day!"" is something that is commonly said. Over @PERCENT1 of adults complain that there is never enough time in a day. That is a statistic from @ORGANIZATION1. The computer allows you to multi - task, so you can be on a business call and at the same time email your mother to let her know that you didn't forget her birthday.  In addition, computers help us understand other countries and learn about their culture and how they are faring. There are many people who don't have TVs and they get their news from the internet. Also, for projects, in @NUM2 grade, I had to learn about @CAPS4, the country in @LOCATION2. It would have taken countless hours to find research in books, and you would find a lot of stuff you don't need. But on the computer, it is fast and easy. If you need to know something, you can just type it in and, boom! You have it. Whereas if you were using a book, you would still be looking for what you need. Time is something that we can't afford to waste, especially in this economy.  Furthermore, computers are great for all kinds of research and getting directions. People who think that people spend too much time on the computer and neglect exercising are not always right. I don't know about you, @PERSON3, but I am constantly looking up different exercises to get a flat stomach. Most of my friends do it with me. I also look up directions. Finding routes on maps is extremely frustrating and takes forever. Go on the computer, the maps are always updated and you can get easy and fast directions! I don't know about you but I love things fast and easy. Going back to research, what about for solving crimes? Identifying people with fingerprints quickly so no one can get hurt.  In conclusion, computers affect us in positive ways and are a great help to society, from locating people, to communication, and all the way to finding valuable and life - changing information. I hope that you and I see eye to eye on this matter. Advancing computers are our friends, not the enemy."
142	142	1	3	"As more and more people are becoming accustomed to using computers, I believe that this is having a negative effect on society. Because of computers, people are not exercising as much as they should, which is of crucial importance for maintaining good health and a proper lifestyle. In addition, people are becoming unable to enjoy and appreciate nature while they still can. Finally, people are slowly losing their ability to communicate effectively with family and friends. As every day people are getting in touch with technology, they are losing touch with the world around them. Therefore, the advances in technology are having a negative impact on society.  When the average person uses the computers, be it for business, homework, chatting, or just for fun, they are easily occupied for long periods of time. They consider themselves ""too busy"" for a thing called exercise, which is becoming more and more crucial to our health and well - being. With music, walk, cool friends right in front of us, who has the time to go for a walk, jog, or bike ride? With computers, people are losing the will to exercise. In this day and age, when we need our exercise more than ever, we are neglecting it. Every day, rainforests are being deforested, the air is polluted, and the sky is clouded. We need to get out and experience nature, but because of the allure of the @ORGANIZATION1 screen, we fail to realize this. We need to wake up and appreciate the beauty of the @ORGANIZATION1.  As time goes by, with the development of communication technology through the internet, this issue of maintaining healthy relationships is becoming a progressively worse issue. ""Face - to - face"" is something that doesn't completely exist on the internet. This means that while you might find someone you can call a ""friend"" online, you never know exactly who they are until you've actually met them...which could be potentially dangerous. Additionally, the very real emotions and human need for interaction that comes with relationships is something that can never be simulated or programmed, no matter how ""advanced"" your technology is.  As you can see, the dependency on and overuse of computers is having a negative effect on our society. We are not taking the time for exercise, enjoying nature, and human interaction, all of which are vital to our health. And in a world where it's more important than ever to be healthy, grateful, and diplomatic, we are slowly losing these important aspects. Therefore, the over - reliance on @ORGANIZATION1 is having a negative impact on society."
143	143	1	3	Dear, @ORGANIZATION1, my name is @CAPS2 @CAPS3 and I am a student in @ORGANIZATION1 middle school. I want to state my opinion on how computers affect people. There are many things related to computers, like games, chatrooms, social networking, and also information for homework or for work and jobs. Well, let me get started. My opinion on people using computers is that it is good. Only fools don't use computers. They help you a lot. Let's say I am in a situation where I forgot how to do something. I'll just go on the computer and find it, and it's that easy. I've used a computer all my life and I am smart. I even help my mom use the computer sometimes.  Chat rooms are great. You can make new friends and you can talk to family members, like your mom, dad, or cousin if they live in a different part of the world. I talk to my cousin all the time, not a little bit. He lives in Colombia. I also talk to my friends on Facebook to ask what the homework was sometimes.  Games are fun when you get bored or have nothing to do. You can play all different kinds of games, like action games. Or if you want a challenge, you can play hard games like chess or Sudoku. These games can help your brain think and exercise your mind. Games can also help you get to know the computer better. Many people don't even know how to type without looking at the keyboard. I still have to look at it sometimes.  Well, these are some of the opinions I had about the computer. Even though people think it takes time from exercising and interacting with people in person, it's not really wasted time. You are exercising your brain and you can still interact with people. So, until next time, remember that computers can be a great asset in our lives.
144	144	1	3	Dear local Newspaper, In my opinion, computers are a great help to our planet. The new technology makes life easier to handle in numerous ways. The computers are a help because they teach hand - eye coordination. You can talk to people, and it is a new way to be entertained.  Computers can teach hand - eye coordination because of typing. Whether someone realizes it or not, when you are typing fast, it is benefiting your hands. Also, the fact that if you are typing without making mistakes is also helpful because it makes your hands more agile and easier to move. The typing is giving your hands a lot of exercise because your hands are moving all over the keyboard. The more you move them, the more exercise you can get. Computers can really help improve hand - eye coordination a great deal.  Computers can also help by enabling us to talk to people. To talk to people far away, it is better to talk to them on the computer because if you have a webcam, you can see each other. You are able to talk to people from different countries. Also, computers are able to be used in business meetings when a business has to talk with another from different locations. For example, if part of the business is doing a project in Hong Kong, then the boss can set up a meeting to see how it is going. Another way to use computers to talk to people is to speak with a person you are not able to see in person. Like if a person is in the hospital but you're not able to go, then you can talk while seeing each other through the computer. Computers are a great way to use in communication.  Computers are also a new way to get entertained. They can entertain you because there are games that you can play. There are games that come pre - installed with the computers and a lot of games on the internet. Instead of being bored all the time, you can play thousands of games with just a click of a mouse. Also, to avoid boredom, you can watch videos on platforms like YouTube. You can listen to music or watch comedy videos. Videos also show a way to express what you feel and present it in comedy, horror, or sad videos. Also, for teenagers, there are ways to talk to their friends on social media like Facebook. On the website, you can talk with anyone on your friends list.  In the end, computers can help kids, adults, or teenagers. With just a click of your mouse, you can access a new and powerful way of technology. And you can be able to get better hand - eye coordination, talk to people, and get entertained. So go get yourself a computer and be amazed at all the wonderful things it can do for you.
145	145	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, are you administering your local newspaper to society? You are probably using a computer to type the documents. If the government, businesses, schools, students, and local newspapers are using computers for a variety of different tasks, then why are they not helpful?  Primarily, computers are used for typing, editing, and presenting. As stated before, local newspapers are required to use computers to present their work in a professional and readable manner. As a member of society, I know I would not want to read something that is not typed neatly. The government must announce laws to the people and use typed documents to communicate with different countries and states. Without computers, signs, flyers, businesses, and even newspapers would not be possible.  Let's say you are running late to work because of traffic on the highway. How are you supposed to explain the situation to your boss in time? You can simply email him about the situation and arrive at work stress - free. Practically the entire world uses computers as a source of communication, so why be indifferent? Computers make life easier for people through communication like email, social network websites such as Facebook and AOL, and even video chat.  Computers supply an excellent source of communication that is even used throughout schools. Teachers and administrators interact with each other with important messages using computers. If computers are important to them, then how could they be destructive to society? As a Western Middle School student, I know the amount of projects and research we are required to do per class. Without the internet, this would almost be an impossible task. The internet allows research to happen efficiently. After the research is finished, the paper or homework assignment must be typed and printed. Without the assistance from computers, having neatly - written and well - researched assignments would not be possible.  To conclude, I feel that computers are an excellent advance in technology and should be used as frequently as possible. Without them, newspapers could not print, teachers could not communicate effectively, and students couldn't complete tasks for school. As a student, I know they help me with school and communicating with my friends and relatives. If computers are such a helpful source to society, why would people consider them as a concern? We should embrace this technology and make the most of its benefits.
146	146	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I think that using computers helps people because if we did not have computers, we would not know everything about anyone or anything. For example, all of the @CAPS1, I would not know anything about them, but with computers, I know a lot about them and their lives. Like @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 got shot in the back of the head, and @CAPS4 got shot too. I also know a lot about the @ORGANIZATION1. They are white people who instill fear in black people, and the same goes for the wars like World @NUM1 and World @NUM2, and the @CAPS5 and @PERSON1 and the @CAPS6 war. There was a plain spy plane flying across @LOCATION1, and they shot it down because we were trying to see if they had any nuclear bombs over there. And the same with Google and Yahoo. With Google, you can type in anything, and you will get an answer, and most likely a correct answer. Yahoo and Google are great for some work, products, and studying. In conclusion, I firmly believe that computers are good as they offer a wealth of information and useful tools.
147	147	1	3	Hour after hour of gaming online and posting blogs on social networking sites is all one sees. Unaware of their surroundings, many people zone in on their computer screens and only break away when absolutely necessary. That is not what the world should become, but that is what our society is creating. Computers do not create positive benefits to society. Because of all the time spent on the computer, people's bodies are taking the negative effects. There is also less and less face - to - face interactions with family and friends. Another huge issue is cyberbullying. These are all problems that should be addressed. With all the time spent on a computer in a stuffy, dark room, how will our bodies be maintained properly? Exercise is a key ingredient to healthy living. It is like trying to make bread without flour; without that necessity, the bread will not rise to its full potential. It is the same with the health and functions of our bodies. Exercise must be taken part in to burn fat and calories, but it is also needed to build and maintain muscles. In fact, it is recommended to get in at least one hour of exercise or outside play a day. Not many succeed with this goal, which brings up another negative effect to the body. @CAPS2 @CAPS1 helps to maintain strong bones. To get the recommended dose of @CAPS2 @CAPS1 a day, you only need to absorb @NUM1 minutes of sunlight a day. It doesn't seem like a lot, but @PERCENT1 of our population is not outside to receive it. Instead, they are inside on their computers. Parties, lunch breaks, or even a family dinner are great times to socialize. But, what if one day you decided you were going to skip your lunch break with friends and instead spend time posting a daily blog. This is social time lost. If this habit continues, you might soon see yourself drifting away from your friends because you don't make the time to spend lunch break with them. Even when a child interacts while chatting with friends on @CAPS5 or @CAPS6, anything could be said. Children won't learn at a young age how to think on their feet in real - time language. This will affect their later years when interviewing for things such as colleges or even jobs. Social skills are the difference between success and failure. Spending life on a computer is equivalent to being a caterpillar in its cocoon, while at least attempting to be active will turn you into a well - rounded individual. All these negative aspects are compounded by the ominous cyberbullying. One simple way to prevent this is spending less time on the computer. The effects of cyberbullying can be brutal. A recent study showed that @PERCENT2 of kids would rather be bullied in face - to - face situations than over the internet. The reason is that a great deal of cruelty is displayed through cyberbullying over the internet because it takes much less courage to type something up than for a bully to say something to their victim's face. Such cyberbullying has even led to suicides. In fact, a girl committed suicide due to cyberbullying just @NUM2 weeks ago. In conclusion, we must recognize the many negative impacts of excessive computer use and take steps to limit it for a healthier and more social life.
148	148	1	3	I believe that computers benefit our society for many reasons. Computers have been around for many years now, and everywhere you go, you usually see one. That must mean people love them. There are so many uses and fun experiences you can have with a computer. Computers make people happy, and that makes for a better society because it is happier. They make people happy because you can play games like Tetris, @CAPS1, and even cards. Computer games make people happy because whenever they are bored and there's nothing going on, you can hop on the computer and play a game. Some of the awesome games featured on a computer are @CAPS1, cards, pinball, and other great games. The computer makes for a happier home because as soon as kids get home from school, they use it for games or to chat with friends. Another reason computers benefit society is because you can now pay bills and buy things from the internet. When you pay bills or buy things over the internet, there is no need to go out and waste money on gas, so it makes people very happy when they save money. It also saves on pollution because if a car isn't going out, there is less emissions. So, computers are also saving society as well. My last reason that computers benefit society is they can make you smarter and make you do better in school by learning about different people or cultures. For example, on my last research project for social studies, I used the computer and got an A. This made me happy, so in effect, it makes society happy. In conclusion, computers bring joy, knowledge, and savings to our lives, making them an essential part of a better - functioning society, and that's why I love computers and believe everybody else should too.
149	149	1	3	Dear local Newspaper. I am stating my opinion that the more people use computers, the less time they spend with their family. I have three reasons why computers are good or bad. Not everyone agrees that computers are beneficial for the society. There are both positive and negative effects that computers have on people. My reasons for supporting my view that computers are good or bad are as follows: the first is that computers have a positive effect on people; the second is the ability to talk to other people online; and the last is spending more time with family than on the computer. The first reason that I have for computers is how they have a positive effect on people. The examples that I have to support this view are that computers teach hand - eye coordination, and they give people the ability to learn about far - away places and people. The second reason that I have regarding computers is that you can talk to people online. The examples that I have to support my view are the websites that kids use to talk to their friends like MySpace and Facebook. The places that kids like to go to are YouTube and even blogging about everything and everyone. Some of these things can be good if you don't post pictures or other things on your MySpace or Facebook. I think that these websites are dangerous because somebody can hack into your file, and they can try to talk to you like they're your friend. The third reason I have to support my view is that we should spend more time with our family than being on the computer the whole time. I have examples of what we should do with our families instead of being on the computers. I have some examples of games that we can play with our families instead of being on the computers. The games that we can play with our families are Monopoly, Sorry, Candy Land, card games, video games. We can also talk to our family instead of talking to our friends the whole time. We can enjoy what we have in life, not just with computers but with our family. In conclusion, while computers have their positives, we should prioritize spending quality time with our families to maintain strong relationships and a balanced life.
150	150	1	3	Dear newspaper, @CAPS1, computers do have some cons, but they also have a lot of pros. Some pros are that they show magnificent pictures of nature, and you can keep these pictures until you want to send them by email. You can even order tickets for planes, trains, and movies. Let's not forget shopping on the internet. If you go on the internet, you can find many pictures of anything you want, such as pictures of nature, celebrities. About @PERCENT1 of all pictures on the internet are true. A computer can also hold pictures that you take on a digital camera. It can even take a project on a flash drive and then download it. The computer can even email the pictures to any existing email address. If you want to go to the movies or on vacation, you can get the movie tickets online. You can get them at any ticket sales website. If you want to go on vacation, you can get your hotel tickets, even your plane, train, or boat ticket online. Buying tickets isn't the only thing you can do on the internet; you can buy stuff too. You can order @CAPS2, @CAPS2 @NUM1, @CAPS2 @NUM2, GameCube, Xbox, Xbox @NUM3, Wii, and even computer games. You can even buy the game systems. You can buy household appliances. Also, you can put clothes and other store products on hold. On the internet, you can watch videos on almost any website you go on. Some videos may be about grass, some may be funny, others may even be weird. @PERCENT2 of all teenagers like watching music videos. Some are just the artist singing and dancing in a background; other times, people make fun of other artists. Even though computers do have pros and cons, they have more pros. Like the examples in the passage above clearly show, computers offer a wide range of useful functions and entertainment options, making them an important part of our lives.
151	151	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I don't agree with the people who say people spend too much time on their computers. Because people can learn almost anything they want all on a computer. Also, there are lots of reasons why people should use advanced technology. They can teach kids how to find out answers to their homework the fast way instead of reading a book or taking a class and still get the full understanding. The people that say others spend too much time on their computers are also right about that, but they still can interact with friends and family. They can play games, speak to each other, even learn new things together, all through a computer. One thing they were right about was to go out and enjoy the nature. You can't do that on a computer, but you can help the nature on a computer, like trying to put up a blog. Something that people make so others can see and spread the word. And on that blog, it can state to stop cutting down trees for stores or stop killing animals for their fur or anything you want to write. So the people that do read this should agree with me because you can do lots of things on a computer and learn a lot more than you ever thought you could. So go out and find yourself a computer and find something you need to do or learn or just to have some fun. It's clear that computers offer a wealth of opportunities, and with a balanced approach, we can make the most of them.
152	152	1	3	Dear local newspaper, My opinion on the effects computers have on people is a positive effect. Three main reasons are that people learn more about cultures, places, and some people work online. My first reason why computers have a positive effect on people is because they help you learn about cultures around the world. Learning about cultures is very important because if people travel, they need to know how they can respect each other. Different cultures have unique traditions, values, and ways of life. By using computers, we can explore these aspects in - depth. My second reason why computers have a positive effect on people is because they help you learn about places around the world. Learning about places is very important because you could get lost. It also helps you by telling you which places are famous to visit. You can view virtual tours and get detailed maps. My third reason why computers have a positive effect on people is because some people find jobs online. Other people work online. This benefits people in a positive way as it provides more job opportunities and flexibility. In conclusion, computers have a positive effect on people because it helps people learn about cultures, places, and jobs around them, making the world a more connected and accessible place.
153	153	1	3	@ORGANIZATION1, There are many people in this world that think always being on the computer is good because they can talk with people online and learn more about the world. But, then there are people who disagree with them. I am one of those people. Spending too much time on the computer can really affect your life. People stop exercising, don't enjoy the beauty of nature or life, and they aren't spending enough time with their family and friends. So, I hope that while you read through this letter, you take some of this information into consideration. First of all, when people spend a lot of time on the computer, they aren't getting all of the exercise that their body needs. They become lazy and don't want to do anything. This is very bad because it will affect your health and the rest of your life. People often become overweight and since they got lazy from always being on the computer, they won't go out and get the exercise that their body needs. People need to enjoy their life! By always being on the computer, they won't be able to. There are so many fun and healthy things you can do for your body. You can go play sports and have fun while getting exercise. Many people do this and try to encourage their family and friends to do it with them. But, some of their family and friends are too lazy to do anything because they are always on the computer. Instead, they stay inside the house all cooped up and don't get enough fresh air. This is a horrible thing to do to yourself. Your body needs fresh air, so start enjoying your life a little more people! Finally, people often lose contact with family members or their friends because they are too busy on the computer playing games. I know I wouldn't want to lose a friend to the internet ever again and I don't think anyone else would want to either. I once lost a friend or two because I didn't talk to them as much as I used to because I had been too busy on the computer on social media, online games, and other activities. I felt horrible because I didn't realize that I had been doing that. I really wouldn't want anyone else to lose contact with a family member or lose a friend because of the internet. It's horrible and you don't feel like yourself anymore. Once again I would like to tell you that always being on the internet is not good. You can become lazy, not want to do anything etc., people aren't enjoying their life to the fullest and you can and often lose contact with a family member or lose a friend because you spend too much time on the computer. I hope that after reading this, you realize that being on the computer is not always good for you and make the necessary changes to lead a more balanced life.
154	154	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, I believe that computers are an extremely useful tool in society. It helps people learn new things about different cultures. Also, it lets you communicate with friends and family through the internet, for example, using Facebook or Skype. Finally, it provides an accurate research tool for school projects, or interviews. First, learning about different cultures helps the world stay together. For example, here, we learn about different ethnic groups and their traditions. Each class teaches us to respect more and more of this culture. However, some people don't have the chance to get this kind of education, so they turn to the internet. If the computer didn't exist, we might not know about the lifestyle 100 mi away from us. We wouldn't know if their lifestyles are extremely difficult or luxurious. Also, we wouldn't know if we could help them or not. For example, the earthquake in Haiti which caused great destruction. By using computers, we can learn about the situation and contribute to relief efforts. It's one step closer to world peace, no more war or conflicts. Secondly, the computer helps you communicate to friends and family around the world. I remember one time I was mailing my family friend who was in Afghanistan, risking his life. I knew he couldn't come back to town, so I started to email him, and video - chat with him. Whenever I saw his face, I knew that everything was okay. I don't know how I would have coped without the internet. Other ways like sending letters are slow and unreliable. Also, just communicating with friends on internet sites is extremely useful. Finally, you can use the computer for educational use. For example, research projects, study tools and essays. Whenever there is a research project, the internet is the go - to place. This is extremely reliable and accurate. However, we must note that some of the websites are fake, but with proper verification, we can find great research to use for school projects. Also, I know many teachers in my school have a blog or page where they put their lectures on, study links, and handouts, just in case we lose them. Whenever there is a test coming up, my history teacher, Mrs. Smith would have links on her page to help us study. Also, Quizlet is another website that helps us study for vocab. It also has many games that make it fun to learn our vocab words. As you can see, the computer helps us in our daily use and makes a positive impact on our society. From educational purposes, to learning cultures and socializing with friends it helps us get through life. As a very successful newspaper and people, I assume you will understand how much the computer has made a positive effect in society and spread the word about its benefits.
155	155	1	3	"Dear @ORGANIZATION2, There has been a lot of talk about how computers effect society. Some ""experts"" say computers are good for society and some think the opposite, that computers are bad for society because they make children obese, decrease a person's social skills, and even make children less educated. Computers are just plain bad. In recent years, studies show that children that use the computer often are less likely and less willing to get active. Dr. Johnson says, ""The more children use computers, the more time they waste sitting not being active at all."" A study conducted by the @ORGANIZATION1 shows that children that use the computer 3 hours a day are more obese than children who use it one hour or less a day. Computers keep children inside all day. A child on the computer is wasting time not being active. The main reason children become fat on the computer is because it is easier to just go on the computer than to walk and exert energy. Computers are a direct cause to child obesity, and they are a threat to society. Some of you may think a computer can increase social skills, and you are dead wrong! On a computer you can ""talk"" to friends, but it is not like you are actually talking to them. On a computer you can talk in private and say whatever the heck you want. In public, if you say something bad you will get in a lot of trouble. A computer offers no face - to - face interaction. So when a person who uses a computer often is at a social gathering they are usually very awkward. My cousin spends all of his time on the computer and when I went to his house on Christmas he never took his eyes off the screen! Computers are destroying the social life of millions of people. Did you know that people who use the computer often are usually less smart than kids who don't? ""Experts"" on computers say that computers can be used for infinite knowledge. The key word in that phrase is ""can"". Just because kids have knowledge at their fingertips doesn't mean they will use it. On many projects and homework assignments I have recorded kids say ""I just copied and printed an article on Google."" By copying and printing, students don't learn anything. Computers are slowly making people less educated. Ever since the invention of the computer, people have seen promise for society. Now computers are destroying society by making people fat, socially weird, and less educated. So how can people still think computers are good? It's time to recognize the negative impacts and take steps to limit computer use for a healthier and more well - rounded society."
156	156	1	3	"Dear Local newspaper, I just recently read about your well - written article regarding the computer usage. In my honest opinion, I firmly think that computers are indeed a good thing. Yet, I whole - heartedly believe that it could have a negative influence as well. I truly believe that computers are one of mankind's most remarkable technologies. You can easily type up important documents, learn in - depth about historical happenings, explore different places around the globe, and understand various cultures as well. You can conveniently talk to people from far away by using chat applications or the webcam. That's precisely what I use to speak to my dear relatives in @LOCATION2. Computers are one of the best things that has happened to me and my life. However, although the computer can be such a wonderful thing, it can be bad as well. A lot of people overuse it too. In fact, I know a person and she's an incredibly nice person. She's sweet, caring, loves kids, and has a kind heart. The only drawback is that she's a @CAPS2 addict. She is absolutely crazy about @CAPS2. Sometimes when she comes over, I'll be using my laptop and she'll eagerly ask to check her @CAPS2 status. My point is that she allows @CAPS2 to take over her. It's really not cool. I read an article the other day about computer usage in @LOCATION1. Dr. @PERSON1 covered this article on the topic of computer usage. She said ""The average American spends four hours or more on the computer. Although there are other people who spend their time outside when it's nice. I congratulate them on that"". See, now you've heard it from the expert as well. In conclusion, I would like to clearly state that computers can have either a positive influence or a negative one as well. So it all depends on how you use it and how much time you spend on it. So my point that I would like to get across in @LOCATION1 is that use your computer wisely. Don't spend all of your time on it. Life's too short for that. So spend quality time with family and friends and go outside too!"
157	157	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1, I'm curious to know @CAPS2 much time do you spend on the computer daily, is it @NUM1 hour, or perhaps @NUM2 hours? While computers are truly amazing advances in technology, they are also very bad for you. People spend hours at a time on the computer, which causes less time for exercising, leads to horrible speaking habits, and exposes them to dangerous searches. From @DATE2 to @DATE3, the numbers of obese people increased from @PERCENT2 of @LOCATION2 citizens to @PERCENT1. In a recent study, the amount of families with computers is now @NUM3 out of @DATE1 compared to the @NUM4 out of @DATE1 in @DATE4. Scientists wonder if they were connected and realized they were. People who spent hours on the computer live a sedentary lifestyle. They are more likely to go on the computer than go exercise. The lack of exercising causes obesity and cardiovascular problems. Without this valuable exercise, more people are at risk of various health issues. At a visit to the hospital, a surgeon said he has seen a huge increase of heart surgeries in the @DATE1. We found that the computer manual booklets clearly say to only go on for an @NUM1 hour at a time. The hottest thing online these days is social networking, whether it's @CAPS6's Twitter, or Facebook. These social networking platforms allow teens to talk with their friends. But @CAPS6 really isn't having a proper conversation. For example, they write ""@CAPS3 @CAPS4 going @NUM2 dance."" Not only is the spelling wrong but also the grammar. And this language doesn't just stay online; @CAPS6 is now how they talk in real life. @PERSON1, the grandmother to a social - networking enthusiast, said, ""I can't even have conversations with her because she is talking like she is on the computer. It's so sad."" @CAPS5 for public speaking and English class, @PERSON2, an English teacher for @NUM7 @DATE1, states @CAPS2 she has seen a drop in teens' ability to write grammatically correct and @CAPS2 when she corrects essays, they are written in social - networking form. ""It's hard to see literature dissolving because kids are spending so much time on the computer. The average day for children in @LOCATION1 @CAPS7 is to go home and go on the computer for hours at a time until a parent comes home. @CAPS2 would you like your child to be surfing the internet alone without you for hours when you don't know what they are doing. Parent blockers can only do so much. Children can find out the password and get around it. The dangers are always there. You can get a lot of good information on the internet but you can also get a lot of bad information. You don't know what your child is searching or who they are talking to on the computer; it could be very dangerous."
158	158	1	3	Dear newspaper, Although some believe computers do not benefit society, I whole - heartedly disagree. Computers play a crucial role in helping businesses thrive, keep people aware of what is going on in the world, and allow people to stay in touch with each other. Computers greatly benefit small and large businesses across the world. Imagine all the operations at each business without a computer. Businesses would be highly unreliable because no instant contact would mean it might take a long time for products to be assembled and shipped. Any business owner would cringe at the idea of running a business without a computer. When surveyed, @NUM1 out of @NUM2 business owners and workers would strongly prefer a computer's assistance at work. Almost every modern - day business relies on at least one computer. For example, companies that mass - produce their products often rely on computers to do jobs more precisely than a human worker. Sometimes computer - operated robots do dangerous jobs so workers are not at risk. Businesses also need computers to quickly receive and send information to other businesses and people. Businesses are not the only ones in need of computers. People use computers as much, if not more, than businesses. People like you and me use computers to keep in touch with friends and people we know. Thanks to popular websites like @CAPS2 and e - mail, people can easily stay in constant contact. Families use computers to plan get - togethers. Friends use computers to keep contact after grade school or if they do not live nearby. With computers, anyone that is anywhere can be in constant contact with anyone else. People also like to know news immediately. Without computers, it would be a lot harder to contact the rest of the world. Imagine a natural disaster occurring and not knowing about it right away. In that case, we could not send aid to the area in a timely manner. With the recent earthquakes in @LOCATION1 and @LOCATION2, knowledge about the rest of the world is even more important. Newspapers provide news and information but a day or two late, and they often use computers to acquire that information. Eighty - seven percent of scientists agree that receiving information would be a lot harder without computers. In conclusion, it's evident that computers bring numerous benefits to both businesses and individuals, and their importance in our modern lives cannot be overstated.
159	159	1	3	"Imagine standing outside on a sunny day, the warm sun gently dancing on your back, and then jumping into the pool and feeling the cool water flow smoothly around you. But no, that won't happen. Because children and their parents are spending way too much time on their computers. People aren't getting enough exercise, it can be very dangerous, and families are spending less time with each other. Without computers, the situation is already challenging, so it's even worse with them. I think people need to realize that computers are taking over humans. Humans, especially children, need exercise. But with computers, that isn't really possible. More and more children are becoming obese by the year, and computers are making that happen quicker. Instead of sitting at the computer munching on potato chips, children should be outside on their bikes, enjoying the fresh air, or swimming in the pool, or playing sports with their friends. If it is winter, the least kids could do is go sledding down the snowy hills. Children need to experience nature, not just the screen of a computer. The computer can also be very dangerous. @NUM1 year olds are making Facebook accounts! You can find @NUM2 year olds on the internet now. Naive teenagers go find ""friends"" in chatrooms or on @CAPS2, and their ""friends"" lie to them about their age, or assume another identity. Many teenagers go and meet someone they met online and end up getting raped or killed. There are many sick people in the world, and many of them use the internet to find vulnerable people. Lots of teenagers give out personal information like their last name, cellphone number, or where they live, and that's an easy way for predators to find them. It puts them, and their whole family in danger. Computers are breaking up families and friends. Things like @CAPS1, @CAPS2, @CAPS3, farm - springing, @CAPS4, etc. are turning people against each other. Some families even eat dinner at the computer. When friends go over to other friends' houses, they just sit on the computer. Why is it so fun to just look at the computer screen? Families need to do something together like eat dinner together at the dining table, go out for ice cream on a nice evening, go shopping at the mall, something, anything but going on the computer all day. I'll admit, I am a little addicted to the computer. But I don't go on it @NUM3, like some people. Instead of eating dinner at the computer, go out to dinner as a family. Instead of online shopping, go shopping with your friends. It isn't hard to cut back @NUM4 or @NUM5 hours of going on the computer. Am I the only teenager who thinks this? Maybe. But I know that I am benefitting myself by cutting back on the computer. We don't get enough exercise, it can become really dangerous, and family and friends should start spending more time together. Computers can do everything more than humans can, and we need to stop this trend before it's too late."
160	160	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I whole - heartedly agree that people are spending more time on the computers and less time doing other important stuff. For example, they don't spend time exercising, enjoying the beauty of nature, and they don't spend quality time with their family. Those are very important things that people don't understand that they are missing out on. First, people that spend a lot of time on the computer don't engage in exercise. Doing exercise is extremely good for your health. If you don't do exercise when you get older, your bones are going to weaken. Also, you could easily get fat, and that is very bad for your heart. Just because people are on the computer, they don't pay attention to their health. Next, people don't enjoy the beautiful nature that is outside. It's truly beautiful when you hear the birds singing sweet melodies or see the colorful plants outside. People are forgetting about nature. They don't recycle so that the planet could be clean. The air that we smell is not clean because they don't care about nature. Instead of being on the computer, they should help so that the world could be a better place. Finally, people don't spend time with the people that love them. It is very important to spend quality time with your family. People don't realize that the first thing in life is your family. Instead of being on the computer, it's really fun going to the beach with your kids, wife, father, and so on. In conclusion, I firmly believe that computers have a significant impact on people. People, just for being on the computer, they don't do exercise, enjoy nature, and they don't spend time with their family. Now that you've heard my thoughts, I ask you to think about yours and consider making some positive changes in your life to strike a better balance.
161	161	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Computers have a very positive effect on people. I whole - heartedly agree that computers have a positive effect. They are excellent tools for teaching hand - eye coordination. This skill gives people the ability to learn about diverse people and places, and you can engage in online conversations. The first reason is that computers teach hand - eye coordination. For example, when you learn how to type, you gradually memorize the keys. As a result, you don't have to constantly look down at the keyboard. Computers also teach hand - eye coordination when using a mouse. When you want to click on something, you have to focus on the screen and precisely move the mouse to click on the icon. Another instance where computers teach hand - eye coordination is once you know what to do, you don't have to search the entire screen for an icon. You can just move the mouse to a specific spot on the screen and know exactly what action to take. Computers teach hand - eye coordination when you type, when you move the mouse to click on an icon, and when you memorize all of the icons. The second reason is computers make you smarter. For example, if you have a history project, and you need to know about China, you can use the computer. How often would detailed information about China be in the newspaper? Using the computer, you can access quick and in - depth information. Another example is computers can find information on famous people no one knew much about. You could be able to find what college a famous actor went to in a matter of seconds. The last example is that a search engine can look up famous pictures. If you are working on a project that requires pictures, @ORGANIZATION1 can provide the photos you need. Computers make you smarter because you can look up different countries, you could look up people, and famous countries. The last reason is computers give you the ability to talk online with friends. For example, you could catch up with friends you don't see that much during school. Talking online is just as fast as texting. Also, you could continue a conversation you had with a friend. Did the bell ring in the middle of a conversation? Well, you can continue it on @CAPS4, or @CAPS5. Lastly, you can just have a plain conversation. You could make plans, or you can talk about upcoming events. Computers give you access to talking with your friends. In conclusion, computers do have a positive effect on other people. You can develop hand - eye coordination, you can look up foreign countries and people, and you can talk with your friends, making them an invaluable part of our lives.
162	162	1	3	"Since computers were invented, a colossal change in the way society functions has taken place. People can now easily go on to their computers to communicate with peers, obtain information on any topic for a school paper, or simply use the internet to watch videos and read stories. Magazine and newspaper articles, books and even movies and shows are readily available on today's computers! This advancement in technology has made the @NUM1 century the most modern era this world has ever seen, and is highly beneficial to society. The ""computer age"" has given people in today's society the incredible opportunity to broaden their imaginations through technology. You can, in less than one minute, go on the internet, type in to @ORGANIZATION1 whatever movie or book you want and start watching or reading instantly. People have always said that books can take you anywhere you want. Well, the computers can do the same thing, except with greater efficiency and with more places to choose from. You can, instead of buying a book, go online and read about the faraway city of @LOCATION1, or of the eruption of the @CAPS1 @CAPS2, and you can do it with mind - blowing speed. Some think that by wasting time on computers, people are using up time that could be spent studying or with family. However, any information needed to expand your knowledge on a topic can be found on the internet. And if you want to spend time with your family, you can even connect your computer to a TV and watch a free movie with the family! The computer age is here and it is exactly what society needs. Picture this: you're doing a school project on a topic you know nothing about. Would you rather drive minutes going to a library and thirty minutes looking for everything you need, or do you think it's more sensible to spend five minutes looking for the website you need on the internet? Obviously, the latter of the two is much more reasonable. The computer makes getting research for school or work substantially easier. In addition, you can create entire presentations on a computer with surprising ease! Being an eighth - grade student, I don't know what I would ever do without the internet. I rely on my computer to get all of my research for almost every project, and I even make some of my best projects on it! The computer makes the lives of all the hard - working students and adults much, much easier. People's lives have not only been made easier in the field of research; computers make communicating with friends and family easier as well! Through e - mail, video chat and instant messaging, we can communicate with whoever we wish, whenever we want. With some computers, you can even see and talk to any person you wish. Without these computers, we would once again have to resort to snail mail, which makes instant communication difficult. Compared to telephones, computers offer more options. Computers have enhanced communication so greatly that it's foolish to say they're not beneficial to society. The computer age is a boon to society, making various aspects of life more convenient and accessible."
163	163	1	3	Computers are over - used and control the minds of some people. Computers are partially to @CAPS1 for America's high obesity percentage. America's teens are not doing their homework and not investing time into school because of computers. These high - tech machines should be restricted and given to only those who truly need them. People spend way too much time on computers. The time people spend on the computer is time they should be exercising. Studies show that @PERCENT1 of obese Americans admit to being addicted to the computer. This is why computers are bad. The internet on computers is unsafe. Experts say that popular chatting sites such as MySpace are the reason for the sudden increase in murders and rapes. The number of convicted criminals as well as sex offenders is tremendous. Yet parents let their children use them. People don't understand the troubles computers cause. Besides the other factors, computers retard teens' learning. The computer is supposed to be a helpful tool and used for learning. But computers are being used for other things. Computers encourage kids not to study or do homework. Although there are useful learning sites and tools, these tools aren't used often. Computers hurt people in many ways. America should have an off - computer week to fight back from its evil grip on children. I hope one day we can all turn off our computers for good and focus on more important aspects of life, like physical activity, real - life social interaction, and education.
164	164	1	3	Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1, do you think computers have a positive or negative effect on people? I personally think computers have a positive effect on people because with computers, many people can conduct in - depth research about the past. Also, I don't agree that computers have a negative effect on anybody because with computers, many people learn hand - eye coordination, gain the ability to learn about faraway people and places, and they also allow people to talk to old friends or family members. Then, computers can also be used to help someone find detailed information about nature such as different trees, plants, animals, and many other things that are involved in nature. After that, computers are also sometimes used to contact people who live far away from you. Some ways to contact people on a computer are using e - mails, instant messaging, Facebook, MySpace, and many other websites. In addition, I think computers have a positive effect on people, but others may not agree, which is fine because not everybody has the same opinion on stuff in the world. Then, computers can be very useful to many people because they can use computers if they need to find comprehensive information on history, any events that might have occurred in the past that might not still be happening in the present. Finally, computers are useful to scientists, business workers, many adults, and even children use computers if they need to type something for school or need to find information for a project they're doing. In conclusion, computers bring numerous benefits to people of all ages and professions, making them an important part of modern life.
165	165	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, every day, @CAPS1, new technology is developed. One of the biggest and most popular machines in the technological society is the computer. Some people don't like computers. They think computers are ruining social skills and healthy bodies. The reason I'm writing to you is to persuade those people to realize the greatness that lies inside a computer. For starters, computers help us receive and give @CAPS8. One of the great features that computers give is email. Without email, we would be completely out of the loop. For example, @CAPS2, if there is a snow day at your child's school, you receive an email from the superintendent saying school is canceled. Without that email, we wouldn't be able to know that important information. Another example, @CAPS6, say that you lost your voice due to a terrible cold. You don't feel good and need to call work to report being sick. Now you're stuck because you have no voice. @CAPS2, if you had a computer, you could have simply emailed your boss. Another positive tool computers give us is making communication easier. With all of the social networking now available like @CAPS4, Twitter, @CAPS3, and Yahoo Messenger, it is nearly impossible not to stay in contact with friends and family. Using @CAPS4, you can look up old friends and family. Once you've found them, you can send a friend request and become online friends. Once you're online friends, you can instant message, video chat, look at their status, and browse their photos. So with a computer, @CAPS7, it is nearly impossible not to be able to keep in touch. The last and final reason computers are great is because they make shopping much easier. @CAPS2, if you have used Amazon, eBay, or Overstock, you know what I'm talking about. You can buy almost anything online. From electronics to @CAPS5 animals, the list is endless. With a computer, you can even get your household groceries online. For example, @CAPS6, say you're home from work with explosive diarrhea. But @CAPS7, it's @DATE1, so you need to go grocery shopping. You've been on the toilet @PERCENT1 of the day and all you've got is your laptop. Well, you can shop online. So as you can see, computers help us communicate, shop, and get and receive @CAPS8, making them an essential part of our daily lives.
166	166	1	3	"To editor, @CAPS1's truly a beautiful day. The bright sun is shining brilliantly, the cheerful birds are chirping merrily, and a gentle, lazy breeze is flowing gracefully through the trees. But you don't notice any of @CAPS1 because you're plopped down comfortably in front of your computer, intently tapping away on @CAPS2 or checking your email. With modern technology so prevalent, this is a common scenario. Experts are deeply concerned that excessive computer use can severely harm your health, significantly hamper your social skills, and cause you to be completely disconnected from nature. While computers are indeed helpful in our lives, too much of one thing is never a good thing. As mentioned, computers have a negative effect on your health. Computers cause people to become extremely lazy. They would rather sit and @CAPS2 and email than go outside and exercise in the cool, crisp, fresh air. In fact, statistics recently released by the @ORGANIZATION1 show that computers are the @NUM1 leading reason for obesity. And weight problems are not the only thing to worry about. Too much time in front of the computer will also take @CAPS1's heavy toll on your eyes. Even local doctors have pointed @CAPS1. ""@CAPS4 since computers have become a common household item, the number of kids with eye problems has gone up about @NUM2 or @NUM3 more kids every year than the previous year,"" says @ORGANIZATION3 of the @ORGANIZATION2. And if that isn't enough, typing too many @CAPS5 and emails day after day can give you repetitive strain syndrome, also known as carpal tunnel. Carpal tunnel used to be more prevalent when typewriters were big, but dwindled down once computers with newer, easier - to - type - on keyboards came around. But excessive daily use of computers is causing doctors to see more cases of carpal tunnel crop up. @CAPS1 is clear that if you want to stay healthy, computer usage should be limited. Secondly, too much time spent on the computer can seriously affect your ability to communicate with others. Computers are helpful when you need to talk to someone, but people have gotten so used to it that they sometimes find it extremely awkward to talk to someone face to face. Their eyes look everywhere except at the person, they shift their weight back and forth nervously and struggle to find the right words to say things that should be easy. This awkwardness can also ruin previously close friendships. Friends will talk to each other endlessly through @CAPS2, but have no words for each other when they meet face to face. I remember on @DATE1, I didn't see one of my friends at all; we just @CAPS8 each other daily. When we saw each other at school, we found it incredibly hard to carry a conversation and it took some getting used to talking face to face again. And this isn't the only way friendships are put on the line by computers. Personal and meaningful conversations @MONTH1 sometimes be disrupted. You're on the phone with your friend and you're telling her about something important that you need advice on. A few seconds after you begin talking, you're interrupted by a loud @CAPS7! followed by a ""hold on, so and so just @CAPS8 me."" Clearly, computers seriously impact social skills and personal relationships. Another reason to watch how much time you spend on the computer is that it can cause you to miss out on the real - world experiences that are so vital for a well - rounded life."
167	167	1	3	"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 are being seriously questioned if they are good for our society or not. I would have to say that they are both good and bad; you really can't pick a clear - cut side. These are good because children and teens can easily get the information they need for their school studies. It allows people to have engaging chats with others in different far - flung places, and it helps improve hand - eye coordination. Those were the good aspects. Here are some bad things about computers. People spend an excessive amount of time on the computer instead of engaging in physical exercise. They don't get to fully enjoy the beauty of nature, and people stop having meaningful interactions with friends and family. Anyone can pick a side. I just can't, because I can relate to both sides. For example, one of the good reasons about computers was that you can have chats with other people around the world. I can relate to that because when I live here in @CAPS2 @CAPS3, my mom and step - dad live in @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2, so I don't see them much. But thanks to the computer, I can chat with them whenever I want to. Honestly, I wouldn't know how my life would be like if I didn't have a computer and I wasn't able to connect with them now. Although, I can also relate to one of the bad things about computers, which is that people spend too much time on them. I can relate to that, and so could many of the others as well. Because when I was around @NUM1 years old, after school, I would go straight on my laptop and stay there for around @NUM2 hours. When my grandma comes home around @NUM3 pm, she always comes in and scolds, ""Your on that thing too much! You'll hurt your hands!"" in her concerned voice. So in my opinion, I believe that computers can be good for our society and bad; for me, there is no side to take. Others might feel the same way, and others @MONTH1 not. It's up to them to make a choice. So ask yourself, ""Do you believe that computers are good or bad for our society?"" In the end, it's clear that computers have a dual nature, and we need to find a balance in our usage to make the most of their benefits while minimizing the drawbacks."
168	168	1	3	Dear @LOCATION1 Newspaper: @CAPS1, do you really think computers are that good? Computers are so incredibly helpful today that almost everyone has one. Computers are wonderful; they are great ways to find detailed information, they connect people from all corners of the world, and offer many valuable @ORGANIZATION1 opportunities. Hopefully, at the end of this letter, you will agree with me. Firstly, they help people find information. Computers are outstanding ways to find information. With Google and other similar programs, the whole world of knowledge is at your fingertips. In my school, surveys show that @PERCENT1 of all students use the computer to help them research for school projects and assignments. With computers, you can view many different websites from all around the world about a topic, and you can even find online books that you can use for in - depth study. This is one way computers are a great thing. There are two other great reasons. Secondly, with computers, the whole world becomes much smaller as people begin to know more and more people through the computer. More than @PERCENT2 of people email, @CAPS2, or video - chat on a daily basis. Isn't it great when you make a great friend in college but you find out he/she lives halfway around the world, and you know that you can still keep in touch with the help of the computer? Did you know that many people in the military use video - chat to keep in close touch with their loved ones back home? Computers are great because they connect people and allow them to be virtually together even when they cannot be physically together. But there is still one even better reason why computers are good. Finally, computers offer many opportunities like education and jobs. Today, there are many single parents, more than in any other time according to @ORGANIZATION1, and the number is still drastically increasing with this tough economy. Some of those parents could really use a better education to help them bring in more money for their families. But when can they find time to go to school with work and then taking care of the kids? Now, there are many online college courses you can take to get the education you have always wanted. With Craigslist and other online ads, many people can post job offerings while others can email those people their resume to try to get the job. By seeing ads posted online, people can apply easier from farther away. Computers open many great opportunities for people. Computers are very cool machines that many people take for granted. They help give people information, as well as connect people from around the world and offer many @ORGANIZATION1 opportunities. So @LOCATION1 Newspaper, I hope you can try to understand my view on why computers are so great. In conclusion, computers are an indispensable part of modern life, bringing numerous benefits to people in various aspects.
169	169	1	3	Dear @LOCATION1 @CAPS1, after reading your article about advances in technology, I would like to offer my opinion about this controversial subject. All around the world, people are using computers to do all sorts of diverse things. Whether it's for playing exciting games, the buying and selling of useful items, or having engaging conversations with people in different countries, the possibilities are truly endless. This is, however, not necessarily a good thing. Many people, especially adolescents, become overly addicted to computers. They are drawn to the exciting games that computers offer. From my personal experience of being addicted to computers, I can honestly say that I was under almost complete control by that computer. My grades started to decline rapidly, I stopped having meaningful interactions with my friends and family, and I faced trouble concentrating on other important things. Many parents watch their children go through this difficult phase and are sometimes helpless to stop it. This poses a large problem for parents. My word of advice; don't let your children become addicted! It's crucial to set limits and encourage them to engage in other healthy activities. In the end, while computers have their uses, we need to ensure that their usage doesn't take over our lives, especially the lives of the younger generation.
170	170	1	3	There are some effects computers have on people that I agree with and disagree with. There are many people in the world that use computers every day, and some that use it occasionally. Also, it always provides you with information every time you use it. I would think that computers generally give a positive effect on people. Computers can have their likes and dislikes. Not every time when you need information, the computer will give you the accurate and useful stuff. There are some websites that give you the right information you want to know, and others do not fill your mind with positive and valuable things. That is one thing I do not like about computers. But don't think that is too bad because computers have a lot more fun and useful advantages. One of the most common and widely - used things around the world is instant @CAPS7. Instant @CAPS7 is when you are having a real - time communication with another human being over the online web. Many people use this to get in touch with close family members or dear friends. There are some well - known names for instant @CAPS7 like @CAPS1, @CAPS2, @CAPS3, @CAPS4 - mail, and many more! Yes, the computer can be very addicting, but once in a while, you need to get off and maybe go out and get some fresh air. For some people, I agree that they stay on the computer too much and become very lazy. This is one disadvantage that can cause you to skip exercising and spending time with friends and family. There is no problem if you go on for an hour a day, maybe a bit more, but too long is not good. There are so many things you can do on the computer that I can't name them all, like @CAPS5, @CAPS6, @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS7, and even buying things off the computers. Those are many of the things you can do on your computer. I love going on the computer from time to time, doing many of the things I have talked about. Also, if you don't have one, reading this @MONTH1 persuade you into getting one. My opinion is that they give you a very positive effect overall, but it's important to use them in moderation. In conclusion, computers are a double - edged sword, and we should make the most of their positive aspects while being cautious of the negative ones.
171	171	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1's opinion on the effects of computers is that some people are spending too much time on computers. They are good to be on for a while, but not all day. So, @CAPS1's first reason why I think spending too much time on computers is not a good thing is because it's better to be outside doing other activities with other people. Instead of sitting in front of the computer all day, you could hang out with friends and do some sports or engage in other fun activities. And if you're on the computer all day, you will start to lose some friends as you won't have time to maintain those real - world relationships. @CAPS1's second reason why I don't think it is good to be on the computer all day is because if you're not exercising, you will start to gain weight since you're sitting all day just on the computer. So, it's good to go outside and go for a walk or you could go to a gym. Exercise is good for you; it will keep you healthy. I know someone who is on the computer all day and he really doesn't go outside because he says that computers teach you a lot, and they do, but it is not good to be on it all day. @CAPS1's last reason on some bad effects of computers is that some people could use these computers for bad things. They could be going on some bad websites, and that will just make you stay on the computer even longer. You could even become addicted to being on computers because you're doing nothing else. And some people have cameras on their computers and some use them for bad things. So, that's why it is better not to be on a computer all day long. So, these were @CAPS1's reasons for some bad effects computers could have on people if you don't go outside to do some activities or to hang out with some friends. In conclusion, while computers have their uses, we should limit our time on them to avoid these negative consequences.
172	172	1	3	Dear @LOCATION1 @ORGANIZATION1, I do agree that people should stop spending most of their day on the computer and start to exercise more or spend time with friends and family. The computer has the ability to let you learn about faraway places. But instead of sitting behind a desk and learning about somewhere faraway through the computer screen, you should go outside and see it for yourself. You can feel the local culture, touch the unique landscapes, and have a more immersive experience. Also, our country is one of the top @NUM1 countries that has a high number of fat people. I believe that the computer has something to do with this because most of the kids in our school have a Facebook and about @PERCENT1 of those kids are on Facebook for at least an hour every day. This sedentary behavior on the computer is reducing the time they could spend on physical activities. This is why people should stop using the internet for most of their day because they are not getting the exercise they need. That is why our country is one of the top @NUM1 in the world that has the most overweight people. The internet does allow you to chat with family and friends, but you still need to hang out with your friends outside so you can exercise by playing sports or just going for a walk down the block. If you don't, you will not have a healthy relationship because sometimes they might not even be on the computer so you can chat with them online. Also, if you don't go outside and enjoy nature and play with friends, then you will become very lazy just by sitting in a chair all day and you wouldn't care to do anything anymore. In conclusion, we should balance our time between the computer and real - world activities to lead a healthy and fulfilling life.
173	173	1	3	Dear, Newspaper, I would like to tell you about computers. Without them, this world would fall apart. For example, some people's jobs are to fix them, make them, sell them. Also, some people work from home and need the computer for their jobs. For instance, a freelance writer needs a computer to write articles, and a graphic designer uses it to create designs. Without computers, so many people would be out of jobs and getting paid less. Also, kids need them for education reasons. For example, if you had a broken finger and couldn't hold a pencil, you would have to type. In addition, what if a student needed an answer to a question and there was no one to help them? They could go online and get the answer and learn. There are many ways a computer can help a person. For example, they could need directions or someone's phone number or answers. Also, you can buy online. What if you live too far away from your favorite store? You can fast - order or direct it online. Also, I believe kids should get off the computer and go outside and exercise. Today, there are too many overweight people. If people went for a walk instead of sitting on the computer all day, there wouldn't be as many overweight people. In addition, people need exercise. Without it, people would get fatty, lazy, sleepy, and some might get sick, and angry, and depressed. It would be to everyone's benefit if people would exercise more. In addition, without computers, a lot of people's lives would fall apart, but people just need to exercise more and everything will be fine. In conclusion, we should make good use of computers while also taking time to exercise and stay healthy.
174	174	1	3	Computers are mind - boggling on what they can do. They can make or break someone financially. For example, a stock trader can make a fortune or lose everything through online trading on a computer. They also can produce amazing graphics that artists can't produce as easily. They have advanced software and tools to create complex and detailed visual effects. Computers are also great for recreational activities, but they also take your life away. I'm not talking about a real life; I'm talking about the activities you do away from home. Now, let's see the benefits and problems we've come across so far on how we handle money. We used to put it in chests and hide them. Now all we do is click and type in a security number. People can also invest in items, but investing is tricky. You don't always win. You can win small or lose big, they say. Today's computers are HD. The screens are made of a liquid crystal formula that hardens. The lights in the back pixels do most of the work to bring stunning graphics to life. On computers today, people make money by selling graphics they made on computers. For example, digital artists sell their vector art or 3D models online. So, this would be another plus on what a computer does to a human. I went to a school to learn how to produce great graphics. All teens, kids, and adults have used a computer for recreational activities. On today's computers, you can play games, watch videos, and listen to music. People do this to enjoy themselves. Some people can get in trouble for fooling around on the web. But there's nothing wrong with being stressed out and just playing some games for a while. Personally, I like to go on YouTube and find funny videos after school. I used to own a YouTube account and get many views. The worst thing about computers is it can ruin a plan or someone's social life. Some people get addicted and can't stop being on the computer until it is taken away. For example, some people play World of Warcraft, get addicted, and can't stop! I had a problem when I had to check YouTube a lot. Well, I hoped you readers understand. No matter what happens, I think computers benefit more than the problems. In conclusion, despite the potential negative impacts, the overall advantages of computers in various aspects of our lives make them a valuable tool.
175	175	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, Computers are a sought - after item in this day in age, and we are making advances in technology every single day. Social networking sites like @CAPS4 and @CAPS5 are all over the internet. Computers are good to some extent, but some kids find the computer essential to their life. Using computers too much will have a bad effect on society. Oreos, @LOCATION1, @CAPS6 are all common snacks for people to be eating while on the computer. Now when you're sitting on the computer daily and for hours eating these snacks, you are beginning to become overweight. @PERCENT1 of @CAPS7 kids are overweight and that is unhealthy. A large portion of this @PERCENT1 use the computer daily. There is no doubt obesity is a problem, and computers are making it worse as they encourage a sedentary lifestyle. The people that love to use the computer definitely have some sort of social network account, whether it be @CAPS5, or @CAPS4. Kids think they are immune to getting in trouble while posting messages or putting up pictures of themselves. In one case, a girl was actually killed because of nasty messages posted about her. There have been other cases in which girls have sent nude pictures of themselves to their boyfriends and other people sold it. Their lives will never be the same because they were using the computer too much. Soon we will become the leaders in making decisions around certain aspects. If we are getting to know only our digital world and we are not learning how to be social without the internet, we don't know how we will end up. Instead of typing away, we should explore the world and learn important things. Hopefully, as @CAPS10, we will become less dependent on computers and we will fix this problem by spending less time on them. Computers are a great thing but they should not replace going outside with friends and playing baseball. In conclusion, we need to be more aware of the negative impacts of excessive computer use and find a balance between the digital and real world.
176	176	1	3	Computers and the Internet were a technological breakthrough. It exposed the average person to things that were never thought possible. But as these things advanced over the years, they've become an addiction so bad that it's begun to threaten people's lives. I've been given a choice to side with the addicting computers, or to oppose them. The only clear choice is to oppose. First off, computers have caused the world a decrease in exercise. Studies show that a significant number out of many people who use a computer do not exercise. With less exercise throughout the world, nations are becoming more overweight. This is a huge problem in the United States; computers are the main cause of why the U.S. is overweight and unhealthy. By cutting down on computer use, we can get our world back into great shape. We can bring exercise and health back. Nextly, I'm sure you've all heard of online predators. It's scary just to think about. Well, as computer technology increased, online predators' numbers went up. I remember a couple of years ago, I was watching the news and a story came about a normal teenage girl being killed by someone she met on MySpace. Things like this still go on, and the rate at which they happen is increasing. By putting people on computers, you're putting them at risk of death. This is an extreme problem computers have caused. Thus is the last effect computers have, out of many that I'm going to state. Time on the computer is time taken away from family and friends. This can ruin relationships in and outside the family. Now I'm sure you know many people have become extremely addicted to online games. The more they play these games, the more they pull away from everyone they knew and loved. Computers are a leading cause in dysfunctional families. They steal the user away from the outside world. These people need to get their families and friends back. You have to act now, before it's too late and computers have overtaken the world. If you know anyone who has fallen prey to a computer addiction, do what you can to help get them back. We need to cut back on any kind of computer use fast. Hurry, it's now or never. We must take action to save our lives and relationships from the negative impacts of computer addiction.
177	177	1	3	Dear @LOCATION1 @CAPS1, I strongly believe that computers are a big benefit to society these days. There is so much to learn on a computer. And it is a lot more fun to learn off a computer than from a book. For instance, let's say a student had to do a report, but he couldn't get his hands on any book at all. All the student would have to do is type in a few words on the internet and hundreds of websites pop up about any topic he wants to learn. The vast amount of information available on the internet makes learning more accessible and engaging. Another reason that a computer benefits society is the ways to keep in contact with family and friends if they live too far away. Like me, for instance, I live far from my friends. And the only way I could talk to them outside of school was on a computer. We would be able to talk in a chat room or on a game. The same goes with family. Let's say your children go on vacation and want to keep in touch. All you would have to do is type as much as you want and click send and it's at the other computer instantly. But, if you were to write a letter through the mail, it would take maybe a week or two to reach your child or the other way around. The speed and convenience of computer communication are truly remarkable. But, most of all, there are so many cool things you can do on a computer. There are a bunch of games to play, or videos to watch. You can make music and make money off of it. My favorite would have to be the computer programs. Flash Macromedia is the best though. You get to make your own animation clips or even a movie. Computers are really fun to play on. A computer has so many advantages in today's society. Which I'm very thankful for computers and all of the great stuff they do. That is why I believe computers benefit society, as they enhance learning, communication, and entertainment in our lives.
178	178	1	3	"Dear, @ORGANIZATION1 play a big role in our world today. For example, people use computers to get information, talk in chat rooms, mainly to talk to friends and find friends. I think this is messing people up. My first reason for thinking computers are messing people up is because of the information that is on the website. For example, people post and blog lies about people online. This is ruining many people because this starts rumors and gossip about people. Also, the lies that are being posted could interfere with many lives. The false information can cause emotional distress and damage reputations. Another reason computers affect the lives of people is the dangerous chat rooms. This is not good because you're not familiar with the person you're talking to. The person could have posed as another person and be very hypocritical. The result of this could be very unpleasant. Like you might give them your number, address, or other personal information. The outcome could end up in death, kidnapping, or cyberbullying. The risks associated with these chat rooms are truly alarming. Lastly, I want to talk about the false information that is given to thousands of people online. In other words, the ""@CAPS1, @CAPS2 @CAPS3 Your @CAPS4 love"" or ""@CAPS2""@CAPS6 Your @CAPS7 @CAPS8 On You?"" These things are placed on either side of your screen to get money from you. On the other hand, they attract the readers' attention. For example, these passages are set to copy down your number, get your account number then take your money. This doesn't help our people because it's only there for your money. In conclusion, from my visible stand - point, I don't prefer computers as a magnificent way for people to spend their time on. We should be more cautious about the information we access and share on computers to avoid these negative consequences."
179	179	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, You @MONTH1 have heard that there are up - sides and down - sides to using a computer. There are many more up - sides though. For example, you can communicate with people, conduct business, and you can use it to learn. A computer is a big need in today's growing technological advances. Communication is not as easy to do by phone anymore because people are always busy and on the computer. You can use computers to meet people from different countries. By doing this we can learn what life is like for them. Through social networks, such as @CAPS2 and @CAPS3, we can make plans with friends. The ability to connect with a wide range of people across the globe is a great advantage of computers. Computers are an important communication technology. Today most business is conducted over the internet or on a computer. The @CAPS4 @CAPS5 is all computerized today, and that is a major trade way today. A lot of business transactions and presentations are done on a computer for maximum efficiency. Computers allow us to conduct business with foreign countries without having to go there. This saves time and resources. Computers are a huge advancement in business. Computers help us learn a lot about, just about, everything. Search engines let us type in keywords and find multiple websites on that topic. Computers let us research so we get correct information with just a click. This research can be used to write essays in school. Computers help us to learn in school and outside of it. A computer is a huge technological advancement with many uses. It @MONTH1 have a few down - sides, but it has many more up - sides. Computers allow you to communicate, conduct business, and learn. Life would be much slower without a computer to speed things up. We should embrace the positive aspects of computers and use them to enhance our lives and society.
180	180	1	3	In my opinion, having computers is a very nice thing and does good in our society. I think this because of three reasons. First, it allows people to relax and wind down after a long day of work. Second, it allows people to communicate with their friends. Third, it helps with schoolwork and makes things much easier. These are only a few of the reasons why computers do good in our society. First off, I'd like to say that after a long day of work, all you want to do is relax. Television gets boring and you just want to sit and play games on the computer. Well, that's a great way of winding down on a rough day. You can go on @CAPS2 and watch funny videos or go on @CAPS3 and view your friends' new photo album. Your personal computer is capable of doing many things. There are numerous games, such as @CAPS4 come or @CAPS5 cam that can be a lot of fun. Do you see why the computer is a good way of calming down? Other than winding you down on a rough day at work, on the computer, it allows you to communicate with friends and family. AIM is a good way to talk to friends and plan get - togethers. Or, you can just have a simple talk. @CAPS3 and @CAPS7 are great websites to keep in touch with old friends of yours, and even make new friends. A lot of teenagers and adults have @CAPS3 because it is so engaging that you can't get off it. As you get older, you don't talk to your friends that much and soon you don't have many friends at all. @CAPS3 prevents that so you can always talk to them. You should always keep in touch with friends. Most importantly, you use the computer for school work. Without it, you can't get pictures off @ORGANIZATION1 or type an essay that is due. Moreover, you can't search words on @LOCATION1. Some teachers require you to type out essays and others don't. You need a computer if your teacher requires you to type things. I go on swifts website to see if I have homework due and that helps me out. Some teachers even put extra credit online. All in all, computers are good for society. First, you can just calm down and relax. Second, you can talk to old friends and keep in touch with new ones. Third and most importantly, it's very useful when it comes to schoolwork and getting pictures. Now you must understand when I tell you that computers are important and very useful in society. We should make the most of computers to enjoy relaxation, maintain relationships, and succeed in school.
181	181	1	3	"Dear Readers of the @ORGANIZATION1, Computers are machines that have been around for @MONTH1 years. With the internet, you can engage in various activities like playing games, researching information, and even having conversations with friends and family, all through a computer. Advances in computer technology are beneficial to @CAPS1 society for several reasons. These include that computers improve hand - eye coordination, provide abundant information, and allow people to talk online. As said earlier, using a computer can improve hand - eye coordination. In fact, it is well - known that computers can significantly improve your reflexes. This reminds me of a time when my brother, Patrick, went to an eye doctor and was told that his eyes had trouble focusing. The doctor literally assigned him to play computer games to help enhance his hand - eye coordination. As a matter of fact, @PERCENT1 of people agree that computers can have a gigantic, positive impact on reflexes and hand - eye coordination. If computers are helpful in this way and, in some cases, necessary for your eyes, then why would the use of computers be classified as bad when they are clearly a beneficial factor in @CAPS1 society? Computers are also beneficial because they are an enormous resource. The internet offers a vast amount of information for people of all ages who want to learn and grow. For example, most schools have their students use computers for research. When I say most schools, I mean @PERCENT2 of schools assign students to conduct research using a computer. The Principal of New City @ORGANIZATION2, @PERSON2, says, ""@CAPS1 students use computers at least every week if not more. They are a fantastic resource with endless information."" Computers are a gateway to countless amounts of knowledge that everyone should have access to. It is well - known that almost everyone knows someone who lives far away. I, myself, have a friend who lives in @LOCATION1 that I miss very much. When long - distance phone calls are too expensive in most parts of the world, I rely on computers to talk to my far - away friends. Computers are the bridge between @CAPS2 (my @CAPS3 friend) and me. However, computers are not only used for long - distance communication. I also use computers to e - mail, instant message, video chat, and just stay connected to family and friends. A local teenage boy, @PERSON1, says, ""I use my computer to stay connected with friends and my family that lives in another county. I don't know what I would do without it."" This means that @PERSON1 and thousands of others rely on computers for communication with friends and family. Computers are necessary for @MONTH1 reasons. They help people, educate, and connect people. In my opinion, you must have access to a computer in order to thrive in life."
182	182	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I think more people shouldn't spend excessive time on their computers. The reasons why I think this are that people should spend quality time with their family and friends, second, they need to exercise more, and last, go outside and enjoy nature. My first reason is that people who have computers often stay in their rooms all day and don't get fresh air. They need to step out of their rooms and enjoy the beauty of nature. People who love animals and like to study them should go outside, take a deep breath of fresh air, watch the animals in their natural habitat, and study them up close. Having a computer and being able to study animals that way is okay, but you don't want to get stuck in front of the computer screen. Instead, go outside and watch them in real - life. My second reason is that people need to get more exercise. People are getting overweight because they are just sitting at the computer and not engaging in any physical movement. People are becoming lazy every day because they are glued to the computers @NUM1. If you like to be on the computer and study, then go for a walk, run, jog, or ride a bike for a while. My last reason is that more people need to interact with their friends and family. People should get off the computer and make some plans with their family. Have a get - together with your family, go to interesting places, and just relax. People who are constantly on the computers don't spend enough time with their family and don't know what's going on around them. Some people even go into depression because they are on the computers and don't have enough time with their family. These are my reasons why I think that we shouldn't be on the computers all the time. We should spend more time with friends and family, or go outside and enjoy nature. In conclusion, by limiting computer time, we can lead a more balanced and fulfilling life.
183	183	1	3	"Dear local newspaper, I overheard some people talking about how much time their families spend on the computer. My opinion is that they should not be on the computer, staring at a screen for long periods of time. I think this because it takes away time from important tasks, there is something healthier than enclosing yourself with a computer monitor, that would be going outside or being active. Another reason is that you can have more time being around family and friends. First, you shouldn't be spending so much time on the computer. You could be getting other important tasks done. Such as working, or for most teens, doing homework. Studies show that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 teens get easily distracted by social networking websites such as ""@CAPS1"", ""twitter"", and ""aol"". People in the workplace are also distracted. Sometimes the job can get monotonous, so workers just go on the computer instead of getting things done. Children could be doing chores or just helping around the house a little, but they go on the computer instead. Teens' regular routine often consists of waking up, getting ready, going on the computer, going to school, coming home, having a snack, and then going back to the computer. We need to break those habits of constantly going back to the computer. Staring at a computer screen for long periods of time is not healthy. Instead, you could be active in a sport, or just going outside and having fun. As @CAPS2 technology advances, seizure rates have also gone up, according to a doctor at @ORGANIZATION1. Being involved in a sport would be healthier and more enjoyable than talking to people online. Also, you're not exercising while on the computer, and being active helps you keep in shape along with being fun. The most important reason you shouldn't be on the computer for a long time is because you're using valuable time that you could have used to spend with family and friends. Most people barely see their family when they're at home because they're consumed by the computer. Laptops have made it easier to block people out. Bringing it into your room and shutting the door is the most common way. Hang out with the friends you're already talking to online. Wouldn't it be better in person? In conclusion, we should limit our computer time to do other tasks, be active, and spend time with friends and family. By doing so, we can lead a more well - rounded and fulfilling life."
184	184	1	3	Dear people that read the newspaper and that have @CAPS1 who like to play on the computer for more than an hour. I think you should take your time and read my article in this wonderful newspaper. I am writing this article about @CAPS1 using the computer for more than an hour. My first reason about this computer issue is that it makes them not pay attention in school. To support this reason so you don't think I'm making this up, they play the computer a lot, and it makes the @CAPS1 only think about the computer and not focus on school. They play it so much that it can mess up their concentration, and they can't focus in class. My second main reason is that it makes them always want to talk about the computer. So, if they play it more than an hour, as I said, it can cause them to be addicted, just like drugs. If you don't want your @CAPS1 to be addicted to drugs, I hope you wouldn't want your own @CAPS1 to be addicted to the computer. To continue, your @CAPS1 constantly talking about the computer can make them sound like they have no real - life outside of it. I would hope you wouldn't want your @CAPS1 to be like this. Most importantly, my final reason why you shouldn't let your child play the computer for more than an hour a day is that they can get overweight. Your @CAPS1 will only get up to go to the bathroom and eat. They will only do things that are inside the house. Your @CAPS1 will not go outside and play and won't get any exercise at all. I hope you will understand where I'm coming from. I have a brother who is currently in the hospital because he played the computer too much, and it messed up his health. The doctor said it's touch - and - go, so I'm praying that he will make it out alive. I hope you wouldn't let your @CAPS1 do this because it will mess up their life forever. Thank you so much for taking your own @CAPS4 time to read this article. I hope you would remember this article for your whole entire life and take steps to limit your @CAPS1's computer time.
185	185	1	3	Dear, @CAPS1. There are many people who use computers, this advanced technology we have. Lots of people believe that our lives are better because we have computers, as they have lots of benefits that come with them. But not everyone agrees with this. There are many people who don't like that people use computers too much as it takes away time from enjoying nature, exercising, and interacting with family and friends. But I think that computers have positive effects on people, such as allowing you to talk to people you can't see, looking up information, and giving people something to do. One of the effects computers have on people is that it allows you to talk to people you really don't see often. I say this because not all your friends go to the same school, so you don't get to see them as much. But they might have email, myspace, and facebook accounts. Through these platforms, you can easily stay in touch with them instead of having to drive long distances to see them. I think that when there are other activities you have to do, but you still want to keep in touch, computers are a great option. The second effect computers have on people is that it allows you to look up information. Think about it, when you have to do a project and you don't always have enough information on the topic, if you have a computer, it provides you with a vast amount of data. You can find information on endless sites, which is much better. Also, there might be times when you're planning to go on a trip and you want to know how much it will cost and how long it will take to reach your destination. Well, if you look it up on the computer, all the information will be there for you to see. Where else will you find this information so easily? You can get answers to your questions by simply going to the relevant website. The third effect computers have on people is that it gives you something to do. I say this because not all the time will you have something specific to do. Sometimes you will be bored and looking for something to pass the time. You can go on the computer. The things you can do include playing games. Also, you can watch videos on youtube. For example, if you find funny videos that keep you laughing, you can watch them on the computer. Another thing you can do is download music. Do you ever have a song in mind when you're not busy? Well, you can do it now. See, there are @MONTH1 things you can do on the computer. In conclusion, I think that computers have lots of positive effects on people. These are aspects about how people spend time on computers. Despite the opposing views, I firmly believe there are many good effects that computers can have. I hope you agree with me that computers are a valuable tool in our lives.
186	186	1	3	Dear, Newspaper. I am writing to persuade you to put an article in the paper about how computers have bad effects on people. Computers can make you unhealthy, bullying often takes place on the computer, and it impacts how you perform in school. First, computers have bad effects on people because they make you unhealthy. I say this because most people who spend a lot of time on computers don't get enough exercise. Then, they gradually get obese from not having enough physical activity. Eventually, you may or may not get diabetes from being obese, but most of the time you do. The next reason why computers have bad effects is that kids get bullied on the internet. This is important because when kids get bullied, they feel bad about themselves. Then they become very depressed. This is called cyber - bullying. One example is that a guy came to our school to talk about his son. His son had killed himself from being bullied on the internet and at school. That is why bullying is an important issue and computers have bad effects on people. My third and final reason why computers have bad effects on people is that kids do poorly in school. They do badly in school because they spend so much time on the computer that they stop doing their homework and stop preparing for tests and quizzes. Also, kids get distracted in school because all they think or care about is going home and going on the computer. Kids also do badly in school because they eventually think that school is a waste of time and drop out. It is a proven fact that a certain percentage of kids that have dropped out of school were those who were always on the computer and they said that school was a waste of time. That's how computers have an effect on school. Now remember, computers have bad effects on people because they make people unhealthy, people get bullied, and it has an impact on your schoolwork. In conclusion, it's clear that the negative effects of computers on people are significant and should be addressed.
187	187	1	3	Dear, newspaper. I think that people should have computers. I think that because kids can play games to help them learn, like math games or reading games. Grown - ups can go on websites and watch workout videos, and they can also pay their bills on the computer. Additionally, if kids need to do their homework, computers are great for that. But they also have bad aspects. For instance, kids may say they are doing their homework, but they are actually on YouTube, MySpace, or Facebook, or other such sites. However, computers have more good points than bad things. That's why I think we should have computers. In conclusion, despite the drawbacks, the overall benefits of having computers in our lives make them a valuable addition.
188	188	1	3	Dear local Newspaper, Some people say computers have negative effects on family and friends, others say computers are an important aspect of society. I would have to agree with the second group of people. Computers help students research information that they might need for school. People can talk to their friends on things like Facebook or Twitter, and you can write a rough draft on the computer, save it, then go back to it and make the final changes from a draft to a final. I will elaborate in the following three paragraphs. Computers are a quick and easy way to look up information for a school project or paper. I can understand people thinking that computers take away from family time, but so would a book. A book would probably take up more time and you might get less information. For example, the book could be about multiple people and you read the entire thing only to get two sentences of useful information. Another reason computer research is quicker is that you can go from one page, get some information, and then once you have gotten all the information from that page but you still need more, you can just click another link. If people didn't have computers, they would have to go to the library and spend time looking for books. Is it worth it to use all that time? People can talk to their friends on Facebook or Twitter. Some people say computers distract you from friends when really they help you talk to your friends more. What if you're on vacation and you're so tired of seeing and talking to your family because you've been with them non - stop for a week and you miss your friends. All you have to do is turn on the computer and then you have an instant link to them. Chat rooms also help you meet other people your age from the next town over or anywhere in the country. They might even become your new best friend. When you write a paper, do you want to have to write it once then go back and write it two more times? There's a much simpler way, it's called a computer. You can write your first draft, then all you have to do in order to get a final copy is reread it and make changes when they are necessary. Computers also help kids spell better. All they have to do is hit a button. In conclusion, computers offer numerous advantages in research, communication, and writing, making them an essential part of modern society.
189	189	1	3	Dear Newspaper, Wherever you turn, there is technology. It's not going to change. Try a schedule. Encouragement helps a lot of people. Activities keep your mind off things. Read on to find out more. Scheduling is important. Limit the time on the computer. For every half - hour on the computer, at least fifteen minutes should be spent outside or with friends. Try to memorize the schedule so that you can stick to it. Encouragement helps me and a lot of people! Try to encourage family and friends to follow a balanced routine. The government is also trying to fight the over - use of technology. Encouragement can play a big role in this. Activities can keep people off the computer. Try neighborhood activities like community clean - ups or sports events. After - school activities for a while can also be a great option. All kinds of stuff is fun. Do you think scheduling helps? Do you like encouragement? Do activities keep your mind off things? Then by far, these things help. In conclusion, by implementing schedules, offering encouragement, and engaging in activities, we can better manage our technology use.
190	190	1	3	"Dear Editor, Can you imagine a world where technology controls human interaction? It's not such a far - fetched idea. Some people might see this as a great advancement. Not me. I think that computers detach people from reality, create false personas, and have no physical benefit. This is what I think the computers' effects have on people. First of all, Computers detach people from reality. It's a lot easier for someone to sit on the computer, browsing aimlessly on some social networking website, than go out and actually meet new people. Sure, you can send all the friend requests you want, but there's nothing that compares to a first impression that you get from meeting someone in person. The computer can also have an affect on family members and the time spent with them. For example, a person might be so engrossed in the computer that they ignore their family during dinner. Secondly, the computer creates false personas. If I had a Facebook or Instagram account, it would be very easy to say something false about myself, or someone else. The computer doesn't know better. This allows people to gain, ""friendships"" with others that don't know the real you. I find this as a real problem because it can eventually lead to shaky or unsteady relationships. Lastly, I think that the computer offers no physical gain. This nation is in a severe health crisis. With things easier to get nowadays like fast food, and drugs, I don't think that computers help. People need discipline and there's a time and place for everything, including computers. However, those that aren't disciplined might use them more than they need to and that isn't good. So, can you imagine a world controlled by computers? I think that little by little, that's what's happening, slowly taking away the human element. I think the effects will be severe, detaching from reality, creating false personas, and offering no physical gain. I don't think it's right, but I hope I've persuaded you to think my way. In conclusion, the negative impacts of computers on human interaction and well - being are substantial, and we should be cautious about their over - use."
191	191	1	3	Dear The @CAPS1, I understand that you have some concerns about computers. I don't think you should be concerned though. You should not be concerned because computers are very positive. They teach us hand - eye coordination, help teach you about faraway places and people, and finally you can talk online with family and friends. First, computers teach you hand - eye coordination. There are thousands of fun games online, like action - packed shooting games and fast - paced racing games, that can help improve your reflexes and eyesight. This can help heal or improve some people's reflexes by making their eyes more keen. Another thing amazing about computers is that you can learn about far away places and people. This is very helpful because if you want to travel somewhere far away but you can't, you just go to your computer and look it up. Then you feel like you are really there, exploring ancient ruins or walking along foreign beaches. It can also help you study about people that live far away and that you won't get to meet in person. Finally when you go on your computer you can go online and talk with your family and friends. There are all types of websites you can go on to talk and hang out with all of your friends and family, such as video - chat platforms where you can see their faces and share laughter. The computer is very helpful because it keeps your family and friends together and happy. In conclusion I think computers are a great, fun, and helpful invention. Remember these good characteristics that computers have and please don't take computers away; we need them.
192	192	1	3	How @MONTH1 times do you use the computer in one day? A lot right? I think that computers definitely benefit society. The internet helps a lot of people, because it's very convenient for people. The computers also let people talk online with other people. Computers help people because of the internet. The internet makes a lot of people's lives easier. One way is for school. I know from my own experiences that the internet helps. If I don't have enough material to study, the internet can provide a wealth of resources like e - books, online lectures, and study guides. Another reason that the internet is helpful is for jobs. Did you know that @PERCENT1 of people the age of @NUM1 have jobs on the internet? The internet can also help people find jobs through job - search engines and professional networking sites. The last reason that the internet is helpful is shopping. I remember a time when I needed a special book for school and no bookstore had it. My mum ordered it on the internet, and it arrived in just a few days. The internet is very helpful to many people. My reason that computers are beneficial to our society is that they give people the ability to learn about faraway places. Many people cannot afford to go to a lot of places outside the United States. With computers, people can learn about these places and even get a virtual tour of these places. Sometimes there is even a 360 - degree view to simulate the experience of being there. Another reason is that people are curious and want to learn more. Once, my family got to a wedding in @LOCATION1, but we didn't know much about @LOCATION1. So we went online to find things like the foods eaten there, such as local delicacies, and what the weather is like. Lastly people can learn about where their family came from. If people know the place that their ancestors came from, they can look it up on computers. They can find recipes for food, what religion they practice, and what holidays they celebrate. Obviously computers help people about faraway places. My last reason that computers are beneficial to our society is that they allow people to talk with other people. Sometimes, good friends who want to stay together lose touch or if one friend moves away. People can find each other online and talk. Did you know that there are many sites that tell you where people you went to high - school with are? Also, there are sites like Facebook where people can connect. Another reason is that, people can meet other people online. There are many dating sites such as Match.com that connect people via the internet. Did you know that @PERCENT2 of people on dating sites set up dates? Sometimes people cannot call each other because it's too long - distance. Being able to chat online on sites like Google Chat or others is very helpful. Without a doubt, computers are very helpful. I think that computers help @CAPS1 many people in our society. People use the internet to help them. People learn about other places and people can chat online.
193	193	1	3	Dear @PERSON1 weekly, The new millennium brought a new wave of technology. Computers are the main invention that most likely everyone uses. The computers teach us great things such as learning about a vacation spot or a far - off country. The computer allows us to talk to friends or family while they are away or even at home. Also, typing on the computer teaches us hand - eye coordination that can help us with other things. The computer is surely a great invention. Have you ever wanted to go on vacation to somewhere overseas? Well the computer is a great source for learning about these places. The effects it has could be significant. One day someone might want to go to the Bahamas, but then finds a new location such as @LOCATION1 or even @LOCATION3, with its unique culture and beautiful landscapes. In addition the computer benefits students very well. Students usually have to do projects on places in the world and the computer is the main source of intelligence. When I have an essay to do I always use the computer first, looking up academic journals and reliable websites. Recently my grandmother moved down to @LOCATION2 and I can only talk to her on the phone. Although on my computer I can actually see her on my screen. The webcam allows me to see my grandma, sharing stories and smiles. The computer allows you to keep in touch with friends and family that you do not see on a regular basis. For example, Instagram or Twitter keeps you in touch with friends from high school, showing you their latest adventures and updates. The computer can also send emails to friends and family so you can say hello every once in a while. Sports require a great deal of hand - eye coordination. The computer makes you better at this. By looking at the screen while typing, gives you a boost on your hand - eye coordination because you are doing two things at once. A sport that requires a lot of this is @CAPS2. While the ball is in the air you must focus on it while holding your stick at the correct position. Although hand - eye coordination is mainly taught through the powers of the computer. To conclude, all that I would like to say is that the computer is a great source for intelligence. It also allows you to keep in touch with high school friends and far away family. Finally, the computer teaches you hand - eye coordination. The computer is a very important piece of technology.
194	194	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 you want our society to become one of obese, lazy people with no appreciation for family or friends? @CAPS2 you want people to lack a respect for nature? This is the result of excessive computer usage. Our society will become lazy, and dependent upon robot slaves and be brain - washed. People will not be caring for family or friends. Most importantly, our society will have no appreciation or respect for mother nature. Is this the way you wish our world to be? Have you ever read @CAPS3 @NUM1? In the book, the government uses technology to brainwash people and then manipulate them. If our society, like the one in the book, becomes over - dependent on computers and technology, then we will collapse from the inside, going from a respected world power to a third - world country in a short time. We will need to redesign buildings to have doors big enough for our bodies to fit through. We will not be a respected nation anymore. There will be charities in other countries to send money to build gyms and pools, but nobody will use them. Recent research from @ORGANIZATION1 says that @PERCENT1 of people who spend more than an hour and a half on their computer every day are over @NUM2 pounds. People won't remember how to talk. Babies will learn to type instead of talking or walking. Is this good for our country? People say that the best thing you could ever have is a supportive family and a group of good friends. According to @PERSON1, a well - known psychologist, ""People who have more friends have a @PERCENT2 reduced risk of depression."" Friends actually affect your health. People who use the computer too much lose friends and become separated from their families. The mental health effects from this can be horrible, and people sadly will miss out on all the positive parts of life. It's important that people are happy, but if you only communicate through e - mail and social networking sites, you aren't social enough. It is one thing to chat online, but it is better to be able to see someone face to face than a picture on screen. Nobody wants to end up like this, so limit your computer usage. With too much computer usage comes a lack of respect for nature. People used to care about nature for many reasons, but the biggest is that it affects us everyday, in everything we @CAPS2 and own. Everything has a base in nature, even ourselves. The weather outside even on a beautiful @DATE1 day, can be deadly if we don't pay attention to what is going on outside of our safe house. We depend on nature but if we don't respect her, she will kill us. Anything is good in moderation, even a computer. But when we don't limit ourselves, it has bad consequences. We will no longer have a respected society. Our family and friends will disappear, causing health problems. Worst of all, we will lose all appreciation and respect for mother nature. The time to start limiting computer usage is now, or we will have many great problems."
195	195	1	3	"Dear, @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 idea about ""Computers"" is very well thought outside of the box. Well. We sure need computers to look up information these days. Why do we need them now and it didn't exist before? Research shows over @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2 says computer is everything. Let me explain a little bit further to you what I mean. First, you can look up places, like historical landmarks or exotic tourist destinations, chat with friends and family, sharing daily stories and experiences. @CAPS1 opinion about using the local internet would be that it's good only for those who know, and not trying to be mean. For little ones, they should get to bed at least @NUM1 pm, and never to forget about nature outside, breathing in the fresh air and listening to the birds chirping. In conclusion, the internet these days are very good for people, providing knowledge, connection, and entertainment, but we should also balance it with real - world experiences."
196	196	1	3	I think the use of computers is a very good thing in the present day @LOCATION2. I think this because people use it to research various topics thoroughly, stay in close touch with friends and family, and enjoy a wide range of music. These are all things that adults and kids alike need to do. Read on and I will explain why this is so important. My first reason why I think computers are a good thing is because they are an excellent source to do in - depth research on a specific topic. Kids all over the @LOCATION1 use the internet to do detailed class projects. Adults can use the computer to look up a certain delicious food recipe. If you need help with something, the computer is always there. Some people even rely on the computer for their job. Computers can assist with a great deal of things. Another reason why computers are a big help is because you can stay in constant touch with friends and family. A great tool to use on a computer is a webcam. With this, you can clearly see and talk to people on a little camera even if they are far away. You can also go on MySpace or Facebook. These are two popular websites that are used to post interesting pictures and to have conversations with chosen friends. It is a good way for people to get to know you better. A similar thing to this is instant messaging. You can use this to talk to friends and many others online. Don't stop reading; there is more! My last reason why computers are such a great thing to have is because you can do so much with music on the computer. You can use the computer to listen to various types of music, and transfer music onto an iPod or @NUM1 player. Some people use the computer to create music. You can get a program that allows you to make beats and put them together to make some kind of a song. Music is a great thing that all age groups love. That is why I think having a computer is a very positive thing. You can do researching, stay in touch with friends and family, and do a lot with music. There is so much more than these @NUM2 things that a computer is good for. I don't think the world would be the same without computers as they have become an essential part of our daily lives.
197	197	1	3	"Dear newspaper, I know that computers can cast a spell on a person, but in reality, it's one of the most necessary things we need in our lifetime. Computers are used for many things like completing school work accurately, planning that long - awaited trip you always wanted to go to, and staying updated with the latest news. Read the following to know just how important computers really are. You know now when you have that project due for science class about protoplasms. You want to do your best so you can get a good grade. When you realize that the one book you find on it won't help you achieve the score you desire, you realize that the next place to look is the computer. The computer provides you with an unlimited amount of detailed information that will help you in any report. When a teacher gives you a book to do a biography on, for example, ""The life and times: @PERSON1"" You want to go beyond what the book gives you and search, for instance, his neighborhood, his inspiration, and the influences he had. You will find all this in the computer. When you see a sale on a ""five nights and four days"" trip to @ORGANIZATION1, you want to know if there are better deals. When you start to notice that your family needs a vacation, the only practical place to look is the computer. You can't look for that trip of a lifetime in a book. Sure you can find out that @CAPS1 is having that big blowout sale, but you can't search up the best deal. I've done a research with seven of my friends and found that six of those seven parents have booked a deal on a trip to @ORGANIZATION1 on their accounts. If you're a great fan of road trips, you'll find the best deal or @CAPS2's for the lowest price only by using the computer. If you live in @LOCATION3, @LOCATION4 and you want to have a trip to the @LOCATION1, this deal is really good. If you live in the @LOCATION2 and you know the hottest day in the @DATE1 is coming, you will be ready to get those beach balls and that blanket ready, but if you think computers are a waste of time, then you won't know that all the beaches are open and will be sending free drinks all day. You will be at home eating a @CAPS3.V. watching old reruns of The @CAPS4 @CAPS5. Not only will it tell you news in your area, but it will also tell you about that devastating earthquake in @LOCATION5. You'll also be informed about what people are doing to help them and what you can do to contribute. So not only is the computer good for going on @CAPS6 and @CAPS7, you can help get your grade to an A+ on that history report. It also works well for giving your children a memory they will always cherish. They also help you to be prepared and not be stuck in your house on that nice day in @DATE1. In conclusion, the computer is an indispensable tool for various aspects of our lives, from education to travel and staying informed."
198	198	1	3	"Dear Local Newspaper @CAPS1, statistics show that @PERCENT1 of humans in the @LOCATION2 alone spend most of their time on a computer or laptop. I believe that the effect of computers has a negative impact on humans because it causes people to have a lack of exercise and it limits the physical interaction with others. As a nation, we can lower the statistic above and create a better environment altogether. The number of people who lack a sufficient amount of exercise has increased in the past decade. Doctor @PERSON1, who is an expert in the connections between health and computers, surveyed @NUM1 people. Out of those people, @PERCENT2 said they rarely go outside because they are trapped in the cyber world. This shocking percentage proves that only one in twenty people actually get some type of exercise. @PERSON2 stated, ""this shocking statistic means that most - if not all - people are unhealthy physically, which is a problem that must be solved."" @CAPS3 goes on to say that being on a computer for most of the day and not exercising is what contributes to unhealthiness. In addition to lacking exercise, many humans are losing the physical interaction that they should have. As humans have become more modernized with technology, most humans lose the physical interaction that they would normally have encountered if they were not on the computer. @PERSON3 agreed with this statement and said, "" I am a college graduate; I have a degree and all, but I wasn't always like this. When I was younger, I owned a computer. As soon as I got home from school, I would always go on the computer. I wouldn't talk to anyone - not even my family! If I could go back and change that, I would."" This statement proves that the lack of physical interaction with humans is a crucial subject to address. @PERSON3 regretted it all and changed his ways once @CAPS3 got to high school. No one wants to live with regrets, so physical human interactions are necessary to live a non - regretful life. The lack of human interaction and lack of exercise are problems that need to be solved as soon as possible. In conclusion, using computers has started a growing epidemic in the @LOCATION1. The most important reasons as to why computers have a negative effect on humans are that it limits the amount of exercise, and it almost destroys the physical interactions between humans. We should all be aware of these issues and take steps to reduce our computer usage for a healthier and more social life. Thank you for your attention, and remember one thing: Computers can always have a negative effect on many humans' lives if not used in moderation."
199	199	1	3	@ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1, click, clack - that's the sound of @ORGANIZATION2 computer keys being hit right now. Computers are everywhere these days, even in the poorest places like @LOCATION3. In @LOCATION2, dreadful, time - consuming computers are taking away the meaning and enjoyments of @ORGANIZATION2 life that are offered to us. Computers are our source of information and leisure these days, but we are forgetting that there is a life away from them as well, such as having quality family time, and taking peaceful walks in the beautiful nature. Too much use of a computer is leading to awful health. Computers can cause many fatal problems such as severe seeing and vision problems, and obesity, due to the fact that you sit all day and don't work out. Computers are like mind and body eaters that slowly take away from you and let you cry and weep for the rest of @ORGANIZATION2 your life. Don't you agree? Do you know that the @ORGANIZATION2 says that the second biggest leading cause of obesity is computer use? Yes, that is true! I have experienced this problem while growing up. When I was @NUM1, I was addicted to the computer. Day and night, my eyes were glued to the computer screen. I had nothing on my mind except the computer. My mom got mad at me and yelled at me to get away from it, but I didn't. Slowly, I started to put on heavy, unwanted fat on myself, and later I found out I was overweight for my age. To this day, I have not lost the weight I put on from using the computer, and I am sure others are in the same situation. Obesity doesn't just happen from eating too much. It also happens from not doing any cardio activities, which the computer stops us from doing. So basically, the computer is unhealthy. As said by @PERCENT1 of people from the state of @LOCATION1, time - consuming computers are taking away family time from many families these days. Do you know that @PERCENT2 of families aren't getting to spend the time with each other as they wish, the reason being computers? Kids are on the computer playing games, moms are finding a recipe online to make for dinner, and dad is buying another stock online. Yes, that happens a lot. Instead of doing those things, they could be doing something else together, but no, computer work is considered more important. My family used to spend a lot of time together, but because of the computer, I never get to do anything with my family now. Do you know that experts say kids who spend time with their family are bound to become better parents than those who don't spend time with family? I bet you are a really good family person and would like to bring your family closer. Please take these computers away and make families come together once again. @LOCATION1 has the most beautiful nature ever, with the singing birds, the cute animals, the wonderful @DATE1 times and the colorful fall time. If anyone ever wants to see nature, they should come to @LOCATION1, but the sad thing is that the people of @LOCATION1 aren't appreciating nature themselves because they are too busy with things such as computers. I know one time we went on a camping trip, and we were ready to enjoy nature, and this boy brings his computer. Wouldn't you know it, the whole group forgot about nature and played with the boy's computer. So many people missed out on the beauty of nature and the sight of the beautiful animals like the yellow @CAPS3. That time was amazing, and it is very unfortunate that many people missed out on that event. People these days are once again not appreciating nature, which one day they will regret, because one day you may not be around to enjoy this gift. Don't let the computer tell you what to do. Let's be the boss and take control of our lives. It is now or never; the decision is in your hands. Make the right decision and say no to excessive computer use. Go out there, enjoy nature, spend time with your family, and get healthy. Be the smart and well - educated people you are and tell the world not to be dictated by the computer. Yes, computers are useful, but too much of them is bad. Say no to computers if you don't want to regret it later.
200	200	1	3	"Dear Readers of @LOCATION1, it has been brought to my attention that there is a dilemma on the effect of computers on people. Well, I believe that having computers around is good because. Computers help students complete their school work more effectively. They also give the ability to learn about far - off places. Lastly, computers allow people to talk to other people online or via webcam. My first reason I believe computers are good to have around is that they assist students in doing their school work. Sometimes teachers give assignments like writing an essay. If the student does it on a computer, they might get a higher grade because it looks neater and more professional. Computers especially help out college students. A college university conducted a poll one time. @PERCENT1 of students said they wouldn't know what to do if they didn't have their computer or laptop. One student even said, ""If I didn't have my laptop, I would probably fail most of my classes."" Computers can be very helpful when it comes to student school work. My second reason that I believe computers are good to have around is that they give the ability to learn about far - away places or other countries. I took a poll one time to find out how many people use a computer to find out what's going on in other countries. @PERCENT2 of them said they go on the computer to find out what's happening in other countries. Computers can be very handy when you want to know what's going on in other countries. My last reason why computers are good to have around is that say you're married and you're pregnant (unless you're the guy, of course), but your spouse is in @LOCATION2 and you can't be with them. Well, computers these days have webcams. So now, if you really need to talk to him or her, you can by using a webcam. So readers of the @LOCATION1 @ORGANIZATION1, can you"
201	201	1	3	Computers and modern technology are advancing at a rapid pace, and an increasing number of people are beginning to embrace them. Some individuals claim that computers have a negative influence on children. I hold the opposite view. I firmly believe that computers represent an astonishing breakthrough in modern science. I am convinced that computers are perfect for schoolwork and communicating with others, as long as they are utilized in moderation. Computers simplify school projects to such an extent that I can't imagine how we could manage without them. Our social studies teacher, Mr. Johnson, states that 80% of his projects involve something related to the computer. The internet is an excellent resource for conducting research on large papers and projects. With over thirty - million educational and informational websites, it's effortless to quickly and easily locate the information you need. Once you've completed your research, typing up your report is a breeze. If it's not a written report, there are numerous other programs available for creating elaborate presentations. Take Microsoft PowerPoint as an example: you can design exotic backgrounds and texts, as well as unique animations to emphasize key points or make your presentation stand out. Computers are also an ideal means of communicating with friends and family. Emailing is fast and convenient for conveying your thoughts to others. If you wish to chat, you can use Skype or instant messaging. These options enable you to type and send messages even faster. Both of these programs offer an innovative way to communicate with a family member who is away from home. For instance, if my dad travels to Tokyo on business, we can exchange emails daily. And now, with Zoom (a video - chat service), you can see the person and have a real - time conversation as if they were right at home. Computers have their advantages, but they also come with disadvantages. They are great for communication and schoolwork, but excessive use can be detrimental to health. Here's an example: my older brother, Tom, is a senior in high school. He is at school from 8 am to 4 pm, and as soon as he gets home, he heads straight for his computer. He spends at least five hours on it every night, leaving little time for dinner and hardly any time for sleep. I believe that computers are a remarkable invention in modern technology, as long as people set limits for themselves. Computers are constantly introducing new features, and who knows what they'll be like in the future.
202	202	1	3	I completely agree with those who believe that computers have a negative impact on us today. Although computers are remarkable, they do have numerous adverse effects on users. With the advent of new technology, people can take pictures and post them on websites where everyone can view them. Additionally, there are computer games that people can become addicted to. Lastly, there are online predators. The new technology is truly amazing, such as webcams for video - chatting or cellphones for taking pictures. However, they do have negative consequences. There have been numerous suicides resulting from cyber - bullying. This occurs when people harass kids over the internet. Some individuals even send nude pictures online or during webcam sessions. This is not only illegal but also absurd that young or even older people would engage in such behavior. There are also websites where people can post very personal pictures of you, which can have a profound impact on your life. Many people have computer games or download them from websites. Most individuals actually become addicted to these games. They would play them all day if possible, and when they're not playing, they're constantly thinking about it. This causes them to miss out on a lot of things. They may not get enough exercise, neglect their homework, which will lead to a decline in grades. They might also spend less time with their families. It can even change a person's personality. The most crucial aspect of using computers is safety. There are predators all over the internet who can pretend to be someone from school and ask for your address. You should never disclose your address or full name online. They could very likely come to your home, which could endanger your life or that of your family members. Computers can be enjoyable, and you can learn a vast amount of information from them, but only if you use them wisely. Remember not to tell anyone where you live and avoid sending personal pictures. They could spread across the internet overnight. Lastly, prioritize your family, grades, and health over some useless game. Be smart and stay safe!
203	203	1	3	Dear Newspaper, I firmly believe that people need computers. They can help those who are unable to travel physically or mentally to see the world. They can also be used to send extremely important messages to people who are far away. Moreover, if someone has a loved one who is at a distant location, computers allow them to stay connected. Here are some examples of these three benefits. Some people are either physically or mentally unable to travel and can't afford to do so. It's truly sad that some individuals are so ill with a disease or illness that they can't leave their homes. However, by going online, they can look up pictures and information about places they've never visited, which can help them gain a better understanding of the world. There are also people who have fears that prevent them from traveling. The internet can offer resources to help them overcome these fears, enabling them to eventually travel and experience the world firsthand. Additionally, the internet can assist in finding a well - paying job, which can provide the means to afford travel. What if you need to send a critically important message to someone to prevent them from making a grave mistake, save a life, or even stop a war? Consider a situation where a war is raging due to a misunderstanding. If the government discovers the truth and knows how to resolve the situation, they can send a message to the attackers, explaining what actually happened and that it wasn't what they thought. This could potentially stop the fighting and end the war. Or, imagine if a bomb is discovered in the White House. A person who finds out about it can send a message to the authorities in the building, which could save the lives of everyone inside. Sometimes, loved ones go to far - off places, and it becomes difficult to communicate or see them. For example, if someone in the military has a child, the computer allows them to see and talk to their child via a webcam, keeping the parent - child bond intact. Also, if you see an old friend on Facebook whom you haven't seen in years, you can send them a friend request and rekindle your friendship. In conclusion, computers can perform many helpful functions. They can mend relationships, save lives, help people overcome fears, and enable them to see the world. While we may sometimes overuse them, they are extremely useful. They are not entirely bad; they have their drawbacks, but overall, they are a valuable tool.
204	204	1	3	You want my opinion on the effects computers have on people? Well, I firmly believe that computers help educate people, and many individuals rely on them. It's time to decide if you concur with me that computers have positive effects on people. Do you agree that computers can be of great assistance? For example, if you have a question that no one at home can answer, why not Google it? Of course, every now and then, you'll get a school project. You'll need information, but the library might be closed, and you're not sure what to do. It's simple; all you have to do is conduct research on your computer. Don't you think computers are helpful? I recall one time when I entered a writing contest, and the notes I needed were lost. Then I remembered that I had saved them on my computer. Computers can be relied upon by people. Just think about it! Nearly 70% of jobs in the world depend on computer technology. Take the waste - management job, for instance. It would be incredibly challenging to keep track of the amount of trash thrown out each year without a computer. Banks also heavily rely on computers to manage everyone's accounts and financial situations. Let's not forget about lawyers. Some lawyers in court use computers to type up every word spoken during a trial, converting the words into shorthand to keep up with the proceedings. Did you know that without computers, nearly half of the million jobs in the world would face difficulties? Some people would agree that certain online games are educational. For example, there is Wordscapes. This game teaches you words you may have never encountered before. And don't overlook Math Blaster. That game enhances your numerical - counting skills. Last but not least is Chess Titans. This game sharpens your strategic thinking and exercises your brain. Strategy is very useful, and surely you can now see that some games are highly educational. In conclusion, I am convinced that the effects computers have on people are positive. They help people, are reliable, and can educate. It's time for you to decide: do you agree that computers have positive effects on people?
205	205	1	3	"Dear local newspaper, Hello, my name is Sarah. I've just learned about how people perceive computers and their effects. In my opinion, I find that computers have a very negative influence on young kids, teens, and adults. There are many harmful aspects associated with having a computer. For one thing, people who are overly engrossed in this electronic device find less time to exercise and take care of themselves. Moreover, the only nature they experience is through online pictures, rather than enjoying the full beauty of the real world. Another negative consequence is that they become increasingly distant from their loved ones. What has happened to our society? Why can't we think independently anymore? I sincerely and strongly hope that what I'm saying will change some people's minds. Thank you very much. Exercise is a vital part of anyone's life, especially for growing kids and teens. When you're on the computer, what exercise benefits do you gain? Stronger fingers? A higher risk of carpal - tunnel syndrome. ""80% of kids with health problems like obesity have access to the internet,"" according to Dr. Smith of the, ""Healthy Living Institute"" in Huntington Beach, California. When you immerse yourself in the computer world, you probably don't even think about staying fit. Instead, you might munch on some chips while typing. What health benefits do these computer activities offer? With the threat of global warming, what you saw in nature yesterday might not be there tomorrow. Breathing in fresh, natural air can really soothe a stressed - out child. Whatever happened to playing with sidewalk chalk, tag, or just running around outside? Is it no longer considered cool? It seems that taking care of oneself is no longer in vogue. You could inspire yourself by writing poems about your feelings or drawing a landscape. Nowadays, instead of climbing a tree, we're using our mouse to click to the next website. There's so much that we take for granted, and one day, when you look back, you'll really miss those care - free days. Family time is extremely important in anyone's life. Without a family, you're lost. When did game night or family time disappear? Just because our society has made computers a common household item doesn't mean that family and friends should no longer be a top priority. If you want to hang out at a friend's house, don't just email about it. Walk over there and experience the full interaction. Since when does a computer replace a family? Never. If we step out of this fake digital reality, we can eliminate negativity from our lives. We can regain a true and meaningful life with our loved ones. We'd think more clearly, just by disconnecting. What makes a computer better than real life? Absolutely nothing. Ask yourself that question. In conclusion, I firmly believe that our excessive use of computers has made us less capable. The negatives far outweigh the positives. Sure, you can quickly send a message or play a game, but isn't it sometimes better to do things the old - fashioned way, like making a phone call or writing a letter? I once again thank you for taking the time to read this. Whether I've changed your mind or not, think about these things the next time you're online."
206	206	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I wholeheartedly agree that computers have had a profound impact on human society. Therefore, my opinion is that they are one of the greatest inventions. I firmly believe this because there are numerous helpful programs and websites that computers offer to assist people in their daily lives. Especially students can take full advantage of studying from educational webpages. Also, people can easily communicate online. Lastly, you can type stories instead of painstakingly hand - writing them. Having the advantage to study online is truly great. Different websites brimming with tons of accurate information and true facts can really boost the grades of most students. Did you know that a significant percentage (represented by @PERCENT1) of the students in @LOCATION1 visit educational websites for information for writing, whether it's an essay or a non - fiction story? Thanks to computers, there is a high probability that students will receive a passing grade. Communication online has made a huge impact worldwide. Whether you use Facebook, @CAPS1, @ORGANIZATION1 etc., communicating with family or friends is a wonderful experience. For example, I use Facebook and I cherish talking to my family down in @LOCATION2, whom I see about once every couple of years. Online communication has transformed the way people interact because there is now an easier way to talk to others instantly. Just a simple push of a button, and you have immediate communication with someone. Finally, people have the option to type on a program if they want to write a letter or a story. For instance, if you use Microsoft Word, you can freely type up whatever you desire. This has changed the writing process as it is a faster and easier way to write. Therefore, if you finish typing earlier than you would have if you hand - wrote it, you would have extra leisure time, or more time to complete the rest of your work. Also, it is convenient for me because I type quite fast; after lots of practice, of course. In conclusion, the invention of computers has helped and still continues to help society in many ways. But, the three ways that I have chosen to tell you about in this letter, I feel, have impacted us the most. I hope this helps you with your questions about how computers have affected people. Thank you for taking the time to read my letter. Have a good day.
207	207	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, I firmly believe that a computer isn't harmful in any way. On the contrary, it helps people learn about things they were previously unaware of. Also, it enables people to interact with individuals from all around the world. Another great aspect is that it allows people to stay in close touch with family and friends across the globe. Computers don't cause harm; they are a source of assistance. Computers are an excellent learning tool. Schools like mine have over a hundred computers, and they are strictly used for educational purposes. Anyway, even if we attempt to access different sites, we get redirected to a blocked website. Cars and other complex machines were designed with the help of computers, which provided the detailed blueprints. There is one thing that computers are predominantly used for, and that's learning. Are you thinking about going on vacation somewhere but are unsure about how things operate there? Well, a computer can help you solve those problems. It allows you to see how the local people are and what the place looks like through a virtual tour. You can even get some assistance if you are unfamiliar with the local traditions or beliefs. Computers are a fantastic way to explore. Computers are also a great means of communicating with others. Family members who live on the other side of the world can use computers to have conversations and check on how you're doing. What about old friends who have moved away? You can still talk and communicate with each other. Getting in touch with friends and family isn't a bad thing, is it? And these are the reasons to show how computers aren't harmful in any way. It provides people with a good education. It allows people to learn about the cultures of places around the world. And talking to friends is something positive, not negative. This is why computers don't harm people; they help.
208	208	1	3	Dear newspaper editor, I have recently heard that some people think that computers have a negative effect on people. Well, I firmly believe that computers have a positive effect on people. I think that computers have a positive effect on people because it simplifies the process of learning about other countries. Also, it facilitates people in talking to individuals from different countries. Another reason is that it helps people gain knowledge about different cultures, religions, or traditions. The reason why some people think that computers have a negative effect on people is that people are spending more time on the computer rather than spending quality time with their family. Also, people use the computer more frequently than they use exercise machines, bicycles, or scooters. Now that you are aware of the positive and negative effects of computers, which side will you choose? The one against computers or the one in favor of computers. I would undoubtedly choose the one in favor of computers as the benefits they offer far outweigh the potential drawbacks.
209	209	1	3	Dear local newspaper editor, My opinion on the effects of computers on people is that staying on a computer is not that bad; it does not rot your brain like video games. There are some good reasons why computers are beneficial and can assist you. Sometimes, computers do contribute to improving hand - eye coordination. You can use the computer to do your homework or to search for a store, for example. Some computers are really slow, but not all of the new ones. For instance, as of @DATE1, computers can also help you read better; they have useful features. You can play games and talk to people like your friends. Listening to music is an easy thing to do; you can find a website that has all the songs that you like to listen to. Many people use the computer to find jobs and to look for ways to eat right and work out. Paying bills online is easier than paying them in person. The computer provides an easy way to pay, and you should agree with my opinion as the advantages are quite evident.
210	210	1	3	Dear Newspaper, The question is whether or not people are spending too much time on the computer or not. In my opinion, people aren't, and there are numerous benefits from being on the computer. Typing on the computer enhances hand - eye coordination. It is also easy to learn while on the computer, and you can communicate with people as well! Hand - eye coordination is extremely important. We utilize it every day during sports, taking notes, and even playing video games! Being on the computer is good because it actively develops hand - eye coordination. Whatever you do on the computer, whether it's typing, playing an online game, or surfing the web, helps in developing hand - eye coordination. It is beneficial to learn hand - eye coordination because most teachers these days expect children to type and print their papers so that they are neater. If kids can learn hand - eye coordination, they can type faster and submit their work on time. When students go on their computers, they can enhance their hand - eye coordination. My world cultures teacher allows us to use an online textbook if we don't finish our homework in class, instead of lugging around a heavy textbook. Any student would much rather go online than have to bring a giant textbook to and from school. Have you ever considered how much easier it is to take a college course online rather than having to physically go to college, especially for working parents? Everything can be done online on your portable laptop, instead of having to commute to and from a college. Using a computer to learn about different places is a breeze. There are websites filled with pictures of beautiful foreign places, depicting hot deserts, and the tropical rainfall along with images of monkeys and tigers. It is both fun and easy to learn on a computer. Since cell phones have become so popular, a lot of people have gotten rid of their home phone to save money. Sometimes, though, cell phones lose signal. That is why it is good to have a computer. It is easy to talk to other people through forums, chat websites, and email. You can have intelligent conversations, and it's easy and free! It is straightforward to communicate using a computer. Surely you've heard my reasons why it's okay for people to spend time on the computer, and I hope you see my point. Yes, people should spend time outside or with family, but in small doses, the computer is good for you. It is easy to learn hand - eye coordination and communicate on a computer, making it a valuable tool in our lives.
211	211	1	3	Not everyone thinks computers are good for you, but in fact, they are a very good resource to find a wide variety of information efficiently. It's not good to be on the computer for seven hours straight, but to be on it occasionally is not bad. A person who is glued to the computer all day and does nothing else except that, then that is clearly not healthy at all. People just have to limit their time on how much they stay on the computer. Don't overdo it! Computers are also very good for information as I said earlier. If you have a computer or a laptop and you need to find information on something, the vast expanse of the internet is there at your fingertips. For kids that need to do homework or a project and they need to look up some facts or information on something, they could conveniently go on the computer for that. It is so much easier to do that than to painstakingly look for books that have all the facts you need. So computers have very good qualities and resources. They aren't bad or unhealthy unless that is your entire life and that is the only thing you do. That is my well - considered opinion on computers.
212	212	1	3	I think that people are spending an excessive amount of time on their computers and not taking the time to enjoy nature and other wonderful things. My reasons are that people don't do anything except surf the web aimlessly, talk to other people non - stop all the time, and they just sit around eating junk food and getting no exercise. Those are my three key reasons. My first reason is what people commonly do, which is surf the web. There is an overwhelming number of over a million websites to go to. What people often do is go to all of them, casually look at things or impulsively buy something. The only appropriate things they should be doing on the web are homework or business - related tasks. Also, people play too many video games on the computer too, getting completely engrossed in virtual worlds. My second reason is that people go on @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 or use web cams. Those people could be on there for hours and hours talking to people. Sometimes those virtual interactions become people's entire lives and all they do. I know someone who has a @CAPS1 and after school all they do is talk to people. They have friends on @CAPS1 but no real - life friends to hang out with. My third reason is when people do go on the computer, all they do is eat junk food like potato chips and cookies and have soda. If you do that for a week, you will be extremely tired and sleepy all the time. Also, you can quickly get very fat. Your body will become unhealthy and out of shape. Now that you have read my reasons, I hope you find them convincing. My reasons were that people don't do anything but surf the web, talk to other people all the time, and people eat junk food and get no exercise, which clearly shows the negative impact of excessive computer use.
213	213	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I just wanted to say that I whole - heartedly agree with you that some people spend a disproportionate amount of time on the computer. My reasons are that people need to exercise regularly, go outdoors to enjoy the fresh air, and have fun in real - life situations. If you keep reading, you'll understand why they need to do these things. My first reason was exercising. And the reason why I emphasize exercising is because you don't need to be on the computer all day long. There are so many great things that they can do, such as run briskly in the park, jog along the beach, and go for long bike rides in the countryside. I mean it's okay to go on the computer once in a while to learn, but that's why they have books in libraries and schools to learn about things in a more traditional way. My second reason was going outside. The reason for that is because people need to get fresh air and not be locked inside all day. Another benefit is to explore the unknown and go on a hike to see what beautiful landscapes are out there and just have a great time. My other reason was nature. And what I mean by that is you can go to the zoo and learn about different animals and plants there too. Another thing is that you can do so much more without being on the computer all day long. My last reason was that you can talk to your friends about interesting stuff, you can go to the mall all day to window - shop or buy things, you can also hang out with your friends and have a sleepover and watch exciting movies together. You don't need to stay on the computer all day; you need to have real - life fun. This is why I say you don't need to be on the computer constantly. You can do other stuff and still learn without being glued to the computer. For once, maybe instead of talking online, you can actually go to your friend's house and have a face - to - face conversation. Thank you for your time. Hope to talk to you soon.
214	214	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, Imagine you're at home and you are engrossed in the computer. But it's been hours, maybe even days since you've taken a deep breath of fresh air outside. This might sound crazy, yet it is a harsh reality for over <@PERCENT1@NUM1> of the population in @LOCATION1. Just look around; they are in movies, in chain restaurants at your home, in your office, and even in schools; computers are ubiquitous. I know that because of over - using computers, many experts are deeply concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. I say that because of this, people everywhere should only be allowed to use the computer for a limited time every day. Say @CAPS2 to excessive computer use. My point is with computers, our days are often wasted on virtual games and other mindless downloads. For starters, people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising. Over the past two years, obesity has become a major epidemic in @LOCATION1, with over @PERCENT1 of the population affected. Obesity causes an extremely higher risk of getting diseases and sickness like diabetes, heart failure, and even depression. Recently, my cousin passed away from cancer caused by her obesity. My point is we can't just sit here idly; we need to get up and get moving away from that computer. In addition to this, people should get off computers and start enjoying nature. A total of <@PERCENT1@NUM2> of individuals in @LOCATION1 don't spend enough time outside. With global warming rapidly killing our environment, people should care enough to spend a little more of their time outside. Did you know that more and more of the environment is disappearing each day? I went to my good friend, who is an expert on all things environmental from the institute of Clean Our World or COW. In conclusion, we must take action to reduce computer use and embrace a healthier, more natural lifestyle.
215	215	1	3	"Dear @ORGANIZATION2, I am expressing my deep concern to you about the side - effects that new technologies, such as computers, have on humans. Computers impact humans in a harmful manner because people are spending an inordinate amount of @ORGANIZATION1 their quality time on their computers, which additionally leads to less time spent doing exercise. People also do not get to spend as much of their days outdoors and interacting with friends and family. Firstly, people are spending too much @ORGANIZATION1 their time aimlessly surfing the net. A comprehensive study shows that an average @CAPS1 spends in total @NUM1 hours a day on the computer, almost double what they should be spending on it. Dr. @DR1 from the @CAPS1 technology society says that if this increasing @ORGANIZATION1 time spent on the internet continues for more years, most @CAPS3 will completely lose contact with family and friends outside @ORGANIZATION1 the social computer network. The average weight @ORGANIZATION1 a @NUM2 - year - old has increased from @NUM3 pounds in @DATE1, to @NUM4 pounds today. Statistics clearly show that the main cause for this dramatic increase in weight is due to the excessive amount @ORGANIZATION1 time spent on computers. In addition, @CAPS4 do not have as much time to exercise. Teenagers need to exercise three times a week for thirty minutes each. However, the average adolescent only spends ten minutes a week exercising, not including gym class. All @ORGANIZATION1 these concerning numbers must change, and a way to start would be to reduce computer use because people are spending too much time on them and less time exercising. Secondly, computers are affecting the amount of time people get to go outside and enjoy nature. From my personal experience, nature is a beautiful thing to be a part @ORGANIZATION1. But nowadays, I spend way too much time on social networks such as Facebook, MySpace and @CAPS6 others. How often do you go outside to take a leisurely walk, go for a bike ride or do something else? A study done by @PERSON2 shows that the average person living in @LOCATION1 has only spent a total @ORGANIZATION1 @NUM5 days outside in the past two years after receiving their new computer. This must change; people need to enjoy what this wonderful world has to offer. Thirdly, computers have affected the interaction between family and friends. ""@CAPS6 people have only been interacting with family at mandatory times such as school meetings,"" says @ORGANIZATION1. Family and friends are of major importance in everyone's lives. I love to sit down and have a heart - to - heart talk with my mom over a steaming cup @ORGANIZATION1 hot chocolate. @PERCENT1 @ORGANIZATION1 people now - a - days do not spend any time with family, and @PERCENT2 @ORGANIZATION1 people use computers to interact with friends. It is vitally important that people stop using computers so excessively because ""before you know it you will have lost all communication with family and friends,"" says @PERSON1 from I.U.M. Computers help people lose communication and interaction with family and friends. In conclusion, I earnestly urge you to make the right decision by reducing computer use. By doing so, you will become a much happier and stronger individual. Computers impact humans in a terrible way because people spend too much time on them, leading to a lack of exercise, less time spent outside, and a decrease in interaction between friends and family. Sorry about the lack @ORGANIZATION1 organization towards the end; I ran out @ORGANIZATION1 space. Please excuse the mess. Thank you for considering my concerns."
216	216	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I'm writing you today so you can clearly see why advanced technology, especially computers, has a positive effect on people. My reasons for writing this are quite simple. Computers allow people to talk online to other people, learn about far - away places, and finally, they teach hand - eye coordination. As you read my letter, I sincerely hope you feel the same way. First of all, computers allow you to talk to other people online. Imagine this: what if you can't find your landline phone in your house or even your cell phone? You could quickly check if they were online. Also, it's similar to texting, but with a bigger keyboard and screen. I can vividly relate to this. Once, I was texting someone and then went online to find them too. So, we sent instant messages to each other instead. I truly hope you can see why computers can be so good for people. Secondly, not a lot of people these days will go to the library to look up information for a school paper. The reason is that a computer has Google, which makes finding things incredibly easier. Another factor is that going to the library in @MONTH1 means you'll spend more money to fill up your gas tanks. I can clearly recall that every time my family goes to the library, we have to fill the car up after the visit. This is yet another reason why computers are great. Finally, computers can teach hand - eye coordination. When you're writing an email, you should know the keys that your fingers touch. Another aspect is that if your kid takes karate, they might have learned to move their hands that fast from using the computer. I can remember when I was in the first grade. There was a guy who told me and my friends that he needed us to get in the truck to help him find his lost puppy. He tried grabbing me, but I quickly pulled my hand away before I got pinned. I would like to thank you for sitting and reading my essay. Once again, my reasons for writing were that people can talk to other people online, learn about far - away places, and gain hand - eye coordination. I sincerely hope you will rethink why we should have computers in school. After all, computers are truly a valuable asset in our lives.
217	217	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, I wholeheartedly agree that computers have a positive effect on people. You learn hand - eye coordination, you don't have to step out to go to the library, and it can significantly improve social skills. Continue reading to find out the detailed reasons. Computers are a part of our daily lives. We use them every single day, and they are constantly teaching us something. In @MONTH1, we might not even realize it, but they are teaching us hand - eye coordination. When we type something, we use our eyes to look at the screen and then our hands to type. If there's one mistake, automatically our hands fix it. Or maybe when we are playing exciting games online, the same principle applies. Our eyes are intently looking, while our hands are fast at work over the keyboard. Hand - eye Coordination is a crucial skill in sports, and I firmly believe that since we spend a lot of time on computers, they are a quick way to learn that skill. Next, consider how many students' parents work. My parents do, and sometimes it becomes extremely difficult to walk to the library. Not everyone lives within walking distance to one. That's when a computer becomes a real lifesaver. If you have a project to do, but your parents are at work, you can just @ORGANIZATION1 it up. You might even get more information than what you can get in the library. For instance, if @CAPS1 you had to do a project on @CAPS2. Let's say you managed to go to a library, but apparently there were only @NUM1 books on @CAPS2, out of which @NUM2 were checked out. You can always check it out from another library, but that might not come soon enough. According to a survey, @PERCENT1 of students said this has happened to them, but the computer saved them. So, what else did they say? HELLO @ORGANIZATION1! Last but not least, a computer improves your social skills. When I first moved here, I was a very shy person. When I made a @CAPS3, I started talking to people who go to my school. I even became good friends with them. I'm not saying that you should just stop talking to people in person and only use @CAPS3, @CAPS6, @CAPS7, or @CAPS8 to communicate. What I am saying is that if you start talking to them online, you get to know them a little. Then, when you talk in person, you'll find that you have a lot in common with that person, and soon you can become friends. Another related thing is that I have many friends living in @LOCATION1, and many cousins in @LOCATION3, @LOCATION2. We all know that you can't travel all the time. Sometimes, you can't even get to see them. That's where social networks help. You can keep in touch without wasting minutes on your phone. Can it get any better? In conclusion, computers have a very positive and far - reaching effect on people. From improving hand - eye coordination, to enabling us to complete projects without going to the library and getting an A+ grade, to enhancing our social skills. Even the data collected supports these benefits. Thank you for taking your time and effort to read this. I sincerely hope it has persuaded many people to recognize the value of computers.
218	218	1	3	@ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1, think about it. Do you really want your kids & citizens to get fat and lazy? Or do you want them to be active, learn everyday skills, and become more friendly to the people around them? @PERCENT1 of parents would definitely agree with me on the second idea over the first one. Well, I think after reading this, those extra @PERCENT2 will also be persuaded. Nowadays, @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people are overweight or obese. This can be caused by a lack of exercise and inactivity. Our children need to learn to @CAPS1 go out and exercise for an hour a day. This could get their eyes off the computer screen. A great way to encourage this is to join a sports team or a club. This can keep people away from screens and the @ORGANIZATION2 course. If we can get people out of the office, this could even push them towards nature. There are great things to @CAPS1 at the local park every day. For example, you could ride a bike, play fun games, or just fool around with friends. Learning could also be a big incentive in getting people out of their computer chairs. If they want to look something up, tell them to use a dictionary, a thesaurus, or a book. While people are on the computer, it can expose kids to some bad things. But @CAPS1 can also help find career options and life skills. Sitting in front of a screen can harm your health in many ways. There are better things to @CAPS1 instead of relying on the internet. You can still have a great time even if you're not good at something. For instance, you can hang out with friends. If you're a boy, you could just go @CAPS1 like to a park and play career - based games or even wrestle. In conclusion, I'd say that everyone should want to get up and get outside. Since getting up and going outside could help you socialize, learn new things, and even lose weight. So now, I leave it in your hands whether or not to take the challenge. But just to inform you, if you stay glued to your computer, it can promote the need for glasses and obesity, which are definitely not good for your well - being.
219	219	1	3	Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1, it has lately come to my full attention that people were saying that computers aren't important. Well, I strongly and firmly disagree with that statement. I think computers teach excellent hand - eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about far - away places, and even allow you to chat online with family and friends. Computers teach a great deal of hand - eye coordination. Studies clearly show that @PERCENT1 of all football players have excellent hand - eye coordination. I'm quite sure this is because after the football players get home from a big game or some event, they log into @CAPS2 and make their status all about their win. Plus, they probably pull up ping - pong and see how long they can go without getting the little ball down the hole. Do you have good hand - eye coordination? My second reason for disagreeing with the previous statement is that computers give people the ability to learn about far - away places without ever leaving home. I mean @CAPS1 is so much faster than having to go to the library. At the library, you would have to first get there, second pick out your book, and third check @CAPS1 out. With a computer, in all that time, you could be completely finished with your whole project! Finally, the reason why computers are so important is that @CAPS1 keeps people in touch. Do you have family members who live far away from you? I @CAPS3 I do. I can't always call them on the phone @CAPS4 I want to talk to them. So, I just log on to @CAPS2, and if they're online, I can have my conversation with that person. I don't @CAPS3 about you, but I'm really close to my grandma. Unfortunately, she doesn't even live anywhere close. It's more than @NUM1 hours away from me. She's way down @LOCATION2 in @LOCATION1. By car, that's one and a half days, and by plane, it's three hours! So, it's so much easier to log on @CAPS2 and have a private conversation with her rather than going through the hassle of driving a day and a half or flying for three hours. So, in conclusion, I'm sure you totally agree with me. Computers are just truly amazing! They help you develop hand - eye coordination, let you research something super quickly, and allow you to stay in touch with far - away friends and family. They are an essential part of our modern lives.
220	220	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1, imagine being at home with absolutely nothing to do. You can't play basketball with @PERSON1 and your friends because you lack hand - eye coordination. You want to learn about @LOCATION1, but there aren't any relevant books. And you want to talk to your friends. That's exactly what would have happened if we didn't have advances in technology. No hand - eye coordination, we wouldn't be able to learn about far - away places, and we couldn't talk online. Computers benefit our lives in so many remarkable ways. To begin with, hand - eye coordination is extremely important. Without @CAPS5, we wouldn't be able to write or even hold a pencil properly. @PERCENT1 of people's hand - eye coordination has improved when using a computer. This was proven in a @DATE1 study by @PERSON2, the head of human reactions. “@CAPS3 knows that your hands are the most prominent part of your body, and the computer helps refine the movements to hone hand - eye coordination,” @PERSON1 said in a @DATE2 interview with a science magazine. When you're clumsy, you break things. Sometimes, important things. For example, @PERSON3 in @LOCATION2 broke her mother's glass vase. @CAPS5 could have been improved if she had used a computer. In addition, computers give us the power to learn about far - away places. There might be no relevant books! @PERCENT2 of people prefer looking up information on a computer than in a book. That's a well - known fact. Some people wouldn't have heard about the earthquake in @LOCATION3 if it wasn't for the websites that broadcasted updates on it. Campers wouldn't have heard either. @ORGANIZATION2 had a front - page spread to promote the use of computers instead of books. Books could be outdated, but the computer will always have up - to - date answers. Also, people need to be able to talk online. For business meetings, government plans, or just chatting with a friend. People need to be able to stay in touch. If the president couldn't video - conference, he would be flying everywhere. Email is the only way @PERSON5 from @CAPS4 talks to her coworkers. “I'm just located so far away. It's so much easier,” she says. It makes businesses and major corporations run smoothly. It seems that @CAPS6 is now the only way kids talk. It lets them feel like they're a part of something bigger than themselves. Now, we have happy, healthy, and educated young and old Americans. They can do and research whatever they want. It's truly amazing what technology does. It allows you to talk online, research far - away places, and practice your hand - eye coordination. That definitely sounds like a great thing to me! So, @ORGANIZATION1, computers are only a positive force. I sincerely hope you agree with me and recognize the importance of computers in our lives.
221	221	1	3	Some people in @MONTH1 think that computers take up too much time that could be spent on important things. But really, everything you would like to know is right there at your fingertips. You can learn about nature, discover cool websites, and even explore history. Here are my reasons regarding the effects of computers. First, you can learn so much about nature online. You can view many diverse types of animals and conduct in - depth studies on them. Learn about plants and the profound effect they have on life. Also, you can learn about many things on @LOCATION1 and how its ecological and geographical features are changing. Secondly, there are many cool websites you can join. There are various games you can play to keep you occupied during the day. You can even chat online with friends or maybe find long - lost friends. School - related sites are available for students for some studying or getting academic help. Lastly, computers show you so much about history. You can compare the people who made significant things happen and world - famous people from back then to famous people now. Most important of all, you can learn the life - changing stories and how they impact people's lives today. I hope I've provided you enough reasons to agree with me. As you can see, computers have many resources you can learn from. Learning about nature, exploring websites, and studying history aren't even half of what they offer. Think about it! Thank you for listening.
222	222	1	3	"Computers and the @CAPS1 have changed the way the world works today. From trading stocks to instant messaging (@CAPS2), people have based important decisions in their life based on what they have read on the @CAPS1. Although some people believe that computers are pulling people away from the beauty of nature, spending time with relatives, or getting exercise. I believe that @CAPS11 is only helping the world on a day - to - day basis. One example is conversation. Many people have close relatives who live overseas, cross - country, or even across town. The @CAPS1 helps them speak to others that they normally couldn't have a conversation with. On several occasions, my family have planned trips together even though we live across the continent. What could have taken months by letters in the mail took as little as one hour to do over the @CAPS1. Another way to speak to friends or family is a website called @CAPS3. @CAPS3 is a user - friendly website that allows you to speak to others, share @CAPS6 or send pictures to them. Other similar websites are @CAPS4 and @CAPS5. @PERCENT1 of people in @LOCATION1 have an account on one of these websites. One other way to speak to others, more for business reasons, is @CAPS6. Multiple reliable servers provide @CAPS6, such as @ORGANIZATION3, @ORGANIZATION2, or @CAPS8. ""@ORGANIZATION3 is my personal favorite,"" says @PERSON2, @CAPS9 of the @LOCATION2 @CAPS10 newspaper, ""@CAPS11 has helped me endlessly if I need to contact someone on short notice."" That is one reason why I support the use of computers. Another reason I support the use of computers is because <@PERCENT1@NUM1> of all students rely on the @CAPS1 for research papers and other assignments. ""Even though I still use books,"" college student @PERSON1 said, ""The @CAPS1 is so much faster and the articles are more up - to - date."" Search engines are most popularly used, such as @ORGANIZATION1 or @CAPS14.com. @NUM2 of all computer users with @CAPS1 access have used @ORGANIZATION1 at some point. Another handy program provided by all computer companies is @CAPS15 @CAPS16. This program is used for everything from writing research papers to creating various documents. This program also has a spell check, a punctuation check, and a check for grammar mistakes. The main reason I am writing this paper is because experts have been complaining that people have been spending too much time on the computer and @CAPS11 has been distracting them from the important things in life, such as friends, family, and nature. However, from the examples explained in this paper, I have shown that the @CAPS1 increases conversation and curiosity about how the world looks and operates. As for exercise, it is common sense to spend at least one hour working on personal fitness. In conclusion, the @CAPS1 offers numerous benefits in communication and learning, and with proper balance, it can be a valuable tool in our lives."
223	223	1	3	Dear @LOCATION1, I think the way more and more people use computers is bad because, first, it's not good for people's health. Second, people who use computers a lot of times refuse to spend time with family and friends. And third, you can find more about something that's on a computer by going and studying it yourself. My first reason why computers have bad effects on people who use them is the health issue. Health is very important, but sitting in front of a computer for hours makes matters worse. The way you hunch your back in order to see something small on the computer screen, or when you hold on to the mouse, waiting to click on something for a long period of time, can cause arthritis. My second reason why computers have bad effects on people who use them is that people who are on computers tend to sometimes refuse to spend time with family or friends. For example: say a week ago you made a promise to have a family get - together with the family, and they all count on you to come. Then you get on a computer, you go on all these neat websites that you never heard of. It seems amazing, right? WRONG! Before you know it, it's the day for the family get - together and you're online an hour before. You make excuses not to come. And that breaks your family's heart. My last reason why, to me, computers are a bad idea is that you can learn about a place from the computer, but it's more fun traveling or meeting people from that place instead of sitting in front of a screen and having your neck, back, and eyes sore. Am I right? I think I am. Also, it's fun to taste and eat foods from the culture that you find cool, rather than relying on that lame computer. (To me, that sounds like a good time to invite family and friends!) Therefore, in conclusion, in my personal opinion, computers have bad effects on people's health. It can cause later back and neck problems, maybe even joint problems. People who use computers a lot or love to spend time on computers refuse to spend time with family and friends. And you can find more about something like a culture or land if you go and study it yourself instead of going on a computer for hours. I hope my opinion convinces others how computers have bad effects on people who use them a lot, and they will take action into their own hands and do what is right.
224	224	1	3	"@ORGANIZATION1, Computers have great effects that are positive towards people. This is because it teaches hand - eye coordination, allows people to learn about far - away places, and enables them to talk to other people online. Computers have great positive effects for everyone. Computers teach hand - eye coordination. When a person is typing, they are using their hands to type while looking at the monitor for the letters. Computer games help to teach this skill as in the game things happen very quickly, so the person has to see what's going on and click the correct key fast, thus improving hand - eye coordination greatly. Studies do show that people who use computers have a @PERCENT1 better hand - eye coordination than someone who doesn't. Computers help with hand - eye coordination and they can teach you about far - away places. Someone can learn about far - away places by searching it up online. They will get many detailed facts about that place. Sheral from @LOCATION4 said, ""I heard someone at school mention @LOCATION2 and didn't know a thing about it, so I searched it and got a ton of interesting facts."" This shows the computer can help someone learn about foreign countries. And they can talk to people far away. Using the computer, someone could talk to you while you're hundreds or thousands of miles away. They can do this through e - mail or video chat. A survey showed that seven out of ten people prefer video chat because it's faster and the two people can see each other. However, either way, they are still fast ways to contact a person far away. Jack from @LOCATION1 said, ""Because of video chat, I was able to talk to and see my cousin from @LOCATION3 who I almost never see."" This goes to show that the computer is a positive thing for people. The computer is helpful in so many ways. It teaches hand - eye coordination, it allows people to learn about far - away places, and it allows for people to talk to other people. Computers are truly a great thing for everyone, enhancing our learning, communication, and skills."
225	225	1	3	"Computers, @CAPS1, how far we've come. Computers hold many opportunities for the world, and yet we don't utilize most of them in a healthy way. Computers have taken many people and left them without exercise. Computers fascinate many and can become very addicting if not used only in moderation. Computers are also attention hogs and take away interaction with family. Imagine seven years of your life sitting in front of a computer. You never get up unless you absolutely need to. You even decide to cut the sports from your life. Now imagine what that does to your body. Even if you ate right, the never - exercising part would kill you. I remember I was at my cousin @PERSON2's house when she suggested to play the game @CAPS2 fit. If you have never played this before, when you sign in, it does some physical tests and determines the age of your body. My body was @NUM1 years old. I was a @NUM2 - year - old in a @NUM1 - year - old body. All those years wasted in front of the computer. I don't want that experience to happen to another person. Don't make the same mistake as me, readers of the @LOCATION1 current. I have a friend named @PERSON1, and she is a computer addict. She would spend days on end on the computer. Sometimes she'd miss school for the computer or come to school just to play on the computer. She'd sometimes get violent when someone tried to pull her away. I hated seeing my friend like this, but mostly I hated how I watched it happen. It started off innocent enough. She enjoyed a certain website on the internet. It would sometimes get scary when she talked to me about it and clearly had played it all night. If you are looking at this story and thinking that would never happen to me, you're wrong. I was thinking the same way when I took a look at that website that got her started. Thankfully, I stopped my addiction before it got too serious, but many others like @PERSON1 could and will be absorbed by the computers. Many readers reading this right now should understand how dangerous this is. ""@CAPS3!.... @CAPS3!... I'm talking to you!"" That is the sound of your family members trying to talk to you when you're on the computer. It doesn't work because computers are so attention - grabbing that you can't even stand to talk to your own family. My mom does this many times a day to grab my attention and ends up calling my cell phone or instant - messaging me. That's really just sad. By doing this, you also become detached, which is never a good thing. The more and more you ignore your family for the computer, the less of a bond you'll have, and the less of a fulfilling life you'll lead. Computers truly are amazing, but the loss of exercise is very unhealthy and rapidly happening. Computers can also be dangerous as many people will get addicted. The more you chat in chat rooms with strangers, the less you will talk to your family. Computers are like double - edged swords. In conclusion, we need to be extremely cautious when using computers. We should set limits to avoid the negative impacts on our health, relationships, and overall well - being."
226	226	1	3	"Dear local newspaper, I think that computers are a good thing to have for the following three compelling reasons. First, they serve as powerful tools to assist people in learning by enabling them to look up information from various sources across different platforms. Second, they facilitate seamless communication with friends and family using @CAPS2, a remarkable digital communication medium. Lastly, they help people unwind and become less stressed through engaging in a wide array of computer games.  Learning is of utmost importance, and computers provide a significant advantage in this regard. With computers, you're able to acquire knowledge at a much faster pace. They help you explore far - away places like @LOCATION1, offering vivid details and in - depth information. It is undeniably much easier to learn on the computer than to visit the library and painstakingly check out a book. For instance, if you're working on a project and you need some last - minute information, you can simply turn to the computer and search for your topic with just a few clicks. Learning on a computer is far more convenient than going to the @CAPS1.  Another crucial reason computers are good is the ability to communicate with friends and family who are far away using something called @CAPS2. @CAPS2 is a revolutionary technology that allows someone to have real - time conversations with another person using the computer. These individuals could be living just down the block or halfway across the world. My cousin is spending a semester in college in Spain. I've had numerous video calls with her through @CAPS2. The most amazing aspect of @CAPS2 is that you can actually see the person you're talking to on the computer screen, making the communication feel more personal and intimate. @CAPS2 is truly a great way to keep in touch with loved ones who are geographically distant.  My last reason is that computers are effective in lowering your stress level through playing games. Computer games are incredibly fun to play, with a vast range of options. They have games that range from @CAPS3 @CAPS4 the word, to @CAPS5 @CAPS6 beauty barn. Computer games are an excellent way to relieve stress because instead of overwhelming yourself with too much work, you can relax and unwind with these games. They also offer educational games, like ""Which country is which"". This game teaches you geography while you have a great time.  Computers are an invaluable asset. They help you learn about far - away places, stay connected with people who live far away, and offer a platform to play fun computer games. Computers are always going to be in use and will never be obsolete. There's always something productive or entertaining you can do when you log on to a computer."
227	227	1	3	Dear people from the newspaper, I am deeply concerned that people spend an excessive amount of time on the computer because it could lead to trouble, violence, and illegal crimes.  First, I am worried that people's excessive computer use causes trouble. In @DATE2, a significant @PERCENT1 of @DATE1 people in the @LOCATION1 engage in unethical behavior such as starting baseless rumors and saying derogatory things about people they dislike. In the @DATE1, @PERCENT2 of @DATE1 teens aged @NUM1 were involved in this rumor - spreading activity. This kind of behavior is extremely harmful to all children, as it can damage reputations and cause emotional distress. All these negative actions can lead to the consequences described @NUM2 below.  Secondly, I am concerned that excessive computer use leads to violence. Given the reasons outlined in the @NUM3 paragraph, if this trend continues, it may escalate and result in violence. In @DATE1, @NUM4 people tragically lost their lives due to the crimes committed online. A large number of @NUM5 threats were discovered online from well - known websites like @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and @CAPS3. These threats not only create a sense of fear but also pose a real danger to individuals.  Lastly, I am alarmed that excessive computer use could lead to illegal crimes. In @DATE3, a girl was chatting with a boy online. When they decided to meet in person, he shot and killed her. It turned out that he had lied about his identity online. On a website called @CAPS4, a group of @DATE1 men were discussing their hatred for kids and planned to shoot them at their bus stops. Fortunately, the police were able to apprehend them before they could carry out this heinous crime.  In conclusion, I am extremely concerned that people are spending too much time on the computer because it causes trouble, violence, and illegal crimes. This situation urgently needs to stop before everyone becomes addicted to spreading rumors and engaging in other harmful online activities. Thank you for taking the time to read this letter.
228	228	1	3	Dear Readers, in today's modern world, almost everyone owns a computer. While this can be seen as a positive development, it mostly has an unnatural impact on our lives.  Computers have enabled people to do things that were previously impossible. For example, when people move to a different location, they no longer need to send letters and wait days for a reply. Now, they can simply sign into platforms like AIM, Facebook, or MySpace and have instant conversations. However, these are just the positive aspects. There are numerous negative consequences.  People are spending less time outdoors and are no longer appreciating the beauty of nature. We rarely spend quality time with our friends in person. I can hardly recall the last time I had a face - to - face conversation with someone unless it was absolutely necessary.  The anonymity of the internet allows people to do as they please. You might think this is a good thing, but it's not. People can hack into various systems, cyberbully others without being identified, and assume false identities. For instance, if I were @NUM1 and I wanted to stalk a @NUM2 - year - old, I could pretend to be ten and befriend the child. Once I gather enough information, I could potentially locate the child. This kind of behavior was not possible before the widespread use of computers.  If people start to recognize the negative impacts on our lives, more of them will stop being overly attached to their computers. They will reduce the amount of time spent on the computer and start living a more balanced life. We need to take action, be more aware, and spread the word about the importance of limiting computer use. By doing so, we can regain a more natural and fulfilling way of life.
229	229	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, when you have some spare time, @CAPS2 would you prefer to do? Would you go outside and perhaps @CAPS3 the soccer ball around with your kids, enjoying the fresh air and physical activity? Or would you grab a bag of chips and log onto Facebook or your email, sitting in front of the screen for hours? The crucial question is, do computers have a negative or positive effect on people? I firmly believe that computers have a negative effect.  Talking to friends on the computer doesn't allow you to develop essential social skills. Social interaction in real - life situations involves body language, tone of voice, and immediate responses. When you communicate online, you miss out on these elements. For example, when you first meet someone in person, you need to know @CAPS4 @CAPS2 to say and how to act appropriately. Typing on a keyboard doesn't really let you interact with people in a meaningful way. Why not invite someone over for a cup of coffee or go out to lunch with your family instead?  Computers are also highly addictive. I can speak from my own experience that once I log onto the computer, I may not be able to tear myself away for hours. This is a common problem for many people. Although not everyone uses a computer daily, the vast majority of people are regular users. When I'm on Facebook and see the number of people online, initially it might be one hundred or two hundred, but as time passes, the number keeps increasing.  This addiction to the computer leads to a lack of exercise. Doctors recommend that adults and kids should get at least an hour of exercise a day. However, sitting in front of the computer for long periods takes away from this valuable time. Instead of sitting on the computer for an hour, you could be jogging in the park or playing a sport. Often, when someone sits down at the computer, they bring a snack with them. This not only adds to the sedentary lifestyle but also contributes to health problems. It's clear that getting enough exercise is crucial for staying healthy.  I truly believe that I would feel a lot better if I went for a run instead of going on the computer. You might think you can manage both computer use and exercise, but some people prioritize exercise. When these people see you constantly on the computer, @CAPS2 kind of example does it set? If everyone limited their time on the computer, we would all be more social, feel better, and lead healthier lives. I trust that you will agree with me that computers have a negative effect on people.
230	230	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, when it comes to spare time, @CAPS2 what would you choose to do? Would you go outdoors and perhaps kick the soccer ball around with your kids, relishing the joy of physical activity and quality time? Or would you simply grab a bag of chips and log onto Facebook or check your email, sitting passively in front of the screen? The question at hand is whether computers have a negative or positive effect on people. I am convinced that computers have a negative impact.  One of the main drawbacks is that talking to friends on the computer fails to help you learn social skills. In real - life conversations, there are non - verbal cues, facial expressions, and intonations that play a crucial role in communication. When you communicate online, you miss out on these important elements. For instance, when you first meet someone in person, you need to quickly figure out @CAPS4 @CAPS2 to say and how to behave. Typing on a keyboard doesn't offer the same level of interaction as a face - to - face conversation. Why not invite someone over for a friendly chat or go out to lunch with your family instead? This way, you can enhance your social skills and build stronger relationships.  Computers are also extremely addictive. I can attest that once I start using the computer, I often lose track of time and may stay on it for several hours. This is a widespread issue. Although not every individual uses a computer daily, a large number of people do. When I'm on Facebook and see the number of people online, it's astonishing to watch the numbers grow over time.  This addiction to the computer has a direct impact on getting enough exercise. Doctors emphasize that both adults and children should engage in at least an hour of exercise each day. However, spending excessive time on the computer takes away from this necessary physical activity. Instead of sitting in front of the screen, you could be going for a brisk walk, cycling, or playing a sport. Moreover, when someone sits down at the computer, they usually have a snack nearby. This not only adds extra calories but also further reduces the motivation to exercise. It's evident that getting regular exercise is essential for maintaining good health.  I genuinely believe that I would feel much better if I went for a run instead of spending time on the computer. You may think you can balance both computer use and exercise, but some people value physical activity more. When these people see you glued to the computer, @CAPS2 what kind of example does it set? If everyone were to limit their computer time, we would all be more sociable, feel more energetic, and be in better health. I trust that you will come to agree with me that computers have a negative effect on people.
231	231	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 people often find the clicking and clacking sounds of computers quite a nuisance. What they don't realize is that computers are helping the youths' lives and making them easier, and they could also be benefiting from computers in the same way. This is why computers have a very good effect on people. First off, computers aren't a bad thing if they are just helping people get to know each other better. You always see ads for dating websites and other similar things. Did you know that @PERCENT1 of couples meet online? That's a significant number, and to think they would have never met if it weren't for computers. Second of all, computers provide a tremendous amount of entertainment. There are over @NUM1 computer games available online, and @CAPS2 of them are free too. I bet almost every kid has played a game on the internet before. Think about it, your child could be out getting in trouble or be nice and safe at home playing on the computer. You are probably thinking, computers sound so childish and infantile. Well, computers aren't just fun and games. They provide a lot of information. They are very useful for teens in school for projects, but they also benefit adults in many ways. They provide information on vacations, hotels, etc. Also, computers now have numerous videos on how to do things, like how - to guides and other useful information. So as you can see, computers aren't just a pain. They help bring people together, provide entertainment, and have very useful information. Think about it. A computer might save your life one day. Computers help people's everyday lives, and they could be helping yours, making your daily activities more convenient and enjoyable.
232	232	1	3	"Lately, a technology buzz has hit all over the world. Wherever you look, be it at home, at school, at work, or on the streets, you see people texting, talking on phones, blogging, and engaging in other computer - related things. This concerns some people. They believe that these generations are relying too much on computers and not spending enough time exercising outside or socializing. But here is where they go wrong. These experts are judging computers too harshly, for it's not like everyone is zoning out in front of a glass screen, sucked into the world beyond. In fact, most of these ""computer geeks"" are using the computer for useful things. While they are also used for entertainment, computers also help society to reconnect with long - lost friends or even get directions to a well - known restaurant. As you can plainly see, computers are not turning us all into zombies. Computers are sometimes seen as a nuisance. Parents complain about the many times they have to drag their sons and daughters from the screen for dinner or a soccer game that started @NUM1 minutes ago. But you see, this doesn't mean it's bad. Everyone goes on the computer. ""Even though my father complains that I'm on @CAPS1 too much,"" @PERSON1, @ORGANIZATION1, says. ""@CAPS2 forgets that @CAPS2 has one of his own."" This is an example not unlike many other students' parents. About @PERCENT1 of adults confess that they too have fallen into the new fads such as @CAPS1, @CAPS4, and @CAPS5. So why do we need these things? What seems to make them so important to us? The answer is simple, it makes us feel connected. Then again, if you think about it, maybe not so simple. Many people have different opinions on why the computer is so important to them, but most agree that friends is one big factor. ""Everyone is already online."" @PERSON2, computer technician, informs. ""If all your friends are involved in something, wouldn't you want to be as well?"" However, as the famous saying, ""If your friends jumped off a bridge, would you?"", flashes through your mind, let me answer that for you - no. Being connected and diving off the deep end are two different concepts. As you find friends from high school or just friends from school, you're glad that now you can talk to them face to face - or computer screen to computer screen - again. Last, but certainly not least, the computer is a great resource. While some people complain, others are using what it has to offer by looking up directions to events or facts for your next report. This is how websites like @ORGANIZATION2 make billions from the words being typed into the search engine. The facts and places that arise from the computer are like gems waiting to be found. In conclusion, it's easy to see why the computer and its resources are so loved. Everyone uses it for different things and different hobbies. Some use it for pure entertainment, others for information, and another for reconnection. My personal favorite is finding the true treasure of hidden bands, the fantastic ones, that hardly anyone even knows. And so, this is why I'm convinced the computer is a positive impact on the world, enhancing our lives in multiple ways."
233	233	1	3	Dier: newspaper I think the computers are beneficial and consequential. Computers are beneficial because they offer entertainment, are informational, and are super useful. I enjoy all the cool videos on YouTube while older people might watch the news. You can also send mail. It is much simpler compared to sending an ordinary envelope. Waiting for days or even weeks depending on where you live, but with e - mail, it can get there in a matter of seconds. Big differences, right? People who depend on computers can upload important information for all the people on islands of the poles, and the army uses the internet on their computers to control special equipment like @CAPS1.A.V. for the army or everyday monitoring systems for a police officer. I myself use a computer to research school subjects like math and history. But computers aren't all good; people abuse it. Some people can hack into other computers and steal important information and make your life miserable. It can affect your home. Online players spend countless hours playing. It can make you a game - addict, spend less time with your friends and family. They play so often that they might need glasses. Computers may completely replace newspapers as they offer more up - to - date and diverse information, but we should also be cautious of their negative impacts and use them responsibly.
234	234	1	3	Many people think that computers are not a good thing. They think people spend too much time on the computer and are getting less exercise. They are also concerned that looking at the screen could be damaging to your eyes. Those statements may be true. I believe that computers are beneficial. You can talk to people from other places. You could learn about other places in the world. You can also use the computer to research topics. First off, on the computer you can talk to people. Whether it's on a webcam or one of those networks to @LOCATION1 and chat with each other. On the computer, you can chat and talk with people without having to be on the phone and paying a bill for it. For example, I have family in another country, and one way we always talk is on the computer. We talk on webcam and chat. Calling someone from another country on the phone gets really expensive. If I didn't have a computer, then I would not have such great contact with my family from another country. In addition, you can use the computer to look at foreign countries. Many people, including my parents, have used the computer to look and read into about other countries. My mother, whenever she plans a vacation, looks up the country we are going to and gets more information about it. Like on @DATE1 we went to a hot exotic place, my mom looked it up to see what we should pack to go there. If it weren't for the computer, we might have packed the wrong items. Lastly, computers are a great source for researching. I can't tell you how many times I have used the computer to research. Books and encyclopedias are great sources, but the computer has so much to offer. You have so many links you can go to and sites. You can find pictures, videos, maps, and much more. I have used the computer many times to research. Sometimes it's a requirement to have a few sites you have gone on to research for your project in school or something. If you have a computer at home, you can build up your computer skills for school. Computers are a more positive thing than negative. You can talk to people without the expensive phone bill. You can learn about other places and cultures. Also, you can use it for researching purposes. Computers truly enhance our lives by facilitating communication, knowledge - acquisition, and research, making the world a smaller and more accessible place.
235	235	1	3	To whom it @MONTH1 concern, I feel that computers are great in most people's lives. One, you can use them for almost everything. Two, computers are good for you in many ways. It shouldn't affect your daily schedule or just being with your family. People can use computers for almost everything. For one, there are hundreds of websites on the computer. For example, you can play games of all different kinds, you can also chat with people, listen to music, watch videos, look for places, and a whole lot more. Computers are very useful in many different ways. Computers are also good for you. They help with your eye coordination. You can also go online and do practice on math, social studies, etc. The internet also has a lot of educational games, which is good for people who need that extra help. It also helps you with your hand coordination because on the computer you need to know how to type. If you get really good at it, you can type without looking. A computer can not get between your daily schedule or what you do with your family. Because a computer is a computer, you go on it if you need something or you go on it just for fun. For example, I have a computer at my house, and someone goes on it everyday, and it never affects what everybody does. We kids still go to school, my parents still go to work, we eat dinner together, we do what we have to do, and the computer never gets in the way. As my conclusion, I know that computers are good to have in people's houses. One, you can use them for almost everything, from work - related tasks to entertainment. Two, computers are good for you, improving your skills and knowledge. Three, it shouldn't affect your daily schedule in any way, as long as you use it in a balanced manner.
236	236	1	3	Dear newspaper people, I think computers are truly wonderful tools. Consider this: what if I have a family member who goes out of town, and I want to stay in touch, but I don't have a phone? Then I can simply go on a chatting website and stay connected with them. When I'm bored, I often go on Google to look up pictures and play some fun games. You can look up one thing and find something else that will catch your eye. Computers are useful wherever you go; they can help you look up information for a school project. When you're in school, they can assist you with spelling. And if you need to know which country has the most people, the computer will find the answer as fast as a snap. Computers are advancing every year. At first, the computer was just a screen and a mouse, but now we have laptops that you can take everywhere. People can exercise if they want and enjoy nature while bringing a laptop. And when you're exercising, you can go right to YouTube and listen to some music and watch funny videos. And that's why I firmly believe computers are good.
237	237	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I am writing this letter to clearly state my opinion on the effects computers have on people. And there are three significant ones: @CAPS4 theft, cyberbully, and addiction. Now I will write one paragraph about each. My first reason why I feel that computers have bad effects is @CAPS4 theft. Many people in the @CAPS5.S.A have their identities stolen for listing private information online (via computer), which can leave that person in a huge amount of debt. How can we encourage people to use computers when they're at the risk of getting their @CAPS4 stolen? If this is happening to innocent people, it definitely needs to stop. We mustn't encourage this online behavior, so say no to computers. I understand it really is interesting to learn about people from different countries, but there are some cons. Talking online to people you don't know and have never seen or met in person, they can pose as someone famous and bully you for their own enjoyment. It has been proven that when children, even adults, get cyberbullied, it can lead them down the path of depression and even suicide. Now I find it quite feeble - minded to give up your life for a computer. So again, I say no to computers. My last reason why I say no to computers is because people become addicted to the excitement of the computers, which eventually leads to the division from friends and family because you're lost in the computer world. Also, you forget about your hygiene, and some people even forget to eat. This thing they call a computer is a drug, a drug that makes you forget about reality and everything else you used to think of and brings you to computer land. And I say no to computers. I have given you my opinion and three supporting reasons why I feel the way I do, which were @CAPS4 theft, cyberbullying, and addiction. Say no @NUM1 computers. In conclusion, the negative impacts of computers are too severe to ignore, and we should be cautious about our computer usage.
238	238	1	3	Dear Newspaper, I strongly agree with experts on computers. Those who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people. They say that computers teach us hand - eye coordination, give people the ability to learn from faraway places, and even allow people to talk with others online. These effects are true, but there are many other bad effects that they don't like to mention. Computers also affect people's vision as you are really close to the screen for long periods. Computers are really addicting for many people all around the world, and this leads to them doing barely any exercise, moving many people towards a big problem nowadays, which is obesity. Computers also tend to take a significant amount of time away from people's lives. The way I see it is that although computers have some positive effects on people, you can achieve those positive effects in a better way that can keep you fit and allow you to see places with your own eyes. For example, you can get practice with hand - eye coordination by simply getting a friend and passing tennis balls back and forth quickly, so at the same time you're exercising too. Also, a computer can have you talk with your friends online, but why not talk to them by phone if they're far away and go outside and catch some fresh air? And if they live close by, why not talk to them in person instead? Or if you want to learn about a certain far - away place, why not visit the place instead? There are many things you can do that a computer can do, and do better. But yet I'm not saying a computer is all bad at all. I agree that there are both good and bad effects to computers, as well as most things in the world we live in. In my opinion, I honestly think there are more bad effects than good effects for computers. So, we should be more aware of the potential harms when using computers.
239	239	1	3	I personally think that people should not spend so much time on the computer. One clear reason why people shouldn't spend so much time on the computer is because people spend too much time on them and not enough time exercising. Another reason is that people aren't enjoying nature. Finally, my last reason is that people are spending less time interacting with family and friends. My first reason why people shouldn't spend so much time on the computer is because they are spending more time on them than exercising. People will end up getting fat if all they do is sit around on their computer. People should be running or going to the gym instead of going on the computer. Even if you have your own exercise equipment at your house, it's still better than going on the computer and not getting any exercise at all. If people spent as much time exercising as they spend on the computer, then the average weight of a human will go way down. Another reason people shouldn't spend so much time on the computer is because people are spending less time enjoying nature. People should be outside getting fresh air instead of being inside on the computer all day. I personally would much rather be outside playing baseball and getting fit than being inside on the computer getting fat. Even if you look at nature via computer, it still won't be the same because you actually aren't outside experiencing it yourself. If people would spend as much time enjoying nature as they are on the computer, we would be living in a much more healthy and clean world. My last reason why I think people spend so much time on the computer is because they are spending less time interacting with family and friends. People could be in a dark room all day, isolated from everyone they care about just because they are on the computer. That to me just isn't right because they're missing out on spending quality time with their friends and family. Instead, they are spending time with their computer. If a person spends all their time on the computer, then everyone they care about will gradually be slipping away, even if they don't know it. So as you can see, it would be much better if people spend more time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends than spending more time on the computer. Even if you don't spend a lot of your time on the computer yet, you will gradually spend more and more time on it every day until eventually it's all you do. Therefore, we should make a conscious effort to limit our computer time.
240	240	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, This is a letter telling you my opinion about computers. Yes, people do spend a great deal of time on computers, and it's because computers are very helpful in numerous ways. Computers assist us with our job, school, work, etc. For example, in the field of science. I'm in @NUM1 grade. My teacher @PERSON1 gives us homework; every @DATE1, we have to do @ORGANIZATION1, which are @NUM2 facts about anything you want to write about. A lot of people look up bears on @ORGANIZATION2 and then do their assignment about bears. In terms of jobs, secretaries always have to use computers for everything. In our school, secretaries and teachers use computers for attendance, grading. They check your attendance, grade, phone number, and schedule. Regarding communication, my dad uses the computer to connect with our family from @LOCATION1. We talk to know how they've been and to know what's new. Like a week ago, I was chatting to my cousin, and she told me her dog had @NUM3 puppies. My family also uses the computer to order things. My uncle went to ticketmaster.com and he ordered two tickets for WWE. He also orders his flight tickets on his computer to go to @LOCATION1. Well, my point is people use computers a lot because they are very helpful in many ways. However, it's not good to just be on the computer all the time. It's good to go outside, enjoy nature, live your life, and exercise, not only to be in shape but for your health. @CAPS1, I hope you enjoy and understand my opinion on computers. Thank you for taking your time and reading; I really appreciate it. In conclusion, while computers are useful, we should balance our computer use with real - life activities.
241	241	1	3	Dear local @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS1 of @LOCATION1, lately I have been noticing that some of the citizens of @ORGANIZATION1 have been spending a good amount of time using computers and laptops. Some people say that @CAPS2 is a waste of time that could be spent enjoying time with family and friends, especially those who live far away. However, @CAPS2 helps with research and learning about @ORGANIZATION1 - related things. It also helps people relax. In modern times, some who disagree enjoy their family and friends from afar. But when family and friends live far away, it's not easy to talk to them in person. There's always the option of calling them or writing a letter, but email, Facebook, and @ORGANIZATION2 are easier to use. When you call, you don't know if their phones are busy, or if they're in a bad mood. @CAPS2 might take time, but it's better to send a message and know you've made the effort. @CAPS2 also helps in advertisement and sales. Sometimes it may be unreliable because anybody can change anything on the site. Not all things online are like that though. Stay away from scams and such; they will come your way. Some people find the internet @CAPS2 a great escape from work or other stress. There are fun games and ways to talk to others. In research, the internet helps @PERCENT1 of people relax and calm down after a long @CAPS5 when on the computer or laptop, which helps with stress. Computers can help in many ways, and there are other reliable things available too. Plus, wherever you go, you will find the internet. In conclusion, while there are drawbacks, the benefits of using the internet via computers and laptops are significant and should be utilized wisely.
242	242	1	3	"Dear Newspaper, In our town, an increasing number of people are on the computer each day. Some people state that you can do a lot on the computer and talk to people. But, I firmly believe that our town should not support excessive advances in technology. By reducing computer time, you will have more time to exercise, talk to family and friends in person, and take part in different activities around the town. Do you want to be overweight and out of shape? Well, if you sit at the computer all day every day, you will likely become like that. ""I think exercise should be a part of everybody's day,"" @CAPS1 teacher @PERSON1 from @LOCATION1 stated. You would become so attached to your computer that you wouldn't work out. In the state of @LOCATION1, it is proven that @PERCENT1 of residents are overweight from not exercising, and @PERCENT2 are overweight due to not eating properly. This shows that more people in @LOCATION1 don't exercise than don't eat properly. No one wants to be overweight, and you can change that! More people each year create Facebook and @CAPS2 @CAPS3 accounts. Some kids in school are on the internet all day talking to friends who live down the street. Students refuse to talk to their friends on the phone. Instead, they do it online. ""You can't always understand their tone of the message sent,"" @PERSON3 stated. You could interpret it in different ways. When you are on the phone, it is a quick and easy way to communicate without waiting for somebody to type back. If you are a person who is always on the computer, plan a get - together with your friend to talk in real life. Sidewalk sales, clubs, sports teams, holiday strolls, these are events that every town offers! Instead of sitting dreaming of being on the team, go out and do it! Each town cares about its residents and wants them to have fun. That is why towns offer these activities. ""@CAPS5 want to make the town interesting and for everybody to know each other,"" says @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @PERSON2. If you participate in these activities, you will meet other kids your age around the town. If your town offers all of these activities, they are helping you out. Being out helping the town is way better than sitting in your house on the computer! In many ways, whether technology advances or not, it's better to be outside and interact in real - life. Being in shape, talking to people in real life, and participating in activities your town offers is the way to go. Thank you for your concern."
243	243	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, Have you ever thought about how your life would be affected if you did not have a computer? I strongly believe that computers have a great impact on people all around the world. They help you at work for a job and at school. Computers also assist students and adults in communicating with others. Many people want to go to different places but don't know what the place looks like or where it is. With a computer, you can easily find out all of that information. Let's read into the minds of the students and see what we have to say on this topic. Using a computer makes work at your job or school much easier. Just think, without computers, people would need to write every paper by hand, and we all know that can take hours. When you type a paper for school, you can use spell - check, and then you know everything is correct. If you write a paper by hand, there's a huge chance that some words could be misspelled. Work gets finished a lot quicker on the computer, so you have more time to do other things like hang out with friends. If you rush on a paper by hand, the people reading it will have a tough time trying to figure out what it says. On the computer, your work is always going to be neat. You can email your work to a friend or save it to your computer. So, if you need to change something for a paper, it will be quicker than having to rewrite the whole paper over. Computers do not affect me in a horrible way because they help me get my work done faster. Computers also help people communicate with others. By having a computer, people can easily talk to other people. In many schools, students ask their friends questions about homework. Without a computer, people would have no way of asking questions and might end up getting the answers wrong. I like to hang out with my friends, and in order to do that, you have to make plans. When you are on the computer, you can go on Facebook, and if your friends are online, you can talk to them about what they want to do that night. It is so much easier to do instead of looking up their number and calling them. Many people in the world have old friends from school that they want to stay in touch with. Now with a computer, they will have no issue doing that. You can finally look up a place you want to go. Many people in this world like to travel. On the computer, you can look up maps and see the shortest way to get to the place you want to go. You'll also see if the easiest way to get there might not be by car. I wouldn't want to go to a place that doesn't look appealing. Now I can just go on the website and find out everything I wanted to know about that place. If a place is @NUM1 hours away, I wouldn't want to travel that far, so I would need to know if a place is close to where I live. Computers really tell you a lot about it and what the weather is mostly like. I use the computer for mostly everything I do. Going through our thoughts has shown you what we think about the effects computers have on us today. We can make work a lot easier, talk to other people, and get information on places we want to visit. The computer is a very reliable source for me, and you'll miss out a lot if you don't agree with me on this. In conclusion, computers are an essential part of our lives, offering numerous benefits in work, communication, and exploration.
244	244	1	3	Dear @CITY1, Currently, I am writing to you about the issue of people spending too much time on computers and not being able to spend quality time with family, friends, and others. On one hand, people can get useful information off the computer, which is great for important papers or college essays. On the other hand, some people are becoming a bit lazy and not getting enough exercise or fresh air. Let me explain with an example about missing out on time with friends. Say your friends are planning on going to a huge beach party that everyone is going to. So you tell your friends to pick you up. But before they come, you go on the computer and start talking to someone you know. Your friends come to your house to pick you up, but you're not ready for them. They pass by, and you miss the party. The next day at school, they're talking about how you missed the great party. So, that's one story. Now, let me shorten the part about getting information on the computer. For example, let's say you're doing a paper. You just need more information. You find a good website, go on it, find good content, write it down, get off the computer, finish the paper, get a good grade, feel happy, and that's the end. So, that's the positive side of why computers are good. For some reason, some people want to stay inside on the computer, while others go outside on a good warm day. So, what's your reason? Is it MySpace, Facebook, or something else? It's good if you talk to other people, but it's bad if all you're worried about is whether your pictures are good. What matters is that you need to be happy. I think I've said all I could. So, those are my reasons why computers are both good and bad. They're good for research but bad because they lead to a lack of exercise and less time with friends. In conclusion, we should strike a balance between using computers for their benefits and spending time in the real world with others.
245	245	1	3	I believe computers are a significant benefit to society. Computers help improve hand - eye coordination when typing. Eventually, you get so good at it that you don't ever have to look down at the keyboard. Moreover, you can search for anything on the internet. If you want to learn about a country, you can search it and discover all sorts of new things you never knew before. Maybe you're planning a vacation to another country and can't decide which one to go to. You can go on the computer and look up tourist attractions in those countries to decide which area you want to visit. Also, if you're on vacation or live in a different place from your loved ones and want to see them, you can video - chat with them over the computer. These are the reasons why I think that computers are a benefit to our society. In conclusion, the advantages of computers in terms of skill - building, knowledge - acquisition, and communication are undeniable, making them an invaluable part of modern society.
246	246	1	3	"Dear editor, Have you ever yearned so intensely to know something that you can't focus on anything else? Have you ever tried to find that information and had that glorious ""ah-hah!"" moment? What did you use to search for this knowledge? Chances are, you used a computer. All you need to do is precisely type in your request, hit ""enter"", and voila! Your screen fills with a plethora of choices of information sites. Computers assist countless people with their everyday questions. Our country has become smarter because of computers. You can have engaging conversations with friends who have moved across the state, country, or even to the other side of the world. With every click of your mouse, there are new and exciting things to learn. You can even use the computer for your personal enjoyment. Computers have opened up so many opportunities that the world needs to embrace. When I was four years old, my best friends at the time moved to Florida. I was utterly devastated. At first, we tried writing letters to each other. Then, as we grew older and our schedules became busier and busier, our connection with each other came to a halt. As technology and computers have advanced, my friend and I text, e-mail, and instant message each other all the time. It has made our long - distance friendship easier and closer. Because of computers, you can communicate with friends you thought were long - lost. You can also meet new people on one of the many available sites. How would you like to have a lively chat with someone all the way down in @LOCATION2? World communication has also opened up numerous business opportunities. Since the economy is struggling, computers will create job spaces, help college students study for their future careers, and hopefully improve the lives of many people. Communication is essential for many aspects to make our world better for generations to come. Instead of going to a noisy arcade, why not play exciting games right in the privacy of your home? Any game you can think of can probably be found on the @CAPS1. From a simple game of solitaire to an advanced level of shift, games for any age and difficulty level can be discovered. Now, some people @MONTH1 think that all kids are going to do is sit in front of the computer and play games. There are going to be some people who will refuse to go outside, spend time with their friends, or just read outdoors. There will definitely be some people like that. I can't change that. What we can do is encourage those who refuse to go outside to do so. I know many people who manage and budget their time wisely and still have a great time. We can also encourage kids to use exercise programs on their computers and video games to improve their health. There are many fun games that help you become a better and healthier person while still having a blast. The computers we have in our homes right now are packed with so much information that if you tried to absorb it all, you would be completely overwhelmed. @ORGANIZATION1, a popular search engine, gives you the power to look up anything you could ever want to know, from the vice - president's birthday to the price of eggs in @LOCATION4 to how wide the @LOCATION1 is. All can be found with the click of a button. This knowledge is incredibly helpful for homework assignments. Most reference books are out of date and the information is inaccurate, but computers are updated so frequently that you have all the facts at all times. I firmly believe our country has gotten much smarter because of computers. So whether you want to talk to your long - lost friend in @LOCATION2 or consult an expert on osprey in @LOCATION3, you can find your answer on the computer. While you're at it, play a couple of exciting games and learn about the best movies ever released in @DATE1. Have a great time and learn a lot!"
247	247	1	3	Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, A large number of people are now using computers. However, everyone is entitled to their own opinion about them. Some people don't like them, and then there are people like me who whole - heartedly do like them. Computers can enable you to communicate at a much faster pace, you can play all sorts of games for free, and it provides a vast amount of information. Nine out of ten people love what computers can do for them. Unlike the traditional way of sending and writing letters to people, instant messaging is a far faster and easier way to talk to another person. Sending and receiving letters can take days or even weeks. On the other hand, instant messaging takes only a few seconds! Even better, it's free! Instant messaging is not the only way you can communicate with friends or family; there is also video chat. Video chat is just like talking on the phone, but you can also visually see the person you're talking to. You can be having a video chat with someone from another country, and guess what? It's also free! When you make long - distance calls, it can be quite costly, but video chat won't cost a single penny out of your pockets! Not only is a computer excellent for communication, but you can also play fun and entertaining games! Everyone enjoys playing games, whether you're a young child or an elderly person. There are numerous websites on the internet, and among them are game sites. Most game sites have virtual games that you can play online for free! There are one - player, two - player, and party games. This means you could play alone, with a friend, or with the whole family. Everyone can join in and have a great time. Also, computers can be used for both fun and work. They offer a vast amount of information. It's like having your own personal library at home at the touch of a finger! Whether you're doing research on a project, studying for an exam, or just want to be well - informed, the internet can help you with any subject. All you have to do is search for the topic you need, whether it's cooking a certain dish, learning about space, trying to spell a word, or anything you can think of, and it'll all be there for you, and once again, for free! In conclusion, computers are useful for numerous things, and these are just a few examples. I hope you think of computers the way I, and millions of other people, do. As you can clearly see, computers have improved the lives of many human beings.
248	248	1	3	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I believe computers are a new technology that keeps on getting better and better. It can do many wonderful things like help you learn something new and catch up with new or old friends. Even some people pursue online education. Also, what a lot of people like about computers is the wide variety of games. Computers are a great benefit to us and can be both useful and fun. The computer can teach us many new and exciting things. There is a vast amount to learn too. Some things you could learn about on the computer are different places around the world, famous people, various animals, unique plants, and delicious food, etc. I once had to find a recipe for caramel apples, and to do so I used the computer. Some people use the computer for their education. There are online colleges and online high schools. It's like a new way to be home - schooled. Not everyone can attend big @CAPS1, so it is much easier for them to use an online college. Also, let's say you're working on a project and you need information. Instead of rushing to the library, you can use the computer and quickly find it. There are many other things you can do on the computer, like visiting some friends. Everyone has friends, either new friends or old friends. Back then, before computers, if you wanted to talk to your friend, you would have had to send a letter. With a computer, you can now send a letter much faster than before. It's now called an email. You just type what you want and click ""send"" to dispatch it to your friend. Not all people use an email; some use instant messaging. An example of that would be AIM or Meebo. I moved from @LOCATION1 to here, and I have friends I don't get to see much. I bet there are many people that have the same issue. Well, with the computer, you can now see people! You can chat and see them. For instance, @ORGANIZATION2 is a great way to see your friends like that. It's an easy and fun way to stay in touch with friends and even your family. There is still more that a computer can do. Another thing it can do is play video games. They are so much fun to play, and what I'm referring to are video games that kids, teens, and adults all love. Whenever you're bored, you can go play online games. Or you can have games you purchased and play them. They are entertaining and fun too! Even very young kids can play games. Sometimes you can even play with your friends online in an online game. I know when I get bored, I go on the computer and play a game called @CAPS2 @NUM1. Computers are great, and there are plenty of more things you can do other than what I was talking about. I hope I have convinced you or shown you how computers are a benefit to us people."
249	249	1	3	"According to @PERSON1, an economic expert, every hour you spend on the computer, you raise your electricity bill by @MONEY2. The average @CAPS2 user spends @NUM1 hours on the computer every day. I believe that spending too much time on the computer could be a bad thing. You experience economic loss from the electric bill, health loss because you won't be able to exercise as much, and a loss in community interaction because you won't spend as much time with your community. Financial loss is a concern for many people. If everybody spent @NUM2 less hour on the computer, they could save @MONEY1 off their electric bill. In a survey, @NUM3 out of @NUM4 people said they would do anything to save money. So if they spent less time on the computer, they would save a significant amount of @MONEY1 money. In addition to financial loss, there is also a health issue. Many people are discussing how Americans are becoming obese. Part of this is due to spending too much time on the computer. Professor @CAPS3 of @ORGANIZATION1 says that, ""the obesity in @LOCATION1 is a serious problem. If people spent less time on the computer and more time exercising, that problem would be alleviated."" Currently, @NUM5 out of @NUM6 people are obese. If everyone spent @NUM2 less hour on the computer, it would reduce to @NUM1 out of @NUM6. Although health is a problem, the community aspect is a bigger one. People rarely talk to each other face - to - face anymore. They all communicate on @CAPS5 or @CAPS6. Communities are spending less time together in real life than on the computer. @PERSON1, an expert on human behavior, says that when people spend less time on the computer, they spend more time together. It's a well - known fact that when people spend more time together, they have more fun. So, I would say that spending less time on the computer would be beneficial to our community. It would provide financial, health, and community benefits. These are all important things that we lack if we spend too much time on the computer."
250	250	1	3	I do not believe computers benefit society. Many people spend a large portion of their lives on their computers instead of exercising, going out with friends, or spending quality time with family. @NUM1? A significant number of @CAPS1 will admit they spend at least @NUM2 hours a day on their computer, which is completely unnecessary. Why is there so much obesity in the world nowadays? Because of a lack of @CAPS3. And who is the #@NUM3 culprit? Computers, of course. In order for more people to maintain good health, there needs to be a lot of @CAPS3. When someone can sit around all day clicking a mouse or typing keys, how much @CAPS3 are they really getting? Plus, there are many different disorders in the world. @PERCENT1 of individuals will agree that with more @CAPS3, these sometimes painful disorders could be avoided. Too many people are choosing their computers over exercise, and it causes them many health problems that could've easily been avoided. Secondly, everyone would agree that friends are essential in life. But now people are talking to their friends online or in computer games instead of meeting them in person. Online, there is much more miscommunication which often breaks up friendships. Also, it's harder to meet new people or make as many new friends online. If you go out in the @CAPS2, you can make many more friends, which makes life in general much better. Finally, you wouldn't want families to fall apart, would you? Well, this is one of the many effects of excessive computer use. Family members get together less often, which could weaken them as a family. Plus, husbands and wives could not talk very often, often leading to separation or divorce. This could make a child have to choose between a whole family. @CAPS3, friends, and family are essential in life, and computers put those in jeopardy. So take a stand and end this negative trend for good. Stop the over - use of computers before it is too late.
251	251	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 I have learned that some experts say that people spend an excessive amount of time on computers when they could be engaging in physical exercise or spending quality time with friends and family. I, on the other hand, think otherwise. Computers are a great way to learn and communicate with others, here's why: First of all, I would like to say how much computers assist us in school. Most students utilize them on a daily basis. We can study for tests by searching for websites that are rich in information and we can also conduct research on topics that baffle us. For example, if you want to find out how planets form, you can simply type it into a search engine and a list of relevant websites will promptly pop up. Another way we use computers in school is when we have to create projects. We can employ different tools to set up an engaging slide show while also looking up information on the internet. Lastly, the internet is also a means for teachers to communicate with their students. If the teacher sets up a blog, students can always stay informed about what the class is doing, what the homework assignments are, and find useful links that will help them understand certain topics better. Another point I would like to mention is that the experts claim that computers deprive us of time with family and friends when the truth is, it's the opposite; computers actually take communication to a whole new level. For example, if you wanted to have a chat with an old friend, you could log right on to msn or aim and discover what's new in their lives. A second way to communicate with friends is by using @ORGANIZATION1, a cost - effective and easy way to contact friends outside the country. Next, you could go a bit more old - fashioned and just write an e - mail. It will take a bit longer to get a reply but it's still worth the wait in the end. Lastly, for parents whose kids live far away, video chat is also an excellent way to communicate because you will be able to see them and hear their voices as well. Lastly, I would like to tell you about just how much we can learn by using a computer. You could just go to a search engine and search any topic in the world and you're bound to find hundreds of results. It doesn't matter what your interests are because you'll always find great information. The internet also allows you to keep up with recent news such as the weather. Next, there are websites that enable you to ask questions and get answers just as quickly. You might have to check your sources to make sure they're reliable, but I believe it's still worth it. Lastly, if you are getting ready to go on a trip, you can check flight information with the click of a button. Or maybe you need to find out what the weather will be like; there are numerous websites for that. There are also websites that can help you learn about the place you'll be staying at as well. Next time, think twice about what you hear about computers because they really aren't all that bad for you. Sometimes it might be better to go outside and play but computers do help you learn and communicate with others which are just as important aspects of our lives.
252	252	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I also wholeheartedly agree that computers have a positive effect on people. I concur with this because the computer can educate people in various ways. Also, people can communicate with one another, and express or create whatever they desire. Computers have a positive effect on people because I firmly believe the computer can teach people a great deal. The computer can make complex things visually understandable for kids and adults alike. I know that when I was younger, I used to play math and science games on the computer to aid me in studying for tests. The computer also proves extremely helpful for adults in their jobs. I truly don't know what half the adults in the world would do without computers. If you think about all the jobs that are carried out today, many rely on the computer. Such as e - mail. What would some businesses do without e - mail? Also, adults like to check websites for the latest news and to catch up on sports. We can all learn so much from the computer, and there are so many people who perform their jobs on computers. We all learn something every day, and with the computer, we can make the learning process more interesting. Also, the computer facilitates online chats, e - mail, and now even with a webcam, you can talk face - to - face with people all over the world. I know e - mail helps out so many people who live long - distance, and e - mail doesn't take long at all. I know thanks to webcams and microphones that are built into computers, it has been a great help because now I can talk to all my friends and family, see them, and hear them without having to travel, just by simply clicking a button. There are websites now that offer the option of interacting with @NUM1 people online via webcam or microphone. Things like this help out so much. Some people just need to think about all those people who have relationships and such, and how computers really do assist them. Lastly, all the people who unleash their imagination through computers, all those people who pour their thoughts and feelings into the computer. I know plenty of people who type their feelings because they would never dare say them out loud. Now imagine if computers faded away? That's what I think about when people say such things as the computer not being useful. Everything is useful and everything has at least some sort of positive effect coming out of it. So, in my opinion, computers do bring out a positive effect to the world, enhancing our learning, communication, and self - expression.
253	253	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 do you think computers are good to use? More and more people are using computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. I strongly disagree. My first reason is because computers are not safe. My second reason is that computers could get you in a lot of trouble. My third reason is you never know what could happen on the computer. Read on and see why I disagree. First, I'm gonna tell you why I disagree. The reason why I disagree is because computers are not safe because you could have someone trace where you live. Then what? Second - computers could get you into a lot of trouble such as posting inappropriate things online or saying mean things to people. Next, computers are bad because if someone likes you and you say I don't like you, they could post mean and hurtful things, and then if your friends see it, you will probably get very angry. Finally - in conclusion, these are all my reasons why I think computers are not good. You never know what could happen on a computer; there are websites there, and some could start a virus on your computer. Also, I think computers are not good because computers often lead to no good. So keep your child away from computers. Also, be careful what you do on computers. In today's digital age, the potential risks associated with computer use are significant, and we should be vigilant to protect ourselves and our loved ones.
254	254	1	3	I walked into my living room. I saw my brother engrossed on the computer, chatting with his friends on facebook. I thought to myself, he's always on the computer, never for any school - related reason. People always say we don't need computers, and I personally agree with the statement. In the town of @ORGANIZATION1, almost everybody has computers. Without a computer to look up content, you have to go to the library and check out a book. Just the other day, my friend @PERSON1 went to the library and checked out a book about the @CAPS1 culture. He was completely engrossed in that book; he read it cover to cover. He read it for a book report on different cultures. When he handed it in to the teacher that day, when he reached the classroom, the teacher looked extremely happy. When she gave him back his test, he had an @NUM1. He didn't use the internet. Your computer is not as mobile as a book. If you wanted to learn about something while traveling in your car, you can't plug your computer in and use it, unlike a book. Also, books are usually more engaging to read. Not having a computer can lead to a lot more positive things like physical exercise. While my brother is inside all day, me and my friends are outside playing football, basketball, baseball, soccer, kickball, and dodgeball. We are very thin because of the physical activity we do almost every day. Unlike my brother, who is obese because all he does is sit on the computer. Before he had the computer, he was as thin as us. It is also unhealthy to be on the computer all day because that can lead to staying up late at night, missing the bus, and also getting bad grades. Where when we are done with our games, we watch a little TV, then go to sleep to regain our energy. We usually have at least @NUM2 hours of sleep every day, which allows us to make it through school. We also make the right choices in food to eat to have more energy, such as fruits and vegetables. Whereas my brother eats all the junk food, which has contributed to his obesity. Not having a computer can help you spend more time with your family. When we go out to eat, my brother is always in a rush to get back on the computer, and he doesn't let us enjoy our food. He is so much in a rush that he picks off of other people's plates so they would be finished faster, when everyone wants to savor their food. When we want to go out to the movies, my brother stays home on the computer. Even if we buy a movie and watch it at home, he won't watch it with us. He's on the computer. It really makes my mom, dad, brothers, and sisters angry that he won't do anything but play on the computer. It's like he's not part of the family anymore. It's like he forgot we were even there. That's the reason why I think computers should be used with caution. If not, it can lead to many negative consequences like obesity, bad grades, and a lack of family togetherness. So, if you want a healthier, more balanced life, consider reducing computer use.
255	255	1	3	Dear Newspaper editor, Computers have been a remarkable advancement in technology, but some people think otherwise. It is regarded as a great thing to have by some, but others think it is a hazard to health. I think it is an excellent thing to have. I have come up with three reasons to support my opinion. Computers help you keep in touch with distant friends and/or family, they assist you in research, and they even enable you to do shopping. Firstly, if you have any relatives or friends who live far away, computers offer websites such as aol or facebook & myspace that you can use to stay connected with them. Most of these platforms are free to create an account, so you don't need to worry about monthly bills for using them. So this is a far better option than driving long distances and paying for gas just to visit them. Computers even come equipped with webcams for video chat. With video chat, you can see each other in real - time and talk at the same time; that's truly amazing. Secondly, you can search the web for research purposes. If you have a project and you need more in - depth information than what books can provide, then just use search engines like google or ask.com. You can easily find the detailed information you need. All this takes is just a couple of minutes, which is a lot more efficient than spending an hour or more reading through multiple books. Lastly, if you really want or need something, just shop online. For example, if you find a really cool toy that you want to buy for your daughter or son, but it's not available in stores, then you can buy it off the internet. They even offer fast shipping of your item. I really like buying off the internet. When I really wanted a bike, I saw my mom end up getting it for my birthday through an online purchase. In conclusion, computers are extremely handy. Whether you need information, want to talk to someone, or have something to buy, computers have got you covered. I use computers a great deal in my daily life. I firmly believe they are very beneficial to have, enhancing our connectivity, knowledge - seeking, and shopping experiences.
256	256	1	3	"Some of you in @MONTH1 agree that computers don't keep you fit or we spend too much time on them. However, they can help you keep in touch with friends and family, meet new people, and save information efficiently. Without these important technology devices, we wouldn't be able to do any of these things conveniently. Most families live all over the country, and in @MONTH1, they may even be in another country. You don't get to see them very often because of high traveling prices. However, with the computer, they can help us keep in contact with them very easily and quicker than you can say ""@LOCATION1."" Moreover, more people make a website that allows us to easily keep up with our distant family. Facebook, @CAPS2, @CAPS3, @CAPS4 of fish, and singles net are all sites that you can find friends or the one that's right for you. This gives you a chance to discover @CAPS1 people with the same interests as you. Half of my mom's boyfriends were from these sites. Without these sites, there might be less divorces and more happy - ending fairy tales. @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people work from home. It's good as you can get things done. Many people have papers and lots of important information that could be lost in a blink of an eye. With technology like this, they can save it with just a click of that mouse. More businesses are being held at their households because of this easy - going technology. Exercise is still important. With a touch of a button, I could talk to my aunt, find the right one for me, and save my whole life's data. New technology like computers can change the world and help us do things faster, but we should also balance it with other aspects of life."
257	257	1	3	"Dear Local Newspaper, My opinion on the fact of the computer is that it can be bad for the citizens in @LOCATION2 in @LOCATION1. I think that some people are not getting enough exercise, and I also think that getting lazy on the computer is bad too. My three reasons for this opinion are as follows. First, people are not getting enough exercise. I pick that reason because people I know gain a lot of weight. It's kinda sad because they do nothing but stay on the computer and eat junk food. Another detail is that the computer messes up your eyes by staring at that type of screen for long hours. One time I did that, and my eyes felt weird after getting off the computer. The third detail was that people get very fragile and weak. I picked that detail because if you get up off the computer and try to exercise, your bones will become weak due to lack of regular physical activity. The second reason is because people will become lazy and change. For example, people will keep asking you to get stuff and do stuff for them, and you would do it because you're a good friend. The second detail is that the person will change; they will be too lazy to go to fun events with you as a friend. Eventually, you won't have a friend anymore. The third detail is that it's like your best - friend has replaced you for a computer. That hurts if a person you know for a long time has replaced you for a computer. That's something that will make you depressed and make you wanna commit suicide, at least to me. The third reason is because the person will get addicted to the computer. For example, you want to celebrate a birthday, and the person says ""first I got to beat this level."" Once the person says that, they're not going to get off the computer easily. Another detail is that their day will pass fast, and that's like wasting days of life. People who died would do anything to get their life back, and to waste it is not good. The third detail is you will begin to hate the person because the person doesn't care about anything but the computer. Those were the reasons to explain my opinion on the computer fact in the newspaper I read, and we should be aware of these negative impacts."
258	258	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, Spending too much time on the computer is never a good thing, whether you are doing work or things for pleasure. I strongly believe this because being on the computer too long will mean that you are spending less time exercising, interacting with real family and friends rather than on the internet, and being on the computer too long can ruin your vision. Nowadays, with all the great advances in technology, people are always glued to computer screens. Let's face it, once you go on the computer, it can get pretty addicting with all of the fabulous things you can do. When we get addicted, we don't feel like doing other things like exercising. Studies show that @PERCENT1 of the kids who use his or her computer for more than @NUM1 hours a day are obese. The cause of this problem is obvious: kids being addicted to computers. Since they are so addicted to computers, they do not want to go to the gym or engage in any physical activities. Another example is that in school, kids have a choice of what electives they want to take. Many kids would rather choose the computer programming class rather than physical education. This also cuts down on their exercise time. Computers are wonderful things, but when it starts affecting your health and physical fitness, they are enemies. Interacting with others on the computer can be looked at as a positive, but it is not since it affects the way you interact in real life. For instance, some people develop a habit from only interacting through the computer that makes them anti - social in real life. Furthermore, some kids can be the most pleasant people to interact with through the computer, but then when you meet them in real life, they are the quietest people in the world. This happens because they are more comfortable interacting through the computer. Also, they have lost their abilities to interact in real life. Interacting through the computer is great if you have family and friends in other countries, but you shouldn't do it so much that you become uncomfortable to interact in real life. Your eyes are one of the most important parts of your body besides the vital parts. Most people do not know this, but being on the computer too long puts strain on your eyes, which is bad. This strain only leads to unpleasant things. For example, if you are addicted to computers, then there is a large chance you will get glasses someday in your life. A recent poll was taken, and over @PERCENT2 of people who use their computers for more than @NUM2 hours a day have gotten glasses. In conclusion, we should limit our computer use to maintain a healthy lifestyle.
259	259	1	3	"As time goes on, our society becomes more advanced with more and more unnecessary technology, such as the television. What I really want to write about is the computer. Society today has developed a very unhealthy habit, and it is always using the computer. Everyone in the twenty - first century uses a computer. The world got so used to having the computer around that if all the computers in the world were to ""break,"" then most people probably would not know how to function properly. Like the basic theory of Y2K, which was that the world was ""@CAPS1"" to end back in the year two - thousand because everyone thought that the world was going to end only because the computers were going to crash and lose all the data that we have ever recorded. Humanity relies way too much on the computer. Since many people rely on the computer to work, study, or just pass time, a lot of people ""forget"" to exercise! Our body needs exercise to live. Exercise is one of the most important activities in our daily lives. When you don't exercise and all you do is eat junk food and drink sugary beverages today, you better bet on your mother's grave that you're going to either get diabetes, the flu, heartburn, or any other sickness or disability. You are what you eat is what I say. Life already has enough distractions in it, why add another distraction? All the computer is, is a distraction from keeping you and everyone else healthy. The computer started off as an ""innocent"" invention. Now a days, people literally worship the computer like it is a @CAPS3. People who use the computer all day every day end up becoming very lazy because all they want to do is sit down and use the computer. In my opinion, everybody should be a part of some physical activity. Whether it is basketball, football, baseball, track, tennis, or my favorite thing to do, skateboarding. Everyone should get physically active at least three times a week for many reasons. The fact is, that if you exercise three times a week at the least, your body will function better, you will look better, and you will feel better. Exercise can be fun, as long as you make it fun. I hope this essay has really made you think about how you want to live. Exercise should be a huge part of your daily routine, not sitting on your butt all day searching for pointless videos on ""youtube."" We should strive to balance our use of technology with physical activity for a better life."
260	260	1	3	Over one million people are on the computer daily. I think being on the computer is unhealthy. So many people abuse themselves by staying on it too long. You should manage a time schedule so you can still get exercise and only use the computer when needed. One main effect that I see is many people play on the computer too long and are becoming overweight. This can be stopped if we all join together. One person isn't going to change anything, but many of us will. We can be like huge, dangerous predators going for the prey, in this case, the bad habit of excessive computer use. If there is something else to do besides play the computer, do it. If you know you're overweight from the computer, you can make a change. If you keep doing other activities, you can get skinny again easily. You just have to make that type of change. A serious issue is people don't wanna take time to make a quick little chart to manage computer usage. The way I see it is if we make a chart, then we will know when to get off and when to play. This is important because some people take in information better when they have it in front of them. This could make some satisfying results. People use the computer for school work. This is good depending on how long it takes. In my opinion, people shouldn't be on the computer for more than @NUM1 hours to @NUM2 hours a day. I think people should get their schoolwork done and get off. I much rather see kids outside playing. The nature and wildlife are much more important. The effects that the computer puts on us can vary, from getting overweight to not spending time with families, to the time spent on schoolwork. You need to use your time wisely to avoid the negative impacts of excessive computer use and lead a healthier life.
261	261	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I believe many people spend too much time on computers. It is okay to be on a computer for twenty minutes to half an hour. However, one hour or more is too long. People could get sucked in by playing addictive games. Also, through online chatting services like Facebook, MySpace, instant messaging, and more. Another way someone could spend more time on a computer is working on a report. They might start it at the last minute. These are just some of the many ways someone could be sucked into their computers. Have you ever hopped on the computer and played a game? Then you look at the time and it's an hour later. Games are very addictive. You can play a game for hours and not notice how much time has passed by. Games are very fun, but they can fry your brain. @PERCENT1 of the human population spends up to an average of two hours on a computer each day. I think we should eliminate some games off the internet so people can spend days exercising and hanging out with friends instead of playing silly games. Have you ever started a conversation with someone and realized you have been talking for an hour and a half and that you have homework? @PERCENT3 of teenagers on average spend three hours each day chatting with friends on the internet. Facebook, MySpace, instant messaging are all examples of this. It is okay for someone to talk to their friends, but you need to watch the time so you do not get carried away. I think we should cut down our use of these websites so children and teenagers can get their homework done. Have you ever been assigned a report and waited till the last minute to get it started? Many teenagers do this. They wait and start their reports the day before their reports are due. They then are stuck on the internet for hours trying to get it done, which makes their grade lower than if they were to start it earlier. @PERCENT2 of students wait till the last minute to do their reports, and on average, they spend over four hours on the computer. I think we should make sure that students start their reports earlier so it could bring up their grades. In conclusion, I believe people have spent way too much time using computers due to games, internet chatting, and reports being done last minute. I think if we eliminate games off the internet, cut down use on internet chatting, and start reports earlier, people will start exercising, hanging out with friends and family, get homework done, and get higher grades.
262	262	1	3	Do you think being able to look up information on anything or talk to people that are far away is good? With a computer, these are some things that you will be able to do. Being able to talk to anyone that is far away is beneficial. Some people have family in other countries that they have not seen in a long time, and with a computer, you can have face - to - face conversations with them. For instance, @CAPS1 the people we have sent to @ORGANIZATION1, they have a family here and I have heard of them using computers to talk to them because they miss them dearly. Also, if you live in an area that gets bad weather and you can not go anywhere, a computer can help pass the time. For example, @CAPS1 the people that live in the @CAPS2, they can get a lot of snow during the winter time and @MONTH1 have to stay inside. So if they have a computer, they are able to do things like play some games or watch some interesting videos to pass the time. Another thing a computer is good for is that you are able to search for anything. You are able to learn about faraway places even if you have never been there just by looking it up on reliable websites. Some kids do have some trouble with some homework, but they can use a computer to learn some more about it and hopefully they will now understand how the work is supposed to be done instead of going to the teacher tomorrow and telling them that they did not do it. There are my opinions why computers have a positive effect on people. By being able to search anything, help children with homework, and pass the time if you have nothing to do, computers prove to be useful tools in our daily lives.
263	263	1	3	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 minute of the day - millions of computer users around the world hop onto their laptops or desktops, but is it always a good thing? The question has been raised if people spending a lot of time on computers is a bad thing. Computers are a bad thing because people spend too much time on them and lose quality time with friends and family. There are also the dangers of online interaction and the risk of having your information stolen. Countless people around the world face these problems every day and computer usage should be lessened. Whether teens, kids, or adults are gaming, on websites or typing essays, people around the world spend way too much time on their computers. For example, of the @PERCENT1 of people who have computers with online access, @PERCENT2 of them spend @NUM1 hours a day on them. This is about @NUM2 billion hours of computer usage around the world. Children and adults alike have lost face - to - face interaction with other human beings. Before computers, kids played outside, running and playing around. While in present day, less than @PERCENT3 of all children get at least one hour of time outside. Computers are not a bad thing, but when they are over - used, they become hurtful to kids' health. These facts have not just contributed, but they are almost the cause of obesity in the world. Computer usage needs to be cut down to size if we are to solve these problems. The addition of online chat to computers has not only increased computer usage but doubled it. The invention of @CAPS2 and instant messaging was never meant to be a bad thing, but it sure did turn into one. Online chat allows people to send hateful and vulgar messages to their enemies without showing their face. In some cases, some teens were harassed online so badly they committed suicide. Another bad thing about @CAPS2 or @CAPS3 is that dangerous criminals can hide behind their computers and lure children or teens to a meeting place where they can be kidnapped. @NUM3 out of @NUM4 users of online chat was lured by a criminal to a ""meeting place"" and was kidnapped and never seen again last year. Most of these victims do not return or are found. Although the invention of chat online was meant as quick and easy communication, it became a horror crime in most cases. Millions, even billions of dollars have been stolen by internet hackers. These hackers break the security codes and buy things online using other people's money. Four out of five people admit to having multiple sites with personal information on them, and @NUM5 out of those four people have had at least one account hacked. This problem continues to grow and hackers feed off of weak sites. If this problem continues to grow, the whole world will be in financial trouble. Internet usage needs to be cut down. If we do not, then usage will increase, there will be more chat - related problems, and people's money will keep getting stolen."
264	264	1	3	Dear editor, @CAPS1 what do you do all day? The answer to that would probably be sit down in front of @ORGANIZATION1 a computer all day. My friends say that this is very unhealthy. Research has proven it, and my mom has had experience with the negative impacts of computers. This is not only unhealthy for people but also for our environment. @PERCENT1 @ORGANIZATION1 my friends say that computers are a waste of time. Most people who interact on the computer all day don't have a stable diet or even a good exercise routine. They say that all the junk food kids and grown - ups accumulate in their daily life while sitting in front of a computer is unhealthy and will never go away unless they get up and move. They also say that without exercise, our country will be filled with overweight people. Dr. @ORGANIZATION1 has done extensive research and has proven that computers are bad for you. @PERSON1 has gone all over the country to talk to people, and he specifically stresses that more people should get out and enjoy the nature. But instead, they are sitting in front of @ORGANIZATION1 a computer, which is not good for them. He's taught people that @PERCENT2 @ORGANIZATION1 the time if you get out and have fresh air, your life will be so much better both physically and mentally. My mom has had experience with computers and assures me that when she was younger, you couldn't just sit there and not get out. She says that it's important to interact with your family and friends so you keep a stable relationship. Talking to your family will keep them in touch with @CAPS1's going on in your life, and hanging out with your friends will help you have a more fulfilling life outside of your household. She says any kid who does sit in front of @ORGANIZATION1 a computer all day should be disappointed in themselves. Editor, you've done a wonderful job since you've taken the job! So, I feel that if you stress the point in your next newspaper about not relying on computers all the time and always exercising like my friends say, following the research to enjoy your nature, and interacting with your family and friends as my mother says, it will be very beneficial. I'm sure your next article will be a great source of information, stating facts and inspiring people to change their habits.
265	265	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2, computers. The subject of so many debates over the years, from lawyers against judges to parents against children. Could it be too much of a good thing? Are computers the cause of increased awkwardness in today's society? Certainly, it can't be good that your entire life is documented on a place where anyone can access it. And then there is the content of what you are viewing. I can't wait to get to that paragraph. One of the top @NUM1 picked - through subjects in the world is whether people are really less interested in exercise than they were in the @NUM2's. Studies show that in the @CAPS3 @CAPS4, @NUM3 out of @NUM1 people were overweight. That number has risen to @NUM5 out of @NUM1 as of @DATE1. It's amazing how this trend has developed. And some of these people might be safer staying inside, but not in a healthy way. If you've played a video game where the player can lose health, you'll know what happens when the bar runs out. You restart. After playing some high - octane, action - packed games like @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8 @CAPS9, @CAPS10 @CAPS11 @MONTH1 might be tempted to try that gravity - defying, head - turning stunt in real life. And let me tell you, there is no restarting after that. Did you know that @ORGANIZATION1 is recording everything you do online? If say, you are a budding guitarist and are looking around for a new Gibson, you'll start getting all these ads for online stores. Why? Because @ORGANIZATION1 sells your info to businesses. And you give them permission by clicking that continue with install button. So spam email starts to flood your inbox. But something even worse is on the way. Your bank account number. That's right, I went there. If a virus gets onto your computer, your money could vanish in an instant. So be responsible with your online activities. This brings us to our last subject, the touchy one. It used to be that you had to buy a magazine or book to witness the exploitation of young women. Now, it is just the click of a button away. And that is bad enough. Young boys are snagged early, and their futures are now at risk, controlled by this harmful content. But add to that the immense risk of a virus attack, and you're in a heap of trouble. So I'm not saying computers are terrible. Just that they could be too much of a good thing. Sometimes they can be a good way to relieve stress, like by taking it out on a hapless alien in a game. Just use the technology at your hands responsibly so that you can enjoy the benefits without falling into the many pitfalls.
266	266	1	3	"Dear Newspaper, I strongly agree that computers have affected people in a very positive way. Since more and more people have been using computers, the technology advances steadily and people can access a vast array of things. Computers are excellent because they are convenient, and offer a great deal of entertainment. Have you ever wondered what the capital of @LOCATION3 is, or what the weather is like in @LOCATION2? To find out these answers, all you have to do is look them up on the computer! The computer is so convenient that whenever you have a question about anything, you can turn to the computer! Take my cousin Courthey, for example. Every day, her teacher assigns definitions for homework. So, she simply looks up the definitions on the computer instead of spending time to find them in the dictionary. However, Courthey isn't the only person who thinks the computer is convenient. When surveyed, @PERCENT1 of people voted that when they have a question about something, the computer is the most convenient item to use. Professor @PERSON2, from @ORGANIZATION2 says, ""@CAPS1, since more people are learning how to use the computer, it is becoming more convenient for everyone."" In conclusion, many people rely on the computer for information, and you wouldn't want to take that away from them, would you? It's a @DATE1 @TIME1, and you're bored. What do you do? How about going on the computer! The computer is a great source of entertainment. Whether it's listening to music, playing games, or chatting with friends, you will always have a good time on the computer. For example, my neighbor, @PERSON3, comes home after school by herself. She is usually extremely bored, so she goes on the computer to play games and talk with friends. @PERSON3 can also talk to her cousins, @PERSON5 and @PERSON6, who live in @LOCATION1. But @PERSON3 is not the only one who talks to relatives on the internet. When surveyed, @PERCENT2 of people agreed that they talk to relatives from other places on the computer. Dr. @PERSON1, from @ORGANIZATION1 says, ""The computer is the main source of entertainment for most teens and adults."" @CAPS2, you wouldn't want to take away our main source of entertainment, would you? After school, many teens and adults rush to the computers for various reasons. But in conclusion, computers have positively affected all people with their amazing convenience and great sources of entertainment."
267	267	1	3	To whom @CAPS5 @MONTH1 concern, @CAPS1 the sheer joy of just clicking a mouse and suddenly you're talking with a friend you haven't seen in years. Computers make this a reality for us, but that isn't the only benefit they offer. Computers help society by providing us with powerful search engines and a wealth of educational resources, allowing us to connect easily with friends and family, helping us communicate important matters and plan things, and much more. First, computers have become a vital part of both education and research. Students at schools, from elementary through college, are able to access far more information than they could without computers. You can even earn a college degree on the computer! That's right, online universities are beginning to emerge. This is great for moms who want to get a degree but have to stay home with their children. Also, computer technology has been applied to research in science and hospitals. New discoveries have advanced with the help of computers, which will actually improve people's lives! Computers are used to search for a cure for cancer, predict disasters such as earthquakes, and even detect a disease someone has before its symptoms even begin to appear! Computers have helped save lives and benefit lives in ways people never could have imagined sixty years ago. Secondly, computers allow people to connect and reconnect with other people around the @CAPS2. I recently got a Facebook account, and within a few days, I had found and reconnected with three friends of mine who had moved away, a distant cousin who had moved to @LOCATION1 that I haven't seen since we were little, and even my great - grandmother! The possibilities are truly endless. Email has also been very beneficial to society as well, as @CAPS5 helps people communicate and plan events, which brings me to my next topic. Lastly, computers help the @CAPS2 communicate with one another. The internet is filled with websites made to benefit our @CAPS2, one being @ORGANIZATION2; @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4. If not for computers, this program wouldn't have been as successful and beneficial as @CAPS5 has become. Also, there is an amazing website that combines education with the aspect of @CAPS2 @CAPS5. It quizzes you on different levels of general knowledge, and for each correct answer, @ORGANIZATION1 donates @NUM1 grains of @ORGANIZATION1. When I'm bored, I sometimes go on it, and so far, I have filled over thirty bowls of @ORGANIZATION1 while learning at the same time! To conclude, computers have proven to benefit the @CAPS2 and all in @CAPS5, not only people but the environment, too. Computers help advance research, help people reconnect with one another, and help the @CAPS2 communicate. Who knows what computers will help us accomplish next?
268	268	1	3	Dear, @CAPS1 I would like to tell you something. Throughout the ages, we have been evolving, from cavemen discovering fire to humans learning how to fly. With evolution, we discovered technology, and in recent years, we have been developing new technologies at a rapid pace. Some say that some technology, like computers, is bad. I think that computers are good because they give you the ability to learn about far - away places, let you talk to people online, and teach hand - eye coordination. Computers let you go to places that you ordinarily wouldn't be able to visit. If you were doing a research project on @LOCATION1 and you didn't have any books, what would you use? That's right, a computer. The internet would have the facts you needed so you could get a good grade. While on the internet, you could talk to friends and family who @MONTH1 live far away. The computer can span long distances and connect both computers so you can exchange messages almost instantly. Without computers, you wouldn't be able to get in touch with these people. Using computers is good for the body as well as the mind. It helps you improve your hand - eye coordination. When you see things on the screen and reach to click it, you are actually training your body. Some people say that when you are on the computer, you aren't interacting with friends and family, but they are wrong. I myself have talked with my sister in a different room while using the computer, so the computer lets you interact with friends and family too! I love computers, don't you?
269	269	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, yes, I do believe that too many people are 'addicted' to the computer and spend far too much time on the computer every day! Not only teenagers but also children and the youth have fallen into the trap of the computer. As I grew up in my younger years, I hated the computer. All I wanted to do was go outside and play. As I became older, I used the computer way more often than I did before. I now believe the computer takes time away from family time, time to sit down and read a good book, and time for hanging out with friends. Instead of all those fun and interactive activities, people decide to go on Facebook, MySpace, Twitter, YouTube, addictive games, and whatever else they can find. I do not agree with being stuck to the computer like a mouse is to cheese. No! If there was one thing in the world that would keep parents and children together, it isn't the computer. Computers distract kids and teenagers from doing other things in life. Also, it doesn't allow families to truly be a family. Before computers were made, all people had was their family. Coming home from school, kids would say ""@CAPS3 dad, I'm home from school. Want to go play catch?"" Instead of that, kids come home from school to see if @CAPS4 replied to their Facebook message. Computers also cut off the interacting time that families always used to have. @DATE1 @TIME1, instead of talking to @CAPS5 on MySpace, why don't you grab a family board game and play! Or go out to a restaurant, talk about your next vacation and what you'd be interested in doing, go to the same field and have a game, or go to your local baseball field and play kickball, instead of sitting there mesmerized by the computer screen! Okay, I @MONTH1 understand that some people just @MONTH1 not like to go out and play or engage in physical exercise, and that is totally understandable. But that is still no excuse for sitting at the computer instead of reading a book. Reading is not only fun but also educational, even without being in school! As you read, your brain works its inner mechanisms, and you can learn new words so you can show off to your friends or family. It is shown that @PERCENT1 of students who read regularly perform better, unlike the @PERCENT2 who sit at the computer all day writing replies. In conclusion, the over - use of computers is having a negative impact on people's lives, especially on family relationships and personal development."
270	270	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 sun, I find that computers are very useful. They help people in many ways. They let people learn about what is going on in the world, teach hand - eye coordination, and let you meet people online. First, people can learn about what is going on around the world. I can find out what is happening in my local area by looking up your newspaper online. Other people can find out about places they might want to visit. They can find out what the weather is like so they know how to pack when going places. Also, if one of your employees is planning to go camping, they can look up a good place to camp and they can find out what kind of dangers there are when camping so they can avoid them. Because if they get sick, they can't work. As you can see, computers are important. Next, computers teach hand - eye coordination. Many jobs require you to be able to work well with your hands. Let's say one of your printers breaks down, so you call someone to come fix it. They must be able to work well with their hands to fix it. Now, let's say the wiring in your lights gets messed up. So you call an electrician. The electrician has to be good with his hands to be able to work with small wires. Both of these people are good with their hands, and they could have become that way by using computers. As you can see, computers are important in today's life. Lastly, computers let you meet new people online. Let's say you are all alone after a hard day of making newspapers. You could go online and meet new people in chat rooms and online games. Now, let's say that one of your employees just broke up with his girlfriend and he is sad and lonely, so he isn't working as well. He could go on an online dating site and meet the perfect girl. Now when he comes to work, he is happier and making more papers. And if he makes more papers, you make more money. As you can see, computers are very important. In conclusion, computers are wonderful machines. They can let people learn about what is going on in the world, teach people good hand - eye coordination, and let people meet new people online. They truly play a significant role in modern life.
271	271	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, I've heard about your problems with computers, and would like to state my opinion. I think that computers teach you more than they disable you. For example, say you have a research project and you need to look someone up. You simply go on the computer, and within seconds, you've got the information you need. Also, say you want to go far for vacation, like to @LOCATION1. You can go on the internet and find out how the locals live there, what the best attractions are, and even read reviews from other travelers. My last reason is that now you can be on the computer and still interact with family and friends. First, I stated the first one because a couple of weeks ago I had a social studies research project. But if I couldn't use a computer, then I would have had to use a book. Instead, I just went on the computer and quickly looked up the information. Another example could be like you need pictures to make the project look better. So you can go on Google and find a high - quality picture to go with your project. But that's not all the internet can help you with. Like say you've been planning a trip to @LOCATION1 for your honeymoon but never been there or know anything about it, and your honeymoon is just a month away. You can go on the computer and learn about the local culture, cuisine, and accommodation options. Also, now they have online classes and you can learn their language before you go. But to wrap it up, I have one more example. Lastly, chatting. Some people think because you're on the computer all day you can't interact with others, but you can. For example, there's a website called @ORGANIZATION1. You can chat with all your friends at once. Also, they have video chatting, so you can be looking right at the person while you're talking. All in all, computers clearly offer numerous benefits in various aspects of our lives.
272	272	1	3	"Dear Local Newspaper, I think Computers have a positive effect on people because it helps their education, you can talk to family and friends, and you can get better hand - eye coordination. Read on to find interesting details about computers and their positive effect. For the first reason, computers are positive is that it can help you with your education. I mean come on, how many college students do you see without a laptop? You see almost none. Am I right? You always need a computer because you have to type everything, and do in - depth research for big essay papers. People think ""well, there's always the library?"" But you're wrong. The local library closes at @TIME1 pm. I'm sure college students are up way later than @TIME1 doing homework. Just imagine, late at night, @NUM1 pm, no library, no computer, and a giant essay due tomorrow. What are you going to do? You better get yourself a laptop before the next giant essay comes! Moreover, even if you did go to the library, who wants to lug all of your books downstairs, drive to the library, and then finally get there and realize you forgot something. That's just a waste of precious time! Next, computers are positive because you can talk to your friends and family. For one, it saves a load of money because email doesn't cost anything! I have a @ORGANIZATION1! email and I don't pay a cent for it! With a cellphone, you have to buy the phone and pay the bill every month. Did you know the average American spends at least #@NUM2 each month on cellphones? It's outrageous. What if you never see a certain family member? I know my cousin just had a baby and her dad lives in @LOCATION1 @CAPS3. So, she got a webcam, and now every day they talk, and her dad gets to see the baby. They always talk about everything, from daily events to future plans. After I have just said all these wonderful things, you can't look someone in the eyes and say that computers don't help people. For the final reason, computers are positive because you could gain hand - eye coordination. My brother, @PERSON1, loves, and I mean obsessively loves, video games. He's addicted to them! He can't stop playing them, and I don't mind at all. I don't mind because now he can chew gum, jot down ideas for his essay, think about what he's gonna have for lunch, and play a video game. How's that for multi - tasking! Moreover, you will be healthier. Think about it, better reflexes, better hand - eye coordination, and a happier doctor! I mean seriously, if you play computer games you can have fun while knowing you're going to make your doctor happy. And who doesn't want to make their doctor happy! In conclusion, computers have a positive effect on you because they help your education, allow you to talk to your friends and family, and improve your hand - eye coordination."
273	273	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I think that computers have bad effects on people. The first reason why I think this is because people in the world are becoming less healthy. Kids and adults should stay active more. Kids and parents should only be allowed @NUM1 hours on the computer and then go outside. Computers are not so bad because it is helpful for looking up information, but it is harmful if you abuse it. Kids play games on the computers and it damages their eyes and makes them lazy. Also, when you go outside, there are lots of things to do. Instead of talking with your friend on the computer, you should call your friend, ask him to come over, and play games outside. If this continues, lots of kids will be fit and active. The second reason why computers are bad is because of what people post on the computer about other people. Do not ever put something bad up on the computer because sometimes they are deep secrets and millions of people will see it, and that person might be teased and laughed at. And really, the computer could do horrible things. If you and this person are friends, it could break your friendship forever. The final reason why the computer is not good is because people are dying from being overweight. There are several teams that are on commercials saying that kids and adults should get up and be active. If it weren't for these heroes, much more kids would die faster. When kids die, they look inside them and scientists found big fat chunks around the kids' hearts. Well, that's my theory. I hope all of you listen to my advice. Get up, shut the computer off, and get active. In conclusion, the negative impacts of computers on health, relationships, and well - being are quite evident, and we should take steps to limit their excessive use.
274	274	1	3	"Dear local Newspaper, @CAPS1, would you like to be warmly greeted by the unique culture of the zingbobway tribe in @ORGANIZATION1 @LOCATION2, say hi to a far - away family member again, or maybe quicken your reflexes? Well you can! Computers are a useful way for accomplishing these tasks. Imagine your family member or friend fighting in the war miles away. Wouldn't you want to see them at least once? Computers allow you to interact with them using webcams. You can see their expressions and talk with them as if they were right beside you. Not only can you talk with family, you can talk to friends. You can make new friends from around the world without leaving your cozy home. You can have a new best friend every day! Not only can you talk to people on computers, they give you better hand - eye coordination, and they quicken your reflexes. Dr. @PERSON1, @ORGANIZATION1, says ""Studies have shown that people who type or use a computer regularly have better reflexes than those who don't."" Having a computer around is also easier for school. I remember one time, I had to write a @NUM1 - page paper for @CAPS4 and it was due the next day. I wrote the beginning part of it and my hand started to cramp up. I had to finish my paper soon, so I ran to my computer and typed it in half the time I would've spent writing it. I also improved my hand - eye coordination in the process. Not only do you type on it, you learn on it. A large number of computers are used for learning about places and people. Say you just won @NUM1 free tickets to go anywhere in the world with a celebrity of your choosing! With a computer, you could research the destination thoroughly and make that trip the best days of your life. And even if you don't like actually going to other places, you can virtually go there on a computer. With computers, you can see the magnificent mountains of @CAPS5 @CAPS6 in @LOCATION1, the colorful tropical reef fish, or the ancient ruins of the @ORGANIZATION2. Computers hold the world at your fingertips. So as you can see, computers have a positive effect on people. They allow people to interact with others, increase your hand - eye coordination, and give you access to the world's knowledge and beauty."
275	275	1	3	Dear @PERSON1, Advances in technology and computers is a bad thing. When the computer companies such as @CAPS1, @ORGANIZATION2, and @ORGANIZATION1, make cool updates to their computer systems, people do not want to shut their computer off, which is not a good thing. As a child, did you spend all of your time indoors and online? Computers take time away from spending time outside, or exercising. And they affect very crucial family time. Computer advances are bad for our country and town. Now - a - days, kids would much rather spend time on their computers than outside. This can have a very negative affect. First of all, it is important that students see and feel nature. Last time I checked, they can not do that on a computer. Children need to see the beautiful animals in their natural habitat, smell the sweet scent of fresh flowers, and feel the gentle breeze brush against their cheeks. A second reason that going outside is important is for the sun. Even though the sun does have harmful days, it is still important for health that everyone spends some time in the sun. The computer takes time away from nature, which is unhealthy and dangerous. Computers also take precious time away from exercise. If people spend all their time on computers, then when do they exercise? Everyone is supposed to get at least @NUM1 minutes of activity daily, but no one ever seems to spend that much time working out. Also, obesity numbers have increased greatly since the invention of personal computers and the internet. Obesity can make life difficult for people and can also lead to various diseases such as diabetes and heart problems. Life with computers has led to less people exercising and obesity rates increasing. Another issue computers cause is that people are spending less time with their families. Family is one of the most important things in the world and everyone should spend a few hours daily with their family. Plus, with encouragement from their family, many students excel in school and sports, which gives them great self - confidence. Computers take time away from something that should be the most important to everyone, family. Many people are affected negatively by computers. The technology takes very important time away from children and adults. It takes time away from the outdoors, exercising, and family. Yes, computers sometimes make life easier, but they have a much more negative affect than they do a positive one. In conclusion, we should be more aware of the negative impacts of computers and find a balance between their use and other important aspects of our lives.
276	276	1	3	Dear local Newspaper, I firmly believe that computers are bad news. Most kids come home from a long day at school and immediately log on to AIM so they can chat with their friends. Shockingly, @PERCENT1 of @CAPS1 are obese. I genuinely feel it is far better to play outside with your friends than to just sit idly in a chair playing on the computer. If kids go outside and play with their friends, they will surely have a great deal more fun. Also, kids will learn how to interact with each other in a real - world setting by playing outside together. The kids will get to see more of nature and be able to learn more about the animals that inhabit it. When kids are on computers, they are just sitting there, not really doing anything productive. Also, some kids post inappropriate pictures of themselves on platforms like Facebook that can get them in a whole lot of trouble. They also say things on the computer that they wouldn't normally say to a person's face. The computer is simply a way for kids to get into trouble. When you're outside playing baseball, football or tag with your friends, you are getting good exercise and having a blast. If you are getting lots of exercise, then you are most likely not going to be obese. Some say the computer is good for hand - eye coordination, but catching a football or hitting a ball is much better. Also, some say computers can tell you about far - away places, but that's what school is for. I am clearly saying that exercise and playing with your friends in person is better than just talking to your friends or video - chatting with them. There are far too many overweight people in @LOCATION1, and the computer is not helping the cause. In conclusion, we should encourage kids to put down the computer and go outside to lead healthier and more fulfilling lives.
277	277	1	3	"Dear @LOCATION2 press, I wonder if you are aware that @PERCENT1 of people out of @NUM1 surveyed by the well - respected university out in @LOCATION1 agreed that using laptops and computers had a very good benefit on their life? I wholeheartedly agree that computers benefit society and our everyday lives. With a computer, you can interact with people all around the vast world. They can be extremely helpful with school work and make everyday life much easier. Five years ago, I had to move from the familiar @LOCATION4 to the new @LOCATION3. We had to leave all of our dear family and friends behind. However, thanks to this great technology, we could easily email them, instant message them, and have video chats with them, instead of having to fork out money to make long - distance calls. There are many people out there like me, who have friends and family far away, whether it's family in different countries, old schoolmates, or camp friends. Using a computer is an excellent way to keep in touch with one another. Using a computer can also make life a lot easier. A mom taking care of her kids might find it difficult to go to @CAPS1 & @CAPS2 when one kid is glued to his video games and the other is engrossed in their favorite @CAPS3 show. Thankfully, that mom can go online, pick the food she wants and the quantity, and get someone to deliver it. That mother also might not be able to get out and go shopping. So with her computer, she can go to her favorite store's website and pick the clothes she desires. And then when @CAPS4 comes, a computer can be a lifesaver, so she doesn't have to worry about not having enough time to go out. A computer just makes life that much simpler! Statistics show how people are helped online, whether instant messaging or going in - person. ""Computers are great. I can do my homework and know that if I need to write a planner, it's much easier on the computer. If I need more information, I can find a lot more of it on the computer from @CAPS5.com than I could find in my local library. You can find almost anything with search engines on your computer! Some people do disagree with the use of computers. Some also believe that some people abuse the benefits of computers and spend too much time on it, not exercising and enjoying nature enough. This is true, but as long as you stay reasonable with your computer usage, it benefits you in many ways. Like I said, it's great for keeping connections between people, simplifying everyday life, and doing research for school. In conclusion, computers are a valuable asset when used properly, and we should embrace their benefits while being mindful of over - usage."
278	278	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I firmly think that computers affect people in a positive way. Computers significantly increase our knowledge, let us communicate with our friends and family in a convenient manner, teach us hand - eye coordination, and allow us to access our news faster. Computers are truly enjoyable and remarkable pieces of technology. Even though sitting down looking at your computer screen might not seem very interactive, computers are a goldmine of knowledge. Computers have numerous websites that are brimming with great information. You can look up anything you would like to learn about and find exactly what you're looking for. Going to the library to search for a book for your report would take up extra time. Instead, you can quickly look up the facts you need online. Computers also let us communicate with family and friends in a cost - effective way. Calling someone or sending a letter costs money, but sending an email to someone is free. Many people have family and friends who live far away from them. Through computers, they can talk to them as long as they want at no expense. You can also see each other through a webcam, which you can attach to your computer if it doesn't have one already. Another reason why computers are useful is because they are great for hand - eye coordination. Computers require you to type, which is an essential skill. While writing out an essay by hand is tiring and boring, you can type up the essay on your computer. Typing takes time to get good at, but it is very helpful. Finally, computers help us get our news faster. When major events happen, such as the earthquake in @LOCATION1, it was all over the internet before it even hit the news channels. In conclusion, computers are very useful and help us increase our knowledge, communicate with people, improve our hand - eye coordination, and access our news faster. But most importantly, computers are fun, and they enhance our lives in many ways.
279	279	1	3	Dear Newspaper, I wholeheartedly believe that advances in technology have many positive effects, especially when it comes to computers. Computers are great for people of all ages. Computers effectively teach hand - eye coordination and allow people to learn information from all corners of the world. Lastly, computers enable people to communicate seamlessly through the internet. Advances in technology improve society and the overall way of life around the globe. Advances in technology are truly amazing. Computers showcase these advances greatly. With the simple use of a computer, one can learn great hand - eye coordination skills. Typing skills are a prime example. Typing skills are needed by almost everyone in the modern world. Without computers, very few people would have these skills. A young child can go on the computer, play an engaging game, and learn basic typing and hand - eye coordination skills to kick - start their coordination skills for the rest of their life. These advances in computers can also allow people to learn worldwide information. Many times in school, students are assigned to do a report on a different country. It would be extremely difficult to do that report without a computer. The student would need to painstakingly go through all different books to find the specific information needed. With the internet, that project can get done a lot faster just by typing whatever you need to know. How about that family vacation you've always dreamed of? Need an idea of where to go? Use the internet! All you need to do is type in vacation spots and click enter. Instantly, you will have hundreds of choices right in front of you. This makes life a lot simpler. Do you remember the last time your mom or dad went on a business trip and you couldn't talk to them because they were swamped with work? There is a solution to this with the internet. You can communicate with them through @CAPS1, @CAPS2 or both. Just hook up your @CAPS2 to the computer and instantly say good @TIME1, or ask how it's going. If you have a friend, you can instant message them. It is so easy that it will seem like you are standing right next to them in a matter of seconds. In conclusion, computers and advances in technology are great and can benefit everyone in the world. Computers teach hand - eye coordination, allow one to learn information from around the world, and enable communication through the internet to happen instantly. Writers and editors of the newspaper, please agree with me on this topic. Advances in technology can only add positive effects to the way of life. Support advances in today's technology to help improve life for those of us in the modern age.
280	280	1	3	Dear @LOCATION1, I firmly believe computers have a positive effect on people. They effectively teach hand - eye coordination. Computers give people the wonderful ability to learn about far - away places and people. They even enable people to talk online. Computers are a very useful piece of machinery. Computers teach hand - eye coordination. When you're in school, you need to type lots of important @CAPS1 prompts, detailed @CAPS2 labs, and complex @CAPS3 @CAPS4 vocab. Computers help us do that efficiently. Typing fast and correctly takes practice. Typing without looking at the keyboard is a great example of hand - eye coordination. This skill will help us later on in life as well. Whether it's typing term papers in high school or your all - important application essay for college, you will need the help of computers. Computers give people the ability to learn about far - away places. @NUM1 years ago, I took a trip to the fascinating @LOCATION3 for the first time. I didn't know much about the rich history of @LOCATION3, so I sat down at my desk and turned on my computer. Suddenly, it was as if I was right in the heart of @LOCATION3! I read about the delicious local food and the vibrant culture. I took a virtual tour of the magnificent @CAPS5 @CAPS6 and the great @CAPS7. I heard the beautiful @CAPS8 music and learned some of the local @CAPS8 language. In just @NUM2 hour, I visited @LOCATION3 right from my very own house! Computers can take you on a magical journey to a far - away country. Computers allow people to talk online with other people. This is a very good thing. I have cousins who live in @LOCATION2, and because of the @NUM3 hour time difference, it's not always easy to talk on the phone, so we use the computer. My family will send e - mails back and forth with them. Sometimes we will even have video chats! Social networking sites accessible by computer such as @CAPS10 or @CAPS11 allow us to talk to people who we don't regularly see. On @CAPS11, you can even talk to your favorite stars or musicians. Computers let us keep in touch with others. Computers have a positive effect on people. Some experts @MONTH1 say that people spend too much time on the computer. While that @MONTH1 be true for some people, it's not true for everyone. We still exercise and spend time outside. We still interact with family and friends, but now we are also able to do so on the computer. More and more people using computers is a good thing as it connects us and enriches our lives. In conclusion, we should embrace computers as they bring so many positive aspects to our lives and help us grow and connect in a digital age.
281	281	1	3	"Dear, Local Newspaper writer, I believe that computers greatly benefit our society because we can connect to people much faster and more easily. With just a few clicks, we can reach out to friends, family, and colleagues around the world. And computers are good for our society because we don't have to spend too much time on the phone. Instead of long and costly phone calls, we can use various communication tools on the computer. That's why I think computers benefit our society. ""Are computers a good thing or bad thing?"" Computers are undoubtedly a good thing because you can email your family or friends any time you want. But sometimes we don't have to be on the computer for so long. That's why I think computers are a good thing overall. Without computers, it will be very different because you have to talk to people on the phone or send text messages, which are less efficient. In my opinion, I am really thankful that we have computers. And on computers, you can access everything like social media platforms, educational websites, and even work on important tasks. That shows without computers, our lives would be quite different. I think people are not spending too much time on the computer because a lot of people use the computer to do office work, which is essential for their jobs. Computers make things a lot easier for us! But sometimes people take advantage of it. That's why I still feel people are not spending an excessive amount of time on the computer. Last but not least, that's why I firmly know computers benefit our society."
282	282	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, I heard that you wanted some opinions on whether or not computers have a positive effect on people. I know that a lot of people are against these positive opinions, but I firmly think computers have a positive effect on people. The main thing that computers are great for is research. Without computers, kids and adults won't be provided with the necessary tools for knowledge acquisition. Studies show that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 students have computers at home, and that one person without computer access gets about @PERCENT1 of a lower grade because of poor research ability on projects. This clearly indicates the importance of computers in education. Another reason why computers are good is that they can bring the world together. Facebook, @CAPS2, and Twitter users can chat with people across the street, across the country, and even across the ocean! People in the @LOCATION5 can play games and chat with people in @LOCATION1, @LOCATION4, @LOCATION2, and even @LOCATION3! It breaks down geographical barriers and allows people to interact with others from different cultures. My last reason is that computers are great for businesses. A lot of people have websites for their jobs that can get them well - known and for people to know what their business is about. Take for example your newspaper. Without computers, you wouldn't be able to get your research efficiently or even type or print your newspaper. Your website wouldn't be able to persuade people to read your newspaper effectively. Even though some people might abuse their computer privileges by staying on too long instead of exercising or interacting with people, but that's just a small portion of them. It's only @PERCENT2 of people with computers that do it! And so what, it's their time and they want to spend it on the computer. What can you do to change? Nothing. And with that, I conclude this letter by letting you know that computers are truly great for people! They give us research capabilities, they help us with school and businesses, and they allow us to talk to people around the world.
283	283	1	3	Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, I am writing a letter to you saying that I think it's a bad idea for you to make kids stay off of computers because computers do teach kids a lot of things, they are good for doing homework on, and you can relax when you're on it. Well, computers teach kids a lot of things like hand - eye coordination. If kids want to work with computers when they're older, they can learn new skills to work with it. There are also websites that can show you how to move your hands when using a computer, which is very helpful for kids to develop proper computer - using habits. Well, when kids come from school, they always have homework. Usually, you need to do it on the computer. So if you couldn't use computers, it would be extremely hard for kids to do their homework. So when they go to school and the class tells the teacher they don't have computers, what are they going to do? It would put them at a disadvantage. So when I get out of school and I've had a very long day, I go home, do my homework, and then go on the computer and listen to music to relax. If you guys were to take computers away, everyone would be grumpy all the time. That is why I think you should keep computers and not worry too much about kids not exercising as much. We get enough of that in school by carrying all these heavy books around. In conclusion, computers are very beneficial for kids and should not be restricted.
284	284	1	3	Dear @STATE1 news, Computers are a great machine to use. People can research, learn about any topic or subject, and let people talk to friends online. I think that computers have a good effect on people. Computers are one of the greatest inventions we have. They are very helpful in our everyday life. When people need to write a paper for school or do a project, you can research what you need. If you need to know something about a topic that you don't know about, you can look up questions you have about it on the internet. The internet is like a vast library with endless information. If you're writing a paper and need an answer, it's all on the internet. Suppose you want to go on a family vacation to California. You can plan your whole trip right on your computer. You can book a flight, get a hotel room, and even see what there is to do. You can see the whole world right from your computer, which makes travel planning much more convenient. If you want to learn another language, you can learn an entire language on your computer through various language - learning platforms. Also, if you're too busy to go to college or want to take another class, there are even schools online. The computer is a great way to learn about new things at your own pace. Finally, you can talk to friends online. Websites like Facebook and MySpace are great ways to keep in touch with your friends. Another positive way is that you can instant message friends and family without having to wait so long for a response back. If you want to reach out to your friends, you can just message them. I think that computers have a positive effect on people. They are helpful in many ways such as people can do research, learn about new things, and talk to friends. I hope you see my point of view that they are something everyone should have. In conclusion, computers are an essential part of our modern life and bring numerous benefits.
285	285	1	3	"I walked into my living room. I saw my mom avidly reading the screen of our computer with pictures of caller masters and logos clustering the web page as well. I thought that the internet had influenced my mom better than I could to convince her that we should go on vacation. More and more people log on to a computer everyday. And although the people willing to change and believe in new advances in technology put forward a strong argument of why computers are beneficial, there are still some that can only see the negative. I strongly support computers and believe they have a lot of potential. Computers make the work even smaller. They allow us to talk to people thousands of miles away in an instant. Also, you can reconnect with friends that you can't see anymore. For example, I used to go to an awesome @DATE1 camp and I made some of my best friends there. But @DATE1, the camp ended, and instead of playing sports and having fun, I layed down in my basement, too lazy to stand up because my sweat glued me to the floor. Then one day, I heard the familiar sound that my computer's speakers made when I receive an instant @CAPS1. I gathered the energy to crawl over to the screen, only to find out that @PERSON1, one of my closest friends from the camp, wanted to take a bike ride down to the wall, and hang out with some other people we knew. Needless to say, I happily responded, ""@CAPS2 I definitely want to go,"" which was a moment made possible by computers. If it hadn't been for computers and @ORGANIZATION1, we would all have drifted apart and never talked again. An exaggerated argument people use against computers is that everybody that uses them doesn't exercise. I frequent my computer almost every hour, so I made a system to ensure I got exercise. Every time I walk into the room where my computer is hooked up, I grab the pull - up bar right there and do @NUM1. I only thought of this system @NUM2 months ago, and I have already strengthened my own muscles. I can now do @NUM3 pull - ups at a time, but when I started, I struggled to do @NUM2. If not for the amazing connection that computers gave me back to my friends, I would still do exercise, but only half - heartedly and would probably give up after about a week. Computers give easy access to the internet, which has so much information it is mind - boggling. Unless it is a closely grounded secret, you could probably find whatever you want on the internet. I've gone countless times to find information for an essay, and the limited textbooks I have just isn't what I need. My country project @DATE1 year couldn't have had more than @CAPS5 pieces of information from a book! It also makes a great teacher of about any subject as well. As a matter of fact, my language arts teacher told us a story about how a kid who had never done any sort of water sports before, spent @NUM2 weeks watching videos on YouTube about how to waterski, and on his first try, he was doing tricks. These are only a few of the reasons I think computers are great. They keep friendships close, give you a reason to exercise, and can teach you anything! I say we spread the good word about computers and let everyone know how awesome they are."
286	286	1	3	Dear computer co., computers have a notably negative effect on people's lives. Why would you go outside and experience the real world if you could play incredibly life - like games on your @CAPS1? These games are so immersive that they draw people in for hours on end. I think that the games on the @CAPS1 should be removed so people could enjoy all of the great things in life, such as the beauty of nature, the warmth of human interaction, and the thrill of physical activities. If people weren't on @CAPS1's all day, they would pay more attention to the way they're destroying nature, like littering in parks or contributing to pollution through excessive energy consumption. In conclusion, getting rid of these games on @CAPS1 could be a step towards a more balanced and environmentally - conscious life.
287	287	1	3	"Dear The @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Your resources, your entertainment, even your communication with people might be gradually fading. As you know, a large portion of people think this @PERSON2 is harming our society. Well, I will say I firmly believe they don't understand the numerous benefits that computers bring us. Computer act like patient teachers, teaching us without us even being fully aware of it. Hand - eye coordination is a perfect and practical example. Plus, we use computers to learn about far - off places we might want to travel to, or have a warm conversation with friends or family living ways away from us. Computers are an extraordinary piece of technology. First, I like to say that everything that you do physically uses hand - eye coordination, such as making a delicious dinner, riding a bike smoothly, or driving a car safely. And unfortunately, not all people are the best at hand - eye coordination. One of @CAPS7 friends, @PERSON1, had horrible hand - eye coordination. So for his birthday, I decided to get him a computer. It's been @NUM1 month since he had his computer. And when he was trying to hit a baseball at his son's party, he managed to hit the ball @NUM2 out of @NUM3 times, where he used to hit it @NUM1 or @NUM5 out of @NUM6 times. @PERCENT2 is a tremendous increase in only @NUM1 month! Just something as simple as a computer improved @CAPS7 friend's hand - eye coordination a tremendous amount. Secondly, the computer can help you learn about far - away places like the @LOCATION1 or @LOCATION4. Do you really want to travel up to the icy cold, and piercing winds of the @LOCATION1 just to learn about it? For some, I'd say they might like that, but what if you can't travel up to the @LOCATION1 due to money or flying conditions. I want to be able to study about polar bears and the glaciers without needing to worry. A statistic from the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 of @CAPS5 states ""@PERCENT2 of people would love to experience the thrill and excitement of the @ORGANIZATION1 lights. But out of those @PERCENT2 only @PERCENT3 said they'd actually travel to @LOCATION2 to see them"". So you can see that @PERCENT4 of those people wouldn't go whether it be due to money or the cold. They said that's why they love the computer. They can experience the @ORGANIZATION1 lights without needing to travel into the bitter cold. Lastly, what could be a better thing to do on the computer than connect with family you've never met before or don't get to see often. The editor for the @LOCATION3 Local states ""@CAPS7 parents live over @NUM8 miles away. I rarely get to talk to them now because I can't afford to travel that distance often. So I use @CAPS7 computer, and @CAPS7 parents and I now communicate @PERCENT1 more than we used to. I love the computer as it helps keep me close to @CAPS7 loved ones."" As you can tell, thanks to the computer, we talk @PERCENT1 more to his parents than he used to! In conclusion, computers are truly a remarkable invention that offers various benefits in terms of skill - building, learning, and staying connected."
288	288	1	3	Dear newspaper, I think that using your computer too much is extremely bad. Some people spend an inordinate amount of time on the internet. Many people are so overly focused on the internet that they neglect their normal daily activities. Also, the computer is bad for people because they will be on the internet all night long and get no sleep at all. This leaves them utterly exhausted for the day ahead. A lot of people spend far too much time on the internet. Since they are always glued to the internet, they don't spend a lot of quality time with their families. This causes the internet - addicted person to gradually lose meaningful relationships with their family and friends. Lack of exercise is also a result of this addiction. For example, my stepbrother is always on the internet now. He doesn't talk to anyone because he is so preoccupied with his game. Another problem people encounter with the internet is being overly focused. When you are too focused on the internet, you forget there is a whole wonderful world out there that needs your attention and help. Most people won't do their chores, or make a nourishing meal for their family. These people also have no time for the outdoor activities they used to enjoy so much. Internet addicts usually don't get any sleep. They have no time to study at night because they spend all their extra time on the internet. During the day, they will be very tired in school or work, and the internet will be the one to blame. Last month, my mom made a Facebook. She is constantly on it. When she is on it, she ignores everything around her. My mom goes to school, and she tells me how she never has time to study because she is always on the internet. She also stopped reading the Bible in her spare time to go on the internet. The internet is a bad thing to get hooked on. You lose relationships with your friends and family because you never get off the computer. People usually don't exercise or do their chores. This is not a very good addiction to get into, and it's important for people to find a balance between their online and offline lives.
289	289	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1, The effect that computers have on people is not a positive one. I think people spend an excessive amount of time on computers. Some information on computers is inaccurate, and there are still telephones and cellphones that people can use for communication. A majority of people's time is spent on the computer. Whether it's playing exciting games, checking @CAPS2 - mail regularly, or even working long hours, people's valuable time is getting wasted. This time could be used by doing more important things such as spending quality time with friends and family, enjoying the beauty of nature outdoors, or engaging in physical exercise. Being on the computer instead of exercising has had a huge negative effect on people. Some people are overweight because they eat and then do not exercise after. My sister works on the computer all day, and she says @NUM1 or @NUM2 ladies at her work are unhealthy because all they do is go on the computer and eat granola bars, which are usually healthy but not enough to counteract the lack of exercise. If others spent at least a half - an hour outside to breathe some fresh air instead of using a computer most of the time, most of them would feel a lot better. My doctor always used to tell me and my brother, ""Go out and play an hour a day!"" This is true, and I strongly encourage people to go outside and do an activity as opposed to playing on the computer. The computer is used a lot for researching. Some of the information on the computer is very helpful, but you can never really know what information is inaccurate. At least when you research using a book or encyclopedia, you can trust those sources. What if you had to do a report and you could only use the internet? How would you be able to tell if the information is trustworthy? Sure, computers also teach hand - eye coordination by playing video games, but when in real life, will you need to know how to shoot a dragon or dodge candy that's falling from the sky? This is just an example of unneeded information and skills that keeps people wanting to go back on the computer. Another thing you can do on the computer is communicate with others. When computers weren't invented or even that advanced, people were more than happy to give one another a call. Now with computers, people @CAPS2 - mail, instant message, or even use Skype, a webcam website. What even happened to cellphones? You can take them anywhere and have a real - time conversation. In conclusion, people should be more cautious about their computer use and find a better balance in their lives."
290	290	1	3	Dear reader, @CAPS1, people have been debating whether or not computers are actually benefiting society, especially now that the majority of @CAPS2 now own one of these helpful machines. Computers help people with everyday tasks and are no doubt doing more good than harm. Imagine how impossible it would be for most people to do their jobs without them. Life would become much harder for the people living on this planet. Think of the successful schools in our country, and then think of which of those schools don't have computers. Computers are the easiest way to look up information, something extremely important when children are learning. Whenever someone needs to know something, they just google it. This comes in very handy when researching for that huge project due next week. People have never been so knowledgeable. Computers are important not only for school but also in the work - place. They serve almost the same useful purposes in both environments. Now that computers are so common, people can conveniently type up a paper and submit it to their boss or teacher. It saves time and effort and gives a more professional result. Computers also serve the important purpose of communication. Using email or instant messaging, one could communicate with someone on the other side of the world without that enormous phone bill. Some @MONTH1 see this as dangerous because you could be chatting with a complete stranger. However, it is also opening your eyes to new cultures. Now it's possible to learn about life in @LOCATION1 first - hand. If computers were no more, it would be extremely hard for a regular person to interact with someone from another country. It's almost like isolation from the world. There are many out there who take great interest in learning other languages. There are better ways than sitting in a classroom listening to someone talk. As a person on this planet, do you really want to be kept separate from others just because they don't live close enough? A main concern about computers is that no one will want to read books and other things. However, a recent study shows that after computers came out, more people have begun to read. This proves that just because there is now something fun and new, it doesn't mean everything else is trash. People will still continue to do things they always did, just with something new on their list. In addition, it is the option of everyone whether or not they want to spend their time on the computer. If someone doesn't like the idea, they have no right to take it away from someone else. Computers were created to help the human race, not control it. If a person doesn't want one, they don't have to get one. Everything is up to them, and that is the way it should remain. The next time you see a computer, don't think of it as some sort of obsession that's keeping people from doing other things they could be. But as a universal device that allows them to broaden their horizons and learn things they probably wouldn't go to the library to look for. Computers aren't holding anyone back but pushing everyone forward, whether at work, school, or even at home. They benefit everyone, everywhere, and we should embrace their positive aspects while being cautious of potential drawbacks.
291	291	1	3	Have you ever thought about all the amazing things that computers have done for us? Now, we can learn about anything we desire, talk with people on the far - off other side of the world, and even make progress in other areas of technology. Computers have, without a shadow of a doubt, had a positive effect on people. Just imagine this...one second you can be in the blazing deserts of @LOCATION3, feeling the scorching heat on your virtual skin, the next in a lush, steamy, jungle thriving with exotic animals...All without leaving the comfort of your room! Using computers, people can learn about new places and things at their convenience. The millions of resources on the internet make it feasible to learn about different places and times. Although this information might be available in a local library. Going on the computer is MUCH easier. Who wants to go through the hassle of loaning books from the library, when the internet is there for your use any time? No need for registration to get a library card. No late fees and no waiting lists. It is quite clear that using your computer to do research is a very valuable thing. @NUM1 out of ten people said that they would rather email a person than talk on the phone with them. Now, with computers, people can instant message, or email anyone, anywhere in the world. Making a call from @LOCATION1 to @LOCATION2 can be very expensive but with email, I can talk to my @CAPS1 friend, @PERSON1, free of charge. I remember when she moved to @LOCATION2. It was sad, but we promised to stay in touch. With e - mail and instant messaging, it was easy to talk, and exchange the latest news! Having the ability to communicate with someone easily is an unbelievable privilege, that would be non - existent without computers to help us. Lastly, computers have helped people make advances in other areas of technology. Where would we be in science and medicine without computers? These machines have assisted scientists to conduct experiments. With a simulated experiment they can be certain that no other variables will affect your results. Now, experiments can be extremely accurate. Computers have helped advance medicine as well. They have been the key to unlocking all sorts of cures for dangerous diseases. Who knows, maybe in @NUM2 years there will be a cure for cancer. All of these amazing accomplishments have been positively affected by computers. Although some people might think that computers have a negative impact on our day - to - day life, I completely disagree. People can engage in learning, talking, and make advances in technology with one click of a mouse. Computers have affected people positively in many ways, so, click away! Computers have none of the limitations that traditional methods have.
292	292	1	3	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 the world forty years ago. People would need to travel long distances to visit a library to research, every document, doctors' notes, and building plan would have to be painstakingly written by hand or on an old - fashioned typewriter. Life would have been much more difficult. Today, computers allow us to communicate with one another effortlessly, access the millions of websites on the internet and assist with school work. Almost every day, my mom and dad receive friend requests from long - lost school friends as well as relatives and current friends. Today's computers allow the world to talk to one another and stay informed about what is going on. My dad always says "" @CAPS2 makes the world go round."" With the social networking sites, everyone is receiving tons of @CAPS2 about one another. Another way to communicate is by video chat. All modern @CAPS3 computers are equipped with a video camera and you can easily buy one if you have a @CAPS4. This will let you clearly see the person's face you are talking to. I have heard many amazing stories about this. One is about a soldier in @LOCATION1 and his present wife back home. The doctors set up a computer equipped with video chat in the operating room and the soldier was, in a way, in two places at once. The man got to see his newborn baby and his wife. Computers can do amazing things! Another reason computers are great is their accessibility to the internet. There is this cool website called @CAPS5.Dcotors.Com. If you have an illness or a symptom to something, all you have to do is type it in on the home page and it will list all the possible reasons or outcomes. It also tells you how to treat it and where to find the medicine. If we looked back in time, one would need to travel to a doctor and pay to have your problem checked out. Also computers help out immensely with school work and homework. Many teachers nowadays request or demand students to type their assignments because it is easy to read, and it is easier to correct. I also find it faster to type than print. Say that you need to research the periodic table and write down @NUM1 facts as well as all the elements. There are probably hundreds if not thousands of websites on this subject. All you need to do is type it in on google. You can also add an image by copy and pasting; which will enhance your work. Computers have helped students and teachers. Lastly, computers (and then keyboards) are helping people with hand - eye coordination. Many schools are offering typing classes to try and help students. I recently searched this topic on the internet and it showed a study done by @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 that people who practice typing at least @NUM2 minutes a day, will experience increased hand - eye coordination to @PERCENT1 better. This increase would help many people with low coordination. Today, computers are helping the world in many ways. From communication, to internet accessibility, then to helping hand - eye coordination. The world would change for the worse if computers were abandoned."
293	293	1	3	Dear Newspaper people, @CAPS1 opinion's on what effect's do computer's have on people is that without the computer we couldn't research important people and event's. Also we couldn't type important paper's. Last we can talk to other people. Now that @CAPS1 first opinion is without the computer we couldn't research important people and events. This is one of @CAPS1 reason's because if people didn't know anything about an important person they could look them up. For an example, who is Harry @PERSON1? He was the @NUM1 president. I didn't know who he was or what he did until I looked him up on the internet. @CAPS1 second opinion is we wouldn't be able to type important paper's. I say this because people that have @CAPS3's mostly have to type paper's. And without the computers everything would have to be hand - written. Also some people have really bad hand - writing. @CAPS1 last opinion is we can type to people that are online and offline. I say this because if you have to tell a family member, or a friend something important but your phone is dead or broken you can e - mail them. Or if you have a facebook you can tell them on that. Last you can I.M them. Now that you know three opinion's on what effects computer's have, people can always exercise around their house or around their block. In conclusion, computers have become an indispensable part of our lives, enabling us to connect, learn, and create in ways that were unimaginable before.
294	294	1	3	Dear readers of @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 people today are debating whether having a computer benefits society. Computer benefit society in @CAPS1 way like it could help the children with their school work. Not @CAPS1 children are very outgoing but if they had a computer then that will really help them. Not @CAPS1 kids have ways to find out what they are going to be in life. I'm pretty sure they don't care right now but the computer will help them out. As you can see the computer can help society. Every child who goes to school has homework from kindergarten to when they end school. The computer can help them with their math homeworks, their science, and even their social studies homework. When your kids get older starting middle school they have to do reports & projects that require knowledge to be able to write or do the paper. If you are a busy parent and can't take your children to the library to take out @CAPS1 books that could get lost and you would have to pay for something that has been bought and is not able to use again. But the computer eliminates all of that hassle to society. The computer can help the communication in so @CAPS1 ways. @CAPS1 kids like to go on @CAPS2 to chat and parents think that @CAPS2 is their world, but it could happen that they are arranging a group to form. Now a days there are a lot more shy people who are scared to @ORGANIZATION1 people and befriend them. but now they could be a lot more depressed. The computer could also help you because you could be late or unable to go to an appointment or to a meeting & you can inform the person in advance. This is a great way why computers help society. In society there are not a lot of people who know right away what they want to be when they grow up. If they use the computer and are really good at fixing them when they're broken then they can be a computer @CAPS3. There are so @CAPS1 beautiful places that people take pictures of and upload them into their computer. Some people don't see their talent until someone points it out to them. @CAPS1 people could be having a bad day and write a story out of it and send it to some of their friends, and then their friend can send it to a publisher and make this person @CAPS5. As you can see there are so @CAPS1 great ways you can use the computer to help your society. Readers the computer can help you in your school work. The computer can help the society communicate. It could also help people find their @CAPS6. I think that the computer does a great job helping the society.
295	295	1	3	Dear Newspaper, I strongly believe that the widespread use of technologies for kids and adults to use computers has a negative impact. I strongly believe that computers have a bad effect on people because you can get addicted, you spend less time with your family and friends. Finally, you spend less time exercising and doing great opportunities for yourself. Clearly, I think that letting students and adults use computers will take over their mind and make them addicted to the computer. This is very bad because when you're addicted to something, it's hard to go back. This means you will have no time for anything else. For example, they might forget what life is about and what was around for us to live in. Addiction is hard to get over, so don't live your life in a box and play on non - essential things. Live your life to the fullest. Overall, addiction exists in everything, including computers and it's a horrible thing. Without a doubt, spending too much time on computers will rot your brain and make you lazy. Meaning that the less you exercise, the less active you are. This problem is especially for teens. Teens have access to computers every week, cell phones, ipods, and many more. A lot of teens get cranky and then become moody and nasty to their parents because they are so engrossed in their devices. As people don't exercise and move around a lot, it can cause severe consequences like obesity and cancer. Obesity usually happens when you over - eat food, but it can also happen by not eating properly and not exercising. People that aren't moving become lazy and have no desire to do anything which will have a negative effect. Overall computers cause people to exercise less and be less active which will cause various health problems. Lastly, Computers make people spend less and less time with their family, and treat their computer as if the computers are their only companions. In everyday life, teens are on their cell phones, their computers listening to music. These electronics are causing a rift in family relationships. If this goes on, a lot of teens will lose the people they love. Computers are a waste of time because they can make you isolated. In conclusion, the over - reliance on computers has a detrimental impact on people who use computers and other electronics, and we should strive to find a better balance in our lives.
296	296	1	3	"Dear local newspaper, my name is @PERSON1, and I firmly believe that computers are incredibly useful tools from which people can learn a great deal. The computer is an intelligent device and is likely the best technology ever invented. Computers are extremely helpful when you need to gather information about a specific person. For instance, if you're a policeman and your superior tells you to meet at @ORGANIZATION1, and there you're informed about a suspect but know nothing about them, a computer can quickly show you their criminal record and what they're convicted of. Another example is when your teacher assigns a report on "" @PERSON3 lopez,"" and you're unfamiliar with this person; using the computer allows you to read about their life. Also, if you're interested in learning about your country's history and the leaders behind it, the computer is an ideal resource.  Second, computers are a great aid for students with their homework. Say your teacher asks for a neat essay on @PERSON2, but your handwriting is poor; you can use a word - processing program on the computer. If you forget to write down your homework in your agenda, you can simply visit the school website to check. And if your teacher asks you to find a book about the @CAPS1, and the library copies are all taken but you need one by tomorrow, you can search on the computer to locate the nearest place that has it.  Lastly, computers help you stay in touch with your family and friends. Writing letters can be time - consuming, so online messengers like ""@CAPS2,"" Facebook, and MySpace are excellent alternatives. If you send a letter to the wrong address, you can go online to ask a friend or family member. Moreover, if you want to see and talk to someone, you can use a webcam for a face - to - face conversation.  I hope you agree with my opinion and recognize that computers are useful and beneficial for people. They assist people in learning about others and obtaining information, help students with schoolwork, and enable us to connect with family and friends. Therefore, I hope you like my letter and find my perspective valuable."
297	297	1	3	Dear local Newspaper, I assume you've heard about the ongoing debate about computers. I personally believe that computers do bring significant benefits to society. I hold this view because computers offer advantages through their online capabilities, the internet, and overall assistance in various other aspects.  My first reason for why you should believe that they benefit society is the online functionality of computers. Through online platforms such as chat rooms and online banking, it can have a positive impact on people's morale. For military officers and soldiers who are often separated from their families, online communication can instantly bridge that gap. Additionally, online banking allows you to pay bills, saving you a trip to the bank and the cost of gas. So, the online aspect is a strong reason for you, the local newspaper, to agree with me.  My second reason is the great value of the internet. The internet, a remarkable creation @NUM1 years ago, is truly amazing. You can purchase items on websites like eBay and Amazon, which saves a significant amount of time. Moreover, it enables you to learn about foreign nations. You can also receive news through the internet, which is crucial as it allows people to be instantly informed about natural disasters and community problems, rather than waiting to find the information in the newspaper or on television. That's my second reason for why you should agree that computers are helpful.  My final reason is the overall assistance computers provide in various situations. For example, a student can research information about a subject online, which can improve their grades on a project. Studies have shown that computer training, such as playing online games like Call of Duty, can boost soldiers' accuracy by enhancing their hand - eye coordination by @PERCENT1. This may seem like a small improvement, but on the battlefield, it can be the difference between life and death. Computers are also widely available in places like libraries and internet cafes.  Some people might think that computers are a bad thing because they take time away from exercise. However, this issue can be easily resolved by using the internet to buy an indoor jogger. Computers benefit society through their online features, the internet, and overall assistance in different scenarios. These are the reasons why I believe you should support the cause of computers. Thank you for taking the time to read my opinion.
298	298	1	3	Dear Newspaper, I firmly believe that computer use is highly beneficial because it teaches people hand - eye coordination. When using a computer, people learn to focus their eyes while also using their hands simultaneously. To maintain focus, people might need to wear glasses to reduce the glare from the screen. This way, when typing, they don't have to constantly look down at the keyboard. Understanding the layout of the keyboard and using their hands effectively on it are important skills that computers help develop.  Secondly, computers enable people to learn about different states and countries. You can not only see how nice or bad these places look but also read about their unique cultures and religions. In the states, you can learn about @LOCATION1 and @LOCATION2 and appreciate the beauty of our wonderful state.  Finally, computers allow people to interact with family and friends online. There are numerous websites where you can search for and connect with your loved ones. You can have in - depth conversations with them, even if they're in a different state. You can discuss family matters, life experiences, and express how much you miss each other.  Not only do computers teach hand - eye coordination, help you connect with family and friends, and provide knowledge about different states, but they also offer other benefits. You can play a variety of games, type on a notepad, and use the calculator when you're stuck on a math problem. Therefore, people should make good use of computers.
299	299	1	3	Do you think computers have a negative effect on people? Well, I don't. I believe that computers are an easier and faster way to obtain information. The three main reasons why I believe computers have a positive effect on people are the ability to learn about faraway places, the availability of jobs in the computer business, and the opportunity to communicate with people from afar. There are many other reasons, but I'm only required to discuss three here.  First of all, computers allow you to learn about faraway places that you may not be able to visit in person. The internet provides a faster way to get information about news that might not appear in the newspaper until the next day. If you don't have the money to travel, you can simply explore these faraway places on the internet. It offers a more comprehensive and up - to - date source of information.  My second reason is the importance of computers in the job market. There are a large number of jobs that rely on computers. Without computers, many people would be unemployed, and businesses would slow down as they wouldn't have access to the necessary information. So, computers are essential for the smooth operation of the job market and business world.  Lastly, computers enable you to talk to people from faraway. While phone calls are an option, video chat on a computer allows you to see the person you're talking to, which is a much more personal experience. It's a great way to make new friends and keep in touch with old ones. You can talk to relatives, friends, or anyone you want. Without computers, you would likely lose touch with people who live far away, which would be a pity.  In conclusion, computers are an efficient way to get information. They allow you to learn about faraway places, provide job opportunities in the computer business, and help you communicate with distant people. I firmly believe that computers have a positive impact on our lives.
300	300	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, when you look at a map of your area, all you can see is an overwhelming presence of computers. Whether it's in the town, the state, the country, or even across the world, computers seem to be everywhere. It's time for us to shut down these computers so that we can start exercising, enjoying nature, and spending quality time with our families.  Let's take a look around. What do we see? A rising problem of obesity. These so - called computers are one of the main culprits. Take @CAPS5 for example. He used to weigh over @NUM1 pounds because he spent most of his time on that ""blasted electrical error"" we call a computer. One day, he decided to change his ways and started exercising. After just one year, he weighed only @NUM2 pounds. A doctor, computer expert, and author of books on exercise, nature, and family, @PERSON1, says that if people would turn off their computers and go to the gym, over @PERCENT1 of @LOCATION1's obesity problem would decline.  The computers are also causing people to miss out on the beauty of nature. @PERSON1 mentions that over @PERCENT2 of people will never experience nature once they get a computer. I can vividly imagine the beautiful scenery: fresh plump fruits hanging from lush green bushes in spring, the magnificent waterfall shining as it cascades into a creek, the dark and majestic scenery at night, and the soothing sounds of crickets and owls lulling you to sleep under the tall oak trees. This is what we should get people interested in, not time - consuming electronics.  Another serious issue is that computers are keeping people from spending time with their families. People are so engrossed in @CAPS9, @CAPS10, and other computer - related activities that the important things in life are being neglected. My friend @PERSON2 was once a victim of the computer. He managed to break free in time to stop one of his kids from going to an illegal party. Since then, he has put his family first. Unfortunately, many other families are not as lucky. @PERSON1 states that @PERCENT3 of families with computers have no communication and end up splitting up.  The computers have gone too far. They have not only messed up people's personal lives but also damaged family relationships. We must put an end to this. We can't let computers be in control while we become their slaves. We need to get people away from these time - consuming devices and back to the things that truly matter. So, I ask, will you join us in this fight?"
301	301	1	3	"Dear @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 of @CAPS3 is all about Computers. They are incredibly powerful machines that can do anything. But think, are they really helping us? Yes, they can perform in - depth research and handle various complex tasks, but physically they're not. You end up spending less time exercising, interacting with family and friends, and there are potential long - term impacts that computers can have on @CAPS1 lives. Exercise is an essential part of @CAPS1 lives. ""People need to get out there and do something other than be in front of the computer screen"", says @PERSON1 of @ORGANIZATION1. The fact is that one hour of exercise each day is good for your health. However, two in three @CAPS4 won't do so. That's why @CAPS1 @CAPS2 on is the way we are @CAPS3 - lazy, unactive, worthless, and overweight. As a result, computers are to blame. Are there some relatives you haven't been face - to - face with? It's because of computers. Computers @CAPS3 let us do things like video - chat with relatives or go on Facebook and MySpace or use @CAPS5 @CAPS6 to chat with them or send emails. The problem with this is that it makes us lazy. You could be out there traveling to where your relatives live to see them. But why waste energy going to a travel agency when you can do it on the internet instead, say travel agent @PERSON2. @NUM1 in @NUM2 people haven't seen their relatives from other states in years. People need to step away from computers, from games, and from all the activities that are solely on the computer. You don't even have to take much effort. This is bad. People need to do things the old - fashioned way. @NUM3 out of @NUM1 @CAPS4 use the computer daily. People lose jobs over computers. Everything is made so simple that there's no need to hire secretaries, as employees, and more office personnel. Factories don't need many people. Computerized @CAPS10 can take over jobs quicker, easier, and cheaper. They will one day take over. That's not good. In conclusion, computers @MONTH1 seemed like the best thing that hit the earth, but if you really, really think about it, it's not. It prevents you from exercising, seeing friends and family, and can impact @CAPS1 lives in a bad way. I hope you see where I'm coming from."
302	302	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 times, @CAPS2 you think computers benefit society? Well I think so! There are countless reasons why computers are both resourceful and helpful. Many citizens in our own community of Watertown think computers are a great resource for many things, while others disagree with this completely. Computers can benefit society because you can learn many new things on the internet. Also, you can interact with your friends and family, and lastly, there are many applications used for business. On both a computer and the internet, there are more than @NUM1 million things you can learn. When you are struggling with homework, a computer is a great resource. You can quickly open @CAPS3.com and search any topic at any time. For example, if you did not know a conversion, it is easily found on the internet. Another thing you can be taught or informed about is news. There are websites such as nytimes.com and cnn.com that give you daily news. I personally use these websites weekly to stay updated on local and global events. On the computer, you can find vacation spots you want to learn about and plan to visit. When my family was planning our trip to @ORGANIZATION1 in @LOCATION1, we used the computer constantly to research hotels, attractions, and travel routes. In the end, computers can teach you many things. Secondly, you can interact with people on the internet in many ways. These include social networking websites, web - chat, and email. Social networking websites are a great way to connect to family members and friends from the past. Websites that were created for this include: Facebook, MySpace, and Twitter. These free websites let you add friends, send messages, and post pictures, allowing you to share your life with others easily. Web - chatting is a way to video - call people. You can personally see someone from across the @ORGANIZATION1 from your webcam, making long - distance communication more personal. Lastly, emailing is a great way to inform people. You can write a visual letter to one of your friends. In conclusion, the computer is one excellent way to interact. Lastly, the computer is used for business. An application called Microsoft Office is used in countless businesses, including Microsoft Office Word, PowerPoint, Excel, and @CAPS4. Each of these is used to plan, sell, present, manage, and write about products. Microsoft is something you should download in the near future. Businesses also use web - chatting, as I previously stated, for conference calls. A production company can be face - to - face with a company from China without being in the room with them. This makes it much easier than to fly half - way across the @ORGANIZATION1. Finally, computers are used when manufacturing a product in or at a business. Work sites such as @CAPS5 companies use computers to control their machines. I know that the @ORGANIZATION2 factory uses computers in their factory due to the fact that I watched the show Unwrapped about them on @CAPS5 @CAPS6. In the end, computers are a necessary item in a business. In conclusion, computers have a great effect on people. They can teach people many new and exciting things they did not know. Also, they can connect humans with each other from half - way across the @ORGANIZATION1. Lastly, businesses would not run well without a computer. Computers can benefit society because you can learn many new things on the internet. Also, you can interact with your friends and family, and there are many applications used for business. If I were an expert, I would have nothing to worry about concerning computers. They are a magnificent thing. @CAPS2 you have the same belief and understanding as me?
303	303	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, The use of computers does not benefit our society. Instead of spending quality time with the people we love, like friends and family, our time is gobbled up by the one electronic device that many people depend on; the computer. This is not a very good thing to have an electronic device like this in our everyday lives because it uses a lot of electricity, it is expensive to buy and replace, and it allows hackers or other bad people into things we don't want them to see. But using electricity is just the start. By using electricity for this nonsense device, we waste money. We also are doing our part to destroy the environment. Greenhouse gases and fuel are poisoning the air and being wasted. ""I don't have a computer at my house, and I get along pretty well"", says @CAPS3, a local environmentalist. So that's it; we can get along well without the computers taking over our lives. Along with not being good for the environment, it is also not good for the economy. My dad always says how he doesn't like to waste money, and then he goes and purchases a computer. Not only has this computer crashed once, but twice! A waste of money has been put into buying it, restoring it once, and now restoring it a second time! Plus, computers waste our time. I always remember my grandfather saying, ""I don't know why you folks waste all your precious time and money on these doo - dads!"" With so many people acquiring new devices, fewer people will be able to keep track of what goes where and who sees it. This is a terrible thing for the people, but a very, very good thing for the bad people. By ""bad people"" I mean internet hackers. As time goes on, and people get less aware of what's happening in their electronic lives, more and more hackers will be able to get what they want; in fact, anything they want. ""Just a few months ago, I put a message on the message board on the @CAPS5 website which said I would be on vacation for a week. My address was also posted, because that message was a mobile upload. When I came back from vacation, half the things in my house were gone!"" said a local resident. Burglaries, robberies, and easy internet access can lead to chaos. Feeble protection is never good. But remember, computers are using massive amounts of electricity, making many people waste time and money, and allowing bad people into things we don't want them to see. Please understand the meaning of how terrible computers are."
304	304	1	3	"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 opinion as to why some people support advances in technology and believe that computers have a positive effect on people is that I disagree. Some people don't even get enough sleep if they stay up too late on computers. Also, they spend less time exercising and less time interacting with family and friends. Those are @CAPS1 reasons as to why I disagree. In this paragraph, I am going to tell you about why I think that people should do other things than going on the computer all night. If they wake up in the morning and start being grumpy, don't blame them; the computer had them stay up late. Would you rather get a good night's rest or be extra tired in the morning because you stayed up too late on the computer? Well, once I stayed at @CAPS1 friend's house, and she was up on the computer all night. She didn't even get any sleep. In the morning, she was so grumpy because she was so tired. @CAPS1 language arts teacher ""@PERSON1"" says that ""staying up late on the computer all night isn't healthy because you get dark circles under your eyes and you're sleepy. I mean there's a whole lot of side effects."" @NUM1 out of @PERCENT1 of parents agree with me and @CAPS1 first reason. In this paragraph, I am telling you @CAPS1 second reason as to why I disagree, which is less time exercising. (To the parents) Do you really want your kids to be lazy and on the computer all day or do you want your kids to exercise and get healthier? @CAPS1 friend's kids always are on the computer every day all the time, and that's not very healthy for them, especially because they're young. So a couple of weeks ago, I talked to them about being active and how it's not good to be on the computer a lot. Now they barely go on the computer; they always are outside and playing and running around. @CAPS1 science teacher @PERSON3 says that ""Regular exercise is better than doing anything non - active. Also, it can be fun."" @NUM2 out of @PERCENT2 of kids agree with @CAPS1 science teacher @PERSON2. In this paragraph, I am going to explain to you why I think interacting with family and friends is better than being on the computer. If you were in your family's shoes, do you think that they would rather have you come hang out with them or be on the computer? When I was younger, @CAPS1 family used to have to yell at me to get me off the computer so I could hang out with them, but finally a day came when I got to understand their family pain. @CAPS1 mom says that ""I should hang out with @CAPS1 family and friends more often."" @NUM3 out of @PERCENT3 of @CAPS1 family members and friends agree with @CAPS1 mom. In @CAPS1 conclusion, I disagree with the statement ""Some people support advances in technology and believe that computers have a positive effect on people."" @CAPS1 reason as to why is that people aren't getting enough sleep, spending less time exercising, and spending less time interacting with friends and family."
305	305	1	3	"Computers, a very much talked - about subject. Did you know that @PERCENT1 of homes in @LOCATION1 own at least one computer? And that goes for about @PERCENT2 in @LOCATION2. Some people don't like that this is true, but on the other hand, some people do. I have a computer, and it can do so much. For example, it can help me with writing. I can use it to type essays, reports, and stories. At school in English, I would use my computer to help me with a writing prompt. I also use it to write conclusions for science labs. There are a lot of other kids that do this as well. It really is very helpful. That is only one of the reasons I think computers are beneficial to society. Another reason I think computers are beneficial to society is because you can play games on them, like ""World of Warcraft"", ""@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @NUM1"", or classics like ""@CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5"". There are millions of people that play games on the computer. Also, you can socialize with social networking sites, like @CAPS6 and Twitter, and also because you can ""I.M."" your friends. I.M. stands for instant messaging, and it is kind of like email except it is just about instantaneous, and so you and your friend can have a conversation over the computer. Also, there is video - chatting, where it is kind of like a phone except you can see the person you're talking to, and it is over the computer. So it is almost like you and the person you are video - chatting with are meeting face - to - face, but you're not. A third reason I feel that computers are beneficial to society is because you can order a product over the internet from shop websites. For example, I got my @CAPS8 from @LOCATION3, and also the bulb for a @CAPS9 in my house is"
306	306	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, Computers are truly important for growth. They effectively teach us essential skills like hand - eye coordination. When using a computer, we constantly interact with the screen and input devices, which directly enhances this crucial skill. Moreover, they offer a vast platform that allows you to talk online with people from all corners of the world. Through various online platforms, you can learn about faraway people and their unique cultures, as well as explore different places virtually. I firmly do believe that it benefits society even though many people don't share this view. Nine out of @NUM1 schools use computers on a daily basis, and their community is still thriving. I know you think it's taking away real social time, but in fact, it really is improving the community. Imagine a student playing basketball, and his teammate passes the ball to him, but he can't catch it because he has no hand - eye coordination skills. That wouldn't happen to him if he spent more time on the computer. There are numerous coordination games on the internet, like pinball of @CAPS1, that help build up this skill. When you play those games, you keep your hand on the mouse or keyboard and your eyes on the screen. It helps you to maintain focus and not look down. When you play basketball, if you have good coordination, you can catch the ball and still throw it accurately. A significant number out of @NUM1 people keep in touch with family or friends online. It's the greatest feeling when you talk to someone you haven't seen in awhile because you know that they still remember you. When you talk to people online, you get to know them better, and they tell you things that they don't want others to know. Also, when you meet up with them, you have more things to talk about. What would happen if you were to go to a location that you thought was nice, but it turned out to be the worst place ever? It would be terrible, but if you looked it up on the internet, you would know the truth about it. Let's say you want to know about someone famous, you simply look it up on the computer. There are many educational things on the computer that can help you out in life. I do agree with you on one thing. Society is losing its communication skills. Being on the computer all the time isn't doing anyone good. Nobody's picking up the phone and calling their friends to talk. They are distancing themselves from everyone but their computer. We don't want our society to stay this way. The people who spend their day on the computer need to change. I think computers are an asset to the community. Many people believe that computers are ruining everything, but they really aren't. Computers are good for learning about people and places. The question is, do you want people to refrain from using computers? Now is the time to decide, do you want us to use computers to further our education or not? In conclusion, computers, when used in moderation, can bring great benefits to our lives and education, and we should make a wise choice about their usage.
307	307	1	3	"Dear local newspaper, This world is currently filled with a wide variety of electronics. These days, the computer has become the latest and most popular hit. But even though it's extremely popular, is it really the best item to have? Many children and even adults are deeply hooked onto the computer. It is gradually taking away their real - life experiences. Four out of five people each year are losing interest in going outside to play. That's not the way you should spend your life. We all sincerely want our children to be active and healthy, not become a couch potato. Each day, more kids are getting addicted to the computer. Now, every time a parent needs to punish or ""ground"" their child, they take away the electronics. What ever happened to grounding them from going to hang out with their friends or just playing outside? Another horrifying consequence that the computer has on us is that it rips us apart from our loved ones. Kids are more worried about ""@CAPS1"" or ""@CAPS2"" or even trying to slay a dragon in a game than spending quality time with their family. They would unhesitatingly pick the computer over someone who has been in their life forever. This computer is splitting families apart. Now, more families only spend time with each other when they eat dinner together. Also, rather than talking to their parents about a problem, kids are going to websites like ""@CAPS3"" or ""@CAPS4.com"". More people don't enjoy doing some things now because of the computer. Not many like going out and enjoying the beauty of nature. Some don't like reading anymore because they'd rather play games. Some people don't even want to pick up the phone and call for a pizza. Also, people who look for jobs don't go to the newspaper anymore; they go to the internet! The world is revolving around electronics. We need to end this before our kids or grandchildren start getting out of shape and start relying on the computer for everything. Do we really want to destroy this world and lose the precious bonding with our families? I say, make life better and get rid of computers! In conclusion, we should be aware of the negative impacts of computer over - use and take steps to restore a healthy balance in our lives."
308	308	1	3	I think computers are good because if you need to remember stuff, all you have to do is just look at their email, and they will then remember what they have to do. Also, it is incredibly useful if you are lost. All you need to do is quickly look at the map on the computer. If you need to finish a school project, you could do it on the computer by looking for the website of the project. The computer provides easy access to a vast amount of information related to the project. If you need to check a website about anything important, you could just type the website down, and it will show up on the computer screen instantly. And if your child doesn't have anything to do, they could play games on the computer, including math games, @CAPS1 games, and also they could look for knock - knock jokes. These games and content on the computer can not only entertain but also educate. In conclusion, computers offer many practical benefits in various aspects of our lives, such as memory - assistance, navigation, education, and entertainment.
309	309	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 @CAPS4, with all the talk about computers these days, I would have to whole - heartedly agree with the people who think it's taking up a lot more of our time. I hardly ever see people playing outside anymore because apparently computers are far more entertaining than being with your friends and family. Why do you think the obesity rate is so high these days? Well, there's one of the reasons. I recall when my parents were kids, they had no computers, and they went outside to enjoy the beautiful nature. Computers have their ups and downs, but I do not think they benefit our society. First reason being, computers are taking away the precious time to be with our friends and family. I remember when Facebook and @CAPS6 weren't created; those were the days when people actually did fun things with their friends and family. There was a recent study that showed since @DATE1, @PERCENT1 of all Americans use computers more than @NUM1 @CAPS2 a day for all sorts of different reasons. I think mainly computers were invented to make things easier, but nowadays all we use them for is social networking. My second biggest point as to why computers do not benefit our society is that over the past @NUM2 years, the obesity rate has gone up by @PERCENT3, and due to what cause? Eating unhealthy food and sitting in front of your computers all day without exercising. I am almost @PERCENT2 sure that if people stopped using computers, our world would be a healthier place. Don't you feel bad for those people who are stuck being overweight for their whole life because of these habits? I believe most people would feel bad. My last reason is that we have this amazing planet that no one seems to enjoy anymore because they use up all their time on computers. If only people got out every once in a while, they would realize they have been wasting their time. There's been a recent study that says @PERCENT4 of people are inside doing nothing all day! That's more than half!! I hope this will change sometime soon because computers have only created a nuisance to people, and now it seems like no one has any type of a real life. Computers have spread to all sorts of societies, but please let it not take over this friendly town of @CAPS1. In conclusion, we should be more aware of the negative impacts of excessive computer use and take steps to regain a healthy and balanced lifestyle.
310	310	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION3, In a poll conducted by the @ORGANIZATION2 (@CAPS1), @PERCENT1 @ORGANIZATION1 people agreed that computers are a much easier way to research than going to a library. Over the @DATE1 few years, it has become a growing debate as to whether computers are a benefit to society or not. Today in America, over @PERCENT2 @ORGANIZATION1 all people own a computer. According to the @ORGANIZATION1, computers are most definitely a benefit to today's society for the reasons that it allows better and easier world communications, makes text and information more readily available to the public, and allows for the advancements in technology that are necessary. Communication is a vital part of America and the world in this day and age. Communication is solely run by the computer. Computers provide better and faster communication. They are also far more reliable. In the @DATE2's, if you wanted to speak with someone who is far away, you would have to send a letter. Along with sending a letter is the risks that it will not get there, it will be stolen in the mail, and of course, the time that it would take to get there. All these problems are solved in today's email and instant messaging (@CAPS2). They are reliable, can't be stolen, and can go across the globe in seconds. Computers are not only a way for communication but also one of the most prominent ways to research. Without the internet, people would need to go to the library and run the risk of the book not being there or the library being closed. Through the internet, all the information in the world is available @NUM1. Computers are also the driving force in today's technological advances. Computers allow us to have inventions that run themselves so human operation is not necessary. This same technology saves lives every day and allows us to create even better technology. As you can see, computers are the greatest technology created in the @DATE1 and allows faster and more reliable communication, is the greatest library the world has ever known, and allows for the creation of even more advanced technologies. Computers are an extreme benefit to society and necessary in this era. In conclusion, computers have become an indispensable part of our society, bringing numerous advantages in communication, research, and technology, and we should embrace and make good use of them.
311	311	1	3	Dear Newspaper editor, I think that computers are extremely beneficial for everyone. First of all, with just a click, you can learn about places that are scattered around the world. Also, you can easily communicate with friends and family no matter the distance. Finally, it makes your daily life so much easier. Here are some reasons why you should get a computer for your family. First, you can instantly learn about things you didn't even know were real. You can explore ancient civilizations, discover different cultures, and find different recipes for tonight's dinner. You can also get help with school work. If you need to learn about the historical events of @LOCATION1, all you have to do is type it in. If you need to learn your multiplication table, you type it in and it will show up in a matter of seconds. The internet is highly useful for searching up all types of things. Secondly, you can talk to your family members and friends on the internet. I've heard a lot of people saying people need to spend more time with their family. So on the computer, you can talk to someone in @LOCATION2, and everywhere else. It's like a pen pal but you don't waste money buying envelopes and stamps to send a letter. Computers cost a lot of money but it is worth it. You can do almost everything on the computer. Lastly, if you get a computer it makes your life so much easier. Instead of going to the library and getting a cook book, you can type in dinner recipes for chicken. Your computer will come up with hundreds of different ways to make a delicious chicken for dinner. You can tell a friend that you can't make it to their party. Also, it can help you review the homework you did. If you buy a computer, your life would be more relaxing. In conclusion, you should buy a computer. If you do, you will learn so many things. It's like having a book with everything you will ever need or want to know. This is why computers are good to have and be on for a reasonable amount of time.
312	312	1	3	Dear, @LOCATION1 @CAPS1 I think the use of computers is good, and here are some reasons why. My first reason is that you can easily find stuff online. For instance, if you can't find a job in your local area, you can go online and search through numerous job portals to find suitable opportunities. If you want to go to college but you have a busy schedule with no time for traditional classes, you can take online courses from the comfort of your home. These are clear details to support my reason. My second reason is that computers are so much fun. To me, they are fun because when you are bored, you can play a wide variety of games, ranging from action - packed adventures to mind - challenging puzzles. If you are not a game person, you can participate in surveys or find out interesting facts about different topics. That's how I can back up my second reason. My third reason is that you can meet @LOCATION1 people. You can meet @LOCATION1 people by searching them up if you are trying to find an old friend. Or there are social networking platforms such as MySpace, Facebook, Twitter etc., which provide a great opportunity to meet @LOCATION1 people. Mostly everyone would like to meet new @LOCATION1 people. To end this, my first reason was that you can find stuff online, my second reason was that you can have fun, and my last reason was that you can meet @LOCATION1 people. In conclusion, the use of computers offers these great benefits, making them a valuable addition to our lives.
313	314	1	3	"I believe computers aren't having a positive effect on people in this time period. For some people, they've really taken over their lives. There are many health concerns that arise in a generation full of computers. Also, there is less time in your schedule for more important things when you're addicted to Facebook. Also, money will always be in short supply when computers come along! Computers can really be dangerous to your health! For example, all that continuous typing can lead to arthritis in the hands and fingers in the long run. Did you know that more seizures are induced by computers than in epileptics? Dr. @LOCATION1 is saying ""People don't cause obesity, computers do"". @CAPS1 also thinks that the majority of the obesity is caused by an addiction to computer games. Ever been depressed then taken a long nature walk and felt great? Well, a lot of people only rely on their computer when they're down. Computers usually make things worse. When you're on Twitter, Facebook, Google, and YouTube all the time, it's hard to find time for even the most important things. For example, if you're a parent, your child might feel abandoned if you start caring about the computer more than spending quality time with them. That very little time spent together could turn them to alcohol or smoking. I bet you never thought of a computer like that! Computers can be a good way to wind down but they can also become an addiction. When you're addicted to sitting on a computer, you forget about the beauty of nature! Money can also contribute to the addiction. For example, shopping addictions are a common way to blow money because it's so easy. All you have to do is type in a credit card number, which gives you the illusion that you're not spending money, until the bill comes! Another thing is kids' websites like Webkinz which you need to pay for. You also need to pay for the internet and the electricity bill. It's clear to see that computers cause nothing but health problems, less time in your daily schedule, and take money out of your pocket. To me, computers are just a trouble in our lives. In conclusion, we should be more cautious about our computer usage to avoid these negative impacts."
314	315	1	3	Newspaper and Readers, Computers are a very large part of our lives and society. However, there are still people who think that computers do harm. Actually, there are many positive effects that computers have on people. Among those effects are the ease of communication, the ease of gathering information, and the ease of finding entertainment. Computers have far more positive than negative effects. Computers have made communication extremely easy for people. There are so many different means of communication using the computer, which are all free. For example, instant messaging allows you to have real - time conversations with your contacts. @CAPS1 - mail is a great way to send detailed information and documents. Video chat enables you to see and talk to your friends and family as if they were right in front of you. Chat rooms are places where you can meet new people with similar interests. @CAPS2 (and other social networking sites) help you stay connected with a large network of friends and acquaintances. The positive effect that this has on people is that it allows them to stay in touch with people whom they might not otherwise due to financial or convenience issues. Being social is healthy for people and therefore communication is a positive effect of computers. Information is far easier to acquire when a computer is used. For example, if a kid needed to know about the climate of the @CAPS3 @CAPS4.S for his social studies project, instead of having to get in his mom's car, drive all the way to the town library, and spend time looking for the book, he could just log on to @ORGANIZATION1 and access a wealth of information from there. This is a positive effect on him because it saves him some time and effort. Furthermore, much more useful information can be found on the internet as well, such as flight times, prices of products, details about restaurants, stock market trends, weather forecasts, news updates, and basically any fact that you need to know. All these things make having a computer a very positive thing in somebody's life. Computers are a great source of entertainment. In this economy, I know we all could benefit from not having to pay rental fees for movies and high prices for your Xbox or PlayStation games. Internet gaming is very amusing and you can find many good games for free. In addition to that, there are websites that offer free movies and television shows to be streamed right to your computer. These things are a great solution to the rising cost of entertainment. Saving money and enjoying good entertainment are both positive effects on people, and both are offered by computers. I hope now that readers of this newspaper will now understand how good computers are. Next time you are facing a late fee on a library book or movie, remember that the internet and your computer have offered an alternative. In conclusion, computers bring numerous positive impacts to our lives in terms of communication, information access, and entertainment.
315	316	1	3	"To whom it @MONTH1 concern, Computers are beneficial to society. They promote learning, coordination, and even general welfare. It is true that computers @MONTH1 be detrimental to a person's health, affecting the amount of exercise and interaction a person gets, but the positive effects of computers more than make up for this. People learn a vast amount of knowledge from the computer. Among an infinite number of things a person can learn from them are definitions of new words, complex scientific theories, algebraic equations, detailed history, various laws, and any number of languages. Computers, when used for learning, can teach people things they @MONTH1 not learn comprehensively in school, but on their own time. They exercise the brain and teach it to think beyond the boundaries of ""@NUM1."" They also teach the brain how to better direct the body to face its needs. Coordination can be very hard for some people, and this can be a problem. Without coordination, people wouldn't be able to catch a ball, avoid certain dangers, or even stand steadily. To help improve this, people need practice. They can get this practice from activities like catching a ball, threading a needle, or using a computer. Using the mouse on a computer can help with hand - eye coordination in that it forces the brain to precisely direct the mouse to a certain place on the screen, in order to accomplish what is needed to be done. At first, this process @MONTH1 be extremely slow, but over time, as the brain gets more practice, coordination improves and the process speeds up. @CAPS1, the person will be able to use the computer faster and more efficiently. This will help them play games, learn, or even help people when they are in need. Helping people is very important in this day and age. That's why it is important for people to find out news quickly so that they can help. Computers allow this. For example, on the day of the deadly earthquake in @LOCATION1, most of the world found out within the hour from computers. News sites broadcast it, social networking sites such as @CAPS2 talked about it, and people talked to each other online about it. This rapid spread of the news saved many lives in @LOCATION1 as people immediately dropped what they were doing and rushed to help. Computers affect people in that they help to send out news and stories causing them to want to help people. Many websites also are adept at donating money while playing a game. For example, www.freenke.org is a site that donates @NUM2 grains of rice for every question answered correctly, and they have donated over @NUM3 @CAPS3 grains of rice. Obviously, computers and sites like these have a positive effect on the world. Overall, one would think that computers have a mostly positive effect on the world. Despite limiting exercise, they encourage learning and the exercise of the brain. Computers also help people with their coordination, which is very important. Finally, computers promote a world where people want to help each other, and a world where people keep up with current events, whether they like it or not. Thank you, editor, for considering my side on the positive effects computers have on the world."
316	317	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2, do people benefit from the use of computers? Some individuals firmly state that using computers rather than exercising and being outside is a bad thing. They believe that the sedentary nature of computer use can lead to health issues. However, I personally believe that the use of computer technology is a good thing. Computers teach hand - eye coordination in a very effective way. When you play certain computer games, you need to precisely control the movement of the cursor on the screen, which sharpens this skill. They also help people learn a vast amount of knowledge. There is a wealth of educational resources available on the internet, from academic courses to historical documentaries. Moreover, computers allow people to communicate with others across the globe effortlessly. The use of computers not only teaches hand - eye coordination but also improves reaction time. Some say that being outside and exercising is better than using a computer, but many computer games are specifically designed to enhance hand - eye coordination. As you play computer games more and more, the time it takes for you to react to the game you are playing and hit the mouse button becomes very important. These skills could be extremely helpful in the activities you take part in and in everyday life. Personally, I play a lot of @CAPS3 @NUM1, a well - known computer gaming system. @CAPS3 has helped my hand - eye coordination greatly, and it has shown in the four sports that I play, such as basketball and tennis. Clearly, computers can be very helpful and can significantly improve your hand - eye coordination. Computers can also help people learn in numerous ways. There is a lot of content on the internet that simply can't be found in school. The ability to learn about foreign countries is a big part of learning as a student. I use the internet nearly every night to type my papers and find the information that I need. It has been a great aid to me as a student. Also, typing papers on computers is becoming the new norm instead of hand - writing. Teachers are beginning to require that school work is typed on a computer and printed. Documents can be saved so that they cannot be lost, unlike a hard copy written by hand. Although many believe that using a computer is a waste of time, it can also help you stay organized. Many people have calendars in their computers that send you reminders about your schedule. Your computer is also where your data like music and pictures can be safely saved. Computers are also very useful for learning and organizational purposes. We can communicate with others using computers. People use computer technology to communicate every day through @CAPS5, @CAPS6, and I - chat. If I need to know what our homework is or when practice is, I use my computer to ask someone for the answer. Before I began communicating with my computer, talking to others was much more difficult. Although many disagree with using computer technology, computers are often the primary way we communicate with foreign countries. When something happens overseas, the first way we find out about it is usually through a computer. It is essential for us to use computers to communicate with other nations. Clearly, computers are important for communication purposes. We must continue to use computers for multiple reasons. Although many disagree with the use of computers, their hand - eye coordination, communication, and learning purposes are very important. Without computer technology, we would function much differently. It is up to you to continue using computers, and embrace the many benefits they offer.
317	318	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2, do you think computers help society? I do. I strongly believe computers help society and are being used for very good purposes. They help people of all ages. It's easier for kids to look up information for @CAPS3, such as historical events or scientific concepts. This gives kids some good facts to help build knowledge. And not only would it help kids but it will help adults too. It's easy to see why adults think kids don't read enough. However, kids get more than enough reading done on the computer. Some parents think that just because kids aren't going to the library to take a book out for their report, they aren't gaining knowledge. But in fact, they are gaining knowledge because all of the things they could look up in a library they have available to them on the computer. Computers help kids around the world find things quickly and easily. Not only does the computer give them knowledge of things that happened in the past but also things happening in current times. It can also give kids information like weather updates that help to keep them safe. Over @PERCENT1 of the things you can find at the library you can find on the computer. Some parents think that kids aren't getting enough exercise. But nevertheless, they are also skipping out on a lot of knowledge and important facts. On the computer, you pick up a lot of facts such as weather updates, natural disasters, how to help others in need, and other very important facts. If it wasn't for computers, kids would not make up for all the knowledge they miss in school. They can make up for what they miss when they are absent. Computers help people everywhere gain knowledge. Not only have computers helped kids but they also help adults. They can do work over the computer, look at houses, cars, and lots of other important things. Certainly, @CAPS1, you would not want to take away all of the knowledge and help being given to both kids and adults on the computer. It helps adults especially keep things going in their busy lives. It also helps them make changes such as how they eat or act. @CAPS4 are some reasons people should not disapprove of computers because they help kids with @CAPS3, give kids important facts, and help people of all ages. Surely, some of @CAPS4 facts could help change people's views on the importance of computers in our society.
318	319	1	3	Computers definitely have a positive impact on society. They help organize your thoughts, which in turn helps reduce stress. So, they contain many inspirational articles which can convince kids to strive for success. Lastly, when all else fails, the computer can be a great way to relax and clear your mind. Computers help organize your thoughts, which helps reduce stress. Imagine you are working on a project in school. Everybody can add to it, and you can selectively choose which additions you want. In addition, you can also block the programs that you don't want. This device is called the computer, and it's changed @LOCATION1's society for the better. On average, @NUM1 out of @NUM2 @CAPS1 suffer from stress. Now if you organize your thoughts on the computer, and are able to look through them again, a huge burden is alleviated. Instead of worrying about thoughts you may or may not remember, you now have confidence that you can look back and find your thoughts right on your @CAPS2. Reduced stress leading to confidence has a positive effect on society. Also, the computer contains articles that can inspire our children to strive for their goals. Once a child read an article about @PERSON1, from @ORGANIZATION1 book. As an example, a student started using @PERSON1 as a role model in school. By observing games, I noticed how motivated the student became since starting to see @PERSON1 as a role model. The student is now making a stride for a @CAPS4. Where did this inspiration come from? Researching @PERSON1 on the internet. The internet, in this instance, obviously had a positive impact on @CAPS6 society. Lastly, when all else fails, you can rely on the computer to make stressful situations seem less overwhelming. If you have the ability to solve a problem, then why can't you solve it? Often times, the answer to this question is that the situation is too overwhelming. If you take a break, go on your computer, and relax with simple games available on a variety of websites. Now say you come back and attack the problem again. You continually chip away at it, and it no longer seems as overwhelming. Thank you, computer gods! The computer, in this instance, has made a positive impact on @CAPS6 society. So as you can tell, computers make a strong, positive impact on @CAPS6 society, and we should continue to embrace their use for the betterment of our lives.
319	320	1	3	Dear editor of the @ORGANIZATION1, In my opinion, I think people are spending too much time on technology because there are many people I know who stay on technology and don't even do work. Also, they are spending too much time on the computers and other things instead of taking time to exercise, enjoy nature, and interact with family and friends. People who stay too close to their technology will become addicted to it, and they will start to harm their brain cells. Sometimes people get locked out because too much information was given out or they did something that they weren't supposed to do. Downloading certain things also brings harm to your computer, like viruses that can crash the computer hard drive and system. There are many good and bad things about being on a computer. The bad things include stalkers, hackers, seizures, and blindness. Then the good thing about being on a computer is that it teaches hand - eye coordination. When you play games or use certain applications, you need to coordinate your hand movements with what you see on the screen. It gives people the ability to learn about faraway places and people. You can explore different cultures and historical events through various online resources. It even allows people to talk online with others like friends or family. In my life, it helps a little because I play lots of army games. So when I go out with my cousins and friends and we go laser - tagging in a sports complex, I use the same tactics that I learned to beat the other teams. It hurts some people's eyesight when all they are doing is staring directly at the screen. One experience was like @NUM1 months ago when I last stayed at my aunt's house. All my cousins did was stay on the game until they had to take a bath, clean, and eat. They didn't even go to sleep until eight in the @TIME1. Some parents should at least give an hour a day to play the game. For me, I only go on the computer for like twenty minutes, then log off and go back online later on in the day. In conclusion, while computers have their benefits, we should be more mindful of our usage to avoid the negative impacts and maintain a healthy balance in our lives.
320	321	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, my name is @PERSON1 and I will be talking about the wonderful impact computer technology has had on mankind. So many great discoveries and great topics have been found on the computer. Studies have shown that <@PERCENT1@NUM1> of families in the United States has at least one computer in their households. They are a great way to look up important information without going to the library and searching for hours. They are also a means to contact others, and let's face it, they make our life a whole lot easier. Imagine this! You're stressed and on edge. You have just spent @NUM2 hours searching for a topic on your upcoming history essay. You have a pounding headache and just want to quit. You're probably in the library reading through hundreds of books. Now imagine you being at home, with the computer sprawled across your lap. All it takes is a few taps on your keyboard and bam! Instant information. Now how easy was that? That's one of the great impacts computers have made on us, humanity. Computers are terrific to learn things with a fast pace to it. I personally have used computers to my advantage. You log on, go to Google, type the subject of knowledge, and it's just like you have a personal teacher in your own home. A local study has been underway. They have two groups, @CAPS6 A which has a library full of books and @CAPS6 @CAPS3, a group with a @CAPS4 @CAPS5. The scientists gave them all the same essays. @CAPS6 @CAPS3 had <@PERCENT1@NUM3> of students who have passed with flying colors, while @CAPS6 A had <@PERCENT1@NUM4> pass with a @CAPS9 or higher. That's important because higher grades mean higher test scores. Higher test scores equal funding. I think computers are the best invention and are not impairing humans; they are evolving them. Imagine this! You're sitting at home crying because your special other has moved far away from you. Well, computers are a great way to reconnect with that person. Computers have software where you can instant message, send emails, or even video - chat with that person. For even some business people, it's a way to have meetings without flying @NUM5 miles. I have @NUM2 aunts that I cannot live without. They are my strong support base, and I can't live without talking to them for a day. Without computers, I don't know what I would do. Scientists took surveys that @PERCENT1 of the @CAPS10.S.A has family in other states, countries, or even continents. They have to have some way to be in contact. My last reason is that I know we have to admit it, computers have made my and your life easier. Some jobs that have opened up are giving unemployed citizens a source of income on computers. <@PERCENT1@NUM1> of jobs rely on computers. Imagine a cashier counting all the money, a banker having to take time counting one by one other people's cash, a telemarketer calling with no way of information. All these ways and more show how computers have impacted us. Now let's see how computers have not only improved our learning ability, helped us connect with others, but also made our lives better. Computers are truly a remarkable invention that will continue to shape and enhance our lives in the future.
321	322	1	3	"Dear local newspaper, I believe the computer has a notably positive effect on people. It significantly helps students with their projects, enabling them to complete tasks more efficiently. It also helps people learn about other places in great detail. It helps you precisely find information on something you didn't know. A substantial 80 percent of all teachers give out computer projects. Most reading teachers will have you read a book and then type a well - structured essay or a detailed review about your book. Most teachers strongly prefer the essay typed and not written. By the teacher giving that assignment, he/she is giving the student the valuable ability to explore outside of always writing. And I firmly believe other students would whole - heartedly agree with me; it's definitely better to type the essay than to write it! Is there a place out there that you really want to know more about, that you hope to someday visit? Well, you can always conveniently use the computer to find out more about the place. You can use the computer to learn when the absolute best times to visit that place are. If you just heard on the news about a tragic accident like the earthquake over in Japan, and you want to keep in touch on what is happening in that place, you can use the computer. The computer will reliably keep you updated on what is happening there every single day. I'm sure almost every person has read a book and came across a word they did not know or a student had spelling words that they didn't know what the words meant. Well, you can easily use the computer to look up the words. The computer will give you the full, accurate definition and how to properly pronounce the word. Computers will effectively help you find any information you ever need, ""AND THAT'S A FACT!"" In conclusion, computers aren't just a thing that kids play on all day; it helps you with many important things like getting your work done, finding out about places, and finding out information about things you need to know, ""And that's why computers are truly amazing!"
322	323	1	3	Dear Editor, I feel as though computers have good effects on people. Throughout these next paragraphs, I will be clearly giving you all of my reasons on the things that computers help people do. I will be talking about how computers give people good typing skills, how they give information to people, and how they allow us to socialize. Over ninety - four percent of people today own a computer and truly feel as though they have learned many useful things from it. I bet you didn't know that! First off, I will be telling you about how computers help people type. The keyboard on a computer doesn't go alphabetically. This means that you have to practice more diligently to get better at typing. I remember the first time I tried to use the keyboard; it was extremely difficult, but as I tried more, I gradually got better. Once I got better, I realized where the keys were, and soon I didn't even have to look at the computer. All of it's parts help people by teaching them skills that they may need in the future. These skills will surely be needed in their job field. Computers are a very helpful device. The next thing I will be telling you about is how computers have information that is useful to people. It holds a vast amount of information and has websites when the internet is connected. The computer is like a treasure trove of knowledge. My final reason why computers have a good effect. If you need to talk to a friend but don't feel like calling them, you can just easily go on to a website and chat with them. There are so many chat websites that you just can't choose! Did you know what they are over one million of these kinds of websites? There is Facebook, Twitter just to name a few. This also gives people the great chance to socialize with people from all over the world. This in return causes people to have better social skills. Maybe they will become more friendly and become more outgoing. This is all because of one little thing, and that little thing is the computer! So as you can clearly see, computers have many wonderful effects on people. They help people get better at typing, give lots of information that people want to know, and help people get better social skills. Can't you just imagine the benefits of learning with a computer? And I don't know about you, but I can get a pretty clear image of that in my mind. Thanks for reading this and taking the time to consider what I say.
323	324	1	3	I think computers have significantly shaped America to what it is today. Computers help people learn in various ways, give people a great pastime, and all of that can be managed in a certain space of time so you still have plenty of time to go outside. Computers help everyone learn. It makes things much easier by typing up essays because you could type it faster and it's easier to make precise changes. Also, it's much cheaper to buy a computer and go on the internet and look up foreign countries than actually going there. Another example is that a computer teaches you excellent hand - eye coordination from typing and using the mouse. Finally, computers can teach you life lessons by reading well - written articles another person wrote. Computers give bored people great pastimes. One example is that you can play exciting computer games during rainy days or when you can't go outside. Also, you can talk to friends through popular platforms like Facebook or AIM. Another example is that you can talk to distant family in another country by using convenient programs such as Skype. Finally, you can order useful stuff online instead of wasting gas and going to the store, and the things you might order you can play with outside. A lot of people say computers keep kids inside, but they don't know that there are ways to prevent this. One example is you can use shut - off timers that keep anyone from going onto the computer for too long. Also, many people learn how to manage their time on the computer effectively. Another example is that parents can make strict rules that their children aren't allowed to play games on the computer on certain days and/or times. Finally, you can keep the computers in the family room so that children don't play with it all night in their room. Those are just some of the many reasons why computers help society. They help us learn, pass the time, and it can all be managed during a certain amount of time. Now reading this, I hope you firmly believe that computers benefit society as they truly are a valuable asset.
324	325	1	3	Dear Editor, In many ways computers are helpful, but, I don't support the use of them. The advance in technology has really taken away from people's lives all over the world. Some examples of this are lack of proper exercise, too much time spent inside, and not enough time spent with family and friends. Continue reading for more on why computers don't benefit society. As you know, when you use a computer, you usually sit in a chair to do so, correct? Well, this activity is doing only one thing, not keeping you healthy or in shape. I'm sure that you want to be healthy, and to be healthy, you must get some sort of exercise throughout your day, and sitting on the computer is not helping you one bit. So as you can clearly see, so far using computers is not beneficial to our society. Continue for more cons of using computers as much as they are used. Believe it or not, using a computer is unhealthy, and not beneficial, in more than one way. The reason for this is because, not only do you not get enough exercise, you won't go outside as much. You may be wondering as to why not going outside is unhealthy, but it is because you don't receive the needed amount of fresh air that you need to not be sick. Could you imagine the amount of people that would be sick if everyone used the computer for the majority of their day? Well, let's just say it wouldn't be fun to count them all. Now that you know two ways that computers are not beneficial to society, keep reading for one more way. As you probably know, it is a hard task to keep a big family close to each other, and using computers isn't going to do anything to help you. So, why use them? Trust me, spending quality time with your family and friends can be just as much, or even more fun than playing your favorite computer games, and in my opinion, your family should be the most valuable thing in your life, so don't lose them for a computer. Now that you have finished reading, I would like to thank you for your time reading this letter concerning, lack of exercise, too much time inside, and not enough time with family, which clearly shows that computers are not beneficial to society.
325	326	1	3	Dear Editor, I believe that computers are one of the most useful things that we can have. First, computers are good for communicating. Students can easily contact teachers through email if they have a question about an assignment. Computers also are useful for teaching. People use the Internet everyday to get information on their favorite sports teams or on a new recipe they saw on television. Finally, computers help us get work done easier. Students and employees use Microsoft Word for everything from writing a paper to creating a presentation. Furthermore, computers are extremely essential to our everyday life because they help us communicate, learn and finish work. Every year, thousands of students go to college, and thousands of families move away from each other. Computers are one way of communicating to our loved ones in far - away places. Parents send messages via email to their children at college. Families speak with each other through Skype. Computers are what makes all this possible. Not only can we use computers to make contact with our families, but we can also use them to speak with our teachers. Whenever a student is sick, but wants to get their homework finished, they look on their teacher's website. Here, all the homework for the class is listed. Also, if a student has a paper due on Friday, but their printer is broken, they can email the paper to the teacher. This allows the student to get full credit for their work. Email is not only useful for handing in projects, but also for asking questions about the assignments. If a student has a question about an assignment, he or she can ask a friend or the teacher. Then, the student will be able to successfully complete the project. Computers are one of the most useful ways of making contact today, but communication is not the computer's only purpose. The average person goes on the Internet ten times a week just to get information. Computers provide a plethora of knowledge for people's use. Search engines like Google or Yahoo provide answers in less than one second. This is much faster than going in the library and spending an hour looking it up. Website text is not the only thing that provides information for eager learners; images also provide pictures to further the person's understanding about a topic. For example, if a person is living in the United States, and has lived there all their life, but is reading an article on a website about an animal native to Australia, they would not know how to picture it in their head. Articles and books may provide a description, but nothing really gives the person a solid picture. The person could go online and search for a picture, which they will surely find. Finally, computers keep the brain active. While searching on a website, a person could piece together information from different sites to create a better picture, and, therefore, have a more complete and thorough understanding. In order to do this, however, a person's brain must constantly be working. This helps develop skills later on such as problem - solving. Overall, computers are one of the most useful and common of the learning devices. Many people say that computers are useful. They agree this by saying that work gets done so much easier and faster on a computer. On average, computers complete work fifty times more efficiently than people do by hand. This is because of programs such as Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. These programs allow people to correct spelling and grammatical mistakes while at the same time creating a neat - looking presentation. Studies show that 80% of people with bad spelling or grammatical habits corrected their mistakes quickly through PowerPoint and Word. If people constantly make grammatical or spelling errors, then having them underlined in Word will show them that this is not the correct way to punctuate or spell something in a sentence. In conclusion, computers are truly indispensable in our lives due to their multiple benefits in communication, learning, and work - efficiency.
326	327	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, Computers can have a positive effect or a negative effect on people. It all depends on how you look at it and what type of person you are. You can firmly say computers have a very positive effect on people or strongly say computers have a very negative effect on people. My opinion is that computers have a positive effect on people, and you can't simply say that I'm just a kid who plays on it all the time. Well, that might be true to some extent. However, using a computer can teach you hand - eye coordination. For @CAPS2, what I am doing right now is steadily learning to type faster and faster. Another aspect for @CAPS2 is that some people are faster at typing than writing, while some people write faster than type. Me personally, I'm faster at typing than writing. My final reason is that after a hard day at school or work, you can come home, play some soothing music and relax. It is a really good idea to learn how to type fast. For instance, if you are writing a story for school and you just started it, and it is due tomorrow. What are you going to do? Well, if you started to type when you were younger, by the time you are in middle school, you could type really fast. That way, you could finish your story in time. This clearly means you should learn how to type faster. Some people prefer to write than type, but other people prefer to type than write. I personally prefer to type than write, but that is just my preference. Let's say a friend of mine likes to write more than type, that is perfectly okay. We won't stop being friends because of this; we'll just have different preferences, that's all. This means some people prefer to write than type. This often happens as after a hard day at school or work, you can come home, use the computer to play some music and relax. You can play all the music you want and, as well as do other things at the same time. For @CAPS2, I often play music and talk to my friends simultaneously. I also @CAPS3 use it to do homework. In conclusion, it is a good idea to keep computers for use. People can still enjoy nature as well as computers at the same time. Overall, computers have a positive effect on people.
327	328	1	3	What I think about computers benefiting our community is truly great. Technology has advanced significantly over the years. The most important technological advancement is undoubtedly the computer. Most schools now have computers. The reason is that they bring numerous benefits to society. They are a huge saver in terms of paper. You can also learn more things about places @CAPS1 and anything else. These reasons strongly support why we need to have computers. Computers benefit our community by saving a large amount of paper. It also makes our work look neater. We can easily talk to friends and family members. The main reason is that it provides more jobs for computer technicians. People need more jobs, and computers also offer a platform for getting news. For example, if the mayor needs to send an important message about water pollution, he can do that through email. The main thing today in our society is going green. The only way we can achieve that is by switching to using computers. We have to chop down so many trees just to get @NUM1 paper for each kid in the grade. Adults should understand that we need to conserve paper. Now I know what you're thinking: what if we need to print something? My response is that you can just email it to a teacher, friend, or anyone else. Kids these days need to learn more about other cultures. We need to know about their economies. The fastest way we can do that is through the internet. It is so much faster than looking through thousands of books. All you have to do is type the place you want, and boom, there it is. There are many benefits to having a computer. My final reason is that it also gives you great hand - eye coordination. And if you want to be an athlete, then you need a lot of it. How the computer gives you hand - eye coordination is through typing and moving the mouse. The best way is to play lots of educational video games. With all the facts and statements I've given you, like benefiting the community, going green, and also learning about other places, please consider these facts when you are writing your article.
328	329	1	3	Dear town @CAPS1 paper, I would have to firmly pick being for computers. There are a couple of solid reasons why I'm for computers, and they are being able to conveniently talk to friends online, being able to efficiently learn stuff, and you can also enjoy playing video games. One reason that I would be for computers is so you can easily talk to friends online. So if you have a Facebook or MySpace account, you can talk to your friends all day if you wanted to. What I mean is simply by typing in what you want to say to your friend, they will receive those exact words, and then they'll reply. For example, if you just wanted to say hi, then your friend would look at his/her messages and just reply. So being able to talk to friends online is one clear example of why I'm for computers. Another reason that I would be all for computers is being able to effectively learn things. So if you wanted to learn a language, then you would go to Google or something similar and try to find a fast and easy - to - use site. What I mean is if you go to Google, a whole bunch of sites will come up. So what you want to do is find the fastest and easiest site for you. So being able to learn important things like a language is another reason I'm for computers. The last reason for me picking computers is because you can have fun playing video games. What I mean is if you were bored and had no one to talk to, then you can get on your computer and play a mind - numbing game or an educational game for class. For example, in science class, we played a game on the computer that had to do with gravity, and that was what we were learning about, so it was an educational game. So that is the last reason why I'm for computers. I'm for computers because you can play games. So now you know why I'm all for computers. I am for computers because you can talk to friends online, learn stuff, and play video games.
329	330	1	3	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I understand that there is a big discussion going on about if computers have a positive effect on people. I firmly believe that computers do not have a positive effect on people because children on the computers are not safe, they are spending too much time on the computer, and the programs and internet for the computer cost too much money. First, computers have a negative effect on people, including children, because computers are not safe. With all this @ORGANIZATION1 technology, child predators can easily go onto Facebook or another website and find out everything about you. This has happened to many people. Some predator went onto my friend @PERSON2's Facebook page and found out his birthday, where he lived, and what school he went to. This guy sent @PERSON2 a threat saying that something was going to happen to him. Luckily, with the help of the police, they were able to find this guy and arrest him before he got to @PERSON2. These days, this kind of thing is happening all the time. More than @PERCENT1 of @CAPS3 give all of their information away on these websites, and child predators have looked at them. @PERSON1 states that ""@CAPS1 this @ORGANIZATION1 technology has helped, but the negativity it has had on society outweighs @DR1 the good the computer is doing."" @CAPS2 @ORGANIZATION1, do you want @CAPS3 to get taken by these child predators who know everything they need to know because of the computer? Another reason why computers have had a negative effect on people is because @CAPS3 are spending an excessive amount of time on the computer and not enough time doing homework and exercising outside. These @ORGANIZATION1 websites that give @CAPS3 the ability to talk with friends and play games have made @CAPS3 lazy and addicted to the computer. My friend, when he was little, would play outside for hours and hours at a time. He would play all different kinds of sports with his neighbor. Now @PERSON3 is older, and all he does is sit on the computer until his parents have to force him off of the computer for dinner time. @PERSON3's grades have dropped tremendously, and he has gotten very chubby compared to what he used to look like. Statistics show that more than @PERCENT2 of @CAPS3 have gained weight due to not exercising, and their grades have dropped @NUM1 on a @NUM2 grading scale. Dr. @DR1 Much says that, ""@CAPS3 have forgotten the fun in playing outside and lost the determination they had to do well in school. This is all because of these @ORGANIZATION1 computers. @CAPS2 @CAPS3 now can go to any website and do anything on that website."" @LOCATION1 @ORGANIZATION1, do you want your @CAPS3 to gain weight and stop doing well in school? Lastly, computers have had a negative effect on society because of money. Many families have spent thousands and thousands of dollars on buying the computers and getting @CAPS1 them fixed. These @ORGANIZATION1 computers are extremely expensive. They range from @MONEY3@NUM3 for a @CAPS4 computer. Then each family has to buy the software and programs to go with the computer. A close family friend of ours just bought a computer. They bought a @CAPS5 that costs @MONEY2. On top of that, they spent @MONEY3 on all the programs they needed for the computer. This family cannot really afford this computer, but they think that they need one. @CAPS2 they have even dipped into the college fund for money. Now their kid has to go to a cheap school @CAPS2 their family won't be able to support better education. Statistics show that @PERCENT3 of families have wasted their college money on computers because the family thinks they need a computer. Dr. @DR2 @CAPS6 says, ""families do not need computers, yet they waste their college money on them. @CAPS2 @ORGANIZATION1, do you think that money from a college fund is worth a computer? Computers are not worth risking your children's future."
330	331	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, A recent study by scientists clearly shows that too much sitting down, especially in front of computers, is dangerous to health. This is only one reason why I think that, although they are useful, computers are not entirely beneficial to our society. They hinder us from exercising, interacting with nature, and spending time with family and friends. Exercising, as we all well know, is absolutely necessary to remain as a fit and healthy human being. But how is this possible when some people go to work every day and are shut in their offices at their computers all day long? Too much computer time, even for kids, can lead to obesity and overweightness. Also, like I mentioned before, scientists have concluded that too much sitting is bad for you. It isn't how the human body was built to function. If you have seen the movie @ORGANIZATION1's most recent production, it's easy to understand the point. The humans in that movie, after relying on computers for so long, became extremely obese and fat and had no muscle. This is, of course, an exaggeration, but minor versions of this are happening around the world. Going outside instead of sitting at a computer is a sure - fire way to stay healthy. The next thing that computers restrict us in is our ability to truly experience nature. Even high - tech simulations don't provide the real thing. If you wanted to see a frog or some other animal, you can't just @ORGANIZATION2 it; you should look for it in the real world. Developing a connection to nature can really nurture a sense of well - being and health. Instead of exploring a computer, explore the world as we know it before it's or you're too old. Learn how to do something by hands - on experience. Instead of hiring someone to make something, make it yourself. Do it to learn it, don't just sit at a computer website to hire someone! Get up and get outside! As you become more dependent on your computer, you become less dependent on family and friends. It causes there to be a rift between family members. Your family might not be able to help you when you're in need. If you're an adult, and you're on the computer all the time for something other than work, then you're not supporting your family. You have no proper income, no fulfilling life, and no promising future. Why would anyone do this to themselves? Imagine this: You have nothing except your laptop. You're isolated, and you have no real family relations. Nobody wants to be that kind of loser living on the streets! You have nobody and nothing except for your computer, and you've wasted your life away. Too much time on your computer means that everyone around you suffers. To sum it all up, computers may have their uses, but every single cloud has a dark lining. Computers stop us from exercising, interacting with nature, and being with our families. So, get outside and live a more balanced life.
331	332	1	3	"Imagine a world without computers. There would be chaos in war, and even the clutter on your desk would seem unmanageable. The chat you're having with your best friend on AIM wouldn't be happening. The report on @LOCATION1 might not get done because all the books were checked out. In fact, we wouldn't have novels or any space program without computers. I know if this happened, I wouldn't be happy. Companies almost entirely rely on technology. You can't just send a letter and have @CAPS2 at the office in five minutes. Communication through the computer is very popular. @PERCENT1 of the world uses AIM or another chat service. In a study done by a @CAPS1 professor, @NUM1 out of every student doesn't talk to family on the AIM service. A quote from the professor said, ""@CAPS2 is a good thing to stay in touch with their families as well as keeping up to date on current events."" If computers are taken away, information is gone. It's all lost in some pile of papers. @DATE1 time my computer crashed and I had a report due, but all the books were gone. That report was done @DATE1 when they were fixed. Now thanks to the new computer, @CAPS3 is @PERCENT2 more organized, and NASA is running on Mars. NASA runs completely by computers. Look what they have given us today. @PERCENT3 of all household appliances come from NASA's work. A comment from NASA implies @PERSON1, ""@CAPS4 would be no cars or phones without us, their computers too."" If that's true, are they going to take away cars and phones as well? We need you, the people, to decide. The people who made this country what @CAPS2 is to decide. Do you think we shouldn't have computers? I don't, and neither should you. Computers have become an integral part of our lives, and the thought of living without them is almost unimaginable. We should recognize their importance and continue to embrace the technology they offer."
332	333	1	3	"Dear local newspaper, Computers have a lot of effects on people. Some effects are that it takes away from family and friends. You don't really have a proper social life, and you don't get enough exercise. Computers take away from friends and family time. I did an interview yesterday with @PERSON1, and I asked, ""@CAPS1 you go over your grandma's house, what do you usually do?"" @CAPS2 said, ""I usually use the computer."" I then asked, ""Do you want to use the computer while you're there? You're with your family; you're supposed to spend time with them. Play a game like Monopoly, or play @CAPS4. Those are fun and great ways to interact with your family. If your family member doesn't have those games, bring them!"" People think that because there is Facebook, AIM, e - mail, and MySpace, they are interacting with friends. You really aren't. I asked my friend @PERSON3 what @CAPS2 thought of those things, and @CAPS2 said, ""They are great interacting websites."" They really aren't. They are websites on the computer. While you are on the computer, you're not really maintaining a social life. Your town holds activities or has a fun place you could go to. Your town @MONTH1 have a gym, community center, or a library. Go there and hang out with friends, interact with them. Going to school, going to the library, and hanging out with friends are great ways to interact with people. People don't think about @CAPS1 you're sitting in your computer chair and @CAPS5. While you're sitting in the chair, you're not exercising. @CAPS1 you keep @CAPS5, you're gaining weight. You might get fatter @CAPS1 you're stuffing your face with Cheez - its and not exercising. I asked @PERSON2 a question. It was, ""What do you do while you're on the computer?"" @CAPS2 said, ""I eat."" Eating isn't bad, but @CAPS1 you're not really paying attention, you eat more than you need. Your town has rec leagues of sports such as @CAPS6, softball, and baseball. Join a team instead of playing on the computer and @CAPS5. Get active! Computers aren't the greatest things in the world. You don't stay fit with them, you aren't very social, and you don't really spend time with your family. Computers don't really help you grow up and be mature for the future. We should limit our computer use and focus on real - life interactions and physical activities."
333	334	1	3	@ORGANIZATION1, The use of computers per family has increased greatly in the past @NUM1 years. In that same time, people are getting fatter and they need more exercise. If you use the computer, it might break or not work properly. Computers are a big waste of time and a bigger waste of money. In the past @NUM1 years, many people @MONTH1 have gained a lot of weight. They do not do regular activities like going to the supermarket because you can shop online. Studies show that if you go to the supermarket or a store, you are likely to be less fat than if you shop online. Another reason why computers don't give you exercise is because of Google. If you wanted to see a picture of a beautiful mountain, you could just go to Google and type it in. It is a much easier way to see sights, but if you walk to see the actual mountain, you could burn up to @NUM3 times as much calories as if you just look it up on Google. Another reason why computers don't give you exercise is that you can get addicted to a game. Let's say that you have basketball practice at @NUM1:00 pm. If you go on the computer at @NUM5, then you could easily get addicted to a game and forget you have practice. You would be stuck on your computer mindlessly typing away on a computer game that doesn't help you anywhere in life. When you don't go to practice, you will not sweat and therefore gain extra weight. Scientists say that if you actually play a sport, you can lose weight by up to @PERCENT1 compared to if you didn't. Before there were computers, life was simple. No student forgot their homework. But now, when they use their computers, many things can go wrong. First, the printer can break. @CAPS1 year, my printer stopped working @NUM1 times, so I could not do my homework. My teacher said that forgetting my homework affected my grade by over @PERCENT2. Another reason why handwriting is more convenient is that you are capable of doing writing during school. @CAPS1 year with my teacher @PERSON1, I had to write a prompt. She told me to go to the computer lab and type it, but all the computers were taken. When I got downstairs, she told me I had to write it, so I got a @NUM7 because she could not read what I wrote. Every other kid got a @NUM8 or above, but since I was not used to writing, it affected my grade. Another reason why computers are inconvenient is when you need to do research. My parents got rid of our books a while ago because of computers. So one day when I was home alone, I had to research euthanizing dogs on the computer, but there was a power outage. I could not do my @ORGANIZATION1 events for science, so I got a @NUM9 on it. That grade brought my average down from an A+ to an A-. The only reason why I got a bad grade was because I depended on the computer for research, and it let me down. If I had better handwriting, I would have gotten a better grade. The final reason why computers do not benefit society is because they are a waste of money. Most computers cost up to @MONEY1 for the computer and installation. There is no need for them because everything computers have, a library can give. The library has books so you can research with books instead of computers. In my house, all @NUM7 people in my family have a computer, but @NUM11 of the computers are used once a week. They are extremely expensive, and there is no need for them. Also, my dad works at a computer store, and he says that the computer people are overcharging by @PERCENT3. With that extra @MONEY2, you could buy many books and magazines instead of a computer. That is why computers are not useful. People are not getting exercise, so they gain @PERCENT1 more weight. It is much less convenient than writing by hand. Finally, they are a major waste of money. We should reconsider our over - reliance on computers and look for more traditional and cost - effective ways to meet our needs.
334	335	1	3	"Dear @CITY1 @ORGANIZATION1, At first, I was unsure if I was with or against people using computers. But after I thought about it, I decided that I was against using computers. For the same reasons, safety, education, and sites that are not appropriate to see. I know many people @MONTH1 think, ""How come using a computer is not safe?"" Well, even though you are not talking to someone in person and only on the computer, what you do over the computer is not safe. The reason why is that most of the time, there could be someone who is thirty, and we might think they are @NUM1 - @DATE1. We use those ages because kids are the main ones on @CAPS2 MySpace. But he could put up another picture of a young person, and we start thinking to meet up with him, and something bad could happen. For example, my friend who was on MySpace was talking to a forty - one - year - old, and then they met up, but she did not know his age, and she was raped. Not everybody is true over the computer. Education is very important, even for adults and children. Being on the computer is not going to bring our education up; it's going to bring it down. The reason why this is so is that most @DATE1 through @NUM3, kids come home from school, put their bookbag down, eat, and then go straight on MySpace, @CAPS2, @CAPS5 instead of studying, reading, or doing their homework. Even though those websites do help you learn, but only about things like reading messages on @CAPS2, looking at people's comments on @CAPS5. Like for example, I would go on instead of learning new and useful information. Learning brings achievement, a computer brings not succeeding. There is not much I can say about sites that are not appropriate. All I can say is watch what you click on and see on MySpace because you might just stumble into something you're not supposed to, such as the rape that went on. Be careful. We need to be vigilant about our computer use, especially when it comes to our safety and education. We should not let the computer become a source of harm but rather use it in a responsible way."
335	336	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1, ""@CAPS2 at @CAPS3 killed in a horrific accident"" is the title that flashes across the screen. Then another, and another. What is supposed to be @NUM1 minutes grows into an hour or two that take away from your family. I can see why this @MONTH1 brings up many conflicts, as computers can be very helpful. However, I feel that more often they negatively impact the general public. For one, there are many sites out there that portray false information. Plus, computers begin to consume the rest of people's lives. When it comes to these technological devices, there are pros, but the cons can easily outweigh them. To start, computers are loaded with viruses, scams, and internet predators. So easily someone can steal credit and information by placing offers that seem ""too good to be true."" If you listen to your instincts, then you'll know that they are. But, many people who don't know any better fall for these traps. In fact, @NUM2 out of @NUM3 people have been scammed some time in their life. I can clearly remember when someone I know thought they were buying a pair of boots. Later that day, they got a call from the credit card company warning them about the purchase. These days, you have to be so careful when you're on the computers. When my friends and I were learning about evaluating websites in computer processing class, we came upon a site that seemed reliable and accurate. We were all shocked when we learned that everything about it was fake. Computers can put people who @MONTH1 do not know any better at risk. I strongly feel that sites like these and many others have a negative impact on the public. In addition, computers steal much of people's time to the point where family, doing homework, and exercising are limited. I can understand the effects of too much exposure to computers because I see it every day with my younger brother. Once he begins his video interactive games, homework is pushed aside. The only words from his mouth are, ""@CAPS5, just one more game!"" I suppose you can infer how this turns out: one game turns into two and so on. It isn't only children either. Many of my own friends are updating their status or pictures on @CAPS6 for three hours every night. Isn't there a point where we can draw the line between going on for ten minutes and letting the computer control your life? When surveyed, the majority of students said that they spent at least two hours on the computer every night. When games and instant messaging start to take away from studying and exercise, there is a huge issue. Computers take away people's free time and can negatively impact their grades and fitness. So, I ask you to consider the benefits of computers, but also look for the negative effects. You will realize that there are more than you would believe. Support me on this by limiting the usage of computers and by helping the public see the dangers that these technological devices @MONTH1 can bring"
336	337	1	3	Dear Local newspaper, @CAPS1, and well, @CAPS1 and many others, I firmly believe that computers are not only good but also highly beneficial. Computers are advancing our world little by little every single day. We all rely on them for various purposes, such as communication, entertainment, and gaining knowledge. Computers are like companions that offer fun activities and a wealth of things to learn. They are beneficial to everyone across the globe.  Computers gradually enhance communication more and more each day. It used to be the old - fashioned way of sending letters by mail. Then, it evolved into e - mails, and later, platforms like Twitter and Facebook emerged. These websites have revolutionized communication today. Long - distance friends can now view photos, access information, watch videos, and have real - time chats from far away. Some sites like @ORGANIZATION2 even allow you to instant message your friends. Lastly, video chatting is a new and improved way to have a live visual conversation with the other person. According to @ORGANIZATION1, @NUM1 more users signed up for web - cams since the beginning of @DATE1. Clearly, communication is positively affected by computers.  I know you @MONTH1 enjoy sports or being in nature, but sometimes it's great to have instant entertainment at your fingertips. Computer games only cost about @MONEY1 and offer instant access. Also, surfing the web for news or funny videos can be a lot of fun. Almost everyone who has a @CAPS2 has a great time surfing the internet. Do you ever wonder how to listen to the song you like when it's not on the radio? iTunes can store, organize, and play music in a virtual library for permanent access. Moreover, YouTube allows you to watch music videos or listen to songs for free. That's why computers are a great source of entertainment.  Finally, computers provide you with a vast amount of knowledge and are excellent for education. Certain websites give you access to tons of information. Wikipedia and dictionary.com are great resources for learning. In conclusion, computers play a crucial role in our lives, offering multiple benefits in communication, entertainment, and education, making them an indispensable part of modern society.
337	338	1	3	Dear, local Newspaper @CAPS1. I read the article and I whole - heartedly think that you guys are right because in the @DATE1, kids would rather stay inside on the computer. @CAPS1, who knows what they do? @CAPS1 Some kids are glued to Facebook all day, while others are on @CAPS2 or @CAPS3. Sometimes, kids don't even like to go out and do exercises. They just stay on the computer, munching on snacks and eating non - stop.  I believe that if there was no technology, kids these days wouldn't be in such poor physical shape. Some kids don't even like hanging out with their friends or family. They say that they want to stay home on the computer. But we should engage in more physical exercises rather than being constantly on the computer. If we're always on the computer, we won't learn anything at school because when we're at school, kids could be daydreaming about going home to get on the computer, and we won't be focused on our education @CAPS1.  And what if kids drop out or stop coming to school anymore because they'd rather be chatting with their friends or even a stranger on the computer? What if a girl didn't want to go to school and just stayed on her computer? What if she is talking to a stranger? Instead, kids can just go out and do some exercise. By doing so, they won't be in such a poor physical state anymore. In conclusion, it's essential for kids to limit their computer time and focus on physical activities and education to lead a healthy and productive life.
338	339	1	3	Dear @PERSON2, @CAPS1, in a home in your town, all you hear is, “mom, mom, mom, drive me to the library to get books”. You can see many residents who are eager to go to foreign countries but lack the money to do so. Is this the kind of situation you want every home to face? Computers have a great impact on people as they allow people to talk and interact with one another. You can learn about places you've always dreamed of visiting, and it is probably the device that makes your life the easiest. For these reasons, computers are what benefit society most.  First of all, computers enable friends and family to talk without spending a single cent. I know I have relatives who are too poor to pay the high costs of phone bills that come their way when we need to talk. This means that not everyone can afford talking on a phone, but a computer costs nothing to use for communication. Also, in the @ORGANIZATION3 issue @NUM1, @DATE1, @NUM2, a recent poll showed that @PERCENT1 of people who own a computer use it to talk instead of using a phone. I know some people say that computers are too time - consuming, but if this many people use computers to talk, there's no need to worry about paying phone bills. Also, @PERSON1, a @CAPS2 of @ORGANIZATION4, says that fewer people needed a loan when the computer came out with instant messaging and video chatting. This shows that friends and families stopped paying massive phone bills and just talked online.  Furthermore, just by using a computer, anyone can find facts about lands halfway across the @LOCATION1. What's more is that they can be sitting comfortably in their bedroom or any room. A boy named @CAPS3 @PERSON4 who attends @ORGANIZATION1 said that he always wanted to go to @LOCATION2 when he was little and was excited when he looked up facts and pictures about it on the web. Also, @PERSON3, a teacher at @ORGANIZATION5 @ORGANIZATION1, conducted a poll asking how many students did projects having to do with foreign countries, and @PERCENT2 of them said they did. That means that so many people need to research foreign countries and need to use a computer to find out about them. It shows that many more people use computers to “visit” faraway lands.  Last but not least, computers are just about the most convenient thing to have. A recent poll done by @ORGANIZATION2 showed that @PERCENT3 of people would rather have a computer than a car. That just shows how important computers are. Also, I used to think computers were bad for you, but when I received one for my @NUM3 birthday, I found out how useful they were. Many people say computers are time - consuming because they haven't used one yet. Also, did you know that millions of people in a relatively poor country use a computer? That shows how important and convenient computers are.  All in all, now @CAPS1, you have happy residents, laughing and chatting on the computer. They do so because computers allow them to talk with friends, learn, and “visit” foreign countries, and are extremely convenient. @PERSON2 and readers, computers, without a doubt, benefit society greatly.
339	340	1	3	Computers. More and more people are using them. They are used for various purposes, such as communication, for leisure, and many other things. But are computers a good thing?  Computers can be a very good thing to have around. Besides providing practically unlimited information, you can stay in touch with your family using @ORGANIZATION1. You can use @ORGANIZATION2 Word to create well - structured documents and eye - catching PowerPoint presentations that effectively organize your ideas. Also, you can use @ORGANIZATION2 Excel to manage your finances with ease! Windows Movie Maker allows you to construct your own movies if you own a camera. Besides these obvious and very helpful features, you can play computer games, watch movies, and listen to music on a computer.  Like anything, computers have downsides too. Some are minor, and some can be very serious. Computers are expensive to purchase and maintain. You can't see who's really talking to you on a computer, which poses a security risk. Also, many people store important information on a computer. People's computers have been infected, and information has been stolen, leaving them helpless. Bugs can also seriously damage your computer, rendering it impossible to use. Many people can be smeared on the internet as well. Hate sites that encourage terrorism, racial violence, and drug use are all over the web. You have to be extremely careful where you go when using the internet. Also, sometimes computers can take over people's lives. People spend too much time on Facebook and not enough time reading or keeping in touch with family.  Computers can be great things. Between their great features that allow you to be informed all the time and programs that are great for managing business, it's no wonder almost every @CAPS1 household has one. Many people don't like computers. They say that the cons outweigh the pros. I disagree. Yes, the cons can be annoying and sometimes serious. But if you're smart enough to stay away from @CAPS2 - @CAPS3, install reliable anti - virus software, and never give away your information to an unnamed source, the pros outweigh the cons.  So overall, if you're smart enough, a computer can be a fun, convenient addition to your life, allowing you to do more than you ever imagined. It can enhance your knowledge, help you manage your affairs, and provide entertainment, making it a valuable asset in modern life.
340	341	1	3	Did you ever need to know something about another place, or maybe want to see your baby cousin who is not a baby anymore? Having a computer is a huge benefit to society. It not only enables you to find out information and chat with family and friends but also can teach you hand - eye coordination.  A computer can tell you just about anything you need to know. This could help you learn about other cultures, places, or something as simple as what a @LOCATION1 creampie is. The computer has an endless amount of knowledge. This is a huge benefit because a computer is one of the few tools that can help you expand your learning with just a click of a button.  Having a computer also allows you to talk to family and friends. New computers now come equipped with webcams. This benefits you by allowing you to see and speak to them without having to take a long - haul flight or endure a long car ride. Which, I know, is a big benefit for everyone who has relatives that don't live right next door.  Whether it helps you improve your swing in baseball or catch that touchdown pass, having a computer is a big help in developing hand - eye coordination. Believe it or not, having to type a paper for school helps out a great deal in hand - eye coordination. Having good hand - eye coordination can help you out a lot in life, whether it's in physical activities, school work, or jobs.  It is obvious that having a computer is a huge benefit to society. It gives us the ability to learn more, communicate with family and friends, and even improve our physical skills. The society today wouldn't be the same without computers. In fact, computers have become an integral part of our lives, enhancing our learning, communication, and physical development, and will continue to play a vital role in the future.
341	342	1	3	"Dear editor: More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. As the editor of the newspaper, you have the power to inform people about various situations. In my opinion, computers are desperately needed because of the following: computers give people the ability to learn about far - away places, people, and the weather. They allow people to talk online with others, and many jobs use computers. Do you want a more economically advanced state?   First of all, the computer gives people the ability to learn about far - away places, people, and the weather. I have an uncle named @PERSON1, who has @NUM1 little girls. Every day in the morning before school, @PERSON1 checks the weather on his computer to make sure it is safe to go to school. However, one day he forgot to check the weather on his computer and took his kids to school. Little did he know the roads were extremely icy. Sadly, @PERSON1 and his daughters got in a car accident and two of the girls broke a few bones. As you can see, the weather information from the computer could have saved him a trip to the emergency room.  Next, the computer allows you to talk online with other people. Dr. @DR1 from @CAPS1 states that, ""Chatting online with others (@CAPS2) is the best way to stay in touch with others from your old school, camp, and many other places."" I highly agree because adults can stay in touch with friends from middle school. Also, @PERCENT1 of students say that they usually go online to study or get the pages for homework. I believe that chatting online to study for tests is a fantastic idea because it will help the students to get better grades. Some parents say that it is a waste of time. However, teachers say that ever since @CAPS2 was invented, the students' grades have been skyrocketing.  Finally, most jobs today use computers. For example, my dad works for @ORGANIZATION1 and the computer helps him communicate with clients all over the world. Also, the chat function can translate the language, thus it makes it much easier than talking on the phone. Also, teachers use computers to put grades from students in. This makes the teachers' job much easier because it averages all of the grades. The computer has revolutionized the jobs of people.  In conclusion, the computer has a positive effect on people because it gives people the ability to learn about far - away places, people, and the weather, allows people to talk online with other people, and many jobs use computers. I urge you to support me by writing a positive article on computers and how they help society. Please take my idea into consideration."
342	343	1	3	Dear editor, my name is @CAPS2 and I am a @NUM1 - year - old girl, yet I am active in reading the daily newspaper. As I was going through last week's newspapers, I saw an ad to write an article about either the negative or positive factors about computers. I am here to persuade other readers about the negative effects computers have on people. As an active user of the computer, I have experienced all the negative factors.  People who spend more than one hour on the computer are often involved in @CAPS3, @CAPS4, or playing a computer game. Many of those kids are too involved in their computer games. I saw a segment on @CAPS5 @NUM2 about how @PERCENT1 of all teens play on the computer at least once when they are supposed to be doing homework. Computer games distract kids from learning. Kids feel that @CAPS3 is more important than doing math homework. Computers do not benefit kids' learning.  Kids or even adults who are too involved in some use of computers don't want to talk. They feel they need to focus on winning and beating all their friends. To win, people can't talk, they just focus on the game. Kids who are overly focused on winning and not talking could face lifetime results. Being self - conscious or having no social skills are the biggest lifetime results from being too involved in a computer game. That is how being too involved in computer games affects their social skills.  Kids who are too involved in their computer games don't get enough exercise, causing obesity. Kids think they are getting exercise by playing, but in reality, they are doing nothing at all. Kids think they can't leave their game, but they can. There is always a pause button somewhere on the screen. Soon, kids get addicted to playing and don't think going outside is important anymore. That is how computer games cause long - term effects.  In conclusion, computers have no benefits on people. Computers cause a lack of learning, anti - socialism, and obesity. All of these results are long - term, which can have a negative impact on your life. Don't you want a happy and successful life? I know I do!
343	345	1	3	"Dear Local Newspaper, Have you ever thought about all the interesting things you can do on computers such as call people, order groceries, and read books for school? Today it seems like the world is held together by technology and I think computers are at the top. ""@CAPS1 When my older sister moved to @CAPS2, it was hard to keep in touch and see each other, but we found out about @ORGANIZATION1, which is a site where people all over can add people and chat, call, or webcam each other. So we do that every day and it's like she never left home."" @PERSON2 says about the internet site @ORGANIZATION1.   Sure, @PERSON2 and a lot of others love their computers. Studies show that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people get more done in the day online. @PERSON1 says, ""Every day my day is made more efficient because of my @CAPS3. While at work, I can order my groceries and have them delivered by four o'clock. @CAPS1 When I arrive home from work, I can make doctor appointments, school appointments, and schedule meetings all with one touch/click wherever I go, instead of looking on the calendar or picking up the phone.""   @PERCENT1 of couples today say they met online via Twitter, Facebook, MySpace, or AOL. The internet is great for meeting new people because you can interact with each other and get to know one another or look at their profile pictures and other details. You can find people just like you online and after a while, the two of you become friends. I have some of my best friends online through a mutual friend's page and it's a successful friendship today.  Even schools took education to the web, with all books from a class available at home online. Students can even check grades online now and receive comments from teachers. So now students are encouraged to use the web at home and at school.  I hope I have opened your mind a little to understand that the internet is not all bad, and people spend so much time on them now because everything has moved to the web like school, stores, food, even TV. You name it, the web has it. Personally, I spend about an hour or two on the web chatting, studying, watching TV. After that, I might go for a walk or play my @CAPS5, but I'll still be connected to the web because the @CAPS5 picks up on Wi - Fi connections. So I think computers let you open up and connect with others and get other things done on the web. I hope by now you feel the same."
344	346	1	3	"Dear @LOCATION1, As a teenager growing up in this technological era and society, I think computers are more harmful than helpful. I presume that books are better resources, people can find fun in other ways, and that computers can be dangerous and cause health problems. As a well - read newspaper, your stand on this subject will influence the minds of many.  I know computers can help find information, but personally, I believe that books are better resources. Anyone can write and post an article on the internet, even if what they are saying is not true at all. People can lie and say they are a doctor in their @NUM1's when they are really a @NUM2 - year - old working at @ORGANIZATION1. On the computer, you can never be sure who to believe, but with books you know what you're reading is accurate. The information on the computer, (that's true) you can find in a book. Sure, the computer may be the quicker or ""easy way out"" in some cases, but maybe what people need is a challenge. It seems that because of the growing technology, every generation gets lazier and lazier, and less and less into books, and it's time for that to stop.  Also, people can find fun in many other ways not involving a computer. Many people use social networking sites to connect with their friends, such as @CAPS2, @CAPS3, and @CAPS4, but on those, you can't tell if that person is really who they say they are or not. If you want to talk to your friends, why not call them or more modernly, text them? That way you can be sure of who you are talking to. Too many teens nowadays hide away in their rooms and play games on their computers and spend less and less time with their families. What happened to playing cards and board games with your family? It's much more enjoyable, in my opinion, if you play the game for real and not virtually. You can also go outside and get some fresh air, instead of that muggy smell in your room because you're so busy on the computer, you forgot to do the laundry. Plus, if kids have to start handwriting their papers, that would improve their handwriting, because they wouldn't get the simplicity of typing. Besides, some kids don't have access to computers, anyway, and you have to handwrite your @ORGANIZATION2's, so why not?  Lastly, computers can be dangerous and/or harmful to health. The use of social networks allows kids to put all their information out there, for anyone to see. This can lead to bad things, like being stalked or kidnapped. The internet also carries many inappropriate images and websites that youngsters, or anybody, really, should not be looking at. Also, staring at a computer screen for hours on end is very bad for your eyes and can cause very serious vision problems in the long run. Plus, I'm sure you've heard how many typists are more prone to arthritis or any problems with pain or loss of the use of their fingers because of the movement of their fingers when typing.  Getting rid of computers will help to impact people's well - being in a positive manner. While many people enjoy the use of computers, there is really not that great a need for them. Books are better resources, you can find fun in many other ways, and they can be dangerous/harmful to health. Why spend hundreds or more on a tool that is not even necessary? Don't let the media fool you or pull you in with their tricks, scams, or gimmicks to get you to buy one. And next time you go to turn on your computer, think ""Do I really need this or is there a better way to achieve what I need to get done or what I want to do?"" because, more than likely, there will be a better way. So, sometimes it's better to say ""no"" to the new ways of doing things technologically and ""yes"" to the old ways of doing things manually."
345	347	1	3	"Dear local @CAPS1, I hear you are not sure if computers are good or not. Well, they are, and I have many reasons why, but I will tell you a few. First, the games teach hand - eye coordination, teach people about far - away places like other countries, and last, it helps to keep in touch with people.  My first major reason is that it can and does help hand - eye coordination every day. It does this with the mouse; you have to be very coordinated to be good at the games on the computer. This will help in everyday life, whether it's to play catch with your son or to pick something up. It is very important.  Also, it can help you learn about different ethnic backgrounds and far - away places. If you are going on a trip, I would want to know about that place to see what I need. Or just looking at how beautiful the countries are will make you amazed. So, for these few reasons, I would already rethink.  Finally, I think this is the most important reason: to stay in touch with others. I know my mom doesn't have a Facebook, but she is now talking to all her old friends. She says, ""It's nice."" I think having friends is very important to everyone, and computers help them do that.  In conclusion, there are many reasons why a computer is good, like improving hand - eye coordination and learning about far - away places. So, I hope you have been convinced. I know I would have been, and there is no doubt in my mind that you will make the right choice."
346	348	1	3	Dear newspaper, Some individuals believe that computers are a waste of time and pose risks. While it's true that computers can be dangerous, they offer numerous benefits. For instance, they enable you to pay bills online, plan vacations, and even attend college classes.  For busy people, bills can be a real hassle. They are inconvenient, but there are solutions. Consider this: many folks work long hours, sometimes all day and into the night. Coming home to find all your bills already paid would be a relief. One way to achieve this is through a computer. Computers have useful programs that can expedite bill - paying, allowing you to relax and enjoy your free time when you get home.  Computers are also excellent for vacation planning. Every year, a significant number of people use online programs to organize their vacations and trips. For example, my family and I planned a trip to @LOCATION1 in the @DATE1 of @NUM1. When we arrived at the airport, we had first - class tickets, and a ride was waiting for us when we got off the plane. That @DATE1 was truly the best so far.  As we enter a new era, more and more people are enrolling in online college classes, especially those who work or have kids at home. These courses are suitable for working individuals as they are concise and offer a lot of learning. A computer is essential for taking these classes; without one, it would be impossible to participate.  In conclusion, a computer is an extremely useful tool for all these purposes. Whether you're a working professional or a parent, if you want to go back to school, you should consider online college classes. And if your family is planning a vacation, try out one of the convenient online programs available for travel.
347	349	1	3	Dear, to whom @MONTH1 concern; Local Newspaper. I believe you are right. Computers can be helpful as they allow us to chat with people, but they also bring negative consequences. When people use computers, they often neglect exercise. They forget about spending time with family, and most importantly, they endanger their health. Prolonged computer use can damage one's vision. People tend to eat more junk food while on the computer, which can lead to high cholesterol, high blood pressure, and even diabetes.  Computers are highly addictive, causing people to stay up for hours. This not only gives you bad hygiene but also has long - term health implications. I think you should seriously consider this and publish it in the newspaper to alert @CAPS1 @CAPS2 residents. I understand that using a computer can be fun and enjoyable, but the consequences can be severe. It won't be all fun and games once you become very sick.  You @MONTH1 take this seriously because it is a highly significant issue. By being glued to the computer, you miss out on time with your loved ones and engaging in physical activities. People need to step away from the computer and do more in life. A computer is like a drug, but for the sake of your family and your own well - being, you should listen to my perspective.  I propose that all computers should be banned for at least one week. This break can give people time to focus on work or school without the distraction of the computer and also allow them to take care of their health. This @MONTH1 seem like an overreaction, but it's not. Do you want the number of people with diabetes and other health problems to increase? I'm sure you don't. How would that make you feel? It wouldn't feel good at all. So, get on your feet, go for a jog, do whatever you enjoy, and spend quality time with your family. Just listen to me and break this bad habit.
348	350	1	3	Dear local newspaper, Can you imagine a world without computers? Well, I can't because I firmly believe that computers are great. First of all, if you own a computer, you can meet new people. Second, you can use it to do projects or complete homework. Lastly, on a computer, you can basically find out anything you want to know. Read on and discover the reasons behind my positive view of computers.  Who doesn't like meeting new people? I certainly do. If you want to make new friends or find classmates from your school whom you might not know well, you can look them up on your computer. Also, when you have no one to talk to, you can go online and try to meet new people. I do this frequently, and it's actually quite fun. It doesn't pose any harm to make friends or have conversations online; in fact, it's an enjoyable experience once you give it a try. So, one reason why computers are great is the opportunity to meet new people.  The second reason is that computers are extremely helpful when it comes to printing or creating projects. My science teacher always requires assignments to be printed. How could I possibly do that without a computer? Also, if you forget your homework or any assignments, you can ask a friend online or check your school website. Moreover, all assignments look better when they are printed, which is another advantage of using a computer.  My final reason is that on a computer, you can search for almost anything. For example, if you want to find a place to go but don't have the address, you can always check on the computer. If there are problems with your house, car, bills, or anything else, you can search for solutions on the internet. Also, if you can't find something in a store, you can simply purchase it online.  In conclusion, computers have a great impact on our lives. You can meet new people or friends, complete projects or homework, and basically do anything on a computer. They are truly a valuable asset and can help a great deal in life rather than causing any harm.
349	351	1	3	Dear newspaper, Some people claim that computers don't benefit society, but I have a different opinion. Computers offer far more advantages to society than one might initially think. They assist people in learning, simplify work, prevent accidents, and save lives.  It's a well - known fact that computers help people learn and make work easier. With a computer, you can type documents, plan your schedule, create presentations, or check your email. These functions streamline daily tasks, and there are countless other things you can do. As mentioned earlier, computers are also great learning tools. The internet is a vast source of knowledge; you can learn about virtually everything. It's even possible to obtain a medical degree through online courses.  However, the capabilities of computers extend beyond learning and work. Computers can prevent accidents in moving objects. Take cars, for example. There are millions of cars on the road today, and some are almost self - driving, all thanks to computer technology. The same goes for planes; the pilot is mainly there as a backup in case something goes wrong. Trains are also highly computerized. In fact, many @CAPS1 are completely controlled by computers, and humans simply instruct the computer on what to do. This computerization of moving objects makes the world a safer place for everyone.  Finally, computers save lives. In hospitals, computers are indispensable. Without them, many patients would be at risk of dying. Computers are used to keep patient records, monitor vital signs, and assist in surgeries. During surgery, computers allow for minimally invasive procedures and are more accurate than human surgeons, which can save lives. Additionally, computers can ensure that an operating room is completely sterile, reducing the risk of infection.  As you can see, computers bring significant benefits to society. They help people learn, simplify work, prevent accidents, and reduce the number of hospitalizations. Even if someone does end up in the hospital, the use of computers increases their chances of survival. So, what's your opinion of computers now?
350	352	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, Experts agree that people should go outside and exercise, and there are three main reasons for this. Firstly, people and kids these days don't get enough exercise. Lack of exercise can lead to weight gain. Parents and kids who spend all day on their computers or laptops are at a higher risk of becoming overweight. Kids, in particular, have a hard time getting exercise because they are often glued to their computers, playing games.  Secondly, it's important for kids and adults to hang out with their friends and family. Kids should stop spending so much time on the computer and go outside more often with their friends or family. Parents also need to spend quality time with their loved ones instead of staying at home on the computer.  Lastly, people should go outside and enjoy nature. Many people know what nature is, but they don't truly understand its meaning. Adults should spend more time outdoors rather than staying at home, especially considering that @PERCENT1 of the world doesn't have access to computers at all.  In conclusion, going outside and exercising offers multiple benefits. It helps maintain a healthy weight, strengthens relationships with friends and family, and allows people to connect with nature. So, let's step away from our computers and embrace the outdoors.
351	353	1	3	To people, technology, especially computers, is a great asset. If we didn't have technology, we wouldn't be able to call anyone. We'd lack computers to access the internet. We couldn't communicate with our family or friends. People rely on technology for their jobs. For instance, those working in the car industry need computers to check if cars are old. That's why we need technology. People need technology for numerous things. Computers are crucial as we need to look up a vast amount of information online and conduct tests on them. We use technology to call people and access websites like google.com. That's why we need technology so that we can stay in touch with others. In conclusion, technology, with computers at its forefront, is essential for our daily communication, work, and information - seeking needs.
352	354	1	3	"Dear local Newspaper, Over the years, computers have been an outstanding invention. They've helped people acquire more knowledge, communicate with others, and develop more advanced technology. This has had a positive impact on our country. Let me explain. Computers are a boon for our country as they assist us in finding information for school projects and determining locations. For example, I'm @PERSON1 in @NUM1 grade, and the computer helps me find information for my science project much faster than going to the library and searching through books. In case we get lost on the roads, the computer can guide us to our destination. Another reason computers are beneficial is that they enable us to communicate with friends and family. As @PERSON2 said, ""When I can't reach my mom, I email her on my computer."" Also, parents can contact their kids' teachers via email to check on their progress. Lastly, computers help us invent different things. Scientists can easily create new technologies using computers. As @CAPS5 mentioned, ""The computer has helped us first create a model of our invention and then work on the details."" Over the years, computers have helped us with almost everything. In conclusion, computers aid us in our search for information, contacting people, and making new inventions. This has also been useful in wars. We should keep computers in @LOCATION1 as they continue to contribute positively to our lives."
353	355	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, I believe that computers can be a waste of time, yet they also offer many benefits. You should only use the computer when it's truly necessary. People often spend hours on the computer. They turn to it when they're bored or don't want to go outside. Manufacturers have made computers faster and more efficient, which is why more and more people buy them each year. Computers are helpful in various ways. You can learn from a computer, find a job on it, and even shop online. If you're looking for a job, you can search on the computer to find one that suits you. The computer can provide an astonishing amount of information. You can look up anything and even ask questions. Additionally, if you can't find something in a store after searching everywhere, you can go home and find it on the computer, though you'll probably need a credit card. In conclusion, computers are both helpful and can be a waste of time, and we should use them judiciously.
354	356	1	3	"Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1, I spend a lot of time on the computer. However, I think it's one of the most addictive and time - consuming inventions in today's society. Yes, computers have their perks, like allowing us to talk to friends and family we don't see often, doing schoolwork, and gathering information. But in my opinion, people should cut down on their computer usage. Sure, computers let you interact with friends and family through email, instant messaging, or social networking sites like @CAPS3 or @CAPS4. But you can easily communicate the old - fashioned way using cell phones or writing letters. There are alternatives for communication. Exercise is extremely important these days, and people aren't getting enough of it. Did you know that the obesity rate has gone up @PERCENT1 since last year? That's a significant increase, and we don't want it to get worse. If people are just sitting and staring at their computer screens without any exercise, the number will keep rising. Also, computers can cause various medical problems. For example, about a month ago, my back was really hurting. I went to the doctor, and he said one likely cause was leaning forward to use my laptop. As specialist @CAPS5 Oz says, ""Computers can also cause vision problems and headaches."" We can prevent these issues if we take a stand against excessive computer use. We can limit our usage to two or three times a week and only use it for important matters. I hope this makes people aware of the negative effects computers have on us, and we can all make a change for the better."
355	357	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I'm writing to you because computers are having a profound impact on humans, with some effects being quite negative and others less so. Many ordinary people now stay indoors all day, playing games on the computer, or using social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and @CAPS1. This situation is interfering with school, work, and exercise. Every day, more and more people aren't getting enough exercise or completing their work. We must halt this concerning trend. People who stay inside all day aren't as healthy as they used to be. Their immune systems weaken, increasing the risk of getting sick, which can sometimes lead to severe conditions or even death. If you stay inside glued to the computer every day, it becomes so addictive that it takes over your life. To stay healthy, you need to eat well and engage in activities like riding a bike. If someone is frequently on the computer, they're in a similar situation as being addicted to watching TV or playing @CAPS3. When you're addicted to the computer, it can also disrupt family events and sports. When you're on the computer, you might forget about your homework, causing your grades to drop significantly, which could lead to summer school or repeating a grade. Also, if you don't prepare for sports because of computer use, you won't perform to your full potential. This is why computers are affecting the daily lives of people. There are other ways people are affected by computers, but these are the most common ones. In conclusion, we need to be aware of these impacts and find a balance in our computer use.
356	358	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 of the @ORGANIZATION1, I personally disagree with the experts who are concerned that people are spending an excessive amount of time on their computers and less time engaging in activities like exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. The reason for my disagreement is that it's not the computer's fault that people don't get out and exercise. Buying a computer and using it is a matter of free will. The computer doesn't force you to use it; that's our choice. So, we can't blame the computer for people not exercising. Another important aspect to remember is that computers are important because they help you become more educated. For example, there are online computer classes for people who want to obtain their degrees in different fields. With just a click of a button, it can change your future and career for the rest of your life. The most significant reason is that it helps people learn about different cultures and ways of life. I love learning about @LOCATION1 and @LOCATION2 even though they had that terrible storm. I thank you for listening to my opinion and I hope that it changes your view on living a life without computers.
357	359	1	3	Being active has no limit, as one can engage in various physical activities at any time and in different ways. Whether it's a brisk walk in the morning, a strenuous workout at the gym in the evening, or a weekend hike in the mountains, the possibilities are endless. However, technology does have its limitations. It relies on power sources, software updates, and can sometimes malfunction. Despite these limitations, we should not let technology restrict our active lifestyles. Instead, we should strive to balance our use of technology with regular physical activity to lead a healthy and fulfilling life.
358	360	1	3	Do Computers @CAPS1 Society? This question might never be answered definitively. I have an opinion about this, and while it might not affect everyone in the world, I do hope it will have some impact. Exercising is a great way to stay in shape, but if you sit on the @ORGANIZATION1 all day, you don't have a chance to stay in shape. So, while everyone else is fit, you will eventually become overweight. While you sit there playing the same @ORGANIZATION1 game, everyone else is outside playing at the park, swimming in the pool, or fishing at the lake. Sitting on a @ORGANIZATION1 destroys your life both physically and socially. Lastly, @ORGANIZATION1 will stop you from spending time with friends and family. Also, this will stop you from interacting with new friends, and your old ones will find new companions. Lastly, if you sit on the @ORGANIZATION1 @NUM1, you will miss out on the awesome @CAPS2 life you've been waiting for since you can remember. So, the next time your friend says to go online after school, say you'd rather not because you don't want to get addicted and miss out on real - life experiences.
359	361	1	3	Computers have a very positive effect on people. Computers help people in numerous ways. They teach people about history and far - off places, allowing them to explore different eras and cultures from the comfort of their homes. They also are a great way to express yourself. You can write blogs, create art, or share your thoughts and ideas with the world. Computers also are another way to communicate with people, whether they are just a few houses down or on the other side of the globe. Computers hold a vast amount of knowledge, and more is added every day. Every day when I go on the computer, I learn something new. You can search for the word @LOCATION1 and instantly have millions of web pages in front of you, all filled with new knowledge and exciting things about @LOCATION1. Computers are much faster than having to go down to the local library and look for a book that has the information you need. You can also find different views and perspectives of a subject online. Depending on what website you go to, you can get opinions on certain places and events, which you may not find in books at the library. Computers provide a huge amount of knowledge instantly and also some opinions of things. Computers can also entertain you. There are many entertaining websites online that you can go to when you're bored. There are books and magazines you can read at any time you want. If you like to read, then check online; there might be a book you enjoy free of charge to read. Some people like to play games. On the computer, you can find almost any game you want to play, including board games, video games, strategy games, adventure games, and many more. I could go on for hours listing the different types. If you like sports, you can look on the internet and find pages about different sports. You could find ways to improve how you play or learn how to play that sport. If you like to watch @CAPS1, you can also do that on a computer. Some @CAPS2.V programs put the different episodes online so people can easily view them just by one click of the mouse. Computers can benefit anybody who uses them. Computers help teach you things, entertain you, and they also can help you communicate with your friends and family. Many programs let you talk to people through the internet. You could send emails to your cousin halfway across the world. In emails, you can attach pictures and files with text to communicate. There are various programs, like IM which means instant messaging. That means that instantly your message reaches another person using that program. You put a message in and away it goes, instantly reaching the person you're trying to reach. Now there are even more ways to communicate. You can make audio calls to a person using the computer. It is like a phone but in a different form. Webcams make it possible to record and send video instantly and can also be used to talk to someone through a video call. The program connects you to your friends or family and you can see them through a video. Computers are a great way to communicate with others. Computers help in a positive way. They give you access to an amazing amount of information. They can educate you. Computers are also a great way to communicate with people no matter how far away that person is. I would completely say that computers are a positive thing.
360	362	1	3	"Newspaper, I feel that the use of computers is no big deal. It is a convenient way to communicate, it teaches young adults and adults social and life skills, and is no different than other addictions. These three reasons are why I feel the @ORGANIZATION1 is under - appreciated. My first reason why I feel that the @ORGANIZATION1 is under - appreciated is that some people think that less time is spent with family, but I talk to family and friends every time on the @ORGANIZATION1. It is a convenient, fast, and for the most part safe way of communicating. When I need help with something, I sit at the @ORGANIZATION1 and fb chat someone, or if they're not on, I e - mail them. I usually get my answer within a day. Also, you can look up the answer online; the internet is a vast source of knowledge. Moreover, if you call someone versus chatting on the @ORGANIZATION1, you might have no idea who they are, and it is also much easier to trace a call than trace an @ORGANIZATION1 to a certain location. Communication is faster, safer, and more convenient over the @ORGANIZATION1. My second reason for being @NUM1 is that it can help teach social and life skills. For example, did you know that on average, an adult will make @MONEY1 more if they know how to type well and fast? The @ORGANIZATION1 serves many functions. Facebook, for example, is a social network, and many young adults can learn basic social skills by having a Facebook. Social skills play a very important role when you are finding a job for the first time. If you have good social skills, your boss might like and appreciate you more, which can only lead to a promotion! Computers are very useful to have around! My third and final reason, for believing, with all respect, that @NUM2 people are blinded, is that people don't easily get addicted to the @ORGANIZATION1. It is very hard to become addicted to the @ORGANIZATION1. Only about @PERCENT3 of Facebook users are addicted. Compared to an alcohol addiction, about @PERCENT1, or drug addiction, @PERCENT2, @ORGANIZATION1 addiction is microscopic, and not to mention, not deadly. The only similarity between the @ORGANIZATION1 and other deadlier addictions is that they are addicted and might become grumpy if asked to stop. ""@ORGANIZATION1 addiction can be cured with a speedy recovery, and as long as you are on for an hour or less a day, there is nothing to worry about"" says @PERSON1, at the @NUM3. So, there you have it, computer use is not a major problem. It is a convenient communication device, an effective way to learn social and life skills, and is not a huge source of addiction. Therefore, there is nothing to worry about. Sit back and look it up on the internet if you don't believe me."
361	363	1	3	I agree that computers do benefit society because almost everyone uses one or has one at home or in the office. It helps you with important stuff, like schoolwork, work projects, and even personal tasks. The computer makes things easy by automating many processes and providing quick access to information. Computers give exercise in a way as it makes your fingers move faster when typing. The computer is the best thing ever that has happened to this world. You can chat with your friends and family, print out important writing, and play games during your leisure time. What can get better than that? We can research a famous person, look up information about dead people, and find interesting pictures. But the computer makes you lazy because it makes you want to just sit there and never get off of it. It's addicting to people, but others just don't know the proper meaning of using or having a computer. If the others had a computer and used it correctly, they would change their mind. You can go on MySpace, thanks to Tom, and talk to friends, family, and people from a different town or state. You also can go on Google, Yahoo, Facebook, Twitter. The computer and internet are really fun and it gives you a little exercise for your fingers. And it helps you with your school work, homework, research of a country, place, house, or vacation. You can do lots of things. But then the other people have a point. Enjoying nature is good because it gets you healthy and strong, and it will make you play sports more and have fun outside instead of staying inside all day doing nothing, staring at your computer screen and not wanting to get sleep or go outside. So both are pretty much the same to me, but I do side with the first opinion because computers are the best!
362	364	1	3	You've got mail! @CAPS1 My computer is constantly filled with emails from distant relatives and friends. Without computers, I would not be able to keep in touch with these people as efficiently as I can with computers. In the past few decades, technology has been drastically advancing, resulting in the incredible computers we have today. With computers, we can type faster, communicate with distant relatives, and find information like never before. Because of this incredible invention, computers have allowed us to do numerous amazing things. To begin, we have thrown away typewriters and purchased computers. Now, like never before, we can type faster, improve hand - eye coordination, and edit our papers without the help of a peer. First of all, with the extreme amounts of typing needed for colleges, most occupations, and everyday lists, computers have made this a faster and easier process. I am sure most of the things you have to type for various tasks are written using a computer. Secondly, we have gained amazing hand - eye coordination skills. Furthermore, by typing and reading at the same time, we have trained our eyes to do many similar things, just like playing the piano. Lastly, now with spell check, we are able to edit papers without using someone else's help! The computer can sense problems in an instant, which is even more effective. Without a doubt, the typing documents aspect of computers is a crucial reason why we need them around. Another reason is because of communication. Thanks to many useful communication applications such as @ORGANIZATION2, @ORGANIZATION3, @CAPS2 and @CAPS3, we can now communicate with a large number of distant friends and relatives. For example, with both my sisters at college, it was hard for me to communicate with them. However, due to @CAPS2, I can see their pictures, instant message them, and even video chat! Without computers, being able to see their pictures and what they are up to would have never been possible. Secondly, email has created a fast, easy way to update people on schedule changes, ideas, and even sales and specials offered by stores! Snail mail is no more with this extremely efficient way of communication! Clearly, the communication aspect of computers is an obvious reason why we need them in our lives. Last but not least, computers have allowed us to access information like never before. We can now find facts and figures, faster, easier, and with hundreds more opinions, within seconds. Thanks to @ORGANIZATION1 and other search engines, we can find the information we need. Not to mention, the process is exceedingly simple: type in exactly what you are looking for and you will be brought to exactly what you need! Thirdly, there are many more options and sites to choose from. For example, if you were to type in a certain animal, there would be an abundance of pages pertaining to your topic. Now, it is possible to find exactly what you are looking for! There is no question that computers have made searching for information easier and faster, which is exactly why we need them in our everyday lives. Conclusively, computers are an astonishing invention that has opened many doors for today's society. Without computers, we would not be able to type documents as quickly, communicate, and find information in an efficient fashion. However, because of this invention, computers have allowed us to do incredible things. People all across the country are experiencing the efficiency of using computers, and now we can too! It is evident that computers are effective and are advancing technology in our society.
363	365	1	3	"Can you imagine a world full of lifeless zombies obsessing over technology such as computers, television, and cellular phones? Our world as we know it will come to an abrupt end if we don't stop this nonsense. Computers can cause obesity, a lack of interaction, and they make people waste their time on these useless items. Our world can't afford to set aside time for such things. Our planet is run by us humans, and if we don't take care of its necessities, we will all die, including our beloved planet @LOCATION1. Computers aren't a benefit to our society today. First off, computers can cause major obesity, like it has done already. Obesity is one of the most frequently brought - up health problems in the world. Many issues cause obesity, but technology (computers) takes a big role in it. Instead of sitting on a computer all day, people can do something a lot more productive such as taking a walk, starting a club (adult ones for children!), helping out neighbors, etc. So what if they teach hand - eye coordination? They don't teach us how to stay fit! Computers play a big role in the obesity factor. As adults, you should know how much obesity matters. Children are the future, and nobody would want the future leaders to be known for widespread obesity. Nevertheless, computers take away ""bonding"" time from family and friends. Adults and children alike are lacking social needs. They don't verbally and physically interact with their ""online friends"". And they wonder why families these days are turning out the way they are. The source of the cause is computers. Anyways, people spend too much time on computers. If people didn't waste so much time on computers, they wouldn't be losing jobs like dropping flies. The unemployment rate is high because they suppose they ""don't have enough time"". When all their time is devoted to computers, if they took out the computers in their lives, they would have plenty of time to do such things. No one wants a ""stay - at - home"" unemployed loser as themselves. In the end, computers are not a benefit to our poorly run society. They cause obesity, corrupt social needs, and eat the people's time away. You @MONTH1 think computers allow others to ""chat"" online with their ""online friends"", but they don't provide our physical and verbal social needs, which results in a low self - esteem. If newspapers keep publishing articles about the ""benefits of computers,"" people will soon stop believing that nonsense and eventually stop purchasing these newspapers. Nobody wants to read lies, do they?"
364	366	1	3	Computers, Computers, Computers, it's all we hear about today. New websites, chatrooms, games and much more keep popping up. I agree with the experts who think that we should spend more time outdoors with friends and family. Computers take over people's lives. You don't know who is looking you up on Facebook or @CAPS4, and now you can do almost anything on them. Whether it's having lunch, doing @CAPS1, @CAPS2, or @CAPS3, computers are taking over our lives. Believe it or not, some people bring computers everywhere they go. And once you get on that @CAPS3, chances are you won't be getting off it for a while because you keep clicking and keep finding new stuff. I do have to say computers are a cool device, but there has to be a limit. We can not be on the @CAPS3 all day @NUM1 looking up what @PERSON1 said to @PERSON2... You got to come back to earth and spend time with your family. The @CAPS3 might be a cool device, but that does not mean that it is safe to post stuff about you on it. Facebook & @CAPS4, probably two of the most dangerous sites to be on. Anybody could just type in @PERSON1 and get @NUM2 matches and find you, even though you don't know them. People are not always as they say they are. People could say that they are a @NUM3 year old just leaving college when it's really a @NUM4 year old @CAPS6 just getting ready to enter the senior center. Don't trust anybody. Nowadays, you don't even have to leave your house. You can shop, talk, file @CAPS5 taxes, pay bills, and have a virtual life on the @CAPS3. Pretty soon, the human kind as a whole will become connected through the @CAPS3. Some computers probably have a smarter system than some humans do. What I am saying is limit your time on the @CAPS3, or that's where you will be spending all your time. Now you know that I think that computers need to be seen less throughout the human day. Also, they are taking over our lives, are dangerous, and you don't even have to leave your house to make a living. I hope you take my thoughts into consideration. Thank you.
365	367	1	3	@ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 There are a lot of positive things about technology, especially computers. Computers give you a chance to communicate with people from all around the world. Also, computers give you the opportunity to go on educational websites, and lastly, they make it easier to shop and pay bills. Talking to people from around the world can be really interesting. Computers help you do that through the internet. You can learn about different people and their cultural backgrounds, or even talk to your friends and families that live in other cities, states, or maybe even countries. Yes, some people might say they cost too much, but that's really only a one - time price. Computers can be very helpful to students as well as teachers. The reason is that students can get homework help on educational websites. On the other hand, it's helpful for teachers because they can put their students' grades online and won't have kids bugging them about what's their average in a certain class. Yes, I know there are bad, inappropriate websites, but there are a lot of ways to block them. For example, I had a @CAPS2 in @CAPS3 and I needed a lot of help, and my teacher told me about a website called Study Island. By going on that every day, it boosted my grade up to a @CAPS4. Computers give you a chance to get your bills paid and do some shopping for a cheaper price. There are ways that the things you buy online could come a few days late. But think about how much time and money you're saving because you ordered online instead of going to the store. It's also very helpful to people with disabilities. There are a lot of positive things about computers. They give you a chance to communicate with people across the world, and give you a chance to go on educational websites, and last, they help you pay bills and go shopping. According to the local newspaper, computers are a big benefit to society, and without them, a lot of things wouldn't be possible.
366	368	1	3	"Do you use a computer? Is there one at your house? Well, the average household owns two computers, but this isn't good, as these computers are taking valuable time away from hobbies, nature, and real - life interactions. First, computers take time away from hobbies and friends. Some of my friends spend a solid @NUM1 hours on the computer a day that they could be using to play a sport or hang out with others. Also, the computers become the center of their lives. People often ask me "" @CAPS1 weren't you online @TIME1?"" and I answer ""@CAPS2 I have a life that doesn't revolve around @CAPS3."" Second, the computer takes time away from nature. People don't take the time to acknowledge the beauty of the outdoors. Now that our lives are so orderly, we need the wilderness even more, as it helps us to appreciate ourselves more and appreciate how special our planet is. But computers take all that away! Third, computers take us away from real - life. Some people don't know how to have a face - to - face conversation; they only know how to communicate by email or @CAPS5. I acknowledge that getting away from real life can be relaxing, but some people don't even know which side the stamp goes on a letter. It's so old - fashioned, but I believe people put their heart into communication, something you can't fully do by email. In conclusion, computers take time away from real - life, nature, and your hobbies. Plus, you can get arthritis in your hands if you type too much, which just further shows the negative impact of excessive computer use."
367	369	1	3	"Computers are becoming a household item in the @LOCATION1 and around the world. There is a problem though, because some people believe that computers don't benefit society. In my opinion, computers are an excellent thing for our everyday lives. The internet allows us to communicate with friends, family, and more people around the globe! Its various programs help keep files and other things of that nature organized and updated. Finally, computers are a great resource when researching for projects, reports, homework, or anything else that requires information to complete. The world is a large place with many people, places, regions, and countries. Families sometimes move far away from their families and friends, so they want to keep in contact. Post is a very slow and costly service, while the internet is cheaper and quicker! IM's, @CAPS1 @CAPS2, are one of these fast and cheap ways. They allow you to send a message and receive a message on any day, at any time, in any place with little or no hassle involved. Another way is to use websites like @CAPS3 and @CAPS4, which allow you to update your ""status"" on your wall so everyone on your friends list can see or comment on. The final and best way is by using a webcam, which enables you to see the person on the other end of the ""call"" and you can also hear their voices. This is the best way, in my opinion, because instead of sending text and pictures, they can explain everything in their own way with no limit on how much they can say. Many people have noticed that the world is not an organized place. Computers help organize it with their many applications and programs like @ORGANIZATION1 apps, @CAPS5, and document folders. @ORGANIZATION1 is a chain of apps for everything from writing documents to making spreadsheets to making presentations and even to making fliers for special events. These apps are the basics for starting up a business or promoting an invention. @CAPS5 mainly centers on keeping information stored and organized in files however you wish and is great for quick access to them. My parents and other adults I know always say ""organization is the key to success"", so @CAPS5 definitely helps. The final and most basic way that computers help for organization are document folders. These little things come in handy when you need to save something quickly but want to keep it organized. All you have to do is name it, click save, and you're done! Most importantly, computers come in handy when researching for projects or something else that requires lots of up - to - date information. Books will take a few days and you only have @NUM1 days to research, create, and organize your project and data. What are you gonna do now? You could hand it in late, but then you'll get in trouble. Here is where the fast and reliable internet comes in. If you need to know the difference between @PERSON2 and @PERSON1, use the search engine @ORGANIZATION2. If you have a question about the @CAPS7 @CAPS8, use @LOCATION2. Anything at all that you really need is at the tips of your fingers, with a little help from your computer and internet of course. In conclusion, computers are not just a good thing for society; they are an essential part of modern civilization, facilitating communication, organization, and research."
368	370	1	3	About @PERCENT1 of the world today uses computers. Although you may spend time on the computer, you can contact family and friends, exercise your brain, and still have time to enjoy nature. Have you ever heard of an email? Well, it's a great contacting source you can use to contact family and friends. Also, there are other sources you can use to contact family and friends. For example, Facebook, MySpace, and Twitter. Even though you're on the computer, you can still use these platforms instead of always having to call them. I remember a time when I called my aunt from my cell phone, and it wasted my minutes. Something simple as this could've been done over an email. So computers do have a good point to it. Do you know you can exercise your brain online? You can do this by learning new information you haven't learned before. For instance, if my sister needed help with science, she could go online and learn more detailed information about it. Some experts are thinking that it's too much time on the computer, but it can be very useful to others by helping them gain knowledge. Computers can even help you get online tutoring, so you can exercise your brain there also. Do you know you can enjoy nature anytime? About @PERCENT2 of our world enjoys nature. Don't you think it can wait until later? Also, some people don't like the different seasons and might want to stay in their homes. For example, when it snows. I think nature is good, but I don't think others want to be out as much. Also, I know we are a part of nature, and nature is part of our society, but the seasons change, and there's lots of bad weather. In conclusion, the computer has some great sources. Although you may spend time on the computer, you can contact family, exercise your brain, and there's still time to enjoy nature, making it a valuable tool in our lives.
369	371	1	3	"Dear newspaper, I think computers have a good effect on people. Computers are very helpful to many; it gives them an education, and they can interact with many people. Computers can be very helpful to many people. Working with computers can give people extremely good hand - eye coordination. Dr. @PERSON4 said, ""In recent surveys and tests, I have noticed a major increase in hand - eye coordination of @PERCENT1, all thanks to computers."" Computers are also a way that people can learn to type. In a recent survey at @ORGANIZATION1, @NUM1 more students know how to type, thanks to computers. Computers can be very helpful to business people with creating power points. Instead of making a really big poster board for @CAPS2 @CAPS1 project, I made a power point instead that was so much easier. Computers can be very helpful to many people. Computers are used in many schools to help teach students about new things. For example, students can learn about interesting places that they never knew about. ""@CAPS2 friend is moving to @LOCATION1 and she has no idea what it's like, or where it is. So, we looked it up on the internet and found out so much cool stuff about it,"" says @PERSON5. Computers can also teach students about new cultures. At @CAPS3 @ORGANIZATION2, @ORGANIZATION2, @PERCENT2 of the students learned about @NUM2 new cultures in one year, thanks to computers. Not only can computers tell people about interesting places, but interesting people. I never knew that president @PERSON2 had @NUM3 brothers and grew up in @LOCATION2, did you? Computers can be used in schools to help teach students about new things. Computers are used by many people to interact with one another. Using computers is an easy way to talk with friends. Using instant messenger is free! Now parents don't have to pay annoying phone bills anymore! In a recent survey done in the town of @CAPS4 @CAPS5, @PERCENT3 of the people there thought that using computers to talk to friends was a lot easier. Computers can help people meet new people online. Have you ever heard of the dating sites? Well, this is what @PERSON1 has to say about it, ""@CAPS6 wonderful! @CAPS2 husband and I met online and we have been together for @NUM4 years."" What if you have a far - away cousin and if you call or write them a letter it's too expensive? Well, now you don't have to worry about that anymore because talking to distant relatives online is free! ""@CAPS6 so much easier talking to people online,"" says @PERSON3. Computers can be used to interact with one another. Computers have a very good effect on people. They are helpful, can be used to give education, and they can be used to interact with others, making them an important part of our social and educational lives."
370	372	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @PERSON1, Computers have helped us in numerous ways. Computers have assisted both children and adults in learning, increased the number of jobs, and have also supported law enforcement. Yes, I agree some people do spend an excessive amount of time on these machines, but that doesn't mean they haven't been beneficial. Computers help children and adults learn a great deal. Children can use their computers to research homework they're working on or even just research things for fun. Most adults have been through school and are educated, but computers help them make discoveries about space, the human body, etc. So not only are computers teaching children, but they're also part of making new discoveries that need to be taught to children. Right now our economy is not performing well. A large number of people are out of jobs and can't support their families. But imagine how many more people would be out of work if we didn't have computers. @PERCENT1 of our society works with computers, which means @PERCENT1 of the people would be jobless. Computers not only give us knowledge but also help over half of us catch the members of society that do wrong. Computers have helped law enforcement for a little bit more than @NUM1 years. Yes, crime has gone up in the past years, but computers have helped us catch criminals. Computers store massive amounts of data, which means we can store already - arrested criminals' fingerprints, pictures, @CAPS2, previous records, etc. to help us catch criminals. So yes, computers have helped us in more ways than one. Computers have helped children and adults learn, increased the amount of jobs, and helped law enforcement. Even if people spend too much time on these machines, it's their decision, and look at how much computers have helped us. We should make the right decision and let our technology continue to advance, as it will likely bring even more benefits in the future.
371	373	1	3	"To whom it concerns in @MONTH1 @CAPS1, I have recently heard about your argument on the effects that modern - day computers have on society. Some people feel they have a positive effect, such as learning new and diverse information, and interacting or chatting with other people from different parts of the world. Others feel that society is devoting too much time to computers. They feel that these people are spending less time exercising outdoors, enjoying the beauty of nature, and having quality time with their family. I feel that people are overly devoted to the computer. People think that all things on the internet are true, but they're not. @PERCENT1 of all teens across the country are addicted to the computer.  First, things posted on the internet are not always true. They can be posted by anyone, whether the information is true or not. My friend found a website with very detailed - looking information for an essay. She turned it in, and the teacher gave it back the following day. In big red letters it said ""false information"". If she had gotten the information from a book, she probably would've gotten an ""A+"".  Second, @PERCENT1 of teens living in the @LOCATION1 have become addicted to using the computer. My friend was obsessed with Facebook from @NUM1 until @NUM2. She was on it daily. She began failing classes. She didn't do homework, didn't study for tests! She failed the @NUM3 grade. This all happened because she was addicted to a website.  This is why I agree with the statement that experts are concerned with people spending too much time on the computer. If you want to continue a healthy lifestyle, and avoid becoming too addicted to the computer, limit yourself. Make the smart choice and strike a balance between the digital world and real - life experiences."
372	374	1	3	Dear local Newspaper, I believe that people who use a lot of technology such as computers are not making a good choice. Technology can affect adults, and it impacts children even more. Children who go on chatting websites such as Facebook are starting to see a significant difference in their grades. I found out that children who use Facebook are starting to not turn in homework, and their grades are going completely down. I heard a student say that once he got on Facebook, he stopped doing his homework and reading. His grade dropped from an @CAPS1 to a @CAPS2 average because he was much more focused on the computer than on school and his reading.  I believe computers can be really addictive to people. The first time you get on a website, it goes from once a day to twice a day, and further on, it's as if the computer is sometimes connected to you and you can't let go. People who allow themselves to chat online can also be in a dangerous situation. Young females and males think it's exciting to chat with someone in a different state or city, but it's not exciting; it's very dangerous. Chatting online is very dangerous because the person that you are talking to could have a criminal record, like having murdered people, kidnapped kids, or could be wanted by the law. We wouldn't know because on chat lines, you don't have to put your real name, you could put a false picture, and an unknown age. That's why in some cases, something goes missing because they didn't think before they started chatting.  Another reason why using or being on a computer can be bad is that it can lead to a strong distraction from your family. Instead of sitting down and asking your family how their day was, you'll be in a rush to go on the computer. The computer can also lower your test and quiz grades. You can be on the computer for a maximum number of hours when you need to be studying for a huge exam the next day. And when you fail, there's no one to blame but yourself because of your addiction to the usage of a computer.  In conclusion, @PERCENT1 of people have been affected by computers, and it's not a good thing. You could miss a day out of work or be tired and exhausted because all your energy is wasted. Stay off of computers unless it's for educational purposes, and make sure to prioritize real - life interactions.
373	375	1	3	I do not agree that people should spend a lot of time on the computer, and I'm going to say why. My first reason is that if you are a @NUM1 - year - old man, you won't spend time with your kids, and you may also develop eye problems. That's why you shouldn't spend a lot of time on the computer.  My second reason is that you're going to have problems with your wife if she finds out that you are talking to another woman online. A lot of people have faced issues when their wives discovered such online interactions.  My third reason is that if you are a kid like me, you won't have fun and you won't make friends. The computer can become a problem, and you'll miss out on spending time with your family. For example, you won't go outside and play with your little sister.  So, that's why you shouldn't spend a lot of time on the computer. It's important to balance your time between the digital world and real - life experiences to maintain healthy relationships and a good quality of life.
374	376	1	3	@ORGANIZATION2. Hey, my name is @PERSON1. I'm @NUM1 years old, and I go to @ORGANIZATION1. @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I'm going to talk to you about expert people saying that computers are affecting society. But technology experts believe that computers have a positive effect on people. More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society.  People think computers benefit society, but in reality, it's not always the case. People can learn more, and they can also talk to people online if they don't have a cell phone. You could also research places you want to go on vacation and see how they look. Computers are one of the best things ever invented, but it's hard for some people. Those who don't have a computer find it difficult to search for directions and vacation places. So, computers don't always benefit the whole society.  Those who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people. A computer is very important in my life. If I'm behind in some classes, I can do some research and study at home and learn about it. I lost my cell phone, but now I talk to my friends online. When my parents don't want to take me shopping, I go shopping online. It's easier to look for what you want.  People learn a lot with computers. Computers are like a window to the world. You could see the earth, space, the city, and what's going on in the internet. Computers don't effect the society negatively; instead, they make it easier. They give people the ability to learn about far - away places and people and even allow people to talk online.  I didn't know much about @LOCATION1. The only thing I knew was that it was hot. But I searched about it, and @LOCATION1 is like a cool park. There are a lot of fun things you can do, so I want to go there on vacation, and what I found was true. Online is a great place to chat with friends or family. You can keep in touch.  Some expert people are concerned that people are spending too much time on computers instead of exercising. @CAPS1, people do spend a lot of time on computers, but they also exercise. When they go out with family, they play sports, and when they go shopping, they are walking. That's exercising. I've been on the computer for @NUM2, but I still exercise. I play basketball all the time.  In conclusion, computers have both positive and negative aspects. We should make good use of their positive features while being aware of the potential drawbacks and ensure a balanced lifestyle.
375	377	1	3	Dear Readers of the @ORGANIZATION1, Can you imagine life without your computer? No? Well, that's what I am trying to change. Millions of @CAPS2 spend countless hours with their eyes glued to '@ORGANIZATION2, @ORGANIZATION3, and @CAPS3 monitor screens. Spending that much time sitting in one place isn't healthy. Not only do people not get enough exercise, but they also don't get the chance to appreciate the natural world around them, which is ever - changing. Teens and even small children get lost in the cyberworld and don't use their after - school time wisely to study or do homework. The internet is also a dangerous place, and the growing computer use maximizes the problem.  To begin, the obesity rate in @LOCATION1 is growing rapidly. A recent study done by the @LOCATION2 government shows that @NUM1 people are overweight, and @NUM2 people are on the verge of obesity. We @CAPS4 could decrease the obesity rate and be healthier and happier by exercising and getting out more. Spending all your time glued to a computer screen will only increase your chances of becoming overweight.  Secondly, the more time you spend cooped up inside, the less time you get to enjoy nature. The natural world is ever - changing, and you will miss out on a lot of amazing opportunities if you hardly ever step foot outside your front door. Excessive computer use will wear them out quicker than normal. Where does your old, worn - out computer go when you get the @ORGANIZATION2? A landfill! The more you use your computer, the faster you will trash it. If every @CAPS5 threw out one computer a year, there would be over @NUM3 million discarded Dells, Gateways, Macs. We would be living in a sea of trash. Excessive computer use ruins the environment and hurts your health!  What are you waiting for? Go run outside! Ride a bike! Give your computer a break.  Finally, the growing computer use increases the amount of internet predators, and the odds that you or your child could be targeted skyrocket. With more and more kids on the computer each day, the internet safety level drops. Not only could these children be watching inappropriate videos on YouTube or cyber - bullying on @CAPS6, they could be giving personal information out to people they don't even know without realizing it on MySpace and Facebook. @PERCENT1 of kidnappings are possible because of information found on the computer.  In conclusion, excessive computer use has serious negative impacts on health, the environment, and safety. It's time to take action, reduce our computer usage, and embrace a more active and real - life - centered lifestyle to protect ourselves and our loved ones.
376	378	1	3	Dear local Newspaper, I have heard that there is a controversy over whether computers benefit our society. Based on my opinion, it has become clear to me that they are beneficial because they help us keep in contact, complete our daily work, and give everyone a fun time. If we were in a world without computers, then our society would be completely lost.  First off, one contributing factor is that computers help us keep in contact. Any one person can simply send an email with a click of a button. The process is quick and efficient, allowing us to share information instantly. However, if this device was not around, we would have to use the postal service or the telephone, both of which cost money. The postal service is slow, and the telephone can be expensive, especially for long - distance calls. Why wouldn't you want a computer? What happens if a hurricane is approaching, and a family has no idea of its presence? All they need to do is check their email or the internet to realize what danger they are in. Calling somebody is risky because they might not be able to answer for any reason, such as a power outage. In a situation like this, computers become essential to everyone. Clearly, the ability to contact is a great reason why computers need to be kept.  Secondly, computers help us complete our daily work. Almost everyone works during the week, and if you haven't realized it, we get most of our help from computers. Let's say that a man or woman is at their office and they need to create a power point in order to share the company's new brand. All he/she needs to do is turn on their computer and begin to work in an instant. There are various software tools available that make the task easy and professional - looking. But without this device, what would they be able to do? How would they complete their work? The need for a desktop, laptop, or tablet is obviously great when you work.  Lastly, computers give us the ability to play games and browse the internet freely. When I go home, usually I go straight to my computer like most teenagers do. I can easily check scores of last night's games, listen to music, and play solitaire by myself. I don't need to turn on the television and wait through all those tiresome commercials. I don't need to grab a CD and throw it into a boombox. I don't need to grab all the playing cards and set a game up. All I need is my computer. Without a doubt, the fun and helpful features of computers, such as games, help us out.  Although some say that computers aren't needed, they help us throughout our lives. Based on my opinion, it has become clear to me that they are beneficial because they help us keep in contact, complete our daily work, and give everyone a fun time. All of these facts lead to one final solution, which is keeping computers in our society as they are an indispensable part of modern life.
377	379	1	3	I believe that computers have a great effect on people. People all around the world use computers to talk online with other people, give people the ability to learn about far - away people and places, and also let you explore the internet. Computers are a great influence on our lifestyle.  Computers allow people from around the world to interact with friends and family. Some well - known websites that allow you to do so are MySpace, Facebook, and Skype. With Facebook, you can take a picture of yourself and place it on your web page. It is really quite easy. You can also write status updates, share photos and videos, and join groups related to your interests. Also, with Skype, you can chat with your best friends and can actually see what they are doing. But if you want to do this, you are going to need a webcam. I have Skype and I think that it is a wonderful resource. I have relatives in Australia that I only get to see once a year. But with the help of my computer, I can interact with them all year round, having face - to - face conversations as if they were right next to me.  Computers can make people from far - away places learn about the culture and ways of another person's lifestyle. Have you ever seen the commercial where a little boy is talking to his father on the computer? Well, in this commercial, the boy is laying down on the couch and is eating a chocolate chip cookie. While he is doing this, he is talking on the computer with his dad who is doing the same. At the same time, both father and son dip their cookie into a glass of milk, eat it, and laugh. I felt at that time that it was a wonderful moment because even though they are in opposite directions, the two are still having a great time. Just to think that it was all because of one computer.  Exploring the internet is what a computer can do. When doing this, you can play some really fun games on a rainy day when you are bored. You can look up what happened during one of your favorite basketball games, such as how many points LeBron James got for your fantasy team. Also, at my school, you can check your grades to see what you got on your last math test or quiz. For example, if I had all A's but one B in math, then I would know that I would need to really study for my next test to get an A on it. With the help of the internet, I can plan my study schedule and find useful learning resources.  So, now you know why computers are a very important part of our society. Computers allow us to talk online with other people, give people the opportunity to learn about far - away people and places, and computers also allow everyone to explore the internet. As you can see now, computers are a great influence on our lifestyle, and we should continue to embrace and utilize them for our growth and enjoyment.
378	380	1	3	"@CAPS1, that was the sound of a light bulb going off in your head. You learned something new! Yipee. If it weren't for the internet on computers, you would have to read those boring textbooks. Computers have a good effect on people because they teach so much valuable information, they can answer your question in @NUM1 seconds, and also they give you communication to the entire world!  Imagine this, you need to know who the third president of the United States was. Are you going to go to the computer and save a bunch of time? Or are you going to walk over to those miserable books? It would take you much longer to search through books compared to typing a query into a search engine on a computer. Guess what... the capital of @LOCATION2 is @LOCATION1, the constitution of the @ORGANIZATION1 says that a person has the right to, and @PERSON1, one of @CAPS3 greatest, was assassinated in his car. If it wasn't for the internet, I wouldn't have known that.  @NUM2 in @NUM3 websites on the internet are for educational value, @PERSON2, a technology major at @CAPS4 recently said, ""The internet is a huge chunk in education, and if it wasn't for computers, we wouldn't know the things we do today. It's packed with so much to learn, it's very useful, and it forces so much info into our minds."" Lila, a technology major said, ""@PERCENT1 of people communicate through computers, @PERCENT2 through phones, and @PERCENT3 through mail."" @NUM4 in @NUM5 people over the age of nine have an email. Incredible numbers of emails are sent every day. What would it be like without computers? Think about those numbers you just read, isn't that incredible?  Computers have a good effect on people because they teach so much valuable information, they can answer your question in @NUM1 seconds, and also they give you communication to the entire world. If you just take a step back, you'll notice how valuable something really is to you. In today's world, computers have become an essential part of our lives, enabling us to learn, communicate, and stay informed with ease. We should continue to make the most of this powerful tool for our personal and professional development."
379	381	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, more and more people are getting hooked on computers. I am here to say that computers are not the best way to benefit our society.  First off, most teenagers are spending less time with friends/family and more time looking through a screen. Also, it would be so much better for our bodies and minds to go out and enjoy nature instead. Lastly, you can get addicted to the computer. So here are my reasons why computers do not benefit our society.  My first reason includes friends and family. More and more people are neglecting to spend time with their loved ones to get to the next level on 'Star Wars.' Is this really how we want our future generations growing up, looking blankly at computer screens? I know I don't want that. I know this from personal experience. When I was young, I visited my cousin @PERSON1. All I would get to see of him was a quick 'hello,' but then he'd escape to his room to continue clicking angrily on the computer. The point is, you can't replace family and friends with a computer screen. It's not right. Family gatherings are supposed to be a time for bonding, sharing stories, and creating memories, but computers are getting in the way.  My next argument against computers is about our bodies and minds. The best way to take care of those things is nature. Unfortunately, most teenagers aren't getting outside for a good amount of exercise due to computers. In fact, almost @NUM1 teenagers say they spend more time on the computer than anywhere else. This is not a good way to spend time. We need to solve this issue before more teenagers make the switch from nature to computers. Fresh air, trees, and birds are much better than a screen, a couple of clicks, and the hum of a machine. Physical activity in nature helps improve our physical health, reduces stress, and enhances our mental well - being.  My third and final reason is about addiction. So many people are getting addicted to the things they are finding on their computers. Addiction is a very serious matter that we need to fix. All of this is also pointing to laziness too from lack of interest in anything else. I know this from personal experience. When my brother first got his computer, he literally locked himself in his room for days. All he did for almost a week was socialize and beat his personal best score on a game. This is not the way to be treating a device.  So, as I hope you can all see, computers don't have a positive impact on our society. First of all, computers are over - ruling family and friends. Also, nature is becoming less and less of a priority with the computer in mind. Lastly, it's becoming a worldwide addiction. Thank you for deeply considering all the arguments that I have to offer. I know it majorly helps people keep in touch globally, but there are other ways to do it, such as mail, which can also add a personal touch to communication. We should find a balance and not let computers take over our lives.
380	382	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, @ORGANIZATION1's benefit society immensely. They help us learn about far - away places, they help us with our school work, and they let us communicate with other people online. We need computers.  Computers allow us to learn about other countries, people, cultures etc... How would we learn about places we might want to go on vacation? Or how would we learn about the places we want to see and the places we want to stay away from? We need computers to do this. With just a few clicks, we can access detailed information about different destinations, including their history, geography, and local customs. We would never even know of some countries if it weren't for computers.  Next, computers help us with our school work. Sometimes we get projects, and most of them involve research! Computers make this a whole lot easier on us. Instead of spending hours in the library searching through books, we can find relevant information in seconds. Also, instead of lugging your text books from school to home and back, we can use online textbooks. Online textbooks are often more up - to - date and can be accessed from anywhere with an internet connection. Why give us extra work? It's a waste of everyone's time. Instead of wasting your minutes talking on a phone, you can chat online. Wasting minutes is wasting money. Who wants to do that? Besides, using the keyboard to chat with friends will help you in the future, such as improving your typing speed and communication skills. @NUM1 out of @NUM2 students say they prefer to talk online rather than call someone. Computers benefit us by providing easy access to information. Computers are a lot easier to help us with school work than textbooks are.  Lastly, computers let us talk to other people online. Without computers, everything would be so much harder. We can connect with friends and family around the world, share ideas, and collaborate on projects. Whether it's a simple chat or a video conference, computers have made communication more convenient and efficient.  In conclusion, computers are an essential part of our society. They offer us the ability to learn, assist us in our studies, and enable us to communicate effectively. We should continue to embrace and make the most of this technology for our personal and social growth.
381	383	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1, do you think computers are good for providing us with useful information? I certainly agree with you, @CAPS2. This is only one of the reasons why I agree with the use of computers. The reasons are: They provide us with information for learning, they allow us to communicate with people, and they provide entertainment. However, I also understand why someone would oppose that. Let me explain my point of view. Whenever I need to learn something or know something that I don't know about, I go to my computer and look it up. Many search engines such as @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS3 and @LOCATION1 allow us to input a question or phrase and gives us links to other websites that hold information about the topic we are trying to learn about. Another way computers help us learn is because we can download and install software that help us with things like learning a foreign language or even just practicing math. For example, my grandfather wanted to learn how to speak @CAPS4 but he didn't have time to go to classes. So he ordered a program that teaches him how to speak @CAPS4 while he is home. Another reason why I think that computers benefit society is because it allows us to communicate with other people. One way is through social sites where you have a profile and you can ""chat"" with your friends by typing in what you want to say. Another way is through video chat. This is when you have a webcam and you can see and talk to other people. I think that this is very important because @PERCENT1 of people think that the computers leads people to become ""anti - social"". It also helps you connect with old school friends and relatives that are far away. This can actually improve some people's social skills if they are shy. Do you like music, movies, and more? Well you have access to them through your computer. This is yet another reason how computers can benefit us. If you are going somewhere that you think your kids will be bored all you have to do (if you have a laptop) is put a movie in for them to watch. Another way that computer provide entertainment is they let us listen to music. If you have an ipod or @NUM1 player you can download the music from the computer. It also provides us with entertainment if we are interested in playing video games. There is entertainment for everyone. Even though I support the use of computers I understand the negative effect they have on many people. Some of those things are: people stop exercising and become overweight, they may become less interactive with other people, and they may not spend as much time in the fresh air. In conclusion, I think that computers can benefit our society. The reasons why I think this are: they provide us with information, allow us to communicate, and provide us with entertainment."
382	384	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, do you think computers have a positive effect on people? I know I do. Computers are good for many reasons: One reason is because people can learn about far - away places; Second, they can talk to people and learn about their culture and Third, they can teach hand - eye coordination. First off, if you're planning a trip, you want to learn about where you are going. Computers can help with that! Also, if you want to find good hotels you can use the computer for that. If you need transportation just log onto google and type in what you're looking for. Now, if you are doing a project for school or something on a different area of the world you can log onto your skype, facebook, @CAPS3, @CAPS4, or any other website that you use. You can achieve many things while talking to friends on the internet, such as: find out school assignments, find out due dates, make dates and many more wonderful things. Hand - eye coordination is very important. Computers can help with that. Drivers need very good hand - eye coordination; if you don't have that then plan on a big insurance bill. If you don't have good hand - eye coordination then you are going to have a hard time with a lot of stuff. So that's why computers are a good thing to have in our society. You can learn about where you are going, stuff that you need to get done, and even become a better driver. In essence, computers bring a multitude of advantages to our lives.
383	385	1	3	"Dear Newspaper, Computers have a positive effect on people because they teach hand - eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people and allow people to talk online with other people. The invention of computers is the single most important event of the @DATE1. @PERSON1, a well - respected professor at @ORGANIZATION3 says that ""the invention of computers has led to hundreds even thousands of new discoveries. This week alone, @CAPS3 have discovered @NUM1 new drugs that could put an end to cancer."" A report in @ORGANIZATION1 stated that @PERCENT1 of fortune @NUM2 companies are run solely by computer programs. @ORGANIZATION1 also states that the other @PERCENT2 of fortune @NUM2 companies plan to switch to computer - based operations by the end of @DATE2. For personal use, computers allow you to communicate with your fellow peers in order to work on school projects. Computers make life easier in general and can help with all life throws at you. First, computers teach hand - eye coordination and can improve reflexes and reaction time. Computer - based video games can prepare you for real - life tasks and challenges by improving your physical skills. Numerous flight simulators and driving simulators are available on the consumer market. In this day and age, flight schools require their students to complete hundreds of hours of flight simulators. Some driving schools even make their students learn to drive in a simulator before hitting the open road. Other games such as the @CAPS1 @CAPS2, require you to think on your feet and can improve your reflexes. This @CAPS2 makes you dodge bricks and can greatly improve reaction time as well. All of the programs available via the computer can help you with real - life obstacles and make you think creatively. Next, computers allow you to learn about faraway places and people. This is especially interesting because you can learn about a country's culture without actually going there. This opportunity allows you to immerse yourself in different cultures and religions and would make it easier to relate to people in faraway lands. @CAPS4 once said ""@CAPS3 are afraid of only what is different than us, therefore, @CAPS3 have nothing to fear if nothing is different."" @CAPS4 meant that if @CAPS3 know about people and places different than us, @CAPS3 do not have to be afraid of anything. Computers allow us to see people all around the world and learn about them. Seeing different things enriches our life and can make us better people. Lastly, the invention of computers allows us to communicate with people from all around the world. With the invention of @CAPS5, @ORGANIZATION2 and @CAPS6, @CAPS3 can talk to friends that move out of town. @ORGANIZATION2 reported that of its @NUM4 million users, @NUM5 million users have friends that live in a different country. When I was @NUM6, my friend @PERSON2 moved to @LOCATION1. We missed each other until I turned @NUM7 and @ORGANIZATION2 was invented. We were both online one day and I searched his name to see if he had an account. He did and we immediately started video - chatting on a weekly basis. Programs like @CAPS5 allow you to make new friends as well as reconnect with old friends. In short, the birth of the computer has allowed for vast improvement in society as a whole. Individuals can talk with friends who live in different countries as if they were in the same room. Businessmen and women can have meetings on the computer with programs such as @CAPS8. Government officials can talk with other leaders from around the world. Despite some people that think the advent of the computer has affected communication, I believe that it is an effective tool that everybody should have access to."
384	386	1	3	Dear Newspaper, I believe that computers have a positive effect on people. I believe this because we can talk to people in different countries in a quarter of a second, we can send e - mails to other people, and finally we can go to @LOCATION1, ask @CAPS1 question and get an instant reply. First, we can talk to people in different countries. Did you ever have a relative go on vacation in a foreign country and have no way of calling them to see if everything is okay? Let's say for instance that they brought their laptops but forgot their cellphones. Then, the only way we can contact them is by e - mail. Even if you're just at home, you can keep in touch through email. You can even use a computer so you can video chat, and not have to wait long to get your reply. Next, we can send e - mails to other people. Have you ever sent somebody a letter by mail and had to wait two to three days for a reply? Sometimes, your letter is even lost, and there is no way of finding out. Well with e - mail, the wait time of your reply depends on how fast the person whom you are talking to types and most people I know can type a reply in @NUM1 to @NUM2 seconds. I believe that is a huge difference from two to three days. With e - mail, there is an eighty - three percent chance that your email will not be lost. If for some reason it is lost, there will be a message sent to you telling you that your message was lost and that you need to send a new message. But most likely, chances are that your message will reach its destination. We can go to @LOCATION1, ask @CAPS1 question and get an instant reply. Were you ever wondering about something and the answer was on the tip of your tongue but you just can't think of it? If so you probably would be smart to go to @LOCATION1. You can ask @CAPS1 question and get an instant reply. And I mean any question. You can ask questions from what the price of something is in @LOCATION2, to what an object is. If you wanted to you could ask math questions as well, such as what is the square root of pi, and what is @NUM3. From @LOCATION1 to myspace the internet is full of information that can have a positive effect on people. This is why I think that the computer has a positive effect on people, we can talk to people in different countries, we can send e - mails, and we can ask all sorts of questions. In conclusion, computers are a valuable asset in our lives, facilitating communication and providing a wealth of knowledge.
385	387	1	3	Dear, editor. Did you know, @PERCENT1 of children who spend most of their time on the computer and do not exercise can develop weight problems and blood disorders? That is just one way that advances in computer technology have affected people so far. If advances continue that number will increase and other problems may arise from it. Some other problems that we have noticed since @DATE1 that could get worse are, developing a weak immune system, and emotionally separating yourself from your family. First, let's talk about obesity. Obesity is a terrible sight to see someone go through because of something as silly as being, basically, addicted to the computer. Not only can obesity constrict vital organs but it can lead to blood disorders. Blood disorders, such as high blood pressure and diabetes, can cause you to have a heart attack. Which cuts off oxygen to vital areas of the body. Which leads to, eventually, premature death. Dealing with obesity is bad enough, but seeing them suffer because they have developed a weak immune system is horrible. In my experience I find that people who are on the computer often generally don't have very good immune systems. For example, a friend of mine is on the computer quite often, and has developed a weak immune system. Because of it he misses at least @NUM1 day of school a week. And because he misses so many days a school year he usually keeps bad grades. Which is yet another reason why advances in computer technology are a bad idea. So isn't it relatively obvious that advances in technology are a bad idea? Especially being that, children are steadily becoming obese, and developing a weak immune system can affect your life in ways that are totally controllable? So I urge you to write an article about this to stop the growing sickness known as health problems due to technology. We need to take action to prevent these negative impacts on our health and well - being.
386	388	1	3	Almost everyone is affected by computers in some sort of way. Some people think computers are bad because some individuals spend excessive amounts of time on their computers. The thing is, computers are incredibly helpful in our everyday life. If we want to communicate with people from around the world and send donations to places in need like @LOCATION1 or @CAPS1, we can conveniently use computers to achieve that. We can truly change people's lives in third - world countries with the assistance of computers. Computers can also be a great aid in school. When a student has to write a report and has poor handwriting, they can simply type it up and print it neatly. Or if a student has to do research for an essay, they can easily find the required information on the computer. Maybe a kid forgets his homework, he can quickly go to his school website and locate it. My last point would be that computers are a huge help for businesses. When files are lost or misplaced, the workers can use the computer and retrieve the back - up file. When they need to order supplies, most of the time they will visit a website and place the order online. Or when updates are posted about upcoming events in that company, an email is sent out and can be accessed using a computer. Many people think that people overuse their computers, but that is the user's fault, not the computer's. We should be responsible for choosing how long we use a computer. Many jobs would be impossible without computers. It's not about overusing them; it's about using them appropriately. So overall, I say computers are good and very useful when used in the right hands. They are an indispensable part of modern life, contributing to various aspects of our personal, academic, and professional lives.
387	389	1	3	Dear newspaper, I've read your article about people's opinions on the effects of computers. I firmly believe that having computers is a very good thing. With them, we can talk to others from far away, and the communication is fast. You can also learn a great deal from computers. It also teaches hand - eye coordination. My first reason why they are good is because you can talk to others. Without computers, it would be almost impossible to meet people from far away and have easy conversations with them. They even have webcams so you can see each other's expressions and gestures. You can use @CAPS1, @CAPS2, webcams, or even a simple comment on Facebook or MySpace. @CAPS2 or webcams are the quickest and maybe even the coolest way to interact. Secondly, you can learn. Computers have numerous websites that offer a large amount of up - to - date information. It's much easier to get on the internet, type something in a search bar, than to look through a bunch of books. The internet has dictionaries, news stations, weather forecasts, historical data, and places where you can find various things. With all that, you don't even really need books. They even have maps and you can print out directions. My final reason is because it teaches hand - eye coordination. When you first start using computers, you're normally quite young, and sometimes you don't type very fast. Computers have become so advanced that there are even touch - screen devices and wireless mice. So when you first start, you usually look down to see what you're writing. Later, as adults encourage you to look at the screen, when that becomes easy, you know that your hand - eye coordination has improved significantly compared to when you started. In conclusion, I think that computers are a good part of everyday life and that they are not bad. They are an easy means of communication between people, help you learn, and teach good and fast hand - eye coordination in kids, making them an essential tool in our modern world.
388	390	1	3	I think that computers do benefit us. They allow us to interact with people, talk to family far away, help us with school, give us easy access to information, and much more. People usually have family and friends who live apart from each other, and the computer enables us to interact with them. The computer lets us email and instant message them, play games against them, and be their friend on websites like Facebook so you can see recent pictures of them. It's not easy to interact with family and friends who live so far away, and the internet allows us to do that conveniently. The computer doesn't just let you talk to family and friends but it also lets you meet new people and interact with them from all over the world. It allows you to make new friends and play games with them or have a chat. The computer really helps you to stay in touch with other people, and it's a very easy and convenient way to do so. The next thing the computer helps us with is it entertains us. Children are very hyper, and after homework is done, they often have nothing to do. So the computer lets them play games on it, chat with friends, watch movies and videos, upload pictures, etc. It does a lot for them. Kids could hang out after school, but if they can go on the computer, it makes them want to go home where their parents know that they are safe and away from drugs, alcohol, and other bad things they can get into. Just because kids like the computer, that doesn't mean that's the only thing they do. Kids are very athletic, always playing sports and full of energy, but the computer provides a way for them to relax. They go to school for hours, then go to basketball or football practice, sometimes they just need a break. The computer isn't always just fun; it's very useful. The computer helps us with school. It allows us to type essays and projects neatly. It also gives us easy access to information to help write the essays. Websites like Google and Bing are easy - to - use websites that can help us get good and accurate information about whatever the topic is that we are working on. The computer is very useful when it comes to school. As you can see, the computer is very important in our lives and makes life a lot easier. It's your choice how much time you want to spend on it. But no matter what, the computer definitely benefits us, being a multi - functional tool in our daily lives.
389	391	1	3	"People should use computers; they do bring benefits to society. More and more people are using them @DATE1 and agree that these virtual portals of information and communication are extremely helpful. Think about it, paper is made out of trees, and of course, to get the paper, you must cut down the tree first, and then it has to go through a whole wasteful process to become that paper. If everyone used computers, we wouldn't have to cut down those beautifully, lush trees. And also, have you ever needed to get information fast? Well, instead of going through a book and possibly spending hours searching, finding that information on the internet would be so much quicker! Lastly, in the future, everything will eventually be run with computers; they are the present, the past, and the future! They'll never go out of style! Computers are extremely helpful with endless information. A lot of people @DATE1 are very concerned about our environment and how we're treating the earth. They are looking for new ways to help the world be as green as possible. An easy alternative for paper is a computer. Once, for school, I was assigned a paper; I looked up the information on the computer easily, typed it up, and sent it by email to my teacher. Not a single piece of paper had been used! Ok, so I know, computers use up a lot of energy, but to be honest, they don't have to. Many people around the world use solar panels to gain their energy from the sun to power their lights, computers, etc.! The use of computers is extremely eco - friendly and, like I said before, is a great alternative to our everyday wasteful use of paper and pencil. Do you want to look up information fast? Well, on the computer, you can! All you do is type in what you need in a search engine and @CAPS1! you have the info you need! Instead of using a book (which wastes trees) to slowly find your information, you can use a simple computer to do the job. A poll was taken and shows that @PERCENT1 of students at @CAPS2 @CAPS3 school who use the computer to look up information get faster and more accurate results! Do you want that or slow information found in a boring book? The future is not far away. It is already @DATE2 and we are using the computer for so much. Ok, so the computer does show to cause distractions and headaches if used too long, but it is a great invention of the future. Instead of going to a restaurant and ordering off a menu, we'll order from computers/touch - screens. More and more people are coming up with better and faster computers. Everyone is using computers and loves them, and they will definitely be used in the future. I hope you see how amazing computers can be. They're environmentally useful and a great alternative to our everyday wasteful use of paper and pencil, they help you find the information you need fast, and as professor Grant states, ""I do all my work on the computer; without it, I would be lost."" And lastly, they are the future of our world. They are revolutionizing the way we live, work, and interact."
390	392	1	3	Many people like computers and like to use them for many different kinds of reasons. Some people use them to get an online education. Others use them to talk to family and friends that are far away. Also, students use them to do research for school. These are reasons why computers could be good devices. There are many people that now have the ability to get an online education because of problems they have. For example, people who can't walk and don't like going to regular school. The computer would help them find websites that offer free education. The computer can assess what level they are at, just like a regular teacher. The computer would make it so easy and better for the people who don't have the ability to walk. They can even study for tests that they have on the computer. This is one reason why many people use computers. Many families use computers to try to look for friends that they haven't seen in a long time or family that are far away. They can contact them by chatting through websites. They also search for addresses and phone numbers. Many people get to find their family through the internet. They can arrange to meet in a spot or even visit one another's houses. The computer would make their dreams of reuniting with family come true. This would be an exciting event for them, which is why they need computers. This is one very important reason. Students use computers to research projects. Without computers, students won't be able to look for the information they need. The computer would teach students about people in the past they didn't know or didn't get to meet. The computer would inspire them to want to learn more about interesting history. Children need computers to enhance their intelligence and knowledge. These are some reasons why I think we all need computers. We need them for people who don't have the ability to walk, for people who have family and friends far away, and for students who would like to learn more. These are all things people enjoy doing on a computer. If there were no computers, it would shatter everybody's dreams and future. So these are some reasons why many people choose to use computers. They are essential tools that open up new opportunities in education, social connection, and knowledge acquisition.
391	393	1	3	@ORGANIZATION1, Our technology is advancing greatly and more inventions are coming out; but aren't you worried that people spend too much time on technology? I know @CAPS1 is worried. For example, computers. Computers have the technology to go online and chat with various people all around the world. That's when I get worried. In this essay, I will explain why it is bad to spend too much time on computers. It is bad because people don't exercise, enjoy mother nature, and interact with family and friends. Firstly, people are forgetting how important it is to exercise. It is very important because it keeps you fit and healthy. With computers in use, people become less fit and healthy. They start getting fat, their cholesterol gets high, and they stress more. Secondly, they don't enjoy mother nature. When people start going on the computers, they stop doing a lot of things. Like stop going outside and getting fresh air. They get closed in a small bubble, and all they care about is the computers. They don't go out to camp, play outside; they don't do anything. Every day they are on the computer. Finally, one big main problem is that they stop interacting with family and friends. When mothers and fathers are on it, they don't pay attention to their young ones and are always on it. When teenagers are on the computers, they don't talk to their parents, they ignore their friends, and the people that care about them most. They won't care for anybody but themselves. @CAPS2, there you have it; that is why I think we should cut down on computer usage. For these following reasons: People stop exercising and being fit. They stop enjoying mother nature, and they stop interacting with family and friends. @CAPS2, what do you think? In conclusion, reducing computer time can lead to a healthier and more fulfilling life, so it's worth making the effort.
392	394	1	3	I think that computers are a good thing to have because most are portable, they're fun to have, and you can research a lot of things on them. Laptops are carry - around computers. They are very convenient to have. You can bring them anywhere you would like, whether it's to a coffee shop, a park, or on a business trip. Many people have laptops in their home or with them. They're fun to have because you can play many games on your free time with them too. You can play all sorts of games, from action - packed shooters to relaxing puzzle games. Another thing you can do is make videos. You can create short films, vlogs, or even edit home movies. Last but not least, you can just enjoy it. You can research a lot of things on them. The internet is a very successful product. That means you can use it for your homework if you need help. You can find detailed information on any subject, from history to science. Another thing is that you can type up essays that you have to do for work and or school. Typing on a computer is faster and neater than writing by hand. In conclusion, the portability, entertainment value, and research capabilities of computers make them a valuable addition to our lives.
393	395	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, I think that people should try to exercise more than they go on the computer. Computers are one of the main reasons for our nation's obesity rate being as big as it is now, including junk foods like McDonald's. I'm a big fan of computers myself, don't get me wrong. I would be on the computer all night if I could, but I don't want to neglect my body. I go to bed at @NUM1. I usually stay on the computer for an hour or two, depending if I'm doing a project. Also, going on the computer less could make your life more fun. Instead of sitting inside, go outside and play some sports like football, hang out with your friends, have a picnic with your family. Do something else than be on the computer. Conclusively, if people just push themselves to stay on the computer for an @NUM2 hour and a half, the obesity rate will go down. It could also help save our planet by saving the energy. In conclusion, by reducing computer time and increasing physical activity, we can improve our health and contribute to a better environment.
394	396	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I think it's okay for people all over the world to use computers. The reason why I believe this is because a lot of people use computers for a lot of things. People all over the world use computers for something important, in case of emergency and much more. Us kids/students in @ORGANIZATION1 use computers to go on MySpace, Facebook, and the chat line to talk to our friends or even to talk to other people in the world. We also talk to our family that lives somewhere far away. Some of our family lives here in the @LOCATION1 but in a different state. Lots of us kids go to MySpace to talk to friends, family, people who we don't even know, people from all over the world, and people that we haven't seen in years. Well then again, people also use computers to sell drugs, which is very bad for our environment. This is one good reason why people are so affected and addictive to their computers because bad people and drug dealers sell drugs over the internet and other bad people and drug dealers buy the drugs over the internet. As far as I know, a lot of people over the internet, I also know that the people outside the internet wouldn't do those things and even the people inside the internet wouldn't do those bad things and sell drugs over the internet. The reason why I know this is because they're my friends. They're smart and they just wouldn't do no such thing over the internet or even at all. I tell you again to my local newspaper it is okay for the people around the entire world to use any computer, laptop, tablet or anything as long as they have a connection. But as for the drug dealers and bad people, it's up to them if they want to keep doing what they keep doing because eventually they will end up getting caught and getting brought to jail. I tell you that computers are meant to have fun but not meant to sell drugs over the internet. Anyway, in conclusion, computers have many positive uses, and while there are risks like drug - dealing online, most people use them responsibly, and the law will deal with the wrongdoers.
395	397	1	3	"Now - a - days the technological industries are taking over the modern society and are captivating users, making them virtually addicted. What good is that? These people indulged in the online world are less interactive and showed more signs of depression in recent studies. Also, if you are sitting around on the computer all day, you aren't burning calories, so you are gaining unnecessary weight that could easily be prevented. Going to the library is just as useful if not more useful than going on the internet. Lastly, have you thought of the damaging effects, trojans, cyber - bullying, violence? In other words, computers are just a negative waste of good money. Families are becoming less and less connected with each other. Who's to blame? It's that big book of technology on your desk. Rather than socializing and just spending time with family and friends, computer addicts choose to sit on their butts talking and gaming away. They are tearing our family apart. @CAPS1, one @LOCATION1 man on her two teenage children's computer obsession. ""I swear they're on that thing for hours on end"" she claims. In an article I was reading the other day, it said that most people who suffer depression admitted to being online for at least @NUM1 hours per day. What does all of this go to show? Computers are a form of abuse. Take them out of your child's life, or at least limit them. Studies prove that @PERCENT1 of people who spend most of their day surfing the web have either overweight or just on the borderline of being overweight. Rather than going into the real world and experiencing life for themselves, they look it up online and rely on other people's opinions. Does this mean anything to you? People who are overweight have a higher risk of aging, and if not, then they have some pretty health problems. All because they didn't want to breathe fresh air. When in a library environment, people tend to be more and more on task. You might ask yourself the answer is simply that the internet is too expansive and distracting. If you are in the library, you can't get in as much trouble, you can't play online games, or even be looking at things that are inappropriate. Libraries have more credible sources and reliable information to study from. Not to mention you can go with a family, friend, or even be tutored. Computers don't provide that. Going to the library is such a better solution. I must admit, I was before a computer addict, and believe me the effects it has on people are atrocious. Now that I've moved on from that period of my life, I can honestly say, the addictive grasp it has on you is strong, I know. I also know first - hand the rewards of being clean from this harmful drug per say. I am more sociable than ever and I'm dealing with issues much better. I am @NUM2 pounds and in the best shape of my life, and I even made my school's cheer team. I often go to the library to study and I must say, I'm very proud of who I've become. I was spending around @NUM3 hours online and getting little sleep. If I can do it, you can too. My name is @CAPS2 and I'm a computer addiction survivor. In conclusion, breaking free from computer addiction can lead to a healthier, more social, and fulfilling life, so it's a change worth making."
396	398	1	3	"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, @CAPS2 look closely at the remarkable advances in technology over the years and can clearly tell what a profound influence it has had on the current day and people. The question is, are these advances for the better? Or will they take a turn for the worst? Today I will be talking to you about technology, and why I think it's benefitting society poorly. With people spending significantly less time exercising and enjoying the beauty of nature, leaving their precious social life behind by constantly being glued to the computer, they don't realize how much they're hurting themselves. The number of obese people, especially in children, increases each day. This is primarily caused by the lack of exercise because some people are too engrossed in responding to texts, talking on the phone, and playing unneeded video games. Not only are they physically harming themselves, but they are definitely missing out on the wonderful aspects of mother nature! Why not step out for a little while, escape the technology prison cell you've all been reeled into. The @ORGANIZATION1 is one of the most beautifully scenic countries in the world, take advantage of that! Now, without proper exercise, you're putting your heart at serious risks. Even doing smaller things, like a set of jumping jacks or a few sit - ups, can help make you and your heart healthy! Your parents, and even your parents' parents, are the ones who brought you into this world, fought for you in times of need, and would do anything to protect you. What would you say if I told you technology was pushing them away? Texting at the dinner table while they are trying to make conversation, never leaving your room because you're playing ""fun"" games, hiding behind the face of technology are all the things a vast number of people do instead of socializing with the people who matter most: family and friends. Although your friends might be more easy - going, they still care that you're too busy hanging out with your computer to come meet up with them. No single person can live without a friend and that friend needs you! Make some time for the people who have a special place in your heart before they disappear. To sum it up, technology is corrupting the minds of human beings... and it needs to stop! Like I said, be healthy and happy and spend enough time with the people you care about. Who knows, maybe they can make you happier than your electric companion. So, fellow citizens, leap off that desk chair, shut off your electronic devices, and jump back into the real world."
397	399	1	3	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I have heard that people are deeply contemplating how computers are having a bad effect on people, and I firmly disagree. Computers assist people so much in schools, workplaces, and at home. Not having computers would have a far worse effect on people than having them. For students, it is an absolute necessity to conduct in - depth research, and type essays, letters, and so many other writing pieces, and the same holds true for all of society. In almost every school all over the country, students rely on computers on a daily basis. I personally have to log into the computer to type an essay for a class at least twice a week, and some @ORGANIZATION1 students even more frequently. For example, my @CAPS1 teacher asks our class to write a large number of essays or letters. She has repeatedly told us that if our handwriting is not legible, she won't grade it. Having the computers to type on eliminates the issue that if our teacher can't read it, she can't grade it. I understand that people would argue that it makes people write things by hand a lot less and people would lose the ability to hand - write things. However, with such advanced technology on computers and the ability to type anything with such precision, soon handwriting will no longer be required. Any person, for whatever research they need, can find information so easily using a computer. For students in any grade level and any class, research projects are bound to be assigned by a teacher. Using books and other traditional means of research are slow and ineffective. Getting onto a computer and looking up the topic is fast and simple and gives better results than books. The same goes for jobs. For example, a person might need to set up a comprehensive powerpoint presentation. Not only does the computer have powerpoint on it - which is an effective way of setting up projects, but the computer allows that person to do research all in one place. This makes it so much simpler to gather a lot of information and not have to run around getting books and talking to people who know the subject. I understand that computers could ""take control"" of people and people would spend too much time on them. But most of the few that do stay on computers too long learn to balance their time. Keeping computers would benefit in so many ways. Writing many different essays, letters, typing for projects, and doing research would be done faster and easier."
398	400	1	3	Dear Newspaper Readers, @CAPS1 computers have truly revolutionized the way people use technology. It has transformed our society in many significant ways. People can access information at a speed faster than ever before with this remarkable device. People can also communicate with friends, especially on popular websites. Computers are even widely used in schools, mostly in colleges. @CAPS1, the advantage of using it in school means a great deal to the people and their education. Computers have changed the human race forever. When my grandparents went to school, they had no idea what a computer was. Their sources of knowledge were prior knowledge, knowledge from a teacher, or a dictionary. We are so fortunate today to have computers in our schools because my grandparents would have loved to have something as quick and as simple as a computer. @CAPS1, having access to a computer can really help people in so many different ways, mainly in exploring the world. What is the first place you would go to talk to people online: @CAPS2. Do you know that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people have @CAPS2? The reason why it is so popular is that people want to talk to friends that they enjoy chatting with. From my experience, even people outside of Canada have @CAPS2 too, which is quite surprising. Talking to people across the country is an amazing experience. It offers an opportunity for people to make new friends. This can also impact the way people live. When teenagers attend high school, they have a choice of taking specific, almost like a helpful one - on - one classes. The reason for taking these classes is that when you are in college, you need to learn a lot in a short amount of time. I know people who stay up late working on their papers. @CAPS1, these are definite advantages for everyday life, especially in college because it is an opportunity for someone to get better at typing. Computer classes can really help someone trying to learn how to type at a fast pace, and even get a couple more hours of sleep! In conclusion, I believe @CAPS1 computers affect our society in a positive way. Thank you for reading this letter, and I hope you can take this into consideration. @CAPS1 computers have dramatically changed lives forever, making our world a more connected and informed place.
399	401	1	3	Dear, @CAPS1 paper editor, we should put a stop to the over - reliance on computers because people aren't doing anything productive. They're just staying home, glued to the computer screen. This is making their lives worse. We should establish a day without computers, and everyone should go outside and get some exercise. The more you exercise, the better you'll understand the world around you, and the stronger you'll get. People love computers because they can connect with their friends and play games. But sometimes, we have to step away from the screen and go outside. Sometimes I like using the computer, but I end up spending a little too much time on it, and I don't get enough exercise. I really hope I can break this habit and go outside more often. We can still have computers, but we shouldn't use them for long periods. We should only allow kids to use the computer for two or three hours a day. When kids are using the computer, they often use it for more than the recommended hours, which is not good. That's why they should go outside and experience the real world. In conclusion, we need to find a balance between computer use and real - life activities to lead healthier and more fulfilling lives.
400	402	1	3	Dear local Newspaper, I think that computers have an excellent benefit for people. First, family and friends can communicate easily from a far distance. Secondly, typing on the computer enhances people's good hand and eye coordination. Thirdly, they give people the ability to learn about far - away places in great detail. Lastly, it gives students a chance to thoroughly research a topic they are learning about. Well @CAPS1, what do you think? Researcher @PERSON1 said that almost @PERCENT1 of families live far away from each other. Computers give the ability for families to communicate whether it's through an instant messaging service like AIM or a webcam chat. Also, out of the @PERCENT1 of families that live far away from each other, @PERCENT2 use the computer to communicate regularly. Regarding hand and eye coordination, some people type without looking and some people are really slow. Typing on a computer provides great hand and eye coordination training. Good hand and eye coordination could be used for many things. For example, it can be useful when playing sports or even when performing a simple task like throwing something in the trash accurately. Lastly, have you ever wanted to learn about a place far away from where you live or have you ever researched a topic for school? Well I have. Computers give people the ability to learn about places far away in a comprehensive way. For example, in the third grade, I had to conduct in - depth research on hammerhead sharks. Don't teachers always ask their students to look up a word or a topic on the computer? As I have said before, I think computers have a great benefit on people. I hope that my three reasons of contacting family and friends, improving hand and eye coordination, and facilitating research have made you think it's a good thing too. Thank you for taking the time to read what @CAPS1 I had to say and I hope you take it into consideration. In summary, computers are a valuable asset that enriches our lives in multiple ways and should be embraced.
401	403	1	3	Dear Local @CAPS1, I firmly believe that computers have a positive effect on people. There are numerous ways computers can have positive effects on humans. First, computers are powerful tools that bring people together and enable seamless interaction. They allow people to talk to each other in real - time, regardless of geographical distances. Computers also open the door for people to learn about new things. The internet is a vast repository of information, covering every subject imaginable. Moreover, computers let people do things that would be impossible without them. Computers excel at facilitating human interaction. They bring people together in ways previously unimaginable. People can use the internet to send emails to each other. When you need to write a letter to someone, it might take days for them to receive it. But with email, they would get it the second you send it. There are also websites like Facebook that let you talk to your friends. Such websites connect people from all over the world. When you and your friend can't talk in person, you just have to get on your computer. Computers also come equipped with web cameras, which let people talk to each other face - to - face. You can see the other person's facial expressions and hear their voice, which is far better than a phone call or writing a letter. That's why computers are a positive influence on people. Computers also empower you to learn about new things at any time. Whenever you want to find something out or have a question, you can turn to the internet. If you ask someone else, they might not know the answer. Computers let people see pictures and videos. If you want to see a picture of @CAPS2 that you are interested in, you can simply turn on your computer and type it in. Computers let people see pictures that they couldn't see in real life. Videos let you watch something funny to cheer up your day. If you love a show and missed it, you can find it on the computer. Computers also enable you to do things that you couldn't do without them. When a teacher asks me to type a paper, I always do it on the computer. If there were no computers, I would have to use a typewriter, and if I made a mistake, I would have to type the whole thing again. Computers also allow you to play music. You can put a CD in the computer, and it will play the music. In conclusion, computers benefit society and have a positive effect on people. They let people interact with each other, bring people together, help people learn new things, and enable tasks that would otherwise be impossible. Computers have many positive effects on people, so I hope you agree that computers benefit society.
402	404	1	3	"Dear Local Newspaper, The effects computers have on people are positive. I say that it is positive because imagine you're in a rush, and you're unsure whether you need your rain boots or not. You can quickly check the computer for the weather forecast. It's also positive because without the computer, most offices would struggle to run their business. Keeping everything on files is an arduous task. Especially in schools, teachers don't keep their students' grades in a filing cabinet; they store them on the computer. Otherwise, they'd need a huge filing cabinet to accommodate all the records. I can understand why some people think computers have a bad effect on people. They might think that it takes away time from nature, friends, and family. But many people take their laptops to the local park to sit under a tree on warm days and use the computer there. Students, in particular, often do their homework under the leaves to help them relax. Also, for people whose family or friends live in other states, if they don't have the house number or don't have time for a long conversation, they can email them or use social networking platforms like Facebook or MySpace to look at their profile pages and say a quick, ""Hello, how are you doing?"" Local shop owner @PERSON1 says, ""I barely have time for myself! So when I want to say hello to my sister in @LOCATION1, I usually say hello on Facebook because I know how she loves to talk my ear off!"" I remember one morning, when I was rushing before school, I had no idea what type of outfit to wear. I checked the local news casting website for the weather forecast, and thank goodness I did! I would have gotten stuck in a downpour without an umbrella. Computers are also great for catching up on news or just relaxing and playing some games. So, if you're wondering about the weather to see if today will be a good day to sit under the trees in the park and catch up on typing that report with your partner, then go ahead. But don't forget to email her and ask her first, since you lost her phone number. In conclusion, despite the concerns, computers offer numerous benefits and have a positive impact on our daily lives."
403	405	1	3	@ORGANIZATION1, @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people surveyed in @LOCATION1, unanimously agree that the use of computers benefits society. I personally side with these @NUM1 people, as computers have a positive effect on people. There are multiple reasons why I think the use of computers really benefits society, including teaching good hand - eye coordination, giving people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allowing people to talk online with other people. First of all, it's a well - proven fact that most sports involve hand - eye coordination to some extent. The computer can help people, from a very young age, develop good hand - eye coordination. When a person uses a computer, they have to keep an eye on the screen while still being able to use the mouse or keyboard. This requires a great deal of coordination. Many people don't even look at the mouse or keyboard when they are typing; they just know where everything is. People who disagree with what I'm saying often use the excuse that when people spend too much time on the computers, they aren't getting enough exercise. However, I believe that is not true. The hand - eye coordination people learn on the computer helps to improve their skills and coordination in sports. For example, in baseball, a person has to be looking at the ball to catch it, but at the same time, they have to move their arm to catch it. That's where the hand - eye coordination learned on the computer comes in handy. This proves that computers can benefit society through teaching people hand - eye coordination. In addition, @PERCENT1 of teachers at @ORGANIZATION2 believe that computers can be used as a great tool to help students learn. Computers give people the ability to learn about far - away places and people. They provide access to information about foreign places or people that might not be available in other resources. On the computer, one can go to a search site and type in any place in the whole world. Then all they have to do is search, and they'll have dozens of pages with information about that place and pictures. As a society that is advancing in technology, people can learn with just the click of a button. It's also a useful tool in schools. Teachers can have students do projects about different countries or people, and the students can easily gather the information on the computer. Computers benefit society in the way that they can teach about different locations and people. They can help people become interested in these different topics and may even inspire some people to go to these far - away places or interact with different people. Finally, @NUM4 out of @NUM5 people asked had some kind of way to contact people online, whether it was through email or Facebook. Computers allow people to talk online with other people. In our modern society, it is very important that a person has friends. Social media and email are great ways to keep in touch with friends, especially if they live very far away or you haven't talked to them in a while. Those who disagree with my opinion believe that spending time on the computer means less time with family and friends. I believe that is just the opposite. Since we are living in modern times, families understand that when kids go to college, they might be going far away or even across the country. Having a computer allows the family to chat and keep in contact easily. People talking to each other online is just another way how computers benefit society. In conclusion, computers can benefit society in multiple ways. They teach people hand - eye coordination, which can be useful throughout our lives. Most importantly, they give people the ability to learn about far - away places and people. Lastly, they allow people to talk online with others. We are living in a modern time, and society is advancing every day, and computers are a huge part of it! They are having a positive effect on people.
404	406	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I disagree because people should be enjoying spending time with family and not just sitting on the computer doing nothing. Do you agree with me so far? First of all, if you waste all your time on the computer, there's nothing productive you can get done. I've noticed that many children are on the computer right after school, just playing around. For example, my cousin is on the computer every day, just wasting his time. Are you still with me? Secondly, children should be using the computer for studying, not playing video games and going on websites that are not allowed. More than @NUM1 students and children are on the internet playing video games and doing things that are unproductive and done every day. I've also seen many kids playing games on the computer. Thirdly, students will never learn anything if they waste their time. The computer is for studying, but many students don't use their time wisely as they should. Many students should be using the computer only sometimes, not every day. I've noticed that so many students don't learn from the computer because they are not studying for tests. More than @PERCENT1 students fail classes because of excessive computer use. First of all, people should be spending time with family and friends because they are the most important people around us, not computers. Are you still with me? Secondly, friends are the most important people I've ever had because they care about and love you like your own family. But what if you just waste your time on the computer? How will you get to know all your friends? For example, my friend is always on the computer and never goes to see her friends, and her friends stop coming to her because she never cares about them, only the computer. Do you get what I'm saying here? Thirdly, family is also more important than just being on the computer because they care about you. You have to at least spend some time with your family. For example, many families stop spending time with each other because the computer is more important to them. Lastly, helping your community is a worthy goal because it makes your city look better. You don't want it to be messy. Also, many people quit helping with community service around the neighborhood. For example, I've seen trash on the grounds because people don't care. Finally, going out and playing sports and staying fit is very important. First of all, playing sports is fun and good for your health, but people never play sports anymore just because of the computer. For example, @NUM2 people have stopped playing sports. Secondly, going outside is very important because it's good for your well - being. In conclusion, we should limit our computer use and focus more on our relationships and physical health.
405	407	1	3	I believe computers have a positive effect on people. They teach hand - eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about far - away places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. All these things are beneficial, so why not use computers? We truly need computers. Do you think computers have a positive or a negative effect? After you hear my points, you might want to agree that computers have a positive effect. Computers have a positive effect in so many ways, such as in school, at work, for talking to others, and just for getting information from different websites. If we did not have computers or use them, we would probably rely on books. We would get information from the books, but not as much as we would get from the computer. We probably would not know that much if it weren't for computers. The reason why computers have a positive effect is that while you are typing on the computer, you are working your eyes and exercising your hands, which proves the development of hand - eye coordination. We can learn about places we don't live in. For instance, if there's been an earthquake in a certain area, we can go on websites to learn about it. You can get to learn how it is in a certain place you want to go on vacation to. You can also learn about famous people you don't know about. All you have to do is go on the computer and look up your favorite celebrity. Computers are something people use to talk to others and keep in contact. Now we have @CAPS1, @CAPS2, @CAPS3 and others. We use these platforms to talk to our friends and family. Some of our family or friends live in far - away places, so we use the computer to talk to them. If you have an email, teachers and people at work might have to email each other to handle business. You can even get schoolwork for students on the computer so that they can learn more and do different activities. You can even play games on the computer. You can explore nature virtually on the computer. I think the computer is a great way to learn and talk with others. Do you want your child to learn? Do you want your child to have fun? So tell me what you think! In conclusion, computers have a positive effect on people, offering a wide range of benefits in learning, communication, and entertainment.
406	408	1	3	I believe that computers have a negative effect on people. Using the computer affects a person's time because they sit for hours playing online games. It also affects their health because they're not getting any fresh air or spending time with their family. Lastly, it affects their education because the time they could be using to do their homework, they're on their computer. First, using the computer affects a person's time. It does that by wasting hours sitting there when you could be outside playing or doing chores around your house. You could be helping your family or friends out but instead are playing computer games. There goes all the time you could have been doing something good, wasted because of the computer. The computer also affects your health because you're in a room inside not getting any air. You're also not exercising and helping your body out. This could affect your emotional health. When you're on the computer, you're not talking to people and becoming social, and you could lose connections with your friends and your family. When you lose your connections and become isolated, you will use your computer more and then the situation will become worse. My last reason is that it affects education because when you could be doing your homework and studying for an important test, you're on the computer learning nothing. Then you will struggle in school and possibly mess up your future! This is really bad because you were on the computer. A couple of times I pushed homework aside to use the computer and my grades dropped a lot. So this is why it affects education. These are the reasons how the computer affects education, your health, and your time. I know you're thinking that computers could be used for education, but humans prefer fun over anything else. I hope this has helped you realize that the negative impacts of computers on our lives are significant and we should be more cautious about our computer use.
407	409	1	3	Dear local newspaper, my name is @PERSON1. I am @NUM1 years old and I go to a @ORGANIZATION1 in @LOCATION1 called @ORGANIZATION1. I am a really smart kid. In my opinion, I believe people benefit from using computers. You should keep reading my essay because I am going to tell you @NUM2 good reasons why people benefit from using computers. My first reason is they teach hand - eye coordination and give people the ability to learn about far - away places and people. For example, when I am always using the computer and doing research, it always gives me the ability to learn about new places and people. Another example is when I watch @CAPS2.V on @CAPS3 @NUM3, it says that people learn about far - away places and people on the internet @PERCENT1 of the time. My second reason is it allows people to talk online with other people. For example, when I am on the computer every day and visit my Facebook, it always gives me a chance to talk to my friends and other people online. Another example is when I go on a computer and search computers.org, it says that it lets people @PERCENT2 of the time talk to others online. My @NUM4 reason is it allows students to get information when they're doing a project. For example, when I always use the @ORGANIZATION1 computers, it allows me to get information, for example, about @LOCATION2 and @PERSON2 govina. That is why I believe people benefit from using computers. Another example is when I check out a magazine on computers, it tells me that kids get a lot of information when they're doing projects @PERCENT2 of the time. In conclusion, I believe people benefit from using computers because they teach hand - eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about far - away places and people, allow people to talk online with other people, and allow students to get information when they're doing projects. Those are the @NUM2 reasons why I believe people benefit from using computers. So please, the local newspaper, try to make this believable and spread the positive message about computer use.
408	410	1	3	"Dear editor, Computers are a waste of time. When kids get home from school, they put their homework down and go right on the computer. Computers are wasting the minds of little kids. Some kids don't even bother to look outside because they are glued to the computer. If there is only one computer in your house and there are no time limits on how long you can be on, it can cause problems between siblings or adults. If your brother or sister has been on the computer for a really long time and you want to go on and there are no parents around to mediate, there probably will be some fighting and yelling. Also, if somebody does something that they weren't supposed to do on the computer and it messes it up, the person who is always fixing it can get really mad. ""It's a nice day outside"" is what a lot of people hear from their parents. Most people just waste away the day by sitting on the computer with their favorite snack. A lot of people won't even look outside because they are too lazy to get up off of the computer and go for a walk or maybe play in the snow. My little brothers, who are only @NUM1 @NUM2 years old and are twins, like to play shooting games on the computer. They both enjoy killing people in games. I'm pretty sure that almost every other boy out there around their age feels the same way. My point is these games are teaching the kids nothing. All they're teaching them is how to kill people or animals, or do dangerous things where they could hurt themselves. I hope my letter showed people that computers can hurt other people and they waste your life. Instead of going to the park with your family, you're spending that time on the computer. Most of the time, it has a negative effect on people, which isn't very good. We should encourage kids and adults alike to limit their computer use and engage in more real - life activities."
409	411	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 of my local newspaper, More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. These boxes can be harmful to their users' eyes. In addition, they lead to less interaction with “real” people. Finally, they lead to a very unhealthy lifestyle. Computers are harmful to our society. For starters, computers are harmful because they are very bad for our eyes. Between the @DATE1 @DATE2 and @DATE3, doctors saw nearly a @PERCENT1 increase in eye problems that resulted in either surgery, glasses, or contacts. This can be directly associated with the overuse of personal computers. Also, studies have shown that common citizens who use these contraptions for over four hours each day end up with extremely deteriorated vision by the age of @NUM1. Finally, @CAPS2 @CAPS3 stated that overuse of computers has led to a very negative effect on the eyesight of their workers. It can be seen how work gets done faster, however, the cost of medical treatments actually surpasses the little extra profit gained by modernizing. Secondly, computers are harmful because they lead to less time being with “real” people. To begin with, studies have shown that people simply don't learn as much about their peers by talking to them through a box. Also, a study by the @ORGANIZATION1 has shown that there are roughly @PERCENT2 fewer conversations at social gatherings than just @DATE1. This is alarming because at that rate, people may never get to know each other and the world may become an electronically based workspace. Finally, @PERSON1, a social relations professional, stated that people end up with a lack of understanding when they can't feel the emotion a person has when he/she is speaking. Sure, you can video chat, but that still does not convey the real feeling behind a person's words. Finally, computers are harmful because they lead to a very unhealthy lifestyle. To begin with, the lack of fresh air obtained by sitting indoors all day is very bad for the lungs and can lead to premature breathing problems. Also, average people get @PERCENT3 fewer workouts, according to @CAPS4's @CAPS5, which was not likely directly influenced by overuse of computers. Finally, the obesity rate has risen from next to nothing to over @NUM2 in the past ten @DATE1. Research showed that the majority of the obese patients spent excessive time on their little boxes. While you might feel that this is not completely due to computers, it has been proven time and time again that these machines are the main reason behind the world's currently unhealthy lifestyle. Personal computers have a very negative effect on the society of today. This technology has resulted in very poor eyesight in the general public. In addition, they lead to a much lower amount of social interaction. Finally, they end up forcing people into an unhealthy lifestyle. So, let the word out that computers are bad for society, and try to make the world a better, more human - centered place to live.
410	412	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1, I believe that using computers is a good thing. They can help you learn about subjects or places you think are interesting but don't know about. They can help save the environment. These are the reasons why I think using computers is a good thing. First, they can help you learn about new subjects. Say you are doing a report for school on the @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 of the @CAPS2, but you didn't know anything about them. You could just go sit at your computer, enter ""@ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 of the @CAPS2"" in a Google search, and press enter. There you'll find hundreds, even thousands of entries about the @ORGANIZATION1. You could sit for a long time and learn all about these magnificent creations. You can learn about any subject on a computer, at any time. You could even learn about a computer and all of its history! Second, they can help save the environment. People are always using paper, and paper comes from trees. When we cut down trees, we are harming our environment. We are depleting our oxygen supply and destroying the habitats of animals and insects. If everybody used computers, we would be using less paper. We could use computers to send documents and papers. We could bring our computers to tax appointments and for various suits. Computers could even be used for school work. The teacher could assign the homework, email it to the student, the student could fill it out and email it back. Sure, we would still have to use paper for some things, but we would be using it in a much lesser amount. People could also use less fossil fuel. We could talk via the internet and things like Skype to communicate without having to travel and burn fuel. Thirdly, computers could help us advance into the future. Computers can help find ways to do many things such as better medical treatments, more efficient travel, and even in our every - day life. We could find better ways to treat serious medical conditions with the help of computers. We could find ways to treat cancers and maybe even the common cold. Computers could also help us find more efficient ways of doing things. They could help find a more efficient fuel, or it could help make a teleportation device. It could also help us explore deeper into space and find more planets and galaxies. Computers could also help us with our every - day life. When you get up in the morning, imagine being able to control your home devices through a screen and being able to have a hot shower, your breakfast, and your work equipment all ready within five minutes. That really would be the future of computers. Those are all of my reasons for having computers, from school research to space and beyond. We should embrace computers as they offer so many benefits for our learning, the environment, and our future progress."
411	413	1	3	Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 you truly agree that computers have a significant effect on people? I firmly think I @CAPS1 whole - heartedly agree that computers affect people. I @CAPS1 whole - heartedly agree with this statement because people don't get used to doing other things rather than staying glued to the computer. One clear example is that people who @CAPS1 constantly stay on the computer won't have much fun interacting with other people. They won't enjoy themselves as much as they could by staying on the internet. My last example is that doctors sometimes explicitly say it's not good for you to stay on the computer for long. First of all, people who stay on the computer won't have much fun with other people. I know one of my friends loves to get on the computer and stay on it for a long period of time. One aspect is that there isn't a lot to do on a computer for some people. People don't go out and have fun, like going to the mall with your friends. Some people try to focus on the computer if there's something important they have to do. Thirdly, people won't enjoy themselves. When @CAPS2 on the computer, I really don't enjoy myself by just sitting there on the internet. One important fact is that you won't want to enjoy a beautiful day with your family when they're going to the beach. People will stare at maps for a while and not want to go back to sleep, and you won't have anything else to do for the rest of the day. Sometimes you won't have a fulfilling life without enjoying it. Lastly, doctors say it's not good for you to always stay on the computer. One important fact is that you always need to exercise instead of just lounging around. Sometimes, problems might occur with your eyes because you're constantly staring at the computer. You need to do healthy things to help your body. In conclusion, I firmly agree with the statement, and my reasons are that you won't have fun, you won't enjoy yourself, and doctors say it's not good for you. I hope you liked my prompt so it can go in the newspaper.
412	414	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Computers are all around us, no matter where you go. You can learn various things on them or play a wide range of games. Although computers are ubiquitous, they do not have a positive effect on people because harmful people could find out where you live, and they are overly addicting. Wherever you look, you can find a computer. At home, in school, in your car, at work, and even in hotels. Being exposed to these computers can be helpful in some ways. Nowadays, almost everything we see is run by or has a computer involved. In the future, we are going to see even more computers. Businesses practically rely on computers; soon, they might even operate themselves. Also, with so many computers, it creates a variety of jobs. You can build computers, program them, fix them, and even supervise them while they are working. Even though everyone claims they are safe on the computer, they are not. While on a chatting website, you could meet someone, and they might be a child molester or a criminal. They can find out where you live and when no one is home or when you are home alone. With your address, they can even look at your house on a website or possibly obtain your house's blueprints. Then they can come and leave you mentally scarred for life. There are tons of things you can do on a computer. For example, you can play games. There are games with virtual worlds or games that are just for fun and have no real - world meaning. Either way, games on the computer are extremely addicting. You say you are going to play for @NUM1 minutes, but they are so captivating that you end up playing for @NUM2 hours. The games just suck you in, and you're trapped. Although computers are all around us, they do not have a positive effect on people because harmful people can find out where you live and they are too addicting. Computers are good and bad at the same time. People need to know when to stop using them, or it can drastically change your life in a negative way.
413	415	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I strongly believe we should have no more computers rather than constantly looking at the computer screen. I strongly think this because this could cause serious damage to the eyes, such as eye strain, blurred vision, and even long - term vision problems. My opinion on having computers is that I don't think we should have them because you don't get enough exercise. You would just sit there, motionless, looking at the computer all day. You would probably gain a lot of weight over the course of the year. You would be like a couch potato, lacking the physical activity needed for a healthy body. My next opinion is that we won't be able to get out of the house to see the beautiful nature. Like all the tall trees, colorful flowers, and the amazing wild - life animals. If you don't go outside, there will be no fresh air for you to breathe, which is essential for good health. My last opinion is that if we have computers, we won't be able to hang out with friends and family. You won't be able to see how much your family members have grown or how they've changed. Well, these are my opinions on having computers. In conclusion, the negative impacts of excessive computer use on our health, social life, and connection with nature are significant, and we should limit our reliance on computers.
414	416	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1, I am writing this letter to state my opinion on the effects computers have on people. I think that the effect is good because every place needs them. They store things neatly so that you will know that when you go back, it will be well - organized and saved. Every place uses computers; they are a big deal. Hotels use them to save who's in each room precisely and to activate the room keys smoothly. Restaurants use them to help make the bill accurately. Hospitals use them to store files so they can be printed neatly so the doctor can go to look at them and understand clearly. And schools use them; they need them to store grades neatly, or for a student to type up a paper neatly and hand it in. They could leave it for the day and go back to it tomorrow without any hassle. The computer can also be your job, like working on them, such as fixing them or installing a @ORGANIZATION1 program or app. You can also do your work on it, like working on a website or once again just writing a proper report. The biggest companies in @MONTH1 need a computer; even the @ORGANIZATION1 needs them. They are essential in your company. So, even if people don't get outside enough, the computer helps you to make money or be successful in life. And once you've got that money, you will go outside and spend it. So computers have a big effect on schools, the community, stores, and many other places and people's lives. In conclusion, the positive contributions of computers in various aspects of life, from business operations to personal work, clearly show that they have a beneficial impact on people.
415	417	1	3	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, In my opinion, computers are truly fantastic! Therefore, I firmly believe computers have a great effect on people's lives. Three reasons to support my decision are that many jobs use computers, instead of using a dictionary or thesaurus, you can just search it, and it is a big help at home/around the house. My first reason is that many jobs in the state, or nation, rely on a computer. Statistically speaking, @NUM1 out of @NUM2 jobs in the state use a computer or technology related to computer hardware. If you really think about it, if you were a teacher, trying to prepare engaging lessons, or a factory employee, operating complex machinery, you practically wouldn't even be able to do your job without it. We have learned a great deal from the new inventions that have emerged in the past decade or two. If we have learned anything in the past @NUM3 years, it would be to ""value the time you spend on the computer, but go on because you will learn some things you never knew before."" My second reason is that we have a lot more useful search engines than @NUM3 years ago. In/around the @NUM5's, if you wanted to find information, the only option was books. Yes, I mean reading is great, but now having the computer is faster and easier. All you do is go to @ORGANIZATION2 and type in what you want to find. Then it comes up in about @NUM6 seconds with around @NUM7 links to websites to help you out. Just think, now there's no need to flip through a table of contents, just a link and a click! My third reason is that it is a big help around the house/at home. In the state of @LOCATION1, about @PERCENT1 of people have a laptop or a computer in their home. But, this isn't a bad thing, because it can assist with so many things. Including helping with the children's homework, finding new recipes for cooking, and with organizing your daily schedule. Let's say you don't know what time ""@CAPS3's"" friends birthday party starts, no worries, just ask his mom on @CAPS4! Or you need a recipe for dinner, find it on cooks.com. This makes life a lot easier and has an extraordinary effect on your life! In conclusion, having a computer in your life is great because so many jobs use computers, there are so many useful searching tools, and it is helpful at home. So, computers have an awesome effect on people's lives!"
416	418	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS1, I'm @PERSON1 from @LOCATION3, @LOCATION2. I believe it would be valuable for your understanding of the effects of @ORGANIZATION1 computer usage throughout @LOCATION1 if you heard from a young teen. This is beneficial because at @CAPS1 age, people are highly dependent on computers. They can be entertained by a wide variety of online games, communicate easily with friends and family, and stay updated on news about what's happening around the world. Although some individuals may not always benefit from having a computer, most of the time, people are satisfied and do gain advantages from using computers. First off, people are positively affected by computers as they can find entertainment, whether it's through playing engaging online games or participating in exciting fantasy sports leagues. Although I've just mentioned two non - educational examples, there are numerous educational websites on the internet where children can learn effectively. In @CAPS1 personal life, I can cite many examples of entertainment. I use platforms such as @CAPS2, which is a well - known online game website, or get involved in fantasy football teams. Another example of entertainment is when @CAPS1 younger brother, Parker, spends hours on various websites. Even though he's sitting in front of a computer screen, he's learning. Also, experts say that children around the world learn more from the computer than from a textbook or hearing information from a teacher. They claim this because a computer screen can easily catch people's attention. Learning is a major priority, and if putting a child in front of a computer for an hour can improve it, then it's worth doing. @CAPS1 next reason why the effect of computers on people is positive is that it helps people communicate with friends or family. @CAPS1 brother is attending college at @ORGANIZATION1, and since we don't see him often, our family uses a program called @ORGANIZATION4 to video - chat. Thanks to this program, we're able to stay in close touch. An online poll on @DATE1 asked how people regularly talk to friends or family. Sixty - three percent of the votes showed that people communicate over the computer most of the time. Thirty - two percent said over the phone, and about sixteen percent said in person. This clearly shows how much people rely on the computer for communication using platforms like Facebook, @CAPS3, @CAPS4, and more. I'd say the computer has a good impact on people when used in this way. Lastly, computers assist people in receiving news about what's happening around the world. At @CAPS1 house, every time I open the internet, there's breaking news about the war in @LOCATION6, the devastation on @LOCATION5, and more. A few months ago, a class at @ORGANIZATION3 made a pie - chart and found out how their classmates get world news. Fifty - six percent said they got their news from computers. It's not just @ORGANIZATION3 students; most people get news from the internet. Just the other night at dinner, our waiter from @LOCATION4 said he received all his news about his hometown from the internet. As you can see, many people use the internet on their computers to get news and information. It's evident that the effect computers have on people is positive because of the reasons stated above: people can be entertained, communicate with family and friends, and receive news about what's happening around the world. As I said in the first paragraph, not all the effects are positive, but most of them are!
417	419	1	3	The local newspaper wants to know my opinion on the effects computers have on people. Computers indeed have an impact on people. People can meet new individuals from diverse backgrounds, learn about new and interesting places, and communicate with friends conveniently. Read on so you can understand how computers affect people's lives. My first reason is that people can meet new people. You can connect with new people from all corners of the world. You can keep in touch with them through @CAPS1 platforms or via e - mail. It's a quicker and novel way to expand your social circle. My second reason is that you can learn about new places. With just a simple click on a webpage, you can explore new places. Computers offer a faster means of learning. They provide all the information you need to know about the new places you're interested in. My third reason is that we can talk to friends. Computers host many different social websites where you can engage in conversations with people. You don't have to wait until the next school day; you can talk to them through the computer at any time. With all these new and quicker communication options, you can talk to friends whenever you desire. Finally, you now understand how computers affect people. We can meet new people, learn about new places, and talk to friends. Computers are capable of facilitating all these activities. I hope you enjoyed reading about how they affect people.
418	420	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 people, you've been told that using a @CAPS1 can offer no knowledge, but I firmly believe it provides hand - eye coordination. A @CAPS1 is the most helpful thing in the world. For my first reason, computers are filled with so many technological features that assist people on a daily basis. I want to discuss interacting with family and friends. You can log on to popular platforms like Facebook, MySpace, and even Twitter to chat with your friends. It's the most common activity on the @CAPS1. Approximately @PERCENT1 of teens and adults use MySpace and Facebook. Younger kids, about @PERCENT2, use @CAPS2 to interact with some friends. This technology is truly the best thing you could ever utilize. The second reason is that people need to learn how to use a @CAPS1 and develop hand - eye coordination. For learning, you can learn how to type accurately, write engaging stories using @ORGANIZATION1 Word, and even understand what to use on the internet. Regarding hand - eye coordination, you can familiarize yourself with all the keys on the keyboard and their functions to enhance your skills. My third reason is about searching on Google or the @LOCATION1. Google is the most commonly used search engine. You can look up pictures for projects, labs, or basically anything. And for the dictionary, you can quickly find out what words mean, and it's very useful for learning and doing homework. In conclusion, all these reasons are valid, and computers are the greatest sources on the planet. Everyone, do you want education or not? Computers help everyone, and you've got to love them!
419	421	1	3	"More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. I, for one, have reservations. I think that spending a reasonable amount of time on the computer can be beneficial. However, I do believe that computers have become a huge part of people's lives. I think that if people got off the computer and exercised more, they'd be much healthier. Instead of spending hours on the computer looking at pictures of places, nature, and people, if they traveled and experienced nature in person, they'd have a far more fulfilling experience. Everything would be so much more enjoyable if they were actually there to live it, rather than just seeing a picture. Another reason why I feel so strongly about people spending less time on computers is that when they're on the computer too much, they don't spend enough time interacting with family and friends. It seems as if they're too ""busy"" to see them, and they gradually drift away. So, as you can see, I highly disagree with the overuse of computers. In a world where computers are so prevalent, it's important to find a balance and not let them consume our lives."
420	422	1	3	Dear, whoever this concerns, some people are overly obsessed with computers. They often stay up all night playing games or browsing @CAPS1. These computer - lovers rarely interact with others and prefer to be left alone without anyone disturbing them. Some people who go online to research may be deceived; perhaps someone is just having fun at their expense. If you're so in love with computers that you stay up all night and get no sleep, you'll miss work, feel tired, and then you know you have a problem. You need to stop. You don't want to stay up all night because you might have something important to do, like your child's party, and miss it. Maybe your husband or wife tried to wake you up, but you were too engrossed in the computer and missed the event. Your child might never trust you again. When you stop interacting with other people, you've really got a problem. You seem to only want to go out to get junk food and soda. Spending all the time on computers is bad for you. Sometimes, you get cranky when someone takes it away. That's when you need to realize what you're doing and go get some exercise. You need it, or you'll end up unhealthy, which is bad for you. You should break this habit and develop a new one. When you're writing a report, you tend to turn to the internet. It can be a good source, but it might also be lying. You could end up turning in the worst report ever. You might have copy - pasted, but it may not be a reliable source. You should use a good book instead. The internet can be a bad influence as it can consume you. You shouldn't use it all the time. Maybe the people who make computers should shut down all the computers worldwide for one week so that we can experience life without the internet and understand its proper place in our lives.
421	423	1	3	Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, in our community, many @CAPS2 people are actively using computers for positive purposes. For instance, computers offer a great way to enhance hand - eye coordination. When you play certain computer games or use specific software, it requires you to precisely control the mouse or keyboard with your hands while your eyes focus on the screen. This gives you hand and eye coordination, which in turn provides people with the ability to perform more complex tasks. It's like when you work in a restaurant. My mom, a waitress, has to handle heavy trays, carry them around tables, and serve customers. She always tells me how much hand - eye coordination is needed in her job. Moreover, when driving, good hand - eye coordination from using computers can help you react quickly to unexpected situations on the road. Some people argue that computers can damage your eyesight, and you might eventually need glasses. But that's a personal consequence, and overall, it's just one reason that shows computers still have a positive effect on people today.  Secondly, computers are a powerful tool for people to search far - away places. By browsing travel websites or virtual tours, you can get a vivid idea of what a place is like. This might even inspire you to plan a trip there. For students, it's extremely useful as they often have projects that require research on other countries. Computers make kids smarter by providing them with vast amounts of information. However, some worry that kids could access inappropriate websites or that they won't get enough exercise if they only sit in front of the computer for research. But about @PERCENT1 of kids are able to use the computer and then go out for exercise.  Lastly, computers enable kids and adults to communicate with their friends or family more quickly. If a family member lives far away, instead of sending a letter through the mail, you can send a message on the computer in just @NUM1 minute. It's not only quicker but also more convenient. Kids can also talk to their friends faster. Approximately @PERCENT2 of kids use computers to chat with their friends. Although some are concerned that kids might be talking to strangers, you can set up a security question for all your friends to ensure it's really them.  In conclusion, I firmly believe that computers are a positive impact on young adults, children, and parents. They give you more hand and eye coordination, provide the ability to search other countries, and allow you to talk to friends easily. While others disagree because of potential eye - damage, lack of exercise, and safety issues for children, these problems can be easily solved by limiting kids' computer time, monitoring who they talk to, and encouraging them to participate in sports. This is why I think computers are a positive impact.
422	424	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, I firmly believe that computers have a very positive effect on people. Three key reasons are that they can educate individuals, they make things easy, and they are enjoyable. Below, I will explain each reason in detail.  Firstly, computers are highly educational. They are like a vast and limitless resource of information. Many teachers, especially during the month of @MONTH1, direct their students online for learning purposes. A large number of people also go online to research information for their schoolwork, jobs, or projects. There are great websites, such as @ORGANIZATION1, which are jam - packed with useful information and can only be accessed using a computer. For example, imagine having to conduct research using only books when you live far away from a library. The internet makes that research a breeze as you have access to it at any time!  Secondly, computers make tasks very easy to accomplish. They provide people with numerous convenient ways to carry out various tasks. If there were no computers in the world, interacting with people around the globe would surely be a challenge. Almost all of the businesses and organizations in the @LOCATION2, like @PERSON1's store, @ORGANIZATION2, or @PERSON2's establishment, have an online website to assist shoppers. They even allow customers to buy things online, which is far more convenient than driving to the store. I recall a time when I wanted to buy something from a store all the way in @LOCATION1. I simply went online at home and purchased the item there! Moreover, using a computer makes things like ordering food, getting plane tickets, and seeking help much easier and saves a significant amount of time.  Thirdly, computers are extremely enjoyable. They offer a plethora of fun things to do. For example, if you're bored, you can turn on the computer and search for a game you like. There's always a game that suits your taste. In addition to that, you can enjoy yourself by chatting with your friends and family. You can stay in touch with them while having a great time in their virtual company. Another great aspect is that people can send things to one another lightning - fast because of email. Imagine if you don't have a phone and you need to tell your husband, who's away on a business trip, that your son is very sick. If you send the message by mail, it would take at least @NUM1 days. But with email, it only takes a couple of minutes. So, you can see that computers also provide a sense of safety for everyone!  So, as you can see, computers have a very positive effect on people. The ways they do this are that they are educational and help individuals learn. They make tasks like ordering food, getting tickets, or contacting help very easy. They are also very enjoyable, whether it's playing fun games or staying in touch with your friends and family. Don't you think that without computers, we'd probably face a lot of difficulties? I am convinced that computers have a great effect on people.
423	425	1	3	To whom this @MONTH1 concerns, computers are a remarkable source of technology, yet many people spend an excessive amount of time on them. People often miss out on the outside world because they are “too busy” on their computers, using them to find things or play games that they could easily do outside in the fresh air.  First of all, people don't appreciate nature as much as they do their computers. When you're stuck inside school or work, you rarely get to go outside and witness the natural beauty around you. So, when you have some free time, it's a good idea to take @NUM1 minutes or so to go and enjoy the wilderness. You don't have to go out every day, but occasionally, it feels great to step out and explore the world. Especially when you've had a long - day and want some alone time, nature can be a perfect place to relieve stress. Some might say that you can enjoy nature and explore new places online. However, wouldn't you prefer to have a first - hand experience? You can't truly get the real feeling by just looking at pictures. You have to be there in person and explore it on your own. In nature, there's always something new to discover.  Secondly, when you're glued to your computer, you're not doing any good for your body. You need to go out and exercise. Fresh air is beneficial for your health. Spending most of your time on the computer means you're not spending quality time with your family and friends. Family is the most important thing in your life, and as you grow older, the time you have with your family becomes less and less. You might see your friends at school or work every day, but you don't really get to have a proper catch - up. Although there are online programs where you can chat with friends and family, wouldn't you rather see them in person, especially if you don't meet them every week? It's a much better experience, and you'll create many more precious moments. Just going for a walk or a run together can give you quality time with your loved ones.  In conclusion, people are spending too much time on their computers. They miss out on experiencing the outside world and the wonders of nature. The more time they spend on their computers, the less exercise they get and the less fresh air they breathe. Family and friends are some of the greatest treasures in life, but people don't get to bond with them properly. Computers are useful for tasks like creating spreadsheets and typing essays, but they aren't meant for you to spend all your time on. By spending excessive time on computers, you're missing out on the adventures that life has to offer. We should find a balance and make sure to enjoy the real world as well.
424	426	1	3	Dear, @CAPS1 of the @ORGANIZATION1, it has come to my attention that many people are debating whether computers benefit our society or not. Some people think computers are the core of many people's lives, but I have to disagree with that view. I firmly believe that computers benefit our society in three significant ways: they bring people together, they offer many websites to conduct research on a certain topic, and they allow people to shop at home.  One way that computers help us is by bringing people together through the internet. Many families have relatives living far away, making it difficult to keep in touch. However, with the internet, people can use social networking sites such as Facebook or MySpace to communicate with one another. Distant relatives can share pictures and have conversations to stay connected. Moreover, the internet can also play a role in bringing couples together and potentially leading to marriages. How many times have you seen those @CAPS3 harmony commercials that claim to have united two singles and created a happy couple?  Another way that computers contribute to today's society is by providing numerous places to conduct research on a particular topic. There are countless search engines on the internet that can lead you to a vast number of websites, helping you find the information you need. Researching on the computer is much easier compared to going to the library and reading books. When using books, you need to find the right one, read most of it, and then search for the specific information. But with the internet, you just type in your query, click a button, and you're good to go.  Lastly, computers enable you to shop online, leading to a better shopping experience. By shopping online, you can avoid the long lines at retail stores, which means you spend less time walking around to get your product. For example, many people rush to stores early in the @TIME1 for huge sales on “@CAPS4 @DATE1.” A person could end up waiting in line for hours to purchase a product. Why waste so much time when you can simply buy the product from the comfort of your own home and have it delivered right to your doorstep? Additionally, many websites offer special deals for online shoppers, allowing you to save money.  In conclusion, I am certain that computers benefit our society in three important ways. They bring people together, offer great research resources, and provide a better shopping experience. A world without computers would be drastically different from the one we live in today. Computers have become an integral part of our lives, and their positive impact is undeniable.
425	427	1	3	To: The @ORGANIZATION1, computers can be a significant part of people's lives. However, some fail to recognize the negative effects these technological devices have.  First, staring at a computer screen for long periods is unhealthy for your body. For example, if you spend hours playing games on the computer, it can severely strain your eyes. This often leads to feelings of tiredness and drowsiness after using the computer. Statistics show that @PERCENT1 of @CAPS1 own computers. Could this be a contributing factor to the high obesity rate in @LOCATION1? Computers might be preventing people from going outside and exercising, which is essential for maintaining a healthy lifestyle and weight. Clearly, computers are unfit for our bodies in many ways.  Secondly, the information on the internet can be inaccurate. Anyone with access to a computer can post information on a blog, website, or communication site such as Twitter, Facebook, or MySpace. Not everyone who posts articles is an expert on the topic, so the information could easily be false. More and more @CAPS1 rely on computers to obtain the information they need, which could ultimately harm them in the long run. Books, on the other hand, are much more reliable. They have to go through a rigorous editing process and are written by people who are well - versed in the subject matter. Therefore, computers are undoubtedly hurting our nation due to the spread of false facts.  Lastly, we rely on computers too much, which has a negative impact. For instance, let's say you're writing a paper on the computer that's due tomorrow. You save it and then close the computer to go have dinner. When you come back, you find that your paper has disappeared. You search through all your folders, but it's nowhere to be found. Computers often have technical glitches, and you don't always have the time to go to the tech - help store to fix them. However, if you had written the paper by hand, it wouldn't have vanished. Since many people depend on computers too much, it can backfire and cause significant problems. My sixth - grade teacher once told me that when she was in college, she had a big French paper due. She worked hard all night to finish it, but when she went to print it, it had disappeared. She had to rewrite the whole thing.  In conclusion, computers are having a negative impact on our society. They are unhealthy for our bodies, the information on them can be inaccurate, and our over - reliance on them can lead to problems. I strongly advocate that we should reduce our dependence on computers and find a more balanced way to use technology in our lives.
426	428	1	3	"Dear local Newspaper, People spending time on the Internet is a good way for people to connect with one another. But it can also be a way for people to get in trouble with things online, like looking at inappropriate content, talking or typing to strangers they shouldn't be interacting with, or even encountering predators that could be online. A significant percentage of kids and adults go on the computer either when they are getting out of school for the day, or if they are getting off work for the day or for the night. They are just there on the computer to check upon things, and for the kids, it's either for their entertainment, like chatting with friends on some kind of program, or they are even playing a game online. Three - fourths of kids under age 12 go online more than adults age 30 because of their interest in what is on it. People sometimes say, ""oh, I only go on the computer to check up on things. It only takes me a few minutes"", But they are lying. Most people don't just go on for a couple of minutes; they're on for more like a few hours, and that affects their relationship or connection to their family and or friends. John at the local community center says, ""people spend hours on the computer looking at whatever they want and most people do that and it has to stop for the sake of the person's family and friends,"" John also said, ""It's like an addiction"". Do you really want to have an addiction? I didn't think so, so instead of just sitting there staring into a screen for hours a day, go outside and have fun with your friends or family, go to the park, the beach, even just take a walk in the park. Nothing can beat the feeling of being with friends or family and just having fun."
427	429	1	3	@ORGANIZATION1, Computers are great tools and a remarkable piece of modern technology. Almost every family has them. About 80% of my class has computers. So many people have them because they are helpful and an excellent current learning resource. Also, it's a great way to keep in touch with friends. Although they can be time - consuming, they make up for it in the long run. First, they are helpful because it's quick and easy to get from page to page. It's especially helpful for work because instead of calling a bunch of clients, you can send them all emails in under a few minutes. They also help with schoolwork or planning a vacation. You can find great low prices on travel agencies on the computer. This is great because our country is having a bad recession and we need to be saving every penny. These are some of the few reasons why this modern technology is so helpful. Next is that it's a great current learning resource. You can find articles on anything happening right at that moment or a couple of days before. Sometimes the articles in books are old and those outdated articles don't have accurate, more - researched information. But, computers do, so you can compare your information. Also, there are online schools that are affordable. So if you want to get more of an education but you have to work too, this helps a great deal. A computer can be used for many things like learning. Computers are definitely the best way to keep in touch with friends and family that you aren't able to see very often. I know what you're probably thinking, is that well isn't that what phones are for. No because what if that family member or friend doesn't have a phone. Well then they can use their computer to stay in touch. They can use email, Facebook, AIM, and so many more. A computer helps me stay in touch with people I haven't seen in awhile. Okay, now that I've stated all my reasons why computers are a great resource, I just want to remind you that they are helpful, a great learning resource, and a great way to stay in touch. Computers are now an important piece of society. Computers are a whole new track and it should stay that way.
428	430	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, Computers and other technology are the best thing that ever happened to the world! I hear that computers affect people, well I don't agree with that statement. Here are my three reasons why. Computers and other technology make life way easier. You can talk to family and friends without spending money. If you control the amount of time you use on a computer then you will be fine. Please keep reading to hear my great ideas. To start off, computers and other technology make life easier. Think about it, we have access to our bank accounts, stores, research, school, etc. See, instead of having to go out shopping for food, you could just order it online with no trouble. We can now shop for clothes and other household items. It's so easy just to look at a list and pick what you want instead of waiting in a long line. For example, I went to the supermarket to pick up a few items for a party. There was a long line, so I just got online, picked what I wanted and had it shipped to me in less than 2 hours! It's cool to not have to even get up to get what you want. I know you sometimes have that feeling since you don't wanna get up, but you have to go shopping. Don't computers make life so easy? Secondly, you can talk to family and friends without having to spend money. This is awesome because you can text, video chat, email for free. Computers have so many websites to talk to your family and friends like, Facebook, Skype, MySpace, Yahoo, and even OhVoo. Mostly, all those allow you to video chat and voice chat for free. All of those sites you can text for free and reach out to those far away. For example, one day I didn't want to spend my money to talk to my friend. So I just video - chatted with them. And it was 3 times better, free, and more enjoyable. Even for people at long - distance, calling them is way too much money. So why not just video chat? I know you wouldn't wanna spend hundreds of dollars on a phone call bill! Please keep reading. Thirdly, if you count the amount of time you use on the computer or other technology devices then you will be fine. If you limit and set a time on the use of your computer, everything will be wonderful. You can tell your body to get off the PC and get a workout or talk to friends. There's no way you could be addicted to something if you have a limit for it. If you're the type of person that is prone to getting addicted to something, then maybe you shouldn't get a computer. Like my mom gives me a limited time for the computer. On a school night, my laptop has to be off at 9:00 pm. On the weekends, at 10:00 pm my laptop has to be off. There are always ways to not be addicted. You just have to know when enough is enough. It's not the computer's fault. You just have to control yourself. To wrap this up I would just like to say thank you for having the time to read my letter. My reasons are, computers make life easier, talk to family and friends for free, and if you control the amount of time you use on a computer than you will be fine. Thanks again.
429	431	1	3	"Dear officials at the @ORGANIZATION1, have you ever been so bored that you spent the whole day on the computer talking to friends and relatives? Some experts are saying that computers are having a negative effect on people in our society. While others argue that they are very helpful. The use of computers has been taken to an extreme level, and is having a negative effect on the community. Some reasons I feel this way are because of the social limit computers are putting on people and the amount of time people spend on them. My last reason is that computers are affecting the general health of people today. People should be educated on the negative effects computers bring! Firstly, computers are greatly changing the way people communicate. Instead of talking to people face - to - face, teenagers and adults find themselves ""texting"" or ""chatting"" with their friends and colleagues. This is causing many bad - habit forming. People are finding it harder to talk to others physically, and might even be using terms like ""LOL"" and ""BRB"" instead of proper words. This problem is causing a huge gap in the social - workings of humans, and is harming them more than they know! Secondly, the amount of time wasted on the computer is unbelievable! If someone logged onto the computer to search a fact or ""look up"" something, they might get caught up in other programs and spend hours on the computer. This time could have been used for more productive things instead. A recent poll shows that the average person from ages 15 - 30 spends over two hours on the computer each day! This fact is quite amazing, because these people could have been getting more things accomplished in this time. The amount of time wasted on computers is a huge problem that needs to change! Lastly, humans' health is being affected drastically by the use of computers. As the obesity rate is rising, these people are just sitting on their computers watching it go up. During this time, they could be exercising, going to the gym, or even taking a walk with friends. Teenagers could be playing outdoors, but find themselves too busy on their computers to enjoy the fresh air. Whenever I talk to my friends, they usually say they are on Facebook or OhVoo instead of outside or playing with their siblings. The obesity rate will keep rising if these people don't realize that staying on computers all day long is a part of the problem! In conclusion, the use of computers has gotten to a point where it is hurting society, rather than helping it. I feel this way because of the social - flow it is teaching people, and the amount of time wasted on computers. Another major reason is because of the extreme health issues computers are causing. If the average person tried to limit the time they use their computers, they would notice a positive change in their life - style."
430	432	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Experts say, ""60% of teenagers spend 4 hours or more on the computer daily"". The recommended time limit is 1 hour. By spending more time on computers, people aren't exercising. Secondly, those people aren't enjoying life and nature. Lastly, the use of computers puts a strain on social skills between friends and family. Surely the effects of computers can't be good. First off, people in this community aren't exercising as much as they should. Obesity and diabetes affect 30% of adults. Both of these diseases are lethal. If you spend so many hours on the computer, these diseases wouldn't spread nearly as fast. When will you get off the computer for an hour and go outside or to the gym and exercise so these won't affect you? Secondly, nature is a marvelous thing. Sure, camping in a tent and catching dinner isn't for everyone. But, there are many ways to experience nature without ""roughing it."" You can go to the zoo or to the aquarium. Sit by your backyard pond and go bird - watching. All of these are great alternatives to sitting at the computer screen, looking at pictures of nature. Lastly, people aren't spending enough time with family and friends. Yes, you can email, I.M., Facebook, and Skype family and friends, but it's not the same. People are less warm and friendly than they used to be, mainly because of a lack of social skills. We need to improve the level of social interaction without the computer. In conclusion, computers do have a negative affect on people in the long term. People aren't exercising. They aren't enjoying nature. Finally, their bonds between friends and family are weakening. This is a growing problem which must be put to an end. Thank you for your time."
431	433	1	3	"The amount of computer usage has been significantly growing over the years. Adults and children are spending huge amounts of their precious time on computers. Though these devices, especially in @MONTH1, seem entertaining and helpful. Well, that is not all true. Computers are being used for more than just work. It seems to be the people's new way of communication. Communicating with others has always been a great and essential part of our lives. There is not a single person in the world who has not had some form of communication with others. Though computers seem to abuse the privilege of communication. For talking on an online chat site is easier and more convenient for people. The people in those chats are not always who they claim to be. This poses a huge danger on those sites, especially as children of all ages now are using them. These children do not always know who they are talking to, but since it's online, they say anything that comes into their mind. The way @CAPS2 talk to people in person is not the same online. When communicating with people on the computer, the writer tends to shorthand things. Such as the word ""you"" would be spelled ""u"". These quick changes happen without thinking, and become a natural habit. These changes quickly become a part of our communication and writing. So instead of seeing the sentence ""@CAPS1 did you think about her project"", @CAPS2 will see ""wat did u tink bout her pro."" As a result of this, many children's grades could be affected. For their spelling will soon deteriorate and the vocabulary will be all in slang. This vocabulary change could be prevented if computers were not used as much. Today, @CAPS2 are seeing less people going outside. No one ever needs to go anywhere if all their communication can be done at home. This isn't just hurting ourselves but also the environment. The less time people spend outside, the more energy is being wasted. The times @CAPS2 do go outside is for simple tasks such as taking out the trash. This is hurting our environment! There are not as many people taking care of our planet. People are not taking the time to make a garden, plant some trees or simply pick up some trash on the side of the road. If @CAPS2 would all just take the time, maybe only ten minutes a day to help our environment, it would be helping our bodies and also helping our planet. This would reduce the amount of people using computers and change the way @CAPS2 see our civilization today. So please help yourselves and the earth, stop talking on the computers and get out and do something productive. The computer will always be there, but @CAPS2 only have one of us and one of our planet. @CAPS2 don't want to destroy these over a simple piece of technology. We must take action now to strike a better balance between our digital and real - world lives."
432	434	1	3	I think we need our computers. If we don't have computers, we won't be able to connect to our family that could live in another state or country. I know how there is texting now, but some people don't even have phones or any means of mobile communication. How can you connect to them? You can't call as it might not be free with the phone plan you have. If a family member comes and visits you, they would probably email you about it, but if there are no computers, they can't tell you when they're coming. Are they going to show up unexpectedly? You might not even be home, and if they show up without you knowing, they're out of luck. And we can exercise on our computers during our overtime. We can pick what time and we do it, and if we play a sport - related game on the computer, we're still somewhat enjoying nature in a virtual sense. Some people might have jobs that take place outside, but there are also those who rely on computers for work. There are nerds that are on computers all day long, but I'm sure they enjoy nature in their own way. I don't know about exercising, but they have a car and they drive around and do things. Also, about the exercising, everyone has to exercise to stay in shape. I'm pretty sure people don't want to be fat their whole life; they want to look good and feel good about themselves. If it is a holiday or something and people want to send their wishes to someone, they're not going to be able to see them in person if they live so far away, unless they plan to meet each other. But even if they do that, they're going to want to email them rather than call where it costs money, and texting only comes with certain plans of phones. So all that's left is emailing. Sometimes, people will complain that you're always on the computer. If you're not, don't worry; at least you get to email your family that you don't ever see. These reasons are my opinion that we shouldn't get rid of computers and other related devices. We should embrace the technology that keeps us connected and enhances our lives.
433	435	1	3	Most adults believe that computers are just a waste of time and are sometimes can be addicting or bad for health. Well, it's true it can be bad, but it matters how you use it. There is one thing about the computer that is truly amazing. That is socializing with friends, family or even strangers. You know when your parents say never talk to strangers well, you can do this safely and harmlessly over the computer, and you also learn a lot about life or other people's lives outside your small little town. There is another great perk with computers and that is keeping in touch with family or friends that live far away. My sister went to @LOCATION1 for six months, but the thing was it felt like two weeks because I was able to communicate and see pictures of her @CAPS1 @CAPS2. The last but probably the most important part is getting a hold of people you actually really need to talk to, such as friends, teachers or even people you never talk to in school. With these three advanced ways to socialize, it will always feel like you're never alone, which is an awesome thing. There are many other things the computer is used for other than social life, and that is actually important use, stuff you need to know or want to find out. Here is one example, everyone has forgotten their work at school or your office at least once in your life. Well, with being able to just grab all the papers off - line is easy. Just go to your teachers' home page and just print your homework. It's that easy, just one click and that saved you a twenty - minute ride to school. How about when you're up at night wondering what the weather is going to be like, many sunny, cold or even a glorious snow day. Well, instead of waiting to find out, you can just go on weather.com and see everything, maps, forecast or what is going to happen hour by hour. Just like weather, people always want to know breaking news. Why watch a two - hour show when you can just get to the point of what's happening in this world we live in. I mean the parents have to open their eyes and see this as a beautiful thing. We should be proud of the fact that humans have created something so complex and interesting. There is one more topic that I know you're going to absolutely love. I mean right now you're grading this in your office, well, you can be grading this at home on your comfortable couch, with a fire crackling and all the peace and quiet in the world. People work from home all the time. You can run a business from your very own living room. My father owns a company and works from home most days. It's absolutely great as he is able to take me out, spend time with the family and most importantly doing the things he loves and guess what, you can do this too. Like I keep saying it's only a click away. Here is another topic, online banking. Do you really want to drive to the bank and sit down with that boring accountant and spend hours there? Well, now you don't have to waste your time, you can type in a couple of keys and boom, you're on your way to see your information. That was faster than two hours, I'm guessing. Yes, I believe that computers are a valuable use of time and will also help a lot in the future. So the next time you log on to your computer, do some of these things and trust me you will think exactly what I think. Computers are truly a remarkable invention that has transformed our lives in countless positive ways.
434	436	1	3	"Dear Readers of the Local Newspaper, More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. Those who support advance in technology believe that computers have a positive affect on people. They teach hand - eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. Others have different ideas. Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature and interacting with family and friends. I agree with those experts because many people take the computer seriously and always want to be on. Though the @CAPS3 users think there is nothing negative about using the computers, but there is. Such as an increased light bill payment, obesity and like the experts said, ""@CAPS1 time interacting with family and friends."" @CAPS2, @CAPS3 users of the computer cause an increased light bill because if the users are constantly on, then the computer must constantly be on. When the computer is constantly on, it causes the light bill to increase. I can connect to that because I used to be a @CAPS3 user of the computer and my guardian would yell at me because of it. Ever since I had brought down the habit of being a @CAPS3 user, my guardian has stated the light bill has decreased. Another reason why @CAPS3 users of the computer must decrease their habit is because of obesity. Obesity is when a man or woman is overweight. My imaginary friend is a @CAPS3 user in my imagination. He is like many others, he never exercises with his friends because he is constantly on the computer. Last but not least, @CAPS3 users begin to slack on interacting with friends and family. As I stated in paragraph two that I used to be a @CAPS3 user. I myself wouldn't accept invitations to go to movies with friends and I wouldn't help around the house. These were the main three things I wouldn't do. Then I learned to not abuse the computer, not waste my time on it, but I also learned to be responsible with it. That's what I think many @CAPS3 users should do too. In conclusion, being a constantly user is not healthy because it may cause obesity. Also, a @CAPS3 user increases the light bill and won't spend time interacting. We should all strive to use computers in a more balanced way to avoid these negative consequences."
435	437	1	3	@ORGANIZATION1, In my opinion, the effects of computers are not good. Many people spend too much time on their computers and less time exercising. People are on their computers so much that they don't enjoy nature anymore. Also, they aren't interacting with family and friends that much. I think that computers are becoming a serious issue. @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people in my school agree that they hardly exercise any more because they are always on their computers. For example, @NUM3 - year - old @CAPS1 used to go to the gym every day before she got her own computer. Now every afternoon she finds herself in front of the computer monitor. If it wasn't for computers, I'm sure kids would be outside getting exercise. Computers are a serious issue. Have you ever found yourself in front of the computer screen, on a beautiful day outside? I have, and while I was on the computer I could have been outside enjoying nature. I think it would be best if you unplugged those computers for a day and just went outside and got some fresh air! If everybody keeps this habit of staying on your computers all day and not going outside, we might turn into a world of couch potatoes! I'm sure you don't want that. Lastly, I remember multiple times I said I would do something with my dad but I didn't because I was on the computer. Many people can agree with me. Instead of going out to interact with your friends, many are just instant messaging them. The internet is amazing, but I think everyone forgot the joy of going out with friends and family. So get off those computers and call a friend. In conclusion, the effects of computers are bad. Many people are spending too much time on their computers and have less time exercising. They are on so much they don't enjoy nature anymore. Also, they aren't interacting with friends and family. I think after reading this you can see computers aren't all good. We need to find a better balance between our digital and real - world activities to lead healthier and more fulfilling lives.
436	438	1	3	What I am going to tell you could change the way you think about computers in general. People might say that computers are great to use; they're fast and you get what you need. But I think computers are not good. They become addicting and make your bills extremely high. Computers can lead to your child spending less time with you and your family. Also, computers can be very dangerous for teens and children of all ages. I say that computers are addicting, and this is a fact. @PERCENT1 of students spend most of their time on the computer. Why are computers so addicting? Well, they have instant messaging, and you can talk to people around the world. Now, I know it might not sound bad, but this can be bad for your pocket. @PERSON1, who works with electric bills, says that because children spend more time on the computer, the bills in houses have grown up almost @PERCENT2, and it's harder for people to pay their bills. Computers are, as they say nowadays, one of the main reasons children spend less time with their family. This is true in most families, like mine. Because of computers, me and my sisters spend more time on the computer than with each other. This can cause arguing and fighting between family members. Statistics show that @NUM1 people would rather spend more time on the computer talking to people or listening to music than spend time with their own children or parents. Is this what you want for you and your children to be separated by technology? Computers aren't always safe for teens and children of all ages. There are many reasons why computers can sometimes not be safe for your children or teens. I say this because sometimes we are worried about our kids' safety. When your child is on the computer, you have no idea who they are talking to or what they are talking about. Teens are most likely going to meet other people online, and there are stalkers, posers, and other people out there who are pretending to be someone they are not. Your child can be one of those people who fall for it, and it can lead to meeting someone they might not know, and they can be kidnapped, raped; anything can happen. Children can always get hurt by verbal abuse; they can be threatened by others and hurt, and that can cause emotional damage. So, be careful and monitor your child. These are just very few things that can happen. In conclusion, these are my reasons why computers aren't really benefiting our society. Computers bring more harm than good, and we should be more cautious about their use.
437	439	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I think that being on the computer too long is bad for people because you could get obsessed with the computer. You could get in trouble, and it could affect your education. One reason I think that being on the computer too long is bad for people is because you could get obsessed with it. For example, if you were playing outside on a nice sunny day and you called a friend and asked them to come over, and they said no, I can't; I'm @CAPS3 on the computer. You said, ""Why? Today's a nice day."" Then your friend said, ""@CAPS3 playing games."" That's an example of being obsessed with a computer. Another reason that being on the computer too long is bad for you is because you could get in trouble. Getting in trouble online is bad because you could get sued, or the owner of the website could delete it from your computer. Also, if your parents found out, you would be in even more trouble because then you would get grounded. That means you wouldn't be able to use the computer for a long time. My last reason that being on the computer too long is bad for you is because it could affect your education. If someone was on the computer too long instead of doing their homework, that could affect their grades a lot. If you are in @CAPS5 @CAPS6 and this happens, you wouldn't be allowed to graduate and go to college. That is not a good thing if you are trying to get into a good college. Even though the computer is important in @CAPS5 @CAPS6, you still shouldn't be on it too long. In conclusion, everything I have said about why being on the computer too long is bad for you proves that too much computer use is bad for people. We should limit our computer time to avoid these negative consequences."
438	440	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper: Computers have become a major part of people's lives. The effects computers have on people are only negative. Nothing good comes out of using a computer. This is because computers are time - consuming from other activities, computers are not always working, which leads to people getting angry, and using computers is bad for your health. I know you have a difficult decision to make, but after reading what I have to say, there will be no doubt that you will agree. Using computers is very time - consuming. People don't realize how long they have been using the computer. Once you start using it, you're hooked, and it's hard to stop. A poll was taken, and out of @NUM1 kids, @NUM2 of them said they felt groggy and had headaches after using a computer for two hours. The way computers make you feel is not enjoyable. But while you're using the computer, it's entertaining. For example, you're on @CAPS1 and you're talking to your friend, and you're laughing at them and enjoying yourself. But it's not the computer that's making you happy; it's the person. You might as well see them in person. Therefore, computers are time - consuming and should not be used. Computers are not reliable; they have minds of their own. Many people always rely on their computer, and when it doesn't work, it causes the person to get angry or frustrated. Computers have a vast impact on people, but they shouldn't have to. Dr. @PERSON2 at @ORGANIZATION1 says that @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2's frustration and anger is caused by non - working computers. If the use of computers was lowered, the anger that people have would lower, and it would lead to other positive things as well. Furthermore, computers are not reliable and cause people to get angry. My final reason is that computers cause health issues and cause people to be lazy. The obesity rate is higher than ever, and people sitting on the computer all day is not helping. @PERCENT2 of obesity is caused by the use of computers. @PERSON1 at @ORGANIZATION2 says that @NUM3 out of @NUM4 people who don't use computers are much healthier because instead of using computers, they exercise. Therefore, computers cause health issues. In conclusion, computers affect people because they are time - consuming, you can't rely on them, and it's bad for your health. Computers have negative effects on people, and we should reduce our dependence on them to lead healthier and happier lives.
439	441	1	3	"Dear @LOCATION1, @CAPS1 one day being able to talk to anyone in the world by simply pushing a button. This has become possible with the computer. I support the advances in technology because the computer can help hand - eye coordination, it is easy to learn about faraway places or people, and the computer enables you to talk online. This is why I support the computer. First, the computer benefits society because it develops hand - eye coordination. Did you know that nine out of ten people who use a computer have improved hand - eye coordination? Bill @CAPS2, the creator of @ORGANIZATION1, said, ""The keyboard is the most important part of the computer because it builds hand - eye coordination."" This reminds me of when I got my first computer and had no hand - eye coordination. Now, I can type with my eyes closed. I understand how you might think that computers cause people to not get enough exercise. However, the computer can improve your hand - eye coordination. This is why I support the computers. Next, I support the computer because you can learn about faraway places and people. Did you know that nineteen out of twenty students use a computer when they want to learn about a place or a person? @PERSON3 stated, ""The way students study is much different than it used to be. Now, students use computers."" This reminds me of when recently I had a report to do on @PERSON1, and all I needed was my computer. I see how you @MONTH1 think that enjoying nature is important, but intelligence is even more important. This is why the computer supports our society. Finally, I support the computer because you can talk to the world instantly. Did you know that ninety - nine out of a hundred students talk online on touchscreens? @PERSON2, the creator of @CAPS4, an instant messaging website, stated, ""There is no doubt that @CAPS4 is the easiest way to stay in touch."" This reminds me of when I went away on vacation and still stayed in touch with my friends through @CAPS4. I understand how exercise is essential to your body. However, talking with friends is important too. In conclusion, I support the computer because it supports hand - eye coordination, you can learn about faraway places and people, and you can communicate with people around the world. Now that you know why I support the computer, there should be no doubt that you will support it as well. The computer has brought so many positive changes to our lives, and we should embrace its continued development."
440	442	1	3	Dear newspaper, People are spending too much time on their computers. They are on the computers when they should be out exercising in the fresh air. People need to enjoy nature and spend quality time with family and friends. Let me explain more. Firstly, the people who are constantly @CAPS1 people, facebooking people, or on myspace aren't getting the physical activity they need. Now, more than ever, people are becoming very obese. It is extremely unhealthy. People in my family that are always on facebook are not getting exercise, and they are gradually becoming overweight. Eight out of ten @CAPS2 aren't getting enough exercise. We need to get people moving and exercising to improve their health. Secondly, People need to enjoy nature. Everyone is so caught up in their computers that they don't sit back, relax, and take in the beauty of nature. People don't realize that the earth is polluted. Once animals are extinct, they are not coming back. If they got off of their computers for a minute, they could see the animals in their natural habitats before they are gone. Computers are like a wall between the inside and going outside to explore the world. Finally, the computers are getting in the way of seeing family and friends. Everyone is so caught up in the newest computer gadgets that they don't see their friends or family. I know some people who, when it's time for dinner, they walk down to the kitchen, get their food, and bring it to their computer so they don't miss out on anything. Family and friends are very important. @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2 only see friends and family on holidays. Computers are getting in the way of everything! People aren't getting the exercise they need. They aren't going outside to enjoy the nature, and they aren't seeing their friends and family. We need to get people off their butts and away from the computer. Why does everyone have to sit in front of the computer anyway? In conclusion, the overuse of computers is causing a lot of problems in our lives. It's time we take a step back, limit our computer time, and focus on the things that truly matter, like our health, nature, and our relationships with loved ones.
441	443	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, I whole - heartedly support the notion that computers have a positive effect on people. This is because there are a plethora of things to do and learn on the computer. On the computer, you can look up a wide range of topics, like sports events, the fascinating animal world, and rich historical details. The reason I firmly stand by this view is that I have a great interest in looking up history about @CAPS2 and the remarkable @CAPS3 pioneers who have truly changed humanity.   Another reason why I say computers affect people positively is that they teach you how to type faster and how to navigate to certain places on the computer. For example, if your mom asks you if you know how to get to a specific website to buy new furniture, you can easily do so.   A third reason of how computers impact people is this: if one day you have to do a project on what happened during the @CAPS2 revolution and you've spent a good amount of time researching it on the computer, that project should be relatively easy.   Yet another reason is that computers teach better communication skills on platforms like Facebook and @CAPS5. In school, kids often tell each other to go on Facebook when they get home.   I also think computers affect people because if you have an idol, you can look them up. For instance, I'm a fan of football and basketball, and my idols are @PERSON1 Peterson and @PERSON2 Iverson. Every time I go on the computer, I look up both of my idols.   The last reason is that computers teach you how to read. There's always something to read on the computer, no matter what it is. In conclusion, computers clearly bring numerous positive impacts to people's lives in various aspects.
442	444	1	3	"Dear Newspaper, ""@CAPS1 a computer @CAPS15?"" @CAPS2 is a continuous subject, and many controversies and ideas have emerged. Senior scientist @PERSON2 says, ""I believe that computers can be used to help people connect with friends and long - distant relatives."" @PERSON2 is absolutely right. Computers bring people together, whether they are friends, families, or relatives from far - off countries. @CAPS2 also aids with everyday needs, such as schoolwork and household chores.   First off, people can perform a multitude of tasks on a computer. They can do their homework, find a nearby store, and check out traffic and weather conditions. You can play games, connect with friends, learn new recipes, and even find out the result of the football game. By creating a link all around the world, people can find out information about one another and learn about their cultures and lifestyles. @PERCENT1 of large corporations find the @CAPS3 and computers extremely useful. ""@CAPS4 using the @CAPS3, I can find a willing participant in charities,"" says @PERSON4, a charity fund - raiser in @LOCATION1.   Second, by using the @CAPS3, people can share their wares on various websites, including @CAPS6 and @CAPS7. People also create their own websites to showcase their products. @PERSON1, the co - owner of The @CAPS8 @CAPS9, a duct @CAPS8 wallet company that also raises money for @LOCATION2, has started to create a website and hopes to raise awareness of the terrible event that took place there. Many entrepreneurs like @PERSON1 use the @CAPS3 to expand their businesses. ""@CAPS12 stay in the past, when the door to the future @CAPS1 open?"" asks @PERSON3, the successful owner of @ORGANIZATION1.   By using computers, people can gather data from others and create new inventions to help the world. People can create detailed @NUM1 - @CAPS14 diagrams on a computer and send the data to a company, with the hope of creating @CAPS2. Computers aren't just mere playthings; they are serious pieces of equipment that can contribute significantly to the world. Although some people might find the downsides to computers, they will always be able to think of a good side. I hope that you will use this article to prove that computers aren't all @CAPS15. In summary, computers have far - reaching positive impacts in multiple fields."
443	445	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, In my opinion, I firmly think we should use computers. The reason is that when @CAPS2 we need help on something, we can easily find it on the computer. Also, sometimes that is the only way you can get in touch with someone. For example, sometimes people in @MONTH1 have to go on the computer to check instant mail.   First of all, I believe we should use computers because when @CAPS2 a student needs help on homework, they can go on Google and search for what they are doing. It will provide a lot of useful information. Also, they can go on a website called http.historywork.com, which will also assist them in their studies.   Another reason is that sometimes the computer is the only way to connect with others. When I say this, I mean that if @CAPS2 you have accounts on Gmail, Facebook, Yahoo, or MySpace, you can talk to your friends there. I do it all the time.   The last reason why I think we should use computers is that sometimes in @MONTH1, you might have an important message. For example, if @CAPS2 you @MONTH1 had an important message on a website, the website will notify you. I do it, so why can't you?   In conclusion, computers are very useful tools in our daily lives, helping us with learning, communication, and staying informed.
444	446	1	3	"Dear @LOCATION1 @CAPS1, I strongly believe that people should cut down on using the computer. Just imagine a scenario where more people are outside and healthy, there is less ""cyberspace"" bullying, and less electricity is being burned.   My first reason why people should spend less time on the computer and more outside is that @PERCENT1 of people who use the computer more than two hours a day are either at risk of being overweight or are already overweight. Also, @PERSON1, from @ORGANIZATION1, says, ""@CAPS2 people believe that using the computer gives you benefits, but in fact, they increase your chances of either being overweight or getting diseases such as diabetes. It's extremely important that the community takes action to stop this from happening.""   In addition, my neighbor, @PERSON2, had to conduct a study to interview overweight adults and teenagers. @CAPS3 told me that @PERCENT2 of the @NUM1 people @CAPS3 interviewed said they don't go outside and use the computer for about @NUM2 hours a day! I earnestly implore the citizens of the @LOCATION1 area to cut down on internet time and go outside to enjoy nature.   My second reason is that the less people on the computer means less cyberspace bullying. @NUM3 out of @NUM4 people who use socializing websites have experienced more than @NUM2 encounters of cyberbullying. My sister's friend, @PERSON3, overdosed on Advil and almost committed suicide because of cyberbullying. Someone had said @CAPS3 was ugly, smelled bad, and should ""go die in a hole."" @CAPS3 didn't tell anyone about this. Luckily, her mother brought her to @CITY1 @ORGANIZATION1 fast enough to be put on life support for @NUM6 hours. Furthermore, if people cut down on using internet socializing websites, fewer people will be in danger of cyberbullying affecting their lives. It's extremely crucial for people to use the computer for only @NUM7 or @NUM8 hours a day.   My final reason is that the less time you use your computer, the less money you would be wasting on electricity bills and the more time you can spend on family vacations. Dr. @DR1, from the Peabody Museum in @LOCATION2, begs people to use less electricity and power on the internet so the environment can slowly rebuild itself to be what it was before technology and electricity were invented. In addition, @PERCENT3 of power used in today's homes is used on computers. Also, my grandmother is shocked by what today's technology is doing to the environment and the people behind this excessive use of electricity. @CAPS3 believes that the less time on the computer means more time for family vacations and with friends.   In conclusion, it's essential that people take action to reduce their computer usage to improve their health, avoid cyberbullying, and save the environment."
445	447	1	3	"Dear newspaper, In my opinion, computers definitely have a negative effect on people. People who use computers often spend less time exercising. I mean, who would give up their chatrooms and games to get in shape? I remember when I was a little girl, about @NUM1 years old, and I was always eager to be on the computer. I soon got chubby and gained about @NUM2 lbs! I quickly realized that the computer is a tool to be used only when necessary because it shortens activity time.   A survey done by the @ORGANIZATION2 (@CAPS1) showed that @PERCENT1 of @CAPS4 between ages @NUM3 are overweight because of their computer use. Famous singer @PERSON2 says, ""I keep going through cycles of gaining and losing weight because of computers! I will gain weight and then run it off and ignore the computer for a week."" I know you might think that computers don't make you obese if you use them sparingly, but research has proven that more than @NUM4 mins a day can make you gain fat. Clearly, computers are to blame for our society's weight problem.   Have you ever really seen nature's beauty? People who use computers don't! I mean, people are so busy looking up things on the web that they can't truly appreciate the outside world. I remember when I watched the movie @CAPS2 last week, I thought to myself, ""@CAPS3, nature is amazing, why didn't I notice before?"" I already know the answer: computers. A survey conducted by @NUM5 grade @ORGANIZATION1, @PERSON1, showed that @NUM6 out of @NUM7 @CAPS4 have never noticed the blooming flowers or the smell of fresh rain. Famous physician @PERSON4 says, ""@CAPS4 that don't see nature for its true beauty often can't grow up normally. People were supposed to be close to nature, but over the years, technology has diminished that connection."" I know you @MONTH1 think that @CAPS4 see enough of nature even with computers, but more often than not, @CAPS4 don't pay attention to nature. They are too busy with computers. Obviously, nature is ignored by society because of computers.   Families grow more and more detached every time a child or even an adult uses a computer. I mean, every time you turn on the computer, you become attached to it and can't focus on the people around you. I remember when my sister @PERSON5 was in @NUM5 grade, she never took her eyes off the computer. She would play solitaire and instant - message her friends all the time and then completely disconnected from the family. A test done by @ORGANIZATION3 showed that teens will rebel @NUM9 times more than usual with the aid of a computer. Famous talk - show host @PERSON3 says, ""@CAPS4 shouldn't use computers; they will get detached from friends and family."" I know you might think that @CAPS4 don't get detached, but they do. Clearly, @CAPS4 separate from their friends and family because of computers.   In conclusion, any far - sighted person can tell that computers have a negative effect on people as they consume exercise time, make @CAPS4 forget about nature, and cause detachment among families. Therefore, I urge you to limit your computer use."
446	448	1	3	"Computers are very enhanced pieces of machinery. With this high - tech object comes knowledge of many different places and what is happening around the world. Through various news platforms and information websites on the computer, one can access a vast amount of global news instantly. Next, typing is a universal way of writing that is much faster than hand - written pieces. Typing on a keyboard allows for quick input and easy editing. Lastly, online gaming is a convenient and fun way to relieve stress by interacting with other users around the world. These are thousands of news snippets every day of the year that do not ultimately get covered because of limited air - time on news channels. To quickly and simply get your news from around the world you can visit a website and look at hundreds of stories at the click of a button. To add to that, you will get more in - depth news as there is no limit on room or space on the website. These websites will even be areas on the website to donate to those that need assistance. Patrick Johnson, founder of the Global Aid Foundation, stated, ""Online fundraising brings in billions of dollars in aid to people who otherwise would be in deep trouble, and the main source of all of this money is from internet websites."" Without the internet, millions of people would not even know about these people who desperately need help. Typing is a quick and fairly simple way to write, that saves people valuable time. Teachers often assign writing homework, which takes about twice as long to hand - write other than type. Using typing would save you this time and allow you to continue on with other important tasks that are needed to be completed. Furthermore, typing is a mandatory class for many freshmen and previous experience is very helpful to the teachers and students. ""I've had many students,"" says typing instructor Ms. Smith, ""and the ones that excel not only get an 'A', but also cut their homework time in half."" Stress is a common problem in all age groups, and a computer is the best way to relieve it. Interactive games with people around the world will broaden your spectrum to other cultures. You may use your typing skills to talk with others, and share your opinions with them. ""Online gaming may seem a shock,"" says Dr. Brown at Tech University, ""but people who use computers an hour a day are much more culturally advanced than the others."" To add to that, you can use video chat to talk to people in foreign areas. Friends, family, and exchange students are able to talk and see you through video chat. This greatly reduces parents' worry of their children living in a foreign country. Many people can benefit from the various functions of computers in their daily lives."
447	449	1	3	Computers are good because people can find what they need, whether it's information about a particular topic, a product they want to buy, or a service they require. They can also have fun as they can play games, watch movies, or listen to music. With computers, you can ask things, like getting answers to your questions through search engines. You can find places, be it local restaurants, tourist attractions in a different city, or the location of a friend's house. Moreover, you can get things for a good price by comparing prices across different online stores. In conclusion, computers offer a wide range of benefits in terms of fulfilling our needs, having entertainment, and getting good deals, making them an essential part of our modern lives.
448	450	1	3	Dear Readers, I believe that spending time on the computer has its pros and cons. For the good things, people are able to do research, talk to people such as friends and family, and also the computer can help you learn about anything you need to know about. Through various educational websites, online courses, and digital libraries, the computer provides a wealth of knowledge at your fingertips. I also think that there are some cons. People spend way too much time becoming distracted. They often get caught up in social media, online games, or other non - essential content. You ignore your family without even knowing it as you are engrossed in the computer screen. And if you are just staring at a computer screen for long hours, which can permanently damage your eyes. I'm going to start with the good things about how computers have effects on people. The computer is great if you have to do research. If you need information on anything you can search it. Like if you have to do research on a certain project or subject, the computer is the fastest way to get the information you need. You can access multiple sources in a short time and get in - depth knowledge. Another good thing is that you have the capability to talk to people such as friends and family. You can use video calls, instant messaging, or social media platforms to stay connected. To me that is very important and I'm sure for you it is too. That's what I believe a few of the good things are. Now, I'm going to talk about the bad things. I firmly believe that people are spending way too much time on the computer, without knowing how long has gone by! You just stare at the screen, which is not good for your eyes. It can permanently damage them, like causing vision problems or eye strain. One last thing I would like to mention, is that when you are on the computer, you tend to ignore your friends and family, which could be a big problem as it may affect your relationships. These were just a few examples about how the computer has an effect on people. In conclusion, while computers offer many advantages, we should also be aware of their drawbacks and use them in a balanced way.
449	451	1	3	"Dear Health Organization, I believe that people should be able to go on the computers and still be doing it. For a good reason such as communicating with far - away relatives. Another reason is, if you need a health - related work - out or healthy eating tips, you can just print them out. And my last reason is if you're going on a far - away trip but you don't know the way, you can just print out directions (Google Maps). Say if you have a relative that lives all the way in Australia but you can't call them because you live all the way in the United States. And if you call them, it'll cost you about $1 per minute. What you can do is you can contact them over the computer (webcam). And it's way better than just calling them because you can actually see them. You can share moments, expressions, and have a more immersive conversation. Or if you're on a business trip away from home, you can check upon your family. You can see how they are doing and have a real - time interaction. My second reason is, you can stay fit while being on the computer. You can look up health - related ""yoga"" poses. There are many online tutorials that demonstrate proper yoga postures. Or you can also do fitness lessons while watching them off of your computer. And if you're on a diet, you can look up health - related healthy recipes. You can also get health - related work - out equipment that'll make (or keep you), nice and slim. My last reason is that if you're going on a long journey away from home you need to know the way. But, what if you don't know the way? You can go on the internet and look up directions. And that is way better because at least you aren't wasting money on a GPS device. And it is more accurate and quicker. And the best part is that you don't have to keep looking at the GPS and program stuff. With the maps on the computer, you can print it out and actually keep it. Those are all my reasons to why people should really go on computers. There are many things that a computer can do which is really good. You can communicate with relatives, stay fit/healthy while on the computer and getting maps. I hope that this opens up many people's eyes. And maybe change a couple scientist's mind about the negative views of computer usage."
450	452	1	3	Should there be computers in our society? Yes, there should. Computers are good things and are good help. I can give you three good reasons why. Paying bills, using Facebook, and doing research. This is why computers are good. My first reason why computers are good is because people need to pay bills. It's easier to pay your bills online then to do all the paper work. You can log in to your accounts, enter the payment details, and complete the transaction in a few clicks. And it makes it faster for people and computers are really good for them. That's why we need computers. My second reason why we need computers is because people have Facebook. And that's a good way to talk to friends, and get new friends. You can share photos, videos, and updates about your life. It's fun to have Facebook and just interact with people. This is why computers are good in society. My third reason why we should have computers in our society is because of research. When you need to get information on a specific topic, the computer is a great help. It has all the data, articles, and references you might need. For example, if you're researching a historical event or a scientific concept, you can find detailed information quickly. In conclusion, having computers is really good because of paying your bills, using Facebook, and doing research. So people need computers. I've told you all good things about computers. Can you tell me yours?
451	453	1	3	Dear local newspaper, it has come to my attention that computers have positive and negative effects on people. In the past, there have been more negative effects on people. In a survey taken in several magazines, it showed that a significant percentage (i.e., @PERCENT1) of people have negative effects with computers. In my opinion, I think computers have a negative effect on people. First, people are not interacting with family and friends. It is very important to have interactions with people. When on the computer, you're not really interacting. You just sit there staring at a screen. In a survey taken at a local community center, it showed that @PERCENT2 of people are on the computer and not interacting with the people around them. Parents don't see their kids as much because they are always on the computer. Parents would love to see their kids move around. Interacting with their family and friends will be healthy for them. Computers take away the opportunity from hanging out with family and friends. Secondly, people don't get to enjoy nature. People on the computer might not go outside because they are involved with the computer. Staying in one room doing things on the computer for a long time, people need fresh air too. Learning about nature is more enriching. If you don't enjoy nature, you don't know what is going on. Nature is all around us, and why would you miss out on it? In a survey taken in a local magazine, it showed that @PERCENT2 of people are on the computer while they could be enjoying nature. Lastly, people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising. Exercise is important for the mind and body. Our bodies need to stay healthy and fit. The lack of exercise is increasing fast. The more people get computers, the less people exercise. America is already overweight, and people on computers most likely long to become overweight. People rather play on the computer than go exercise for a healthy body. Dr. @DR1, a local doctor, has seen more people become overweight and not exercise as much as they used to. He says computers do not provide exercise. He recommends that people use their computers less as computers are doing more harm than good. In conclusion, I think computers have a negative effect on people. My three reasons are that people are not interacting with friends and family, not enjoying nature, and getting less exercise. I urge you to be aware of the negative effects on people. It's an important decision that is up to you.
452	454	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, To start off, I would like to give my opinion on using computers too much. Although I use a computer a lot, I still have fun with friends and play sports. But too much time on the computer can cause you to not want to get exercise or maybe get sick easier. Spending so much time on the computer can cause a kid to be shy in the outside life. Exercising is very healthy for kids and adults. There are way too many people on computers doing anything you can think of for hours. Staring at a computer screen for a long amount of time will not keep you fit or in shape. People should have a minimal amount of time of @NUM1 minutes each day and then get some exercise. This way, you would get time for being on the internet and still do what's good for you. I shouldn't feel bad about the people who waste all their time on the computer, but I do. To see them getting out of shape and gaining weight from lack of exercise makes me want to help them. No one should put themselves into that kind of situation. What I've noticed about people who stay online a lot is that they get sick more often. From sitting there like lazy bums, they don't get fresh air. Not getting enough fresh air can cause a cold or, for some people with health problems, to get very sick. They need to think twice about what they're getting themselves into. I would rather be having fun and getting nice fresh air than sitting on the computer about to be sick. It can be a different story if you went home sick from work/school and went on the computer. But being sick from the computer is just not right. Even though it may seem odd to say, people who are on the computer often are shy in person. If someone gets in a fight on the internet, that can cause them so much emotional pain that they don't even want to talk. Interacting with people is very nice and fulfilling. But being shy and lonely because of a fight on the computer or from being on it too much is something to be ashamed of. You shouldn't have to be that way because of one thing. Get out in the world and don't let things like that get to you. To wrap this up, it would be nice for people to take care of themselves and not stay on the internet for so long. Remind yourself to have at least @NUM1 minutes to yourself and to do what you want, but also get some exercise. Don't forget about staying healthy and going for a jog once in a while. You shouldn't focus your life on your computer. Thank you and have a great day.
453	455	1	3	People are probably on the computers chatting, checking their e - mail, or making a website, or they are on YouTube. Maybe the person does not like to go outside and enjoy nature or spend time with their family. They are probably checking out new websites and playing games, or they are probably on the computer to book their vacations or see what is on sale at Walmart. They are probably looking at or buying a new truck, or they are looking at the history of all the wars and how they were started. In essence, the computer has become a central part of many people's lives, but they are missing out on the real - world experiences that could be just as fulfilling.
454	456	1	3	I think computers work well because it helps people with their own work. But computers do make people addicted because you can mostly do anything. But mostly, computers were able to be used for help like work, maps, and to find solutions to problems. For school, it helps them with math, science, social studies, and a whole lot of more things. But people abuse it. There are @CAPS2 games, and they don't even go outside. They don't talk to their friends or even see their friends. It's mostly like not having a life. And people don't feel like going to school because they are over - tired and they just want to use the computer all day without stopping. And so I think that people are just too addicted to computers. They don't use it for the right reasons. Then, when people get sick, they could get headaches or they feel like puking. And they don't get to see a lot of things like go to the @CAPS1 to watch football, soccer, @CAPS3, volleyball, or even take their own dog for a walk at the @CAPS1. A lot of people buy computers for games, and a lot of mature people buy computers for their work and to find where places are. So the computer helps a lot, but it also addicted a lot of people. And computers do really break down because people could download a game or something and then it gives it a virus. So you mostly spend about @NUM1 $ or @NUM2$ to fix it. And there are new computers that come out, and it's like @NUM3$ and @NUM4$, and they are different just from the brand and they go about more faster. And when people's computers break, some go crazy and feel like doing some crazy stuff. They feel like they have no friends. They only stay in their room all the time and if they do come out of the room, they instantly don't respect their parents. They do whatever they feel like doing and they get into troubles. So computers do help out sometimes, but they don't always. Maybe we should make different changes to how we use them.
455	457	1	3	Welcome to the @DATE1. In this day in age, numerous advances in technology are being made every day. The one advance that has stood out above the rest is the invention of the computer. For just one invention, the computer has many capabilities: it offers vast access for educational purposes, helps keep people in touch, and opens people up to new aspects of life. The computer has helped mankind with various discoveries about our world. As far as many can see, this piece of technology has positive effects on people everywhere, every day. The new trend in schools all around the globe is the addition of computers or a computer lab. The reason for this is that this technology takes learning to places it has never gone before. Whether a student has to write an essay about the presidency of @PERSON1 or obtain background information for a science experiment about paper towel absorbency, a computer can aid them in finding the information they need. Programs like @ORGANIZATION1 allow students to present their work in a new and efficient way. For children that don't attend school or adults that want a college education, computers let them learn what they need to from online schools. It is also important to note that students can keep in touch with friends after school hours. Computers are able to help them with this. How many times has it been said that communication is key to a healthy relationship? Computers, believe it or not, are an easy and convenient way to maintain contact with far - away people. Some friends and family keep in touch completely by computer because they don't live close enough to visit daily. If one is cautious and uses internet safety techniques, they can make new friends with common interests through computers. This contact with new people is just one way that the computer is broadening one's horizons. Computers are like keys; they open doors to new places and ideas. The use of this technology can help people in discovering so many new things they have never known before. Computers can help open people up to unique genres of music they have never listened to before. On the internet, there are many video tutorials that teach people different skills for free. In one's spare time, they could use a computer to research the people of @LOCATION1 or the pyramids of @LOCATION2. Any way a computer is used has the potential to have a positive effect on someone. In the @DATE1, computers are essential to everyday life. It is imperative that you decide whether you are for this remarkable piece of technology or against it. It is astounding what you could learn from just hopping on a computer. Especially keep in mind that computers are for more than just entertainment: they're for education as well. So what are you waiting for? Discover how great an impact computers can have on your life with just a click of the mouse.
456	458	1	3	Dear editor, I understand that some children and adults are extremely fond of going on the computer, but they truly don’t know what the bad effects are. When you're at a young age, all sorts of things can happen. And while you're on the computer, even more troublesome things can occur. You could engage in bad things over the internet, neglect to exercise, or not have enough time for your family. First of all, by bad things, I specifically mean that your child can access bad websites, talk to strangers, or get harassed. When a child first gets, for example, a Facebook account, most of the time, the people who request them as a friend are unregistered child molesters and or sex offenders. They would probably act friendly at first to get the kid comfortable, and then they might end up kidnapping them. Also, you could harass people or get harassed yourself. And you can visit inappropriate websites. Secondly, nowadays, most kids don't go outside as they should. Lastly, your child won't have sufficient family time. Now, with more technology emerging like cellphones and laptops, kids would rather hang out with their friends and not with their families. I can understand the appeal of cellphones, but you need to make more time for your family. The reason I think going on the computers all the time is not good is that you can do bad things by talking to strangers, experience harassment, and access inappropriate websites. You won't get enough exercise and may suffer from diabetes, high blood pressure, and childhood obesity. Lastly, you won't have enough family time mainly because of all the new technology that has come out such as cellphones and laptops. In conclusion, it's crucial for both children and adults to be aware of these negative impacts and use computers in a more balanced way.
457	459	1	3	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, In my opinion, computers are truly wonderful to society in numerous ways. They can preserve memories that we can't hold onto forever, like photos, videos, and type letters. Computers also can offer dieting tips and advice from local experts. But, most importantly, family members that you miss can talk to you for hours without incurring a phone bill. To begin, computers can provide useful tips on things you didn't know, so they can also serve as a learning center. For example, if you're extremely stressed out because you have a huge paper to do but have no facts, there are millions of websites you could visit to find your answers. The next day, you get your paper back and there's an A stamped right across it. Another great thing about computers is that you can talk to your family members who are all the way in a different city, town, state, or even continent! You may miss them a great deal, but you can always see them, talk to them, or type to them to let those sad feelings melt away for a little bit. Every one in five Americans says that missing or not seeing a family member is like letting a little piece of your heart fall off. Everybody knows what it's like to have a memory that you could never forget, but what about those little memories that photos, websites, and written work seem to slip away from the brain. Computers save all of that. As @PERSON1 exclaims, ""It's like losing a little part of life that you have lived."" This is exactly why computers are so valuable in many ways. I hope you are appreciative of the knowledge, tips, and family connections that computers bring. In conclusion, computers have become an indispensable part of our lives, offering us various benefits that enhance our daily experiences."
458	460	1	3	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1, Have you ever seen someone with a smartphone emailing their co - worker or a person with their laptop at a coffee shop? Well, I can definitely say I have and know that they need it and it benefits them. People use a computer for their work every day. Also, you can keep in touch with friends and family. Plus, it's the start of a new and improved future! Whether you use a computer to get the latest gossip or for a job, the computer is now an important part of people's lives. My mother works on the computer every day at her job. Though it may not seem important to you, it is to my family, who needs the money for food and bills. Half of @LOCATION1 uses computers for jobs to earn money just like my family. Recently, @ORGANIZATION3, the computer company, took a survey to see how many people use the company's products for work. A whopping amount of @PERCENT1 use the computer for work. That @PERCENT1 of people benefit from using the computer. They depend on their email to reach their boss or their layout of their statewide meeting to be saved so they can get the raise they deserve. You, the @ORGANIZATION1, even use computers to write your articles for the paper. More than half of @CAPS2 or @ORGANIZATION2 benefit just from working on the computers. Everyone says family is the most important thing, right? What can you do if they live far away? Well, you can email, video - chat, text, or share photos, of course. Some experts claim, ""People are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family."" Video - chat was originally invented to keep in touch with family. So the experts have no reason to claim that because people use the computer to keep in touch with families. Even people in the army use the computer to communicate. Using the computer isn't as bad as people think. Look out! The future is coming! New technology greater than my knowledge is on the horizon. Computers were the start and people haven't stopped since. Sure, of course, the computer has a couple of downsides. But what thing or invention doesn't? No one can stop what is coming. You just have to learn to live with it and move on. Computers are the beginning of something good, so don't stop something that could be even better! Next time you go outside, look for that guy in the business suit emailing on the smartphone or the girl in the coffee shop and smile, knowing they are benefiting from it. Whether it's for work or for keeping in touch with a relative. Maybe someone with the next big idea for the future. Take a chance on the computer, stop the negativity, and a pleasant surprise will come your way. In conclusion, despite some concerns, the overall benefits of computers far outweigh their drawbacks, and we should embrace them for a better future."
459	461	1	3	Dear The Local Newspaper, I do believe computers affect people. But in many different ways. Also, it depends on how long you are on the computer. In my opinion, computers are good for numerous reasons. I will tell you some of the reasons why I believe this. Hopefully, after you read this, you'll think about it more. One reason computers are good is the communication aspect. There are many different websites to go on and talk to friends and family. If you have a family member far away, this could be an excellent way to talk to them. This also is a way to see your friends with the latest technology like video - chat. Video - chat is a way to see and hear your friends through a little camera. It is a very good way to keep in touch with people you know. Another reason is that you can obtain a great deal of information from the computer. There are so many websites that provide answers to all your questions. Websites like @ORGANIZATION1 and @ORGANIZATION2 recommend other sites to go research. You can learn a lot from computers. The information provided on the computer can really teach everyone something. Lastly, a computer can assist you with many things. Such as online classes, matchmaking, jobs, and so much more. You can find things to do by just typing it into the computer. The economy is very bad, but you can look for jobs. Then once they find one you're interested in, they'll inform you. It's a very good and helpful way for you, and it's so simple. Computers are an amazing and new technology. They keep evolving and coming up with more and more features. So why not use it? It can teach you something and help you. Also, it helps you stay in touch with family and friends. Don't take it for granted, but use it well. It's only a click of a button. I hope I made you all realize what a computer is really useful for. Maybe, even changed your minds or gave you a different way of thinking about computers. In conclusion, computers are a valuable asset in our lives, and we should make the most of their capabilities.
460	462	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1, Technology has been advancing at a rapid rate for many years now, making life much easier for everyday people. It helps out in many ways. For example, it allows you to keep in touch with relatives, learn new information, and stay safe and updated. Computers are vital to everyday life, and we truly need them. A huge purpose of computers is to facilitate communication. With new programs like ""@CAPS2"", ""@CAPS3"", and ""@CAPS4"", it provides you with all sorts of new opportunities to keep in touch and have fun with your friends that were not previously available. Email as well, is a great tool to keep in touch with family members who are far away, as opposed to the old - fashioned letter which might take a week in the mail. Another significant reason why we need computers today is to be able to research foreign places and learn facts that without a computer, you would never even have heard of. With computers, it becomes possible to go online, look up the @ORGANIZATION1, research it, and plan a flight there a week later. It is also a great tool to learn new things that you did not know previously. It is a huge step up in the education process. Computers also provide us with extreme safety and security as well as breaking news. Imagine how much simpler it would be to be at home and go on the computer to check the best route home instead of not checking and consequently sitting in traffic. With modern - day technology, all that is possible. They add great safety and protection to average people like you and me. In conclusion, hopefully your mind has been changed on the topic of computers, or if you already were in support, that as well is great. Now you are being asked to spread the word about how great computers are and how vital they are to ensuring a better future. I understand that some people do not enjoy electronics, but it is up to you to set them straight! Computers are great tools for moving ahead, and we should embrace them, not criticize them."
461	463	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I've heard that some individuals hold the view that computers do not bring benefits to society. But I firmly believe they do. Computers are incredibly useful as they help us learn all types of information. They serve as an excellent source of entertainment. Moreover, computers do not significantly change the time we spend on exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. Computers are a great resource in our daily lives, so why not make use of what we've been given? Google, yahoo, @CAPS1 and @LOCATION1. Just imagine what we'd do without them. They assist us in figuring out small things, like a quick and easy way to get rid of a stomach ache or a funny joke to tell at the office the next day while you're in the staff room sipping coffee. They also come in handy when we're unsure what to do when our newborn has a cough and a small sneeze, you know, the really tough stuff. These are the kinds of things we need to know, and not everyone has the time to go to the library every time they have a question. The information available on computers is endless. Whether it's learning a new language for your next vacation to @LOCATION2 or finding help for that geometry homework that you just can't understand, the computer can do it all. Entertainment on computers seems to be never - ending. From the skateboarding dog on Youtube that you can't stop laughing at to the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 on addictinggames.com, there will never be a dull moment. There are millions of videos and movies on youtube, and there are @CAPS4 of games on the @ORGANIZATION1 alone, from pacman to scrabble. There's no way we'll be left with nothing to do. I always log on to @ORGANIZATION2 to chat with family members living too far away to visit. Computers are one of the best sources of entertainment, and they definitely benefit society. Computers definitely do not change the way we exercise, enjoy nature, or interact with family and friends. On the computer, there are videos that show us new yoga moves and other ways to shed those extra pounds you gained over the days. There are also sites to find out where to go camping and have that family vacation you've always dreamed of. And we always manage to make time to go see our family and friends. Computers don't keep us hypnotized. Without a doubt, computers benefit everyone's society. They are informational, they definitely entertain us all, and they don't turn us into mindless zombies so that we can't interact with other people. Computers are one of the most helpful things we have, and no one should think they aren't, not after reading this essay.
462	464	1	3	Dr. @DR1, The effects computers have on people and the reason why some people don't agree that this benefits society are worth exploring. Some people use computers to be online and talk to friends and family. There are several reasons why some people are reluctant to use the computer. First of all, computers can be used for almost everything, like virtually visiting other places you want to go. Then, if you want to work remotely or enroll in another school, in some cases, you need to do it via computer. Why not give it a try? I know computers can be quite expensive, but sometimes it's really good to have one. However, some people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. For example, when some family and friends are in different places and can't see each other, they can write to each other online, especially if they don't have a cell phone or a house phone. Also, when people want to explore other natural places that they're not familiar with, they can use the computer to look for those locations. The third reason is that people can do exercise through the computer. It doesn't matter if they spend a lot of time on the computer because they can actually do a lot of useful things on it. Like students, we do a lot of projects on the computer and search for all kinds of information. So, many people find computers fun. Finally, those who don't agree should give it a shot. These are the effects computers have on people and the reasons why some people don't agree and spend time online. In conclusion, computers have both positive and negative aspects, but with proper use, they can bring great benefits to our lives.
463	465	1	3	Computers, computers, computers. Almost everyone owns them, right? They teach hand - eye coordination and give people the opportunity to learn about faraway places. Can you actually believe that some people say otherwise? I think that's pure nonsense! Computers today are integrated into everyday tools, such as cars, cellphones, and your everyday television. Computers also make work easier and allow you to interact with people. I, for one, firmly believe that computers benefit society today, and those people who think otherwise should look into it one more step. Cellphones, cars, and telephones are all creations of mankind, but with a significant amount of technology involved. Did you know that @PERCENT1 of cars have computers built into them? With the press of a button, all doors unlock; with a switch, the windows go down, all thanks to computers. Now, how do computers make life easier, you ask? Well, keep reading to find out! The toothpaste, the baseball bats, and the pencils we use are all made by machines, but programmed with computer chips. Oh, I remember when my history teacher told me that it took @NUM1 hours to make a baseball bat by a human from scratch. Now, it takes like @NUM2 minutes with the help of computers. If this isn't enough to convince you that computers benefit us, then what will? Some experts say that people who use computers a lot don't get outside often to interact with family, but I say that's false! Cellphones are an everyday tool that we use to talk to each other on long - distance calls. And if not, we can always chat online on our own personal laptops. I hope now you're convinced that computers really do benefit us. With the everyday items we use, how they make work easier, and how they help us interact, we use them every day, and hopefully, they'll be around for a long, long time.
464	466	1	3	Computers have a good effect on people because they can teach people hand - eye coordination, provide knowledge about historical events, and information about other cultures. They are also a great way to relax and just have fun. Computers teach hand - eye coordination by training your hand to move where your brain tells it to and where your eyes direct it. Hand - eye coordination is extremely important. It can assist people when driving, as it decreases reaction time and can help people write more neatly. For instance, if it can help a driver turn the wheel faster or hit the brakes in time, I think that hand - eye coordination could help that driver avoid an accident. Think of a climber trying to grab a hold on a mountain. With good hand - eye coordination, he would be able to see the hold, grab it, and pull himself up quicker than before. Most people are unaware of many things, like how many soldiers were on @CAPS1 @CAPS2 or how many countries there are in the world. The internet is a great place to find out about history and other things you want to know. A lot of Americans don't even know much about @LOCATION2 history, let alone world history. You can google anything you want, from when the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 ended to when the @LOCATION1 collapsed in @DATE1. You can also learn both interesting and useful things, such as food recipes or the contents in paints. Or you could just stay updated with the news on yahoo.com. Computers are a lot of fun. You can talk with friends, listen to music, play games, or do all three at the same time. That's just the tip of the iceberg. Did you miss your favorite show at @TIME1? There are hundreds of websites that will let you watch it for free. Did you want to hear your favorite band's new album? You can listen to it legally and for free on youtube.com, playlist.com, and many other websites. Between learning about other cultures and just having a great time, the computer can be a wonderful tool for interacting with friends and family, improving hand - eye coordination, or learning something new. In conclusion, computers are truly a valuable asset in our lives.
465	467	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, Computers have many positive effects on society these days. I firmly believe this because computers offer us communication skills, supply us with information, and enhance our skills when it comes to technology. Read on to hear how I further explain my reasoning. First off, computers are excellent for developing communication skills. I personally find the computer to be incredibly useful all the time. It gives you access to websites that enable you to talk to both new and old friends. It's a fast and easy way to communicate with someone, whether you're sitting at home or on the move with your laptop. You can chat with people all over the world. Secondly, computers provide you with a vast amount of information for writing papers, newspaper articles, etc. When a teacher assigns the class to write a paper about a specific topic, students can simply go home, turn on the computer, and type the topic into a search engine. At that moment, they're automatically provided with thousands and thousands of different sources of information. I know that @PERCENT1 of the population in the @LOCATION1 prefer computer sources over book sources because computers are so much more convenient when it comes to finding specific information. Lastly, computers increase your skills in technology. Although some computers may seem fairly easy to use at first, companies are constantly trying to make them more complex. They're also always releasing new software for your computer. By making computers and software more high - tech, the current generation in our country is becoming more technically advanced compared to many other countries. As a whole, computers have a huge impact on our country's technical skills. I believe computers have a positive effect on society. I think this because computers provide us with communication skills, they offer us information, and they enhance our technological know - how. I hope I've made it clear so that we're looking at this from the same perspective. In conclusion, computers are an indispensable part of our society, bringing numerous benefits and helping us progress in various aspects of life.
466	468	1	3	Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, I've heard reports from both the news on @CAPS2.V. and your paper that more and more people are becoming overly reliant on their computers, almost to the point of being consumed by them. I'm not saying it's a bad thing. I mean, the computer has the internet, which allows you to access a vast array of things like various websites and engage in online chatting. I just think that people should get outside more often and do some outdoor activities like playing football, basketball, baseball. Or if you're an adult, you could get a job that doesn't require a computer, like, for example, building houses for homeless people, constructing shelters for animals, or working as a maintenance man, a pool lifeguard, or any other job at a hotel that doesn't involve a computer. You could work at a restaurant that offers regular food or fast - food service. Something that doesn't involve a computer. But if you can't get out of the house, you could do something a bit different from just using computers or playing video games. They may be similar to the computer, but they are something you can do on the @CAPS2.v., and it's better than playing on the computer all the time. In conclusion, a balanced life with both computer use and outdoor activities is ideal.
467	469	1	3	Computers are progressing into our lives more and more. These machines help our world become an easier place to carry out tasks such as work, pay bills, and even entertain ourselves. However, these conveniences are overshadowed by the negative effects, like the online dangers, the disconnection from reality, and the obesity problems we face. With our new technological advances, people are spending more time sitting around than being outside, which adds more and more to the obesity problem we encounter. Kids and teens today would much rather be on their @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 account than go for a run or shoot some hoops. Also, more and more ads are on the web for unhealthy foods, making these kids more likely to eat more junk food. Finally, the internet fools people into believing they can go on an easy - diet plan and become skinny with no worries. Along with more computers and users comes increasing dangers and threats. Viruses can hack your computer, steal your personal information, and destroy your computer. You can end up with huge bills for things you didn't even buy! Cyber - bullies are also a new and dangerous threat. These people threaten and torment innocent people. I remember a story of a girl who took her own life because she was bullied by someone who turned out to be another girl and her mother. Finally, online predators are a great threat to teens. These people brainwash others, convince them to meet, and may rape and kill them. Last but not least, today's computers' interaction with young minds increases ignorance through ads and neglect of education and reading. Many kids, even myself, would rather be online than read a book or do homework. In short, while computers help our world advance, certain aspects can create ignorance and danger for people young and old, and their minds.
468	470	1	3	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, This letter I am writing to you is about how computers affect people. I am concerned about computer use in our society because people who spend too much time on the computer spend less time outdoors, exercising, and with family and friends. Let me tell you more about it... As stated in the paragraph above, one reason I am concerned about computer use is that less time is spent outdoors. ""Everyone, young or old, should get outside for some fresh air for at least @NUM1 minutes every day,"" says @PERSON2. Using the computer could limit this time, and that probably isn't healthy as being in the house all day. A second reason I worry about over - usage of computers relates to the first reason. Too much time on the computer limits the amount of exercise you get every day. ""People should exercise an hour a day to stay healthy,"" says health expert @PERSON1. ""However, @PERCENT1 of people don't because of computers."" This happens often, especially if you are playing a fun game with many levels. You plan to play for @NUM2 minutes, but the @NUM2 minutes turns into @NUM4 minutes, which may even turn into an hour! I know it may still be hard to understand why I'm concerned about using computers, but I have one more reason. My final reason in this letter of why I don't like over - using computers is that it limits the time that can be spent with family and friends. You can see your family and friends on the computer using a webcam. But it's not the same as spending quality time. ""Friends come and go, and you and your family won't live forever,"" says therapist @PERSON3. ""So make the best of the time that you have."" There won't be much quality time if your eyes are glued to the computer screen. In conclusion, as you can see, there are valid reasons why I am concerned about people spending too much time on the computer. There's less time to exercise, enjoy nature, and interact with family and friends. I hope you take this into consideration."
469	471	1	3	I believe that computers benefit society. They make life easier. Computers allow new forms of communication between friends. They also teach you new things. Computers make our lives easier. They let us look things up by more convenient means than asking a person or referring to a book. It has made it simpler to type reports. Now you don't have to worry about making mistakes on a typewriter and having to type the whole thing again. A computer saves the report and can even show you some mistakes. It also helps you take care of your children in some ways, like allowing you to monitor their online activities from your home. Computers allow new means of communication. You can talk online with friends. Social networks such as @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 facilitate that. Computers allow you to converse with friends you don't normally get to see or talk to. They also make it easier and more fun to make new friends. Computers teach us new things. They teach you about places you haven't seen before. Any question you can ask on the internet, and you will get an answer. It gives you answers when you don't know who to ask. Computers also teach hand - eye coordination. You can play games online or with @CAPS3's. You need to have good hand - eye coordination in order to play these games. In conclusion, computers have a positive effect on people of all ages. They make our lives easier with their technology. They allow us to communicate with our friends through social networks. Computers also teach us new things such as hand - eye coordination. All these reasons and more are why I believe that computers benefit our society.
470	472	1	3	@ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 technology majors support that the use of computers have a positive effect on people, and I agree with them. I believe the use of computers is a necessity for social interaction, homework, research, and is a great source of entertainment on a rainy day. After a long day at school, many teens go from the bus, to the front door, to their computer chair. In fact, @PERCENT1 of most teens do so. Odds are they're logging into Facebook, MySpace, Formspring, @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS2, and other socially interactive websites. With good time management, I actually find these websites important. I think Facebook, e - mail, and @CAPS3 @CAPS4 ( @CAPS5) are a great way to be socially interactive. It's also a great way to keep in touch with long - distance family or friends. I go to @DATE1 camp and have made friends I consider my family. Some of them are across the ocean in @LOCATION2. Since I can't make long - distance calls which would cost way too much money, Facebook is a great alternative to keep in touch. Some of my family also live far away. For example, my aunt, uncle, and cousin in @LOCATION1. My aunt just had a baby, meaning I have a new cousin which I'm not able to see in person yet. So seeing pictures on Facebook instead of spending money on envelopes, stamps, and picture prints is really awesome. Many homework assignments given out in school require a computer. Three out of five homework assignments are on the computer. Whether it be taking a twenty - question test or defining a word, the computer is a schoolwork necessity. In school now, many projects are assigned, meaning we need the computer and the internet. We use PowerPoint and other Microsoft documents, whether it be typing an essay or creating a PowerPoint slideshow. We need the internet for research to get the information we need to succeed. Aside from interacting with other humans and researching and typing, the computer holds many more wonders. Many people believe people are spending way too much time on the computer. While this may be true for some people, it is not true for everyone. Many people are concerned children are becoming lazy, but in a recent vote, @NUM1 out of @NUM2 mothers said they'd rather see their children playing and interacting on the computer than being a couch potato and watching @CAPS6. On a rainy day, the computer can be a great alternative. You can slide in a @CAPS7 and watch a movie or play a game or even research something new and learn about it. @NUM3 out of @NUM2 @CAPS8 have at least two computers in the house for a reason. They're important to our daily lives. In conclusion, the computer is a great tool for social interaction, schoolwork, and entertainment, and it has a positive impact on our lives.
471	473	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I think it is both good and bad. The good aspect is that it teaches people about @CAPS1 places and how other people live in their society, like what they do to get food or how they raise their kids. It also helps people like cops. When they have a person they're looking for, they can use the computer to search. For instance, in the case of a speeder, they can see if he or she has done it before. It helps teachers to get a lesson or a guideline to teach, or they can put you on a program to help you with your typing. Yes, it does have a positive effect on some people. Some people think they do a lot better around the computer or they do their best work online, like when writing a high - school paper. Yes, you can talk to other people online and get @CAPS1 friends. On the other hand, computers can be bad. When you meet people online, you don't know who that person is or where they come from. They might have a long criminal record. They might be someone who wants to get you in trouble because of his or her family problems. Some people spend too much time on the computer because they meet someone they really like and don't worry about what the family wants to do. Some people used to work out every day, but now they can talk to their friends all night and all day, stop working out, forget about it, and never start again. Some people just stay in and stay on the computer instead of going to play baseball or football or attending family reunions. In conclusion, while computers offer many benefits, we need to be cautious of their negative impacts and use them in a balanced way.
472	474	1	3	Do you like going on the computer? Well, after you read this, I don't think you would want to. I know that the population of @ORGANIZATION1 uses the computer. If you're on the computer for @NUM1 hr., you can damage your eyes and you would have to wear glasses, and you don't want that. Sometimes it's hard to stay off of them. The internet can be used for a lot of things, like talking to your friends and family and playing games. The computer is also useful for learning about different things. One thing you can learn is about the presidents, and another thing is your family history. Now you know what the computer can do to you. Only use the computer for @NUM2 or @NUM3 mins. That is what I would do, as it helps to protect your eyes and maintain a healthy balance in life.
473	475	1	3	@ORGANIZATION1, as @CAPS1 technology continues to become more and more enhanced, so has the percentage of Americans who use computers. @PERCENT1 of those Americans are children from the ages of @NUM1 to @NUM2. Most teens use the computer to interact with friends on social sites or spend a good chunk of their time playing online games. But what about the other teens; the ones who are constantly facing cyber - bullying or are put in danger by talking to people they don't even know? To prevent these issues, I say we put a limit on our use of technology. Social sites, such as @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3, and Facebook, have been growing at an alarming rate. More teens would rather be on the computer than outside playing tag or on a swingset. I, myself, have an @CAPS2, Facebook, and @CAPS3, and it's prevented me from getting exercise because it's almost like I'd rather be talking to my friends than going for a jog. It bothers me, it really does, but there is one question I always ask myself: how do I stop? I've been going on runs, studying more, and spending time with my family. There are ways and reasons to stop being so attached to technology, we just don't know how to get the message spread. Other than the effects social sites and exercise have had because of computers, online gaming is also a big issue. Many kids, mostly boys from what I see at school, are absolutely loving online gaming. But the only people that actually benefit in life are the website owners. These games are not educational; it's not a good way to spend a couple of hours of your time. So generally, it's a waste. More important things should be done during this time, like studying or doing homework. Just think, you could even hang out with friends during that time rather than staring at a monitor. Although computer gaming is a big reason why kids go on the computer, bullying is a huge factor along with stranger danger on chats. If you're someone who's bullied constantly at school, you think being able to go home and spend time on the computer is amazing; until bullying came along. Cyber - bullying can lead to a child hurting themselves, getting into fights at school, or even worse, someone taking their life because they didn't think it was worth living. Limited computer use or parental control would really help prevent this. Computer usage has its ups and downs, but my point is that safety, health, and education are the main issues we face because of modern technology. I'd like to hear that my letter to your newspaper was read. Please get back to me with your thoughts on this issue within the next three days by email, so that we can work towards a better way of using technology.
474	476	1	3	I think the computer has a positive effect on people all over the world. You can do lots of things on the computer, like academic work, talk on the internet, or even find out facts about famous people you love. I think computers can benefit society because they can help you with your academic work, and you can also talk to your friends online. One way I can benefit from using the computer is by typing my school work. When I'm not doing my school work, I can talk to my friends online. But the best thing of all is finding out information about famous people like @PERSON1. I remember when I was doing a project on the computer and got a @NUM1 on it because I used the computer. That should prove that computers are very helpful. Have you ever wondered how a computer can help you in your everyday life? If you said no, I can tell you how. You can learn about different places and food. Let's say I was going to make pizza and I didn't know how; I would have to look on the computer to find out. A professor from Virgin New York Tech School said that without computers, the world is nothing. @PERCENT1 of people at New York Tech School agreed, but @PERCENT2 did not. Could you imagine a world without computers? If the world did not have computers, we would not have cell phones or even TV. People might not even know about cell phones or computers. Let's face it, without computers, the world would be lost, just like the professor from New York Tech said. Also, teenagers would be bored because most teenagers do not like to go outside. And if we do not have computers, how will adults do their work? They will have to handwrite it. Let's be honest, some adults and kids' handwriting is like chicken scratch. I think computers are very helpful for everyone around the world. In closing, I think the whole world should keep computers because without computers, the world is lost, stuck in the past of paper - based work and limited information access.
475	477	1	3	Dear, @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 opinion is getting out of hand. There are people who are getting addicted to @CAPS2, such as games, websites, communication, and email websites, etc. Therefore, there are people who are just plain addicted to the computer, such as @CAPS3 users. I know people who are addicted to @CAPS3 because they get addicted to talking to people and looking at other people's profiles. As a result, they don't cooperate correctly with their school work (so they get bad grades) or they lose connection with family members and friends (so they become lonely and depressed). Then their only friend is the computer. Also, other effects of computer addiction are that if you're addicted to a website (in general), you can get out of shape because you're not spending enough time exercising. There are already enough people in @LOCATION1 who are obese, and it is an additional problem. I read online that a significant number of people in @LOCATION1 are obese. So computers are an addiction waiting to happen. Therefore, people need to start spending time with friends and start exercising and stay away from the computer. In conclusion, we should be aware of the risks of computer addiction and take steps to maintain a healthy balance in our lives to avoid the negative consequences it brings.
476	478	1	3	"Computers are used everywhere, in various fields and for thousands of different things. Many of us in @LOCATION1 spend hours glued to our computer screen every single day. Being overly reliant on your computer is not always good for you. In @DATE1, too many people spend countless hours on their computers, rather than engaging in other activities. Therefore, computers are not the best way to spend your time because you get less exercise, your school grades can lower, and your communication skills will weaken. First, when spending days sitting in front of your keyboard, you will have less time to run around or play with your friends. In the @LOCATION1 @DATE1, a significant number of people are becoming obese, creating unhealthy genes to be passed on. Perhaps a reason for this is that too many people can just sit on their laptops to shop, watch movies, and even to get a college education. Less and less people go for walks because they would rather be on @CAPS1 or @ORGANIZATION1. Without the constant use of computers, there would be more free time for people to get outside, or play sports. Secondly, many kids and teens are so attached to their laptops that they bring it everywhere with them. So, rather than studying for their tests, they could be on @CAPS1 or @ORGANIZATION1. Most choose to go on @CAPS1 or @ORGANIZATION1 rather than opening their books. Plus, spending so many hours on a computer leaves less time to do their homework, so they just begin to neglect it. Computers take away the time that could be used towards getting a college education. Why waste it? Lastly, why talk on the phone or in person when you can just send them an e - mail or chat online with them? Many people in @DATE1 are staying inside on their laptops to talk to a person rather than doing it face - to - face. This can cause a lack of communication skills. Something that might sound good online could sound absolutely terrible in the ""real"" world. This loss of skill could lead to a generation of more cyber talk rather than @CAPS3. In conclusion, why spend so many hours on the computer when you could be outside, or hanging out with friends? Personally, I'd prefer to go and do something rather than being stuck inside on a computer."
477	479	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, Some people are debating whether advances in technology, such as computers, are beneficial to our daily life. I think that computers are a great addition to life for a few reasons. For one, information and knowledge are at your fingertips. It takes merely seconds to know anything you want or need to. While some might claim that things like email, @CAPS2, @CAPS1, etc. can be labeled as wasteful or dangerous, they also offer great opportunities. New friends can be made every single day through these platforms. Lastly, there can be limits set so there's no more worrying about too much time spent on the computers. One of the reasons computers can be beneficial to our daily life is what they can offer us. Knowledge is just seconds away. Anything you might be interested in learning is all on the web. Whether it's for homework, school projects, or even work, the information you need can often be found nowhere else as easily. The library is a great place to find what you're looking for, but if you're in a hurry and need what you're looking for quickly, there are online encyclopedias like World Book, etc. Technology is becoming a huge part of our life today, and many opinions are up in the air about it. If there's one thing everyone can agree on, it's that it's fast and can make daily tasks easier. Ordering clothes, books, movies, tickets for trips and more all can be done online with just a few clicks. That's not all the computer has to offer. Friends and family are a necessary part of life, but they're not always living right around the corner. They @MONTH1 live on the other side of the state, country, even the world! @CAPS2, @CAPS1, email, etc. can allow you to connect with anybody around the world at any time. E - mail has been around longer than other websites like @CAPS2 and MySpace which allow you to keep daily tabs on them. @CAPS1 or iChat allows you to instantly talk to anybody that you want. These websites can't replace being together in person, but it can help keep in touch for the meanwhile. Some are worried about spending too much time face - to - face with the screen, but there is even something to prevent that. Time spent inside on the computer is becoming a problem. Not enough exercise or time spent outside can be unhealthy. Time limits can fix this problem. A certain amount of time can be set. When there's @NUM1 minutes left, it gives you a warning. That way more time can be spent outside in the open, and less inside staring at the screen all day. Many different opinions about whether computers belong in our life have been shared. I believe they're a beneficial part of our life. They allow you information at the touch of your fingers, access to friends and family, plus there are time limits. In this day and age, the computer is something we can't live without.
478	480	1	3	Do you really think computers have a positive affect? Don't you think way too many people are on their computer for too long? You want me to write an article to my local newspaper about what I think on the effects they give people. I think they have a horrible effect on people. Whenever people are on the computer doing something, it can give them headaches, eye strain. But if they were outside, they would be exercising. One of the reasons I think computers have a bad effect on people is addictions. There are many things people @MONTH1 get addicted to, like Facebook, MySpace, Formspring. For example, @CAPS2 my sister gets home, the first thing she does is go on Facebook, Formspring, and YouTube. My second reason why I think computers have a terrible effect is because of eye damage. When you're staring at a computer screen for so long, you don't notice but your eyes are getting damaged. When I was in sixth grade, I needed glasses because I was addicted to the computer for so long and my eyes got damaged. My first reason @CAPS1 I think computers have a terrible effect on people is because it's a waste of time. When you're at home on the computer and it's sunny outside, you should be outside with friends, family, or even just taking a walk. And it's also a waste of time because when you're on the computer, you could be doing something more productive instead. You might think they have a positive effect, yes, but they damage your body. These are the reasons @CAPS1 I think computers have a bad effect on people. Instead of being on the computer, join a sports club. Now is the time to take action by making more clubs or activities available to people. The issue is that people spend too much time on the computer. These are my reasons @CAPS1 computers have a terrible effect on people. In conclusion, we should limit our computer use to avoid these negative impacts.
479	481	1	3	"Dear newspaper, I have heard you are creating an article on if computers are helpful or non - helpful to society. I find computers as a great addition to society because they play a big role in jobs around the country and in addition display accessible information to the @CAPS1 @CAPS8. Imagine how computers have helped shape the @ORGANIZATION1. Do you want to give this blessing up? Computers have proven to be a big role in job profiles all over the world. Just think about a sales person for instance. Sales people need their computer to store data, like on @ORGANIZATION3. By the way, a study was put into place by the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 to find out how many jobs find it necessary to have computers, and the results showed that @PERCENT1 of @ORGANIZATION1 jobs in @LOCATION1 need to use computers. Dr. @DR1, a computer programmer at To Go Industries, mentioned on the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 that ""computers show up sometime in everyone's life whether they like it or not, especially in jobs"". If you think about it, people that work with computers have less trouble calculating or storing data than citizens without computers. Just think of computers this way: a helping brain for those who work hard. Students love having access to information around the world. I bet that @PERCENT2 of @ORGANIZATION1 people would agree with me. Don't you think? Students around the world, for example, @MONTH1 often need to research information for a topic in class. A @CAPS8 at @ORGANIZATION2 in @CAPS6 mentioned that, ""I prefer using the internet for research in @ORGANIZATION2. It's much faster than looking through books, and people around the earth place opinions online instead of a book with a few authors."" One day @PERSON1 was in the library with the rest of his class, assigned to researching his topic in a book. He read five books and only got half a page of notes for his assignment. The following day he was allowed to work on the @ORGANIZATION2 computer and got three pages of notes. ""I was so relieved to log on to the internet"", @PERSON1 reported to me. A survey was set up by the @CAPS8 foundation to see if students prefer computers over books and @PERCENT3 said yes. Do you want students of all ages to participate in researching on the machine they favor most? Well, I dearly hope your answer benefits the children in @LOCATION1. From young students to adults, computers have become a favorite machine of modern - day technology. Computers are a magnificent part of society. @MONTH1 I remind you that computers benefit many jobs in @LOCATION1 and in addition aid students by showing information about everything there is to know. I sincerely hope you share my feelings about this matter. What is your vision on computers today? In conclusion, computers clearly bring many advantages to both the workplace and education, and they should be embraced in society."
480	482	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 of Newspaper, It has been brought up to concern that computers are a menace to society. On the contrary, computers are very helpful. If one needed directions to a place or if one wanted to know how to do something, it would show how to. They also can help you do things like read faster and improve hand - eye coordination. Computers are also a good form of entertainment. Those are some of the reasons computers are helpful. First, computers can help find out how to do things. If there is somewhere far to go or there are many winding roads to get there, you can use the computer. On the computer, there are many maps that give detailed descriptions on how to get places. Specialists say that over @PERCENT1 of viewers get to their destination. Sometimes, it's due to lack of driving skills. Computers also help with instructions on how to make things. If there is a cake to be made, the computer will have recipes to make it. That also can help make projects. For example, they show things about @CAPS3 mythology for making a @CAPS3 pat. The computer can help you learn languages. There is software that can teach people languages just like books, except that they have animated teachers to help speak the language that one might need to go to. Reading all these different languages can help you with normal reading. Another reason that computers are helpful is they can help people with reading. Did you know that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 Americans have trouble reading? That wouldn't happen if they had computers. Almost everything on the computer has to be read, so it gives a lot of practice. It also will improve hand - eye coordination. When someone is doing something on the computer, they watch the screen, not their hand. Also, on Microsoft Word to type an essay, you watch the screen not your fingers typing. There are many games on the computer for improving hand - eye coordination. The last reason that computers affect people is that they are entertaining. On the internet, there are many fun games for all ages. Some can watch videos on YouTube; there are many funny videos there. As you can see, computers are helpful in many ways. They will give directions to places, help people with reading, and are entertaining and fun. In conclusion, computers are an invaluable tool in our daily lives, offering assistance in multiple areas.
481	483	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, The effects computers have on society are a mixture of positive and negative uses. Getting tired and lazy is a clear negative aspect of computer use. When you are glued to the computer, especially for more than @NUM1 minutes, you start to feel lethargic and have no desire to get up. This issue affects a large number of people on @DATE1 because many individuals rely on computers for their jobs and are thus constantly in front of the screen. It's even more challenging for kids. After coming back from school, they are often so exhausted that they prefer to just sit on the computer rather than engage in other activities. If we limit the time they spend on the computer, it will be beneficial for kids, grown - ups, and our brains. When adults spend excessive time on the computer due to work or checking emails, they frequently fail to interact with their family or other people. I can relate to this because my @CAPS4 dad is always on the computer for work and hardly talks to us or even looks our way. Sometimes, I wish the world had never invented computers because they can be so frustrating. However, we do have family time, and it's good to take a break from the computer. After all, the computer is what helps us earn money. Emailing, chatting, @CAPS3, AIM, @CAPS2 are all forms of technology - based communication. These communication methods are useful when someone can't text or doesn't have a phone. You can always chat with them on @CAPS3 or send them an email. Email and @CAPS3 are the only @NUM2 communications that my @CAPS4 dad uses a lot. He sends emails to my @CAPS4 soccer coach to inform about my game attendance, and the coach always responds promptly. It's very convenient. @CAPS3 is also a great way for kids to communicate with one another, especially if they don't have phones or don't see each other during the school day. Without @CAPS3 or email, it would be difficult to stay in touch. So, as you can see, computers have both positives and negatives. Getting lazy, not spending enough time with friends or family, and the ability to talk to friends are all positive and negative aspects related to computer use.
482	484	1	3	Although most people would say the invention of a computer is a good thing, I disagree. There are numerous bad things about the invention of computers, primarily because they give access to the internet. The internet is rife with inappropriate pictures and writing, unclear identification, and games. The most concerning aspect of the internet is the unclear identification. On social websites such as @CAPS1 or @CAPS2, a profile might claim that a person is fourteen years old, but in reality, @CAPS3 or @CAPS4 could be someone who has just been released from prison and is actually forty years old. There is no reliable way to determine if it's safe to talk to others on the internet. Internet games are also extremely harmful. They are one of the major causes of obesity in America. Moreover, games on the internet draw kids away from their families. Another drawback is that one can easily become addicted to these games. Staring at a computer screen for long periods can lead to severe eye - strain. There are also inappropriate pictures and writing on the internet, including bomb - making websites and illegal music - downloading websites. Overall, computers are useful for research, but they are not reliable in terms of safety and can cause obesity and family arguments. In conclusion, while computers have their uses, the associated risks and negative impacts cannot be ignored.
483	485	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I believe that computers have a negative impact on people. Computers have created problems where kids do not engage in any form of physical activity, which deprives them of their daily required exercise. Also, children spend so much time on the computer that they don't get a chance to enjoy the outdoors. Another effect computers have on kids is that @CAPS6 stops them from spending quality time with family and friends. I really don't understand how people can sit on a computer all day without moving around. First, kids don't get enough exercise because they spend an excessive amount of time on a computer. We know that almost everyone has a computer, and I'm no exception. But @CAPS6 doesn't mean it has to be used constantly. I'm an athlete and I enjoy being on the computer, but I don't use it every single moment. Doctors always recommend that everyone gets at least an hour of exercise every day. However, most people who use the computer or other electronics a lot fail to meet this requirement. This is also contributing to childhood obesity. If all you do is sit on the computer all day, you're likely to become obese someday. People need to get off the computer and engage in activities like sports or simple games. If you don't exercise, you won't be able to enjoy the outdoors. Second, people are not enjoying the outdoors. If someone likes to play sports, they shouldn't spend three hours on @CAPS4. Instead, they should invite a few friends to play basketball. Even walking home from school with a friend is a great way to be outside. People often think during the winter that there's nothing to do. But having a snowball fight with friends can be a lot of fun. No one should feel embarrassed if they want to play tag with a friend, even if they're @NUM2. Just get outside and do something. There are countless things to do that don't involve going on a computer. You're a kid for only so long, and you have to enjoy yourself now before life gets serious. Lastly, when you're not outside, you're not enjoying time with your friends or family. People are spending too much time on the computer and less with friends or family. Chatting on @CAPS4 is not the same as hanging out with your friend. Is it really that hard to tell them online ""@CAPS5 @NUM3 come @NUM3 my house."" It takes just two seconds. Then, in no time, you'll be hanging out with your friend. I don't understand why it's so embarrassing to be with your family. My dad and I like to go and play basketball or ping - pong together. We have fun and don't care. Find something your parents like to do and see if you like it too. It's not hard to say to a friend or parent, ""@CAPS5 to do something."" In conclusion, computers are causing kids to miss out on important aspects of life, and we need to encourage a more balanced lifestyle."
484	486	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 much do computers affect our life? I have always pondered that question. Technology is advancing rapidly, and it has made our life more convenient. However, have you ever considered that technology might replace people's work? In our daily lives, we are constantly exposed to new technological tools. But the presence of technology has changed people. Take cars as an example. Since cars became common, people have stopped walking and exercising. They don't spend enough time with their family and friends, and they miss out on many wonderful things that happen outside. I believe that technology, like computers, takes up a significant portion of our lives by doing most of the work for us. First, have you ever noticed how quickly people are becoming obese? I know the answer. The obesity problem in @LOCATION1 is worsening. People are getting fatter by sitting in one place, in front of a computer, and eating. What kind of exercise are they getting? People no longer exercise. Instead of playing sports like soccer, volleyball, baseball, or even running, they are glued to the computer, playing games that offer no real benefits. I've asked people about their thoughts on this, and a woman replied, ""I think that people don't think about their health; they just want to make life easier."" I wholeheartedly agree with her. Obesity can lead to serious health problems and hospital visits, which no one wants. Second, have you ever thought about how much time you spend with your friends and family? You might have bought a computer thinking you were spending too much time outside and not with your family. But now, you're probably at home most of the time because of the computer, yet still not spending quality time with your family. Spending time with your family is crucial because you might miss out on so many wonderful moments, like family parties or simply watching a show on TV together. I firmly believe that spending time with your family is of utmost importance. Lastly, if you're a parent and you're constantly on the computer, won't you feel terrible if something happens to your son or daughter? We often miss out on wonderful things because of technology, and sometimes we lose those precious moments forever. Imagine being at the computer when your daughter says her first word. You'd feel awful if you missed that, right? I know I would. Always make time for life because one day, you might regret missing so many wonderful things. In conclusion, a large number of people have become addicted to computers. They can't seem to stay away from them. Imagine yourself becoming one of those people. You'd become obese, not spend time with your family, and miss out on the wonderful things the world has to offer. We should all be more mindful of our computer use and make time for the important things in life."
485	487	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1, I think some people are overreacting; it's not really going to kill you. I'm not suggesting that people should stay on the computer all day. My last reason would be that nowadays, almost everyone owns a computer. Let's explore my three points. First, far too many people are overreacting. I think so because people say things like ""you are going to miss out or you are missing out on life."" However, when you're on the computer, you are still interacting with your family and friends, just not verbally (only through typing). I can't understand why people are so against computers. It's similar to the situation with global warming, where there are so many warnings, but no one listens. So, why would they listen to people saying that staying on a computer too long can make you fat? That's just my opinion on this topic. Next, I'm going to explain how a computer can't really kill you. It's just a machine. One reason is that it's just a computer, and another is that you'll get obese and bored if you stay on it for too long. I can't stay on the computer for more than an hour because it gives me a headache. That's another opinion of mine. Now, let's talk about how everyone has computers. Computers are not the sole cause of obesity. Everyone has a computer these days because so many people use Facebook. Even my mom has a Facebook account! There are also other types of websites, such as sexual, gaming, and friend - making sites. I believe Facebook is the most widely used website because so many people have it. In conclusion, as you can see from my points, some people overreact about computer use, it's not likely to be life - threatening, and the widespread ownership of computers is a common phenomenon. We should view computer use with a more balanced perspective."
486	488	1	3	Computers have little to no effect on people. In fact, computers help us out a great deal. They assist us in various fields such as finance, medical, and research. For example, they can help determine whether a person has cancer through advanced diagnostic software. The computers that most people commonly think of are the ones that sit in a room and are used frequently, but sometimes not for their intended purposes. People often use them for entertainment rather than research. However, there aren't just these ordinary computers. There are also larger and more advanced computers that scientists use on a daily basis. Undoubtedly, computers do have an effect on us, but it's a positive one. Most of the time, those who play games or listen to music on computers are bored kids, and they use it a bit too often. I only play with it on rainy days when I can't go outside and play. Humans mainly use computers because they make life simpler and easier. Indeed, it does simplify life. For instance, instead of handwriting a report, you can type it. And instead of searching everywhere in a book, you can directly access the information. One more example is that when you want to stay updated on your favorite sports team, you don't have to go to their games; you just need to visit their website. In my opinion, computers do have an impact on us, and it's for a good reason. I'm a sports fan, so I play a lot of sports. I use the computer often for both fun and research. It doesn't have a negative effect on me at all because I still exercise and play with my friends very often, almost every day. There's no reason why people can't use computers quite often. Computers don't always have a positive effect, but they don't always have a negative effect either. I exercise, enjoy nature, and interact with friends and family regularly, and I also use the computer frequently. Experts shouldn't be concerned about people using computers too much as long as they maintain a balanced lifestyle.
487	489	1	3	Dear The [ORGANIZATION1], [CAPS1] I can clearly see both sides of your argument regarding whether computers are important. However, computers have revolutionized the way we live our lives. Just for a moment, imagine what the world would be like without computers. I firmly believe that computers are one of the most important aspects of our lives. Computers are especially crucial for students and teachers. For instance, if a student needs to do a report on [LOCATION1], he can look up detailed facts and other relevant information on [LOCATION1]. Then, he can condense these facts into a well - structured paragraph on a word document. And if he has a question, he can easily email his teachers. Finally, he can print out the finished report. All of this can be done without having to get up and bother his parents to go to the bookstore and spend [NUM1] on a book that he will probably read only once. Also, without computers, there would be no communication outside of school. Another example of students using computers is online textbooks, which spare them from carrying heavy textbooks home. As I know from personal experience, computers have made my schoolwork and other tasks much easier. Secondly, [PERCENT1] of businesses say that they use computers daily, and some even agree that without computers, their businesses would fail. Computers make business operations much easier, especially with the business management and file - keeping programs that are available. On a computer, businesses can store customer information, compare income, and keep track of inventory without having a cluttered pile or a file cabinet. Computers can also save businesses money because they can eliminate jobs such as record keepers. Additionally, businesses can save time by having meetings via webcams instead of having people drive from state to state for one meeting, then repeating the process the next month and the month after. They can also email important things such as sales projections and other relevant data. Computers are also important and helpful in the home. People can do grocery shopping from the comfort of their homes, order pizza online, and go shopping online. Also, people can pay their bills online, which saves paper. Let's say a mother has a sick child, and she wants to know how to heal him, what to feed him, and what medicine to give him. She can look all this up on the computer and bookmark the websites for future reference. Then, her other child gets hungry, and she wants to find a healthy snack. She can search for it online. Next, she wants to make chicken fried rice but doesn't know how. She can look up the recipe online. Finally, after dinner, she needs to clean a stain on the carpet but it won't come out, so she buys a carpet cleaner from the web. Computers have truly made a mother's day so much easier. Without computers, our lives would be much harder. If we didn't have computers, the student doing a report on [LOCATION1] might have failed, the sick child might not have received proper care, the hungry child might not have been fed, and many other aspects of our lives would be severely affected. Computers are an important part of our lives, and we should embrace their benefits.
488	490	1	3	"Dear [CAPS1], [CAPS2] Have you ever known someone who lives far away from you? Or have you ever used [ORGANIZATION1] [CAPS3]? These are just a few of the amazing features that computers offer. Computers have greatly benefited society. They help people achieve various things, such as allowing people to talk to each other easily, developing skills from playing games, and providing clear images in an easy - to - access format. As I mentioned earlier, computers allow us to communicate with other people. This way, we don't have to talk to people in person all the time. It would be quite annoying if every time we wanted to talk to someone, one of three inconvenient things would happen without computers. Those would be either getting in trouble at school if we use school devices inappropriately, memorizing a long phone number and then dialing it correctly, or talking to them in person, which might not always be feasible. Clearly, computers make it much easier to talk to people. Next, computers enable us to communicate with far - away friends or family. You could write an e - mail or have a chat with them. This has been extremely helpful to me because I often talk to one of my friends in [LOCATION1] and just recently sent an e - mail to my aunt. Without a doubt, computers make it convenient for us to communicate with other people, regardless of the distance. Secondly, every computer that I have come across is capable of playing some sort of game, whether it's through a disk or on a website. These games can teach us many useful skills. The first skill we can learn is typing. Just a few days ago, I was playing a game where you have [NUM1] seconds to type as many words as you can as fast as possible. If you make a mistake, one second is deducted from your time. Also, the game gets more challenging as you progress, starting from just three - letter words and moving on to five - letter words, and even seven - letter words and so on. Also, in a class at [CAPS4] called information processing, which is about computers, once we finished our assignments, we could play ""Type to Learn [NUM2]"". That is also a typing game. As you can see, some games can effectively teach us how to type. Another type of game requires strategic thinking to win. This teaches us to be prepared for almost anything. It also trains us to process what is around us and make quick decisions. In real - life situations, we [MONTH1] often only have a few seconds to react. Games like these are very useful in real - life scenarios. The last type of game is the tower defense game. This shows us teenagers how to think as if our lives depended on it. If we were to ever join the army and become some sort of captain, we would be able to organize our troops in the best possible manner, thanks to these tower defense games. These games also teach us to think and plan ahead. In these types of games, it costs money to buy upgrades and build towers. One has to decide whether to buy a weaker upgrade now or save for a stronger one later. Tower defense games help us make better decisions. Games [MONTH1] can be fun, but they also teach us valuable skills. In conclusion, computers have a wide range of positive impacts on our lives, from communication to skill - building through games."
489	491	1	3	"Dear, [CAPS1] Who wouldn't agree that more and more people are using computers? The issue is whether this is bad or good for you. My opinion on this matter is that I firmly believe computers can be bad when people are spending too much time on them. I hold this view because people are spending more time on computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. And that's my opinion on why people are spending too much time on computers. Clearly, you can see that people are spending too much time on computers and less time exercising. I can say this because I remember a time when my [relative] used to spend most of his time on the computer, and not for schoolwork either. He would stay on it for almost the whole day. He would bring food upstairs and just throw the plates on the floor while continuing to eat and then go to sleep without doing anything else. He would do this day after day. When I went over to his house, it would be dirty. After many attempts to get him to clean up, he still didn't. After he ate, when I asked him if he wanted to go for a walk, you can [PERSON1] the amount of calories he would have burned if he had gone. But he would say no, claiming that he could ""walk"" virtually on the computer. [CAPS3] One day, he became really overweight, and the doctor said he was obese. But do you think he cared? No. However, we would try to encourage him to exercise every day. Now, he has diabetes. We told him over and over again that spending too much time on computers is bad for you. Another reason why spending too much time on computers is bad is that you need to learn how to enjoy nature and get outside. I remember a time when my friend would stay in his house for days on end, sitting in front of the computer. When I would ask him to come outside, he would always say no. [CAPS3] One day, he had to come outside to get new computer software. When he opened the door, he got scared of the bright light and ran back inside. This clearly proves that spending too much time on computers is bad for you. It shows that we should get out, play, and get active. In conclusion, while computers have their uses, excessive use can have serious negative impacts on our physical and mental well - being, so we should find a balance."
490	492	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, I heard what you were saying about whether computers are a good or bad thing. I personally firmly believe that computers can be a bad thing. There are three main reasons for this. Firstly, for the amount of time that someone spends using a computer, they could be outside enjoying the nice weather, of course, if it is a nice day. I mean, you have to agree with me on this one. One of the main reasons why people are becoming obese is because of the over - use of technology, especially computers. People are sitting in front of their screens for hours on end, not getting enough physical activity. The second reason why computers are a bad thing is that some people are doing inappropriate things on them. If people are engaging in such inappropriate activities, why don't the makers of the computers block them? I really don't know. I mean, what kind of person would put those kinds of sites up in the first place? From what I have learned in computer class, computers can be used for more inappropriate things than I ever even imagined. The [CAPS1] and final reason why computer technology could be a bad thing is that some people have given away too much personal information on them and have gotten injured as a result. The internet world [MONTH1] may seem like fun and games until someone gets hurt, and that's what my mom always says. In conclusion, as you can probably see, I am really not a fan of excessive computer use. The reasons why I don't like it are that kids don't get enough exercise, kids are doing inappropriate things on it, and it has been used in ways that can lead to injury and sometimes even death. These are the reasons why the over - use of computers is a bad thing. So, remember these tips and take this article into consideration when using computers, and try to use them in a more responsible and balanced way.
491	493	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I believe that computers benefit society because it is a faster and easier way to do things such as communication. Email helps communicate with other people when you don't have time to talk on the phone at work or don't want to spend an hour on the phone. It is also faster than waiting for them to answer the phone, and their phone might die. Or they won't answer, and they need information fast. Another good thing about computers is looking up information. Like if you are going on a trip, you can look up hotels, find maps and plane tickets, and see what the place will look like. Or if you have a school project that you need to finish but you don't have time to read, you can go on the internet. If you have to look up a country or a president or an animal or find pictures, the internet has it all. Even for building projects like plastering a wall, buying a window, or planting, building a shed, you can find directions and the supplies you will need on the internet. Computers can even help someone at work, like an architect. They can use computers to make a detailed @NUM1 sketch of a building. Even for storing data, like at the doctor's office, they keep your @CAPS1 in a computer. Or the government keeps secret @CAPS1 in computers. There are still jobs like fixing computers and building computers. This is why I think computers are good for society because without computers, some people won't have a job, and everything will be harder and be limited to certain things like fast communication and work directions. In conclusion, computers play an indispensable role in modern society, bringing numerous conveniences and opportunities in various aspects of life.
492	494	1	3	"Dear Newspaper, the @CAPS1 generation has grown up with the complex technology called computers. I have learned over the years of using them that they aren't as helpful as they seem. They can cause an addiction and create numerous distractions. First of all, many doctors say that computers cause ""the new depression."" The internet is where most of this takes place though. For most teenagers, having a Facebook, MySpace, or Formspring is not unusual. I know from personal experiences that some people abuse these social networks and use them as another way to bully people. So therefore, not only do you get made fun of in school, but now, people can make fun of you in cyberspace. This is the main reason that people become socially depressed. There is almost no way to escape it, and all of their anxiety really starts to get to them. Addiction to computers is also a very negative impact. Many people go on the internet and are so fascinated that that is how they spend their free time. About @PERCENT1 of people say that they are addicted. From my @CAPS1 experience with using the internet, I know that there is always something that pulls you back in. You know that you are an addict when you spend more than an hour a day on the computer. Parents always say that it is a self - control issue, but many adults have the same problem. They have just started to be able to use the computers, so many times they go through a phase of addiction. Furthermore, this addiction problem would be totally gotten rid of if we stopped using computers. Finally, computers also create many distractions for students. When students sit down to type their papers, they also, many times, have another tab open at the same time. Therefore, they are getting barely any work done. Social networks only make this even worse. Constantly chatting with someone can cause you to lose track of time. Also, when you try to multitask with the internet, it causes grades to go down or not complete homework on time. All in all, this is an issue that can be easily avoided by eliminating computers. In conclusion, computers bring more negative impacts such as social depression, addiction, and distractions, and it is necessary to be cautious about their use."
493	495	1	3	"Dear Local newspaper, @CAPS1, did you know that every @NUM1 out of @NUM2 obese children spend @NUM3 or more hours a day on a computer? Computers may be fast and convenient, but because of computers, our country is one of the most obese countries in the world because of the ""technology"". Computers are bad for humans because they keep people from enjoying nature, keep people from spending quality time with their families, and they give people less time to exercise. First off, people can't enjoy nature. As you know, forests are being chopped down and pollution is destroying our world. People need to see how beautiful our world is if we really want to save it. Second, being on a computer makes you stay inside. People stay inside for at least 6 - @NUM2 hours a day depending on your job or if you are in school. Lastly, @CAPS2, computers take away from time that should be spent with friends or family. First, people will become anti - social. When being on the computer for a long time, people will forget how to interact with others. With millions of people like that, our society will soon become chaotic. @CAPS2, some people get so obsessed that their family may leave them. They will then fall into a depression. Last, computers are a waste of time, money, and effort. This shows why computers are bad. Lastly, being on a computer gives you less time to exercise and stay healthy. First of all, people will get fat. With less time to exercise, people can't burn the calories and will get obese. Then, without exercise, people's bodies will become more prone to disease and injury. Last but not least, people without healthcare won't be able to pay the medical bills and may become homeless. In conclusion, the negative effects of computers on people's physical and social well - being are obvious, and we should limit our computer use."
494	496	1	3	"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, @CAPS2, would you like it if your children stay on the computer all the time? I wouldn't. Children or even adults won't spend time with family, kids will be unhealthy, and lastly, they can get addicted to using the computer and computer language. Please keep reading to hear my ideas. To begin with, children or even adults won't spend as much time with their family. For example, @PERCENT2 of people will stay on the computer all day and won't even worry about their kids. I remember when I read on Facebook that a guy was so into a game he was playing that he didn't answer the phone when they told him his son got hit by a car. Now, newspaper @CAPS1, @CAPS2, would you want your son to go through what that man's son went through? I don't think so. Also, kids or adults will be unhealthy and not exercise. A study was shown that @PERCENT3 of people who use the internet don't exercise or work out. Out of that @PERCENT3, @PERCENT4 are suffering from obesity. My cousin is always on the computer, and the doctor told him to minimize how much time he's on it because he's obese. He weighs @NUM1 pounds due to being on the computer all the time. So tell me, newspaper @CAPS1, @CAPS2, would you want your kids to be obese? Lastly, nowadays, kids are ""obsessed"" with the computer and computer language. @PERCENT1 of people who use the computer use the computer language in school. And out of that @PERCENT1, they put internet on their phone so they can go on MySpace, Facebook, etc. Now, newspaper @CAPS1, what would happen if you wrote computer language in your article? Wouldn't you get fired? In conclusion, I hope you took my letter into consideration. Kids or adults will be unhealthy, kids will be too obsessed with the computer, and lastly, they won't spend time with family. In conclusion, the over - use of computers has serious negative impacts on family relationships and personal health, and we should address this issue promptly."
495	497	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I believe that computers are affecting the lives of many people. More and more people keep getting sucked into the amazing things that computers can do and forget all about the other more important things in life. People should be exercising and hanging out with friends and family. Computers don't even teach you that much if you really think about it. People don't even realize that computers can take away very important things in life. For instance, people aren't getting nearly as much exercise as they need. In this generation, more kids are overweight and obese than any other generation. People get so caught up in what they are doing on the computer that they forget to exercise each day, or at least every other day. Computers just add to the list of excuses not to do anything. People already spend way too much time watching TV. It rots your brain, and studies actually show that people are less aware and less connected to the world and the people around them. Computers are the same as TVs. You say that you're just going to be on for a minute, and then next thing you know, @NUM1 hours have already gone by. Computers may be exercising your brain, but they're not exercising you, and that's what really counts. Even if you were on the computer doing research for a school project, the computer still wouldn't help you. Most people don't have the time to run out to the library to get the books that they need, so they just resort to the computer. That isn't the smartest idea because half of the websites that you click on or go to don't even have the correct information. You might look at it and read it, and even if it sounds good to you, that doesn't mean that it's right. Next thing you know, you have a @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 on an assignment that you thought you aced. On top of getting false information, most people don't even know where to look to get the information that they're looking for. People just type what they are looking for into the Google search box and press enter. Then they just click on the first link that they see and use the information that is right on the page. Then all of these different windows are popping up, and you are far from where you were. People then just give up and start goofing off on the computer because they don't feel like trying to get back to that page. If people just went to the library and did research the old - fashioned way, then they would stop to notice all the things in life that they are missing out on. People should be focusing on family and friends rather than playing games on the computer. Sure, you can talk to people on the computer, but you can't bond with them or really see what they are feeling. It's better to invite them over and have some fun playing board games or just talking in person for a change. Even if you're spending time with your family or friends, you're probably thinking about the computer the whole time that they are there. So go out and do something for a change. A little fresh air wouldn't kill you. You should go to an amusement park, ride some rides with your cousins, do something that will keep your mind off the computer. In conclusion, computers, while having certain functions, have brought many negative impacts on people's physical health, learning, and social relationships. We should balance our use of computers and focus more on real - life experiences.
496	498	1	3	"To whom @CAPS5 @MONTH1 concern at @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, @CAPS4 @CAPS5's possible, imagine a world @CAPS7 computers. In such a world, drivers are bumping around and having great difficulty watching the wheel and the road simultaneously. Phone bills are sky - high because the whole world has no other efficient way of communicating. And students are home, worried sick that they don't have a proper book to study with. Computers affect all of these crucial areas of our lives. They teach hand - eye coordination, allow us to communicate with others in dozens of convenient ways, and let students learn and stay up - dated from the comfort of their very own home. Computers must stay a fundamental part of our every day. To begin, computers must remain in our community because they teach even young children hand - eye coordination. In a recent report, the @ORGANIZATION2 states that in the past five years, the number of driving students who pass on their first try has almost doubled. The video games, the computer mice, and even typing train the brain at a young age to work in sync with the body's arms, fingers and other appendages. ""@CAPS5's not only on the road where hand - eye counts,"" says @PERSON1, head of surgery at @ORGANIZATION1 hospital. ""@CAPS6 finding that younger doctors, ones that grew up on video and computer games, can perform robotics surgery with much more precision than our older attendings."" @CAPS7 the coordination we acquire from the computer, many jobs @MONTH1 be out of reach, too. When asked, @NUM1 out of @NUM2 managers of local business said they would prefer someone who could type, over someone who couldn't. So, though you @MONTH1 think computers teach no skills, they can provide coordination for the rest of a person's life. Secondly, computers should be part of homes because they allow people to communicate with others worldwide. In a @DATE1 poll, only @PERCENT1 of @NUM3 years old had e - pals, but a recent poll says that @PERCENT2 now have e - pals. Computers have opened up numerous ways to communicate like e - mail, @CAPS8, social networking sites, just to name a few! Parenting @CAPS9 says that parents prefer their teens to e - mail friends or use @CAPS8 as opposed to talk on the phone because @CAPS5 quiets the house, frees the phonelines for others and keeps phone bills low. My friend once only talked online for a month and her parents encouraged her because the phone bill decreased by a third. @CAPS5's clear that even though you @MONTH1 feel that computers take up time that could be spent with others, @CAPS5's actually a way to communicate with people everywhere. Finally, computers can help students learn. In today's schools, students depend on homework being posted online, and getting their books over the web. Once, my brother didn't take home his book - bag for a week, and got all the necessary materials online. He was grateful for the strain off his back. When asked, @PERCENT3 of @NUM4 graders say they use e - books at least twice a week. The internet also is a valuable research tool. @NUM5 out of @NUM2 high - schoolers say they use a book for research less than once a month. As you can see, the internet is a valuable learning tool. In conclusion, computers help us with coordination, communication and education. Computers have nothing but positive effects on people and society as a whole."
497	499	1	3	A lot of people use computers in present day. It allows family and friends to interact with each other in various ways, research different places and ideas thoroughly, and lets you type a document to make it look neat and professional. On the other hand, computer technology prevents people from being physically active, exploring the beautiful nature around us, and talking to family and friends in person. I want to explain to you how I feel about computers personally. I can honestly tell you that I love computers. I spend a lot of time on @CAPS3, because it lets me talk to friends I sometimes don't get to see in real life. I can even see how my cousin in @LOCATION1 is doing, which is really great. Computers also help me out with homework. For projects on a subject that I don't totally understand, I can just quickly hop on my laptop, search what I need, and @CAPS1!, I have my information right away. Then after that I can type up my report neatly and even pick out a couple of relevant pictures to print out. See? Computers are amazing! But I can understand the other side of the issue. Computers can be extremely time - consuming. I can admit that I've spent hours at a time on the computer. This has become a real problem. Experts say that people are starting to spend too much time on the computer and less time in the real world. A perfect example is my brother. He loves the @CAPS2. My mom will call him down for dinner and he'll be so engrossed in what he's doing that he will skip the meal. His friends will call him and he'll blow them off until he finishes his game. I agree that people should not spend so much time on the computer. You have probably read this and thought to yourself. Well? How does she feel about it? I can honestly say, I was supposed to choose one. But here's the thing. I like my laptop. I'm addicted to @CAPS3. But, I still play sports regularly, I talk to my family often, and I even like to take peaceful walks through the woods or on the beach. I'm neutral, like @CAPS4 from @CAPS5. Scientist say computers have positive effect on people. Some experts say they're concerned computers have a negative effect on people. @PERSON1 says they are both right. Computers are wonderful. They are one of the most growing technologies in our world. But we don't need to spend @CAPS6 of our time on them. I hope you understand my point on this issue.
498	500	1	3	Dear local news paper, I agree that technology has a positive effect on people. Just like other electronic devices, computers can help you with hand - eye coordination. Plus, some people, like teachers, want to get staff off the internet for their students to learn about people and places. Others just want to talk to other family or friend members in other towns, states, countries, or continents. Once you read this letter, then you will understand my reasoning. Firstly, these technology - enhanced dictionaries help you with hand - eye coordination. Before the computer, people had little success in writing quickly. They had to make short notes or use shorthand notations like w/ or. Nowadays, people write quicker and can write full words and sentences clearly. They no longer have the problem of not understanding what they wrote as they put it in full sentences. When you play computer games, it gives you even more refined hand - eye coordination. That was only the first few reasons. Secondly, teachers use computers to get a lot of school work done and get information about history and geography. Like an excellent online school book, it can get information on just about anything. It can look up when @PERSON1 was born, when the dinosaurs went extinct, and what the government is doing now. A computer can store what you learn too. It also has search engines that help you locate the information like @ORGANIZATION1 or @ORGANIZATION2. Statistics show that more than @PERCENT1 of people on earth use search engines to find something on the computer. On search engines, they have websites, pictures, movies, maps and more. That is why people use computers for research. Have you ever felt like you don't want to travel across the @LOCATION2 just to see your relative? Well, I have a solution to your problem. Computers have all sorts of features to connect to other people. The computer mostly uses e - mail. E - mail is like a letter, but put electronically. It also has @CAPS1. It is also like a letter. If you buy a special camera that connects to your computer, you can talk to them personally. You don't even have to travel to see your relatives in @LOCATION1. That is the last reason why computers have positive effects on people. Most people use computers effectively. They get hand - eye coordination. Also, they learn important facts about places and people. Plus they can talk to other people. See what I mean, computers are great and also a positive part of society.
499	501	1	3	"Dear, @ORGANIZATION1 you agree with what I'm trying to tell about people use the computer more than exercise? Well first, more and more people use computers but how does it benefit them. Secondly, they are spending too much time on their computer than exercising. Finally, they spend less and less time with their family and being active. First, more and more people use computers but how does that benefit them. Computers is just an addictive technology that makes you lazy and slow. Does using the computer @CAPS6 you with problems you're having with your family...@CAPS11! Well, I know this from experience. My mom is always on Facebook and I hate it. I figure she loves the computer more than @CAPS7. Do you want your kids to think that about you? As the days pass by, her time on the computer increases and @CAPS1 is sitting there, needing @CAPS6 on homework and I'm thinking @CAPS2 @CAPS3 YOU @CAPS4""@CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS1 @CAPS9. See, I was just thinking that cause @CAPS3 I said that it's a wrap for @CAPS7 but @CAPS1 just trying to say this computer won't benefit anyone @CAPS11 way. Second, I want to inform the @CAPS12 @CAPS13 paper is that people are spending more time on the computer than exercising. The obesity rate has been higher than it ever was. I believe by @PERCENT1! COME ON, this is @CAPS14! People come home, buy @CAPS15.K and other fast food @NUM1, go on the computer and eat. Over time, you get bigger and your appearance changes. You begin to look sloppy and nobody wants to be around you. You look back and regret doing what you did. Finally, you spend less and less time with your family. This causes you to grow apart from your family. Your kids pick up bad habits and do the opposite of what you want them to do. This tells @CAPS7 that the computer is just @CAPS11 good at all. In conclusion, I informed you on why I dislike computers. They @CAPS4'@CAPS5 benefit you. They make you lazy and keep you from your kids. So, do you, the local @CAPS13 paper, agree?"
500	502	1	3	Dear, local newspaper, Some people are starting to believe that the computers are affecting people @CAPS1. I'm also on that side because some people would stay on it all day, get addicted to it and want to do nothing all day. First reason why computers are affecting people is that some people would study on it all day. Some people, when they get home from school or work, they go right on the computer. They would stay on from @NUM1 to @NUM2 at night on the computer and repeat the same routine the next day. Another reason why computers are affecting people and making them addicted is because of all those friends online. Plus, when people think about the endless things on the computer. The final reason is that people just end up sitting in front of the computer for long hours. So those are the reasons why some people get addicted and don't want to do anything else. In conclusion, it's clear that computers, in some cases, have a negative impact on people's lives by causing addiction and lack of activity.
501	503	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, I believe that there is nothing wrong with being on the computer. The computer, in my thought, helps you learn about new technology - related stuff such as innovative new games designed to aid learning or useful new websites. Also, using the computer helps you talk to people you know, maybe those you haven't talked to in a while and whose phone numbers you don't have. I think that having a computer makes you smart because, I mean, you still do other stuff besides being on the computer all day. When you're not on it, you're either hanging out with friends or family, eating, sleeping, working out, or just doing something like homework. I believe using a computer is part of your healthy choices and you can learn a lot more than you really think you can. Using a computer and learning in school basically can teach you the same thing. A computer can be very healthy for your hands because when you're constantly moving your hands, it gives them more strength and can develop stronger muscles in your hands and lower arms. In conclusion, I believe that computers are healthy for you and don't take any time away from exercising, time with friends, family, sports, sleep, or eating. Computers are a hundred percent healthy for you. So, I think that people should keep using their computers but just make sure they fit everything else into their daily routine.
502	504	1	3	"Click, click, click, ""@CAPS1!"" @CAPS2 no, your computer froze. What are you going to do now? Computers have a positive effect on people because it teaches you information, you can socialize, and you can improve your skills. Without a computer, you'd be hopeless. Have you ever needed to do a research project, but don't have access to go to your local town library? No problem, as long as you have a computer at home. You could just sit down, type in a few things, and get all the information you need, and more! You can research just about anything on everything, because the computer will have it. Maybe you want to learn something new, but there aren't many books on it. Well, there you go, the computer is your friend. Many people assume that computers are just for entertainment, to play games and have fun in your free time. What they don't know is all the research engines like Google, Netrekker, @LOCATION1, etc., all loaded with knowledgeable information. Some people sit at home and read to become smarter, right? You can do this with a computer, which would probably even be more entertaining than a boring old book from the library. Have you ever thought to yourself ""the computer is just a way for people to get away from everyone else, and just have time to yourself?"" If you thought that way, you thought wrong! There are many ways to socialize with others through the computer such as e - mail, instant messaging, video chatting, etc. There are various ways to communicate with people through the computer. It is amazing technology because even if someone is in a different country, you can communicate with them at the click of a button. Ever heard of social networking? The name is self - explanatory. You socialize with people all across the world through a network. For example, there is MySpace, Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, etc. That is a fun way to connect with others like relatives you have never met or that live far away, friends, friends of friends, etc. You can even be really social and meet new people, as long as you're safe. You might be thinking at this point, that a computer is nothing more than research and socializing. Again, you thought wrong. Computers are a good way to help with your skills. For example, your hand - eye coordination. You look at the screen, type your words, look at the screen again, while clicking your mouse. That really improves your coordination. Also, your hand movement will get better. When you type, your fingers are moving all around the keyboard, creating hand muscles. Not just physical skills, but computers help with research skills. There are certain ways to research information effectively. This can help for future researching and school purposes. Without all this, wouldn't a person be missing something? Computers play a big part in everyone's lives, no matter what age they are. Computers definitely have a positive effect on people."
503	505	1	3	"Do you have a computer? I'll bet @PERCENT2 of you do! You might spend @NUM1 hours on the computer or even @NUM2 hours! Computers, in fact, have many down - sides to them. You could be so involved that you never go outside or get exercise. Also, sitting @NUM2 inches from the computer screen does not help your eyes. Lastly, the internet has very inappropriate websites that kids should not be seeing. Are you a kid who spends @NUM4 to @NUM2 hours at a time on the computer? Well, if you are, it's time to get off the spinning computer chair and out for some fresh air. Most kids spend most of their time on the computer @CAPS1 or on @CAPS2 or @CAPS3. It might be good for kids to interact with kids out of school, but some kids take it way too far. They never go outside and get any exercise. This is not good for a growing teen. They need to be up and active. So, limit the time you spend on the computer. Without a doubt, computers are very bad for your eyesight. Unlike @CAPS4 or video games you could play from a long distance away, a computer is used @NUM2 - 7 inches from the screen. Over time, your eyes will be so used to sitting @NUM2 inches from what you're reading that when you back up, you can hardly read at all. I knew a kid who played video games from about @NUM8 foot away for a long period of time each day. Today, unfortunately, the kid is blind. If that kid just knew the consequences of being that close to a @CAPS4 screen, he would have thought twice about it. Think twice about how close you sit from the computer. If I were to ask anyone of you what you could find on the internet, @PERCENT1 of you would say, ""anything."" Could there really be too much information? As a matter of fact, there is. You could be looking up a topic and something inappropriate, that has nothing to do with the topic, comes up. Kids don't need to, and shouldn't be watching or seeing these inappropriate sites. It's bad for kids, so stop it! After reading this essay, I hope you realized that computers are bad for you in various ways. As a matter of fact, it's physically, mentally, and socially. So, next time you're on a computer, don't look at the little things, but the big picture. By being more aware of these issues, you can make better decisions about your computer use."
504	506	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I'm writing because I've heard that some people think that computers are very useful and some people think they're no good because people spend too much time on them. I think that they are good to have because it's a way to keep in touch with friends, to research the things you're curious about without going to the library and having to look for the book you need. The computers are good to have because they can provide access to resources that are only available online and might not have a physical place to visit. I think it's good to have computers because when you're younger and have lost touch with friends, you might have been really close to them before. You can email each other or search for them online to try to get in contact with them. Also, if your family member is far away and you really can't talk on the phone because of the cost, then you can instant - message them so you can talk without having to spend money. I also think it's good because if there's any problem getting to the library, you can search it up online. Also, the computer is available all the time. The computer is good for doing homework. If you can't find the information in other sources, you can always rely on the computer. I also think it's good to have a computer if you need something but you can't afford it. Usually, if you go online, you can find it and buy it at a lower price, saving money. Also, some products that are available online aren't really sold in actual stores. I think that it's good to have computers but not be on them all the time. They're very helpful for friends, school, and for various other aspects of life. So, make sure to use them in a balanced way.
505	507	1	3	"Dear local newspaper, I strongly think that many people are not benefiting from using computers. There are so many more things people can do besides go on the computer. By using the computer, people are getting less exercise, not enjoying the nature, and not interacting with family or friends. By using the computer, people are not getting many benefits. As I mentioned, people who use computers too much are getting less exercise. By not exercising, this could really affect people's health. From recent studies by @ORGANIZATION1, @PERCENT1 of people who use computers too much are overweight. That is an extremely high statistic! For computers to affect this many people's lives is ridiculous. This many people really shouldn't be overweight. If these people aren't getting exercise, they could become addicted to the computer. If people are getting addicted to the computer, they might start to do bad things with the computer. They could publish bad things, go on ridiculous websites, and watch horrible things. The worst is probably watching bad things. It really puts a bad influence on everyone. Lastly, if you are on the computer too often, it could affect your eyes. If you are staring at the computer all day, your eyes might not be used to seeing everything else. It's hard for your eyes to transfer from seeing one thing to the next. Clearly, being on the computer is bad for health. Not enjoying nature is also something that people aren't benefiting from. As you might know, getting fresh air is good for everyone. It's always nice to smell the nice @DATE1 air after being in school all day. Many people don't do this because as soon as they get home, it's straight to the computer. These people are losing a lot of refreshment. I recently interviewed @PERSON1 and she told me that, ""many people don't get to see what's going on in the world because of computers."" They never take the time to look at anything that's going on around them. By keeping updated, you never know what topic might pop up in school and you could always benefit from checking on mother nature. Lastly, there are always animals that need help. Have you ever been in a situation where a stray dog needs a home? I have, and by helping these animals, you're saving a life. Many people don't have this opportunity because they are on the computer. Obviously, there are many people missing out on the beauty of nature. My last reason is that by being on the computer, you're not interacting with family or friends. In some cases, the person who is addicted to the computer is the parent. If you're a parent, you need to help your family with everyday chores. I know, they can be annoying to have to do, but you're helping your family and that's all you can do. Also, if you are a parent with children, they always need help. Some kids are younger and don't know how to find information for a project. But, that's why a parent is there. But, if the parent is on the computer, they aren't able to fulfill this requirement. I know that my brother is always looking for help because he is younger. Lastly, family parties and computers do not mix. From past experience, when family has come over, my brother has sat on the computer without even coming to say ""hello"" to anyone. I find this extremely rude. I just hope that family members don't get offended by this. Clearly, using the computers takes time away from family. In conclusion, people should have limited time on computers. By using computers, people don't get enough exercise, don't enjoy nature, and spend less time with family. So, it's important to strike a balance and make the most of real - life experiences. Thank you for reading my opinion."
506	508	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2, since electricity was invented, technology has developed at an incredibly rapid rate. Computers have gone from the size of a large room to sleek twelve - inch flat - screen monitors. In our modern - day society, computers are crucial tools that help organize files, conduct in - depth research, and enable pleasurable online networking. Computers teach hand - eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about far - off and exotic places, and allow people to socialize online. Without computers, wouldn't life be extremely difficult? While routinely doing our everyday computer tasks, seldom do we realize that we are writing, which frequently overworks nerves in the hand, causing tendonitis or arthritis. In contrast, typing on computers is quicker and less harmful to the hands. ""Hand - eye coordination helps improve balance and athleticism,"" said @PERSON1, the chief orthopedic surgeon of @ORGANIZATION1. Some people beg to differ and believe spending excessive time on the computer can contribute to a lack of physical activity. There are several portable computer devices, like a @CAPS3, that can be brought outside to use while walking. Ever since I was ten years old, I dreamed of going to @LOCATION1. Although I couldn't afford a plane ticket to @LOCATION1, I was able to use the internet to take virtual tours of the vibrant landscapes and ancient historic venues throughout the country. With the help of the internet, I was able to see a far - away place and experience the country as if I was actually there. @PERSON2, the creator of an online webcom called @ORGANIZATION2, created this computer system in order to allow people to connect all over the world by giving them the opportunity to see and speak to anyone they choose to. I frequently use this program to talk to my sister at college. Through this program, we can socialize as if she's at home and learn about her college experience. In conclusion, computers, despite their drawbacks, have opened up a world of possibilities for us, both in terms of knowledge acquisition and social connection."
507	509	1	3	Dear editor of local newspaper, @CAPS1, did you know that the average person spends three or more hours each day on the computer? The time taken up by staring at a blank screen could be spent helping the community, exercising, or simply having fun with others. All this valuable time is wasted because of computers. Spending large sums of time on a computer lessens your time with family and friends, causes health concerns, and, over time, @MONTH1, it can become addictive. First of all, computers @MONTH1 prevent you from spending quality time with your family and friends. Often, people come home from work or school just wanting to relax, so they seek comfort from the web. However, a more relaxing activity could be playing a board game with your family or going out for a coffee with your friends. After all, nobody lives forever, and your time with loved ones is precious and limited. This precious time is taken away by computer technology, which will last longer than any human and doesn't even provide real comfort when someone is down. For example, a teenager who is being bullied on the computer won't find solace there. If that teenager decided to spend time with her family or friends, they could probably share a few laughs and make everyone feel good. @CAPS2, time spent on the computer is time less spent with family and friends. Secondly, computers can be bad for your health. Staring at the screen strains the eyes, especially for people with trouble seeing. Typing a lot can also cause problems in the hands. Moreover, the more time you spend on the computer, the less time you have for physical activity. For example, if someone finds a website they really like, they will quite often want to visit it often, perhaps even multiple times a day! Along with websites, @CAPS3 games and social networks are also very popular and addictive. Computer addiction can lead to health problems (as talked about before) and withdrawal symptoms when you try to stop. It's very important that people stop spending a lot of time on the computer to make sure an addiction is prevented before it can even start. In conclusion, computer technology is hurting the human race and could be preventing greater things from happening in individuals' lives. There is less time to do things with your loved ones, more negative impacts on your health, and a rising number of computer addicts because of our modern technology. However, all these issues could be prevented if people simply spent less time on the computer.
508	510	1	3	Dear, @CAPS1. Computers do have positive effects, but the negative effects are much worse than the positive effects. @CAPS2 bullying happens every single day. Not only that, but when there is a computer around, kids aren't going to be out exercising. Those machines also damage the eyesight of humans. @CAPS2 bullying is the worst effect of computers. This form of bullying has happened to many, and we have lost many young lives to it. @CAPS2 bullying happens to @NUM1 out of every @NUM2 kids. @CAPS2 bullying is a disease, and it has to be stopped. Kids have committed suicide because of it. Not only that, but the lives of kids have been threatened and taken by it. Without computers, this disease would be stopped. Childhood obesity is a big problem in @LOCATION1, and part of the reason is because of computers. Kids shouldn't be on the computer; they should be outside running around, playing ball, or having fun with their friends. Computers are an addiction that kids can't easily break. Computers aren't just bad for kids; they're bad for adults too. Computer screens are harmful to the eyes if you stare at one for too long. Your sight is very important to living. Sight is, most of the time, your most important sense. Now you see why computers don't benefit society. Online, people are harassed to the extreme. The bright computer screens are harmful to the delicate human eyes. Kids should be exercising outside, not sitting at home on the computer. Everyone should pull the plug on their computers for good and never turn them back on. In conclusion, the negative impacts of computers on both children and adults are significant and far - reaching, and it's high time we took steps to reduce our dependence on them.
509	511	1	3	Dear Newspaper, I think a computer is not something bad for you. A computer can help you do many things. @CAPS1 could help you learn new skills, chat with friends from near and far, and @CAPS1 can entertain you in various ways. A computer can get you successful in life. @CAPS1 helps you learn a lot of things, such as computer engineering. Computer engineering is a job that pays you good money to fix computers and develop software. @CAPS1 is very challenging at first, but when you look @CAPS1 up on search websites, you'll find all your answers. Chatting is the number one thing kids, adults, and teenagers do. @CAPS1 is good and bad in a way. @CAPS1 is good because your phone bill won't be that high up, so you save minutes. @CAPS1 is bad because @CAPS1 can also ruin your eyes. Just remember, don't get too close to the screen. The computer is all about fun. You have millions of websites you can go on to have fun. For example, @CAPS2.com, @LOCATION1, and @CAPS3.com are the three main ones I go on. They are so much fun. They have tons of games suitable for kids and for adults too. I have proven my point that computers are not bad for you because they can help you learn, they lower your phone bill, and they are also very fun. Yes, I know they might take exercise time away, or hurt your eyes, but who cares? Just make up a time limit so you have time to exercise. Do not get too close to the screen because @CAPS1 can hurt your eyes. In conclusion, with proper usage and precautions, computers can be a valuable asset in our lives, offering both educational and entertainment benefits.
510	512	1	3	Dear People, Computers are not a really good thing because, @CAPS1, when you think about it, you never want to get off. You're always chatting or social networking. You can always find something to do on it, but you are wasting your time. You can do anything you want in real life, but I think too much time on the computer is a waste. @CAPS1, if you have kids, you would not spend enough time with them. You could help your kids with their homework, eat dinner with them, watch TV together, or just spend time relaxing. But some people, like ladies with kids, go online and never get off. You have to have time with your kids so they don't develop bad habits and so they don't stay out too late. You have to have time for yourself, clean the house, cook food for your husband, go out shopping, take your kids out to the mall, and just enjoy your life. Computers give nothing to us; they just make us lazy. @CAPS1, if you work, you have to think about your work and maybe hang out with your friends. Don't be on the computer for @NUM1 hours. You can do other stuff, like call your friends over or go shopping, or do cleaning in your house. Computers do not give us anything; it's just a waste of time. @CAPS1, if you social network... There is a good thing about computers. You can find anything you need, look at interesting stuff, and talk to family from far away. @CAPS1, if you use it in good ways, it's a good thing, but @CAPS1, if you never log off Facebook or other sites, it's not good to stay on. You can just go to the beach or go to the gym. You have lots of things to do other than going online and sitting for hours. Just try not to go online and just go out and go somewhere instead. In conclusion, while computers have their uses, we should not let them consume our lives and take away from the real - world experiences and relationships that are truly important.
511	513	1	3	Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, I am writing this letter on behalf of all the busy people in our country. We have come to the firm conclusion that we need, not just want, but truly need computers in our life. First, we need them to communicate with other people. Second, we need computers to conduct research for school and work. Lastly, us kids need computers to type essays, prompts, or papers for each class. Communication is of utmost importance in everyday life. For instance, I have a grandma that lives in @LOCATION1. I only get to see her once or twice a year in person. Throughout the entire year, I video chat with her through @CAPS3 computer because it is a whole lot easier than flying there. Without computers to video chat with @CAPS3 grandma, I would have no communication with her except those one or two times a year. Using a computer for communication is extremely helpful as it allows you to do so many things without traveling, like video chatting. Another reason why computers are a necessity in our lives is because they make research easier. Many kids nowadays have so much homework and spend a lot of time on the internet. For me myself, I find that the internet is a quick way to get the research. Plus, the research I have found is just as accurate as a book from a library. Computers are absolutely needed when kids have a heavy load of homework and projects that need to be researched. Think about the time when kids have to type up essays and prompts; it's unimaginable without a computer. Just in the @DATE1, I had to type an English essay and a fluently written paragraph. If I did not type it on a computer, it would have been a real hassle. Typing things on the computer is not just limited to school. @CAPS3 dad is frequently typing up reports and he is also typing up essays for his company. Many things nowadays, in order to be perfect, have to be written up on the computer or you will not get the result you were hoping for. In conclusion, computers are modern devices and you are going to have to live with it. Computers provide great communication with everyone around or even across the country. Also, they make research for school become a lot more efficient. Finally, computers type papers and essays up faster. Computers are a necessity for living.
512	514	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, People are using too much of their time on the computer. Instead of seeing the world through their own eyes, they are seeing it on videos or in images on the internet. It isn't natural for people to be internet fanatics. Earth is a beautiful planet; it has trees, mountains, seas, and humans. We created the internet, and people love it more than the rock they're standing on. The planet should be explored, not just surfed on the web. People should see the world before all natural land is covered by cities and factories. People use the internet way too much for plans, for business, for entertainment, for a social life! All of this has been done with ease before we could even turn on a light bulb. Life is a gift, and people spend it on an artificial life. For example, a game, @ORGANIZATION1, is one of the most popular and addictive games ever made. In this game, you create a character in a medieval planet while you battle monsters with other players. Some people think that this game is more fun than real life (personally, I think it is), but it is not their real life. It's just a fantasy for people to escape their meaningless lives. I write this in support of the hope that some day people will understand that this is real life. So, live it to the fullest.
513	515	1	3	Dear, local newspaper @CAPS1, it's true that technology is blinding everyone. More and more people are being sucked into electronics, and less people are caring about our planet. There are so many great things out there that could be put at risk. People often say that if you spend a lot of time on the computer, you would be able to find cures for the diseases out there. Those are just lies to stay lazy and waste their life on the computer. What is going to happen to all of the sports in the world? The players are going to get old and they will retire, and if no one is going to take their place, then the games would be canceled. I am a big fan of football, and I don't want to see it get canceled. Some of my friends are saying they are addicted to the computer, and I always hope they get out of that habit because what's going to happen when they get older? They are going to need a job. If they stay addicted, they won't want a job, and then they won't have money, they can't pay bills, and they would lose their house. Why do people say they could find cures for things by looking on the computer? We all know that's not true. They need to learn about them first, not by just looking on the computer. They may not want to, but they would have to look in books and do some heavy thinking before they can find the cures. I hope the ways of life change really fast because things can get really bad. If we do stop this way of life, then things could get better, and then our planet @CAPS3 will stay around longer, and we could make it a better place.
514	516	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I have recently heard about the debate on whether or not computers are used too often. While computers can be unhealthy, I think that generally they're helpful. They give us many opportunities that wouldn't exist without them. I'll describe more of what I mean in the following letter. First, I'll explain one of the advantages of computers: studying and school work. Computers can provide people with ways to research things. For students, it might be something like research for a project or essay. For adults, it could be information on starting a business. In both of those cases, computers were used to get information in a simpler way than perhaps visiting a library. I, personally, know of a website called @LOCATION1, where teachers can set up online tests for students. This would not be possible without computers. Computer online courses can even be taken, where a student can be taught through the internet, rather than in person. This can be an advantage to someone that can't always get to classes. I would also like to mention that computers provide a popular form of communication, such as e - mail and instant messaging. These methods of communication have become extremely popular recently, and I myself use both. I think for some people it can be bad because it prevents them from interacting with the real world. But in general, I think it's helpful. It also gives parents and teachers another way to communicate. These are just some of the many ways computers are helpful. Lastly, I'd just like to talk about how computers can benefit adults specifically. I know that many people pay their bills online. This is because if you think about it, isn't it a hassle to have to mail your bills every month? Computers greatly reduce that hassle. They can also make it easier to buy things you need, look for jobs, and many other things. Without computers, things like looking for jobs would require a lot more work than they do with them. These, again, are only some of the hundreds, if not thousands of ways in which computers are helpful. In conclusion, I think I've made my point very clear. Anything in moderation is okay. People that argue that computers are unhealthy speak of those who use computers too much. Generally, this is not the case. Usually, computers can do much more good than bad, and can make a person's life much easier. They help very much with education, and even that alone I think should be enough to convince you that computers are helpful. But as I said, I hope I made my point clear, and I hope you agree with me.
515	517	1	3	Dear local newspaper, Computers are fairly new, and everyone has one, everyone wants one! There are so many great things they can be used for. But are they getting used too much? As a student and a teenager, I know I am using mine way more than I need to. Sure, they are fun, and sure, they are very useful, but they are time - consuming. You might be doing work or chatting with a friend, but you're also just sitting there. Being on the computer takes away from lots of exercising or doing other activities. I am definitely not saying to stop using your computer totally because they are a great invention. But why sit on a computer chatting to a friend that lives right down the street, when you could be outside, playing a game of kickball or something fun. It would be a good idea just to chat online with the friends or family that live far from you, like in other states. Another time that I would say to use your computer is when doing some work, projects or homework. Or even if your job involves doing research. Computers are a great tool to use. But most people abuse that privilege and go on other websites that have nothing to do with their research. So if you need a computer for school or work, stay on task! That way you get what you need done. If you are a student or have a job, which is the common - day person, it's hard not to use the computer. There are so many helpful things to use it for. But that doesn't mean you need to be on it all day and night. Take about @NUM1 minutes to an hour of your day to talk to those people you never get to see, do your research. Then get up and enjoy nature. You don't need more than an hour. I strongly agree with the experts; people are spending way too much time on their computers. Use it to benefit you, and to help you, not to keep you from getting bored. Don't abuse the fact that you have internet access. If you need research, get that done and stay on task. Remember, an hour a day is more than enough! So get off your computers, go outside and stay fit.
516	518	1	3	Dear local newspaper, More and more people are using computers these days. Some people think computers are an improvement to society. Others are concerned that people spend too much time on computers and not enough time exercising and spending time with friends and family. I believe that computers can be a bad thing. I think this because some people spend an excessive amount of time on them. It's one of the leading causes of obesity, and it interferes with people's social lives. According to recent studies, about @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people spend most of their time on their computers. Many of these people spend their time on online games and socializing websites such as Facebook and MySpace. Others spend it shopping or learning. Some of the online games include World of Warcraft, RuneScape, and many other popular games. Many people who spend most of their time on the computer are or have become obese. According to @PERSON1, spending a lot of time on the computer is one of the main reasons for obesity. Many experts agree that computers are a leading cause of obesity. Between @DATE1 and @DATE2, more people have been using their computers more often, and the obesity rate has increased during that time as well. Most of the people who spend a lot of time on the computer don't interact with their friends and family much. This can lead to ruined relationships, loss of friends, and the risk of losing the closeness with family. Many experts, such as @PERSON2, say that a person can become depressed from not interacting with friends and family. He also says some of the people who become depressed start thinking of suicide. Spending too much time on the computer is a bad thing. Would you want to spend too much time on the computer even after hearing the cons of it? I firmly believe spending too much time on the computer is bad for everyone, and we should strive to find a better balance in our lives.
517	519	1	3	"Dear Readers, Computers have a large presence in the world today. Most people in the @LOCATION1 have at least one, and the number continues to grow. These computers are bad for people. They cost a significant amount of money, cause people to stop exercising and become unhealthy, and teach children that things come easy in life. Computers cost a lot of money. Between buying one, purchasing hardware and protection, and paying for maintenance, they are very expensive. Dr. @PERSON2, a well - known computer science expert, claims, ""The average computer costs @MONEY1. There is then hardware that needs to be bought and replaced, along with antivirus programs and other protection. Now we could be talking about @MONEY2 at the very least. With yearly maintenance costing about @MONEY3 per year, you can clearly see how expensive these machines really are."" @CAPS1 out of every ten computer owners in a recent survey stated that they had to service their computers within the last three months. That's a large amount of money going toward fixing computers. But computers don't just cause money problems; there are health issues too. Computers take a great deal of time away from people. When a computer is used, the user doesn't move around or exercise. Computers are making people unhealthy. The obesity number in the @LOCATION1 has skyrocketed, but it's not just food. Some experts are now attributing computer use to lack of exercise and, therefore, obesity. Dr. @DR1 @CAPS2 says, ""No matter what you're doing on a computer, be it games or education, you would be better off outside, moving around, getting exercise. A recent study shows that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 families who purchased a computer in the last year have halved their exercise and play time. There are health problems created by computers, but they also teach the next generation that things come very easily. Computers are an excellent source of knowledge, but that could be a problem. It is quite easy to find something out or research a topic using a computer. Before computers became popular, people had to work hard and look for information. Now that it is so easy, children often begin to think things come easily in life. @PERSON1, a pediatric psychologist, says, ""The mind of a child works in such a way that most things they encounter are absorbed and become normal. If a child becomes used to the ease of searching an item on a computer, he will expect all things to be equally simple. If they are not, he may become frustrated and not be able to do what is needed."" @NUM3 out of @NUM4 poll takers agree that finding information on the computer is quite easy. What are the children of the world being taught? Life is easy, a false statement. Computer use is a growing problem. It costs ridiculous amounts of money, causes health problems, and poisons the minds of children to believe that life is an easy thing. Computers are clearly bad for the people of the world as they take our money, our health, and distort the minds of our children."
518	520	1	3	Dear newspaper, I think computers are good for you because you can talk online, they teach hand - eye coordination, and there are other benefits too. One reason is that they help you with your hand - eye coordination. For example, they teach you how to look at the screen while typing. If we don't learn hand - eye coordination, we won't know how to do other tasks that require it. The second reason is that if you have a webcam, you can use it effectively. For example, when a family member is living in a different state, you can see their face and talk to them as if you were together in person. The last reason is searching the web. If you want to get travel tickets for a trip, looking online is the best way to get them. Researchers say @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people say getting online is the best way because you can see when the flights take off, when the next flights are available, and also when to come back home. All in all, I say that computers are a good thing because they help with your hand - eye coordination. If you have a webcam, you can see family members from different states, see their faces, and talk to them like you are having a face - to - face conversation. The last benefit is searching the web for travel tickets. If you want to go somewhere far away, go online and see when the flights depart and return because researchers say that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people say that getting online for travel tickets is the best way to get them. Ask yourself, would you like to have the web to search or not? It's clear that computers offer many useful features that enhance our lives.
519	521	1	3	I believe that people should enjoy nature more than computers. I say this because computers can sometimes become addicting. The people who are addicted will only be knowledgeable about stuff on the internet. People need exercise, and they will not get it by sitting in front of a computer all day. Computers are addicting. The people who spend most of their time on the computer are the ones who are addicted. When they get addicted, they will probably fail in school because they don't do their homework. Don't you hate it when you feel weak and tired? Well, that's how the people who sit at computers all day often feel. If people want to stay healthy, then they should get some exercise daily instead of sitting in front of a computer all day. A lot of people get annoyed when they don't know about things as they happen. Most of the people who experience this are the ones who are mostly on the computers. I say this because the people who are mostly on the computers only know about things when it is on the computer. That is why I strongly believe that people spend too much time on computers rather than enjoying nature. This is because, firstly, computers get addicting; secondly, people need exercise if they want to be and stay healthy; lastly, if people like to know things, relying only on the computer is not enough. We should step away from our computers and embrace the beauty and health benefits that nature has to offer.
520	522	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, I have heard that you guys are deciding whether or not computers have a negative or positive impact on society. In my opinion, I believe computers have a very negative impact not only on adults but mostly on students too. Computers in general can be distracting, very dangerous, and give people less time to exercise. Computers, in total, do not have a solely bad impact on people, but the negative aspects are significant. Some people say computers are not distracting, well, I say they are. Computers have various websites such as @CAPS1 and @CAPS2, which can distract people from studying or even doing their homework. @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 are websites where you can chat with friends and see people's pictures. These websites can be very disruptive when trying to do something important. For example, I am one of the biggest slackers when it comes to doing homework or studying. If I had to choose between doing homework or chatting on @CAPS1, I would choose @CAPS1. But if you actually think about it, are these websites benefiting anybody? Homework and studying can actually benefit you in doing better in your studies and further on in your life. In total, I believe computers are a big distraction. When people go on the computer, they often do so without worrying much. They don't know the danger behind it. These computers are home to people called online predators. Online predators sit on the computers basically all day trying to harm others. One website in specific that I heard was very harmful is MySpace. This website is even more dangerous than @CAPS1 or @CAPS2. MySpace is like @CAPS1 in a way but much more dangerous. For instance, my mom told me that one of her friend's daughters had a MySpace and became friends with a guy she didn't know. Of course, she didn't worry because according to her, he seemed a nice guy, so she gave him her number. Good thing her mom saw it; otherwise, something bad would have happened. He ended up being an online predator. Lastly, computers can make people unhealthy. People who stare at computers non - stop don't exercise. For example, they don't play sports such as soccer, volleyball, and tennis. This is very unhealthy for people in our society because they can become obese and unhealthy. This is why computers can make you not exercise. In conclusion, computers can have a very negative effect on people. They can be very distracting, dangerous, and lead to a lack of exercise and subsequent health problems. It's clear that while computers have some useful aspects, we need to be very cautious about their use to avoid these negative impacts.
521	523	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, I - like many other people my age, who are often drawn to the digital realm - love to sit in front of a computer and explore its wonders. But that does not mean that I spend my whole life on it like others. So I can clearly see what too much computer time can do. It has made kids my age more aggressive, have various health problems, and care even less about the environment. More and more kids are falling into those traps. Too much computer time can make even the nicest person extremely aggressive. I know from past experience that when you bother people when they are engrossed in their computer obsession, they will snap at you, yell loudly, or even start swearing at you, or maybe get physically violent. If someone stays up too late on the computer, the next day could mean that they're cranky from the lack of sleep. This aggression @MONTH1 cause others to get aggressive in response, which @MONTH1 lead to a verbal or physical fight, which (hopefully) nobody wants. Another issue too much computer time can cause, @CAPS1, are even more health issues. Staying inside all day will keep people from getting the necessary amount of vitamin @CAPS3 they need which is a vital nutritious vitamin that comes from the sun itself. Not getting enough vitamin @CAPS3 throughout a person's childhood can result in getting an illness called @CAPS5 later in life, which never truly goes away and hinders people from doing the things they love. Too much computer time also means people aren't getting enough exercise, and with the way we eat now, those two things can add up to making a person obese. Others who do not want to get the proper amount of exercise or eat right and at the same time do not want to become obese, @MONTH1 to anorexia. Neither of these weight problems are very good for you, proving my point about the health issues of too much computer time. The issue I will have you read @CAPS1, is how people will become even less caring of the environment. Some of the big technology companies side-step around environmental protection laws to find cheaper ways to make their products and the thing is, no one cares! No one cares so long as they get their newer and better piece of technology. Everyone will just keep protecting these companies to get what they want to satisfy the craving for more computers. Now, I'm not saying that having any computer time is bad. I'm just trying to prove that too much is bad for you. That with too much computer time, people can become more aggressive, have health issues, and become even less caring of the environment. Therefore I urge you @CAPS1 to write an article in the newspaper about the effects of too much computer time, to make it known to everyone in the city. It might help us make a better future by raising awareness and encouraging people to use computers more moderately.
522	524	1	3	@ORGANIZATION1, @DATE1, people are using computers more often these days. Some people do not agree that computers are good. I think computers are good though. They help you learn more, they are like @CAPS1 @CAPS2 (a vast and accessible knowledge source) and when you're bored you can go on the internet. People nowadays are becoming smarter and smarter. One of the main causes is the internet. The internet is like a big, never - ending book. It holds tons of great information on almost every topic imaginable. There's probably information on the internet that probably no one knows, until they read it. Plus the fact that the internet is quick & easy to access. Also, the internet keeps you up to date on things going on in the world, from local news to international events. Without the internet, we would be nowhere. Surveys show that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 students use the internet for information or projects for school. Also, on the internet you can buy things you can't buy in stores, like rare collectibles or unique handmade items. Going to the library is a pain. You have to pay for the gas plus you have to drag yourself out of the house to get in the car to go to the library. What if you don't have a library near you? Then what will you do? You could go on the internet. Plus, with @CAPS2, people could look for a book all day, not find it and find out that someone else has it. What a pain. There are some people like college people, who don't have cars. So how are they supposed to get to the library? Studies show that @PERCENT1 of @CAPS3 don't have cars. When you get bored, what do you do? Eat? Sleep? Lay on the floor staring at the ceiling? No. You go on the computer. The internet has all sorts of fun games and interesting websites. It also helps you make new friends from different parts of the world. The internet is also a good way to stay in contact with close friends or relatives who may live far away. Also, if you are a photographer, then you can sell & share your photographs online. You can also advertise your company or business effectively. @NUM3 out @NUM4 @CAPS3 either have no backyard or have nothing better to do. I think that the internet is great. You can learn all sorts of information, you don't have to go to a library and you can play games when you get bored. Isn't the internet truly a wonderful tool for modern life?
523	525	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, I feel that computers are very beneficial to our society. They are very helpful when it comes to homework, you can talk to people online and you can make plans without even leaving your house. First of all, computers help us a great deal with homework. Many kids are initially adamant about it, but with the help of a computer, they will be more willing to get it done. For example, when I have a difficult science or social studies assignment, I can research it thoroughly on the computer. Also, @CAPS1 I have an exam just coming up and I left my textbook at school, I can just study on my computer using various online resources. So, as a result, computers are very helpful with homework and studying. Secondly, computers make it very easy to communicate with others. For example, talking on the phone costs money, and why would you spend money when you could text, chat, or have a voice call for free? Also, many people use e - mail because it's very easy and you can send important documents to others. Let's say, that I had a work document on yearly company profits and I needed to get it to my boss. No problem, I just attach it to an email and I don't have to drive anywhere. Finally, my last point, computers make it very easy to make plans or connections. I know that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people love to travel, but you need plane tickets. Just go to the website and do it online. It's fast, easy and safe. Also, @CAPS1 you needed to make reservations for something, like a hotel, you just have to go online, pick a date and when you arrive your room will be ready. I can see how this would be very beneficial to traveling business men who might need a room for the night. In conclusion, computers play a huge role in the world because they can help with homework, it's easy to communicate, and you can make reservations without even leaving your house. And the best part about them is that they are fun and easy to use, making our lives more convenient and efficient.
524	526	1	3	Dear Local newspaper, @CAPS1 to this article more and more people use computers, and the people who support advances in technology believe computers have a positive effect on people. I disagree on your part. I believe that computers can ruin your life, and make you go blind. Firstly, computers can ruin your life if you stay on them for too long. Computers are a little device that can almost let you do anything on it. The computer can let you look up where your friends live, you can play tons of exciting games etc. I remember this one time when I was watching channel @NUM1 news and a @NUM2 - year - old kid fainted from playing a computer game for too long. See, I told you that they can ruin your life all it takes is a couple of hours to get hooked on the computer. Secondly, computers can make you go blind because the screen of the computer is too close. The computer is built so you can do things on it, but unfortunately the screen was set too close so when you have to see something on your computer you literally have to stick your face on top of the screen. I remember one time when my dad bought a @ORGANIZATION1, my dad was on that computer all day and when he got off it his eyes were blood - shot, the month after that he got glasses. See, I told you sticking your face too close to a computer screen can hurt your eyes. In conclusion, the computer can ruin your life and can make you go blind. The computer is bad for you, so you should stop and think about what I wrote in this persuasive letter and take steps to limit your computer usage for the sake of your well - being.
525	527	1	3	@DATE1 @CAPS1 The @CAPS2, I believe that computers in today's society have a positive affect on people. I believe this because if people use it for education purposes, to chat, email, or to research it does make a significant difference in people's lives. If you use the computer for educational purposes like games, you could really learn a lot. For example, I help my sister with her multiplication on a fun math game we have. Also, I learned to type with type to learn @CAPS3 on my desktop computer at home. Many other people use it for these reasons too. They also might use it for typing a project or making a professional - looking presentation. Others might only use it for chat and e - mail. These things can still benefit our society though. Using the computer for chat, such as, on popular platforms like facebook, myspace, and twitter can also benefit our society today. These websites benefit us because we can meet new people from different backgrounds, catch up with old friends we haven't seen in a long time, or even talk with current friends on a regular basis. Also on @ORGANIZATION2, @ORGANIZATION1, or @ORGANIZATION3 we can e - mail people instead of instant messaging them. For example, if you have something really big to say to someone you might want to write it in an email. If you just want to say hello you could use facebook, myspace, or twitter if you have an account. Computers do benefit our society today. All of the reasons in my letter support my position on whether or not computers benefit our society, clearly showing that computers are an invaluable asset in modern life.
526	528	1	3	Dear newspaper editor, I think computers are a benefit to everyone. My first reason why I think computers are a benefit is because if you don't know about something and you want to learn more about it, you can just go on the computer and do some thorough research on it. The best part is you can research anything, even if it's like a million miles away. The internet has information on anything and everything, from ancient history to the latest scientific discoveries. My second reason why is because if you have a webcam and some of your relatives live very far away, you can see them whenever you want, having face - to - face conversations just like they're in the same room. It's not just webcam either; you can also go on Facebook and other similar sites to talk to family and friends and see pictures of one another, sharing life's moments easily. My last and final reason is that you can do almost anything on a computer. There's software on them to write, do projects, and plan things accurately. Plus, most of the modern - day society uses computers for stores and businesses to keep track of things precisely. Well, that's why I think computers benefit us. I've told you why I thought they did and how, and it's clear that computers have become an indispensable part of our lives.
527	529	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I agree that the effects computers have on people can be very negative to people, but they should realize what they are doing to themselves and what they can get themselves into. Starting with, people are on the computers more than they are using the phone. This has a real impact on people sitting around on their computers and not cleaning their homes and taking proper care of their households; but instead, they are absorbed in their laptops or desktops. Secondly, parents and children spend most of their time on websites to talk with their friends, for example, using webcam and AIM. This affects people because they could go on the phone or meet them up some place in person. In conclusion, people, but mostly teenagers and a little bit of adults up to ages @NUM1 to @NUM2, like to go on different websites such as myspace.com, facebook.com, formspring.com, and more. This can start rumors and can end up in bad or good situations, which can be a horrifying effect on these people that do this very often. Some people, and mostly teens, can cause a never - ending ""he say she say"" situation. This is why people should log off immediately. Most importantly, people should become aware of themselves or people they might know, knowing that this can put them into negative situations @MONTH1 and put them in harm's way. We all need to be more cautious and limit our computer use to avoid these negative consequences."
528	530	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I have a very strong belief that children and adults are spending far too much time on the computer. Please consider the following: computers have a negative effect on people. Furthermore, @PERCENT1 of parents agree with experts that @CAPS3 spend way too much time on the computer but less time with friends. When I was little, I rarely ever went on the computer. But now, my parents have to remind me to leave the computer multiple times. Ever since teens have joined @CAPS7, myspace, and twitter, they are addicted to it and can't stop going on it to check what their friends are posting. Psychologist @PERSON2 states, ""@CAPS3 who are on the internet for multiple hours a day can't concentrate in school because their minds are on what they're going to post on @CAPS11 when they get home."" Wake up, eat, check @CAPS7, go to school, get home, check @CAPS7. This is the daily routine of a teenager in the @DATE1. Secondly, going on the computer constantly can cause health problems. @NUM1 percent of teens who non - stop use the computer have to wear glasses or contacts because of overusing the computer. When I use the computer without a break for multiple hours, I get a terrible headache because my eyes can't take any more of it. ""When @CAPS3 stay up late on the computer, they are fatigued the next morning,"" says pediatrician @PERSON1. Middle schoolers are very much the most popular users of the internet, and they are mostly very tired and sleepy at school. People who stay up very late have very black saggy lines under their eyes, so if you see a person like that, they are an over - user of the internet. Most @CAPS3 who are very social also never get to go outside when using the internet all the time. Lastly, children are missing out on the beauty of nature. @CAPS3 who don't get enough exercise can't think clearly because there is no oxygen in their brains. Obesity is beginning to take a toll on children who only sit inside and eat junk food. Children who rarely go outside and exercise become overweight or obese. @PERCENT2 of children in Stratford almost never go outside and exercise. As I was in elementary school, we had recess, but now in middle school, we never have it. The only chance we have to go outside is in the @DATE3 and in the @DATE2 when it's warm. We really need to limit our computer time for the sake of our health and well - being."
529	531	1	3	Dear The @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1's opinion on computers may be the same as others or different. I believe that computers help our society. They give us more in - depth knowledge on whatever subject we want, whether it's art history or advanced mathematics. It helps us connect to family in far - away places easily and they even give us a better understanding of any place we can't see for ourselves, providing detailed virtual tours. Some people feel that computers distract kids so they're never spending time with family. But what if one of your family members is on the other side of the world? @CAPS1's cousin lives in @LOCATION2 and the only way I can ever talk to him is through a computer, having real - time conversations. What if you're a little kid and your mom or dad go on business trips far away for a very long time? You would use a computer to talk to them, wouldn't you? Not everyone in your family is always around you and when someone is far away, a computer is the ideal way to connect. Because of computers, kids don't exercise. What if your exercise happened to be hiking? You can get exercise and can enjoy the scenery. With a computer, you can explore anywhere without even leaving your doorstep. Say you're just a young kid and you're always eager to see @LOCATION1 but you can never go there. What would you do? You would hop on a computer and check it out in high - definition. You can explore any place you want with the click of a button. In school, you learn about very historic people who have been dead for thousands of years. How would you learn more about them if they're gone? A computer has detailed information about anyone you chance upon. You may not be exercising but you're expanding your knowledge, aren't you? Yes, you could go down to a library and take out a book on the person. However, what if the book doesn't have the information you are looking for? You could end up reading for hours when the certain information you want wasn't even there. A computer gives you anything you need in a matter of seconds. Why waste your time? Now is the time where our technology advances. Why waste your time on something when you've got what you need right at your fingertips? So what are you waiting for? Go learn what you want right now! Haven't seen your cousin in a long time? Start up your computer and get talking. The time is now, and computers offer us a world of opportunities.
530	532	1	3	Dear Local newspaper editor, I think computers benefit us in a good way. Whether computers are helping kids with in - depth research for homework, projects, and essays or building online stocks to help make businesses grow steadily, computers are now a beneficial way of life. We can see what happens on the other side of the world in real - time and learn about new things every single day. What I think people are focusing on is what they think computers are doing to people, but they're really not focusing on how it helps us in so many ways. One way that people say computers affect people is that we don't exercise instead of being attached to our computers. I doubt computers do this because not everyone likes or wants to exercise. And why would computers stop people from doing that? It's people's choice, the computer doesn't force them to stay in the house. And computers are a great way for you to catch up with friends and family, having long and meaningful conversations through online chatting and even sharing photos of special moments. And I highly doubt people stop seeing their families because of computers; it just doesn't make any sense. People who are against computers are imagining people being stuck in chairs or being controlled by them, which is just silly. If people actually stopped to take the time and think, there's a chance that they would see how computers have helped us grow as a nation. And how much they've used computers and that it really helped them rather than just searching through books for a ton of information. As years have gone by, I can see that a ton of things are run by computers and that a lot of people use them. And it has impacted our country, in my opinion, in a good way. And if it wasn't for computers, who knows how our nation would be running. And if computers have made such a positive impact on our country already, I can only imagine the years to come as computers become bigger and better. So as you have read, I've given my reasons as to how I think computers impact our lives. And how I think in the years to come, it will impact our lives even more significantly. Now I can't force you to be for, or against computers, but whatever your opinion is, just think of a world without computers, especially if you grew up with them. It's clear that computers have become an essential part of our progress and future.
531	533	1	3	In my opinion, having a computer is really good to have. Therefore, I firmly think having computers are an excellent thing because nowadays, computers are extremely useful. Also, a large number of people are using them for their businesses. My three reasons are to look up information, do homework, and talk to friends and family online. My first reason is to look up information on the computer. If you have three reports to do, it will be best to use a computer to look up the information because it will be much easier and faster to do. For example, using the internet will be faster than looking for it in a book. For that, it will take at least 10 to 15 minutes for the internet; if you were to look for it in a book, it can take at least 20 to 30 minutes. My second reason is that you could talk to your friends and family online. Like if one of your relatives lives long - distance, say in another country like @LOCATION2, then you can talk to them on your telephone or cellphone, but the bill will be outrageous. Or if you talk to your friends online, you can ask them a question on homework or what the homework is. Like if you have a friend who moved to @LOCATION1, you can go online and talk to them. My third reason is that you can even do your homework on the computer. If you have a history assignment, you can go on a website for an online book instead of bringing a heavy book to school and back home. Also, it will be easier as you would not have to worry about bringing your history book back home. For example, it will take less time using the internet than using a book. It will take like 5 to 15 minutes using the computer, while using the book can take 15 to 40 minutes. In my conclusion, using a computer is very useful and very important nowadays. My three reasons are to look up information, do homework, and talk online to friends and family. Even though some people don't like computers or don't like to use them, the benefits far outweigh any drawbacks.
532	534	1	3	Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, Even though there are indeed good effects of computers on people, there are also numerous bad effects. Some of the major bad effects of computers on people are lack of exercise, the risk of talking to strangers, and a lack of interaction with family and friends. One of the most prominent effects of computers on people is the lack of exercise. Right now, many people in the @LOCATION1 are obese because of unhealthy eating habits and no exercise. One of the problems is that these people simply don't get off their computers and couches to go outside. These individuals choose to stay indoors and just do nothing except watch TV and go on the computer. So, computers have a huge impact on how these people live their lives. Another problem caused by computers is kids talking to strangers. Most kids in the @LOCATION1 are members of a social network like @CAPS3 or @CAPS4. There are ill - intentioned people out there who go on these websites on their computers and pretend to be teens. This can get many kids in serious trouble if they are not careful on these websites. Since most people access these websites from their computers, it's yet another bad effect of computers on people. Another bad effect is the lack of interaction with family or friends. When people are on computers, they focus solely on what's on the screen and not about their surroundings. Being on the computer stops many people from having meaningful interactions with their family and friends. Not interacting with anyone causes their social skills to deteriorate since they are always glued to the computer. This can become a serious problem if a person becomes overly addicted to the computer. This can cause many communication problems within the family, making the family bond weaker. In conclusion, even though there are good effects of computers on people, there are also many bad effects which can cause serious problems. Computers can lead to tragedies in families and/or in that person's life, and we should be cautious about our computer usage.
533	535	1	3	Dear, local Newspaper, I hear that you think computers have an effect on people. Well, I completely disagree with what you say. I think computers will greatly help us learn and do things much faster. Having computers helps the community gain more knowledge. My first reason I think we should keep computers is that it helps people develop hand - eye coordination for jobs. With the skill of typing, you can work at places like the city of @LOCATION1 where they type every day and work diligently. They also learn more and more facts about various societies. Without knowing how to type, you probably won't get any top - class jobs. My second reason for saying that computers are helpful is that it helps your children perform better in school by learning how to type for high school, and learning math, science, social studies, and language arts. Computers also help kids at a young age do math and other activities with their favorite characters, like Dora, @ORGANIZATION1, Elmo, and others. So, learning on a computer can help you learn and have fun at the same time, which I know your parents would appreciate. Even newborn babies can start learning basic skills like how to read, write, and do math, and they could grow up and potentially be a great leader one day. My third reason is that it helps send things all over the world. Without computers, we would have to do it the old - fashioned way, which is time - consuming and inefficient. Also, with computers, you can talk to family members that live far away from you (in another state or country) and you haven't seen them in a long time. Or you can chat with old school friends from back in the day. You can also buy things off the computer. In my conclusion, I've told you that computers can have a positive effect on people by showing that your child can learn better, and parents can also benefit. I've also added that it helps you get jobs and improves your hand - eye coordination in school and outside. So, computers truly help the community thrive.
534	536	1	3	@ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 computers are an integral part of our advanced technology. They have a highly positive effect on people because computers make almost every task easier. They can teach people things through tutorial or educational websites and @CAPS2 @CAPS3, and they keep people entertained during their spare time. Computers are becoming more and more advanced every single day, and that's precisely why I think people are so addicted to them. Yet, they do have positive impacts. Computers make things a great deal easier for a large number of people. If you really think about it, a lot of things that we use daily, such as well - written books, fashionable clothing, and the music on the radio would not exist if it weren't for computers. We would have to painstakingly hand - write those books and hand - sew our clothes. As for the music, we would just stomp our feet and clap our hands to make simple rhythms. If ancient Egyptians had computers, they would have built millions of @CAPS4 with greater precision. Our computers have programs like Microsoft to help me neatly complete a major school assignment. Computers have positive effects in this way. Every day after I finish my homework and I go on the computer, most adults think that all us teenagers do on the computers are use Facebook and MySpace. I do admit that I go on those websites, but if I notice that my grades are not in the best condition, I go on websites that can help me understand what I'm not grasping. Ninety percent of the time when I do that, my grades go up and I get a satisfying grade. I have also taught my little cousins how to add and subtract using the computer when they were in pre - school. Computers are helping schools teach students more effectively. Besides education, computers can also keep us entertained with games such as virtual solitaire. When I go on the computer, I might need to research something that I have an interest in. Maybe I might want to know when @LOCATION1 was invented or if the universe ever stops expanding. Maybe I don't want to watch @CAPS5 all day to keep me entertained. Computers will save me from boredom. When I use a computer, I am not addicted. In fact, it has a very positive effect on me. Yes, I might stay up countless hours talking to my friends on Facebook, but to me, that's a part of being a kid. The next day I might learn something in school that I want to search deeper into. That is what the computer is for. Without computers, we would not have some of the knowledge we have @CAPS1. In my opinion, their effect is the most positive effect on people ever.
535	537	1	3	"Dear Readers' @ORGANIZATION1, the Local Newspaper, I am almost certain you interact with a computer daily. You use computers to write detailed reports, play exciting games, look at beautiful pictures, and print out important work. There are dozens of practical uses for computers, but nowadays, many people, especially children, are using computers excessively. This unnecessary usage of computers can cause obesity, expose children to inappropriate things, and destroy family time. Readers, hear my argument, and by the end of the paper, you will surely agree with me that computers are detrimental to society. Have you ever made a @ORGANIZATION2 @CAPS1's @CAPS2 to lose weight? It's not uncommon for one to set such a goal. According to the @ORGANIZATION2, @PERCENT1 of adults make their @ORGANIZATION2 @CAPS1's @CAPS2 to get in shape, exercise more, or just lose weight. We've all seen the commercials on @CAPS4 that encourage you to ""@CAPS5 @CAPS6!"" promising that you too can ""lose weight in just one week""! There are also plenty of entrepreneurs out there that want to convince you to buy their exercise product, claiming that you can develop outrageously large muscles in ""no time at all"". But do all these diets and exercise plans really work? According to a study done by the @ORGANIZATION1, the largest cause of obesity is actually computers! The students at @LOCATION1 had one group of people try a regular commercial diet plan and another group of people do exactly what they've been doing... Except avoid their computers. They found that the group who abstained from computer use lost nearly @PERCENT2 more weight on average than the group on the commercial diet! Nothing is causing obesity in @LOCATION2 more than computers. A familiar day for an average child in @LOCATION2 goes like this: go to school, come home on the bus, use the computer, eat dinner, do homework, go to bed. Unfortunately, this happens 5 days a week, and the computer time is eating up none other than the exercise time. Readers, please, try avoiding your computers for just one week, and you can forget those ineffective commercial diets. Another negative aspect of computers is that it not only affects an individual but possibly an entire family! Many children can go an entire day without sitting down and having a proper conversation with their parents. My friend @PERSON1 often comes home from school and goes straight up to his room to use his laptop without even saying hello to his parents. Computers have become nearly an addiction to most teenagers. @PERCENT3 of teens in @LOCATION2 say they use computers daily, and @PERCENT4 say they have trouble communicating with their parents. There is a direct connection between the lack of communication at home for teens and computer usage. Teens become engrossed in their virtual social lives and become attached to their computers. What they don't notice is that they're totally forgetting about their families! I know I've made the mistake of becoming too attached to social networking and forgetting about my family, but luckily I have a stable family environment. Some teens don't have that luxury. Computers have the ability to destroy parent - child relationships; don't let that happen to you. Your children are, without a doubt, the ones affected by this technical revolution the most. From the time they were infants, your children probably had a keyboard at their fingertips. Do parents ever realize what they're getting their children into when they teach them how to use a computer? Children as young as 3 or 4 years old are exposed to pornographic, violent, and vulgar pictures on the web on supposed ""safe sites"". Do you even realize who your child's talking to on the computer? With all the chats and emails flying around, you could be talking to a complete stranger without even knowing. An enormous part of who your child becomes and the values they hold is a product of what they were exposed to at a young age. Bring a computer into your kindergartener's life, and you can probably guess what kind of values they'll grow up with. No matter how much you think or believe in the safety of the computer, you cannot argue with the fact that computers expose children to adult content very early in their lives. So, do you look at your computer differently now? Faced with the concerns of lack of exercise, separation of families, and inappropriate content for children, do you really want your children, or even you for that matter, using a computer daily? Think ahead 10 years from now. Will you say ""I wish I used my computer more"" or ""I wish I spent more time with my family""? In the end, the choice is really up to you."
536	538	1	3	Do you think computers benefit us? I think they clearly do. There are numerous ways computers benefit us, and these far outweigh the few drawbacks. For instance, kids in school now have the option to use online textbooks. This not only saves them from the hassle of carrying heavy loads but also provides access to a wealth of updated information. Also, a large number of companies have well - designed websites. These sites allow us to understand their services, reputation, and areas of expertise before we choose them for a job. We also rely on computers to look up directions to places we want to go, ensuring that we don't get lost during our travels. School kids benefit from computers significantly. Instead of lugging home tons of thick and heavy textbooks, they can simply access the online versions. Imagine having to carry @NUM1 really heavy books; it would be a back - breaking task. I definitely prefer going on the computer to carrying those heavy books home. When looking for a home decorator, the computer is an invaluable tool. We can visit their websites to view examples of their previous work. This helps us avoid the disappointment and financial loss of hiring an unskilled decorator and ending up with a room we don't like. Also, if you're in search of a job, you can visit the company's website on the computer. You can check job openings, company culture, and even apply for an interview. This saves us the time and effort of physically going to the place without prior knowledge. I also use the computer to find the best routes to my destinations. It's much more convenient than starting to drive blindly and getting lost. Although GPS devices are available, they are often more expensive compared to the mapping services on a computer. In conclusion, computers benefit us in countless ways, such as using online textbooks, looking up websites, and searching for addresses. That's why I firmly believe that computers are an essential part of our lives.
537	539	1	3	Dear newstimes, I truly believe that computers are an excellent invention because they enable us to communicate with people online, offer various ways to assist others, and help people manage their finances and bills. First of all, computers allow seamless communication with others. Did you know that @PERCENT1 of people in the United States have family members living in different states and rarely get to see them in person? This is where computers prove to be extremely useful. With the video chat feature, if you have a webcam, you can have face - to - face conversations with people from different parts of the world. You can see each other clearly through the camera, making the interaction more personal. Additionally, there is @CAPS1, a platform that lets you chat with people whenever they are online. My mom got a @CAPS1 account and has now reconnected with friends she hasn't seen since high school. She is overjoyed to catch up with her old buddies. Secondly, computers offer ways to help others, especially in emergencies. If you're in a bind, you can turn to the computer for assistance. For example, if you have an email account, you can quickly send an email to inform someone about the emergency. There are even features on the computer that can directly call someone or send an emergency alert. @PERCENT2 of the people in the @LOCATION1 claim that a computer has saved many lives. Thirdly, computers play a crucial role in helping people pay their bills and manage their money. Remarkably, @PERCENT3 of people in the United States handle their bill payments and financial management on the computer. I know my parents do, and so do many other people I know. If we didn't have computers to manage our finances, we might face difficulties in paying our bills on time, which could lead to the loss of our homes and other essential things. In conclusion, people really do need computers. They help us stay connected with the people we know, have saved many lives, and are indispensable for managing money and bills. Everyone should own a computer for these compelling reasons.
538	540	1	3	@ORGANIZATION1, @PERCENT1 of the world's population believes that computers are an excellent means of interacting with people, learning about foreign cultures and places, and tracing one's family history. So, here I will elaborate on the valid reasons why computers should remain an integral part of our society. How can you meet people from different countries? One effective way is through online interaction. The internet offers numerous benefits when it comes to meeting new people. You can create a specific account on a social platform to connect with individuals who share similar interests. Another option is to visit a website that facilitates pen - pal exchanges with people from different parts of the world. Additionally, you can download instant - messaging apps that allow you to send messages to people globally. Do you have a school project where you need to learn about another country or an explorer? The computer can be your best friend in such situations. It provides access to a vast amount of information that can assist you in completing your schoolwork. Computers also help with homework. When you come home from school and there's no one around to help you, you can rely on educational websites to gain a better understanding of the material. Do you wonder where your family comes from? You can use a website to uncover your family's roots. For example, @LOCATION1 is a useful website that can provide insights into your ancestors' lives, such as whether they participated in a war. You can also ask your parents for the names of relatives and search for them on google.com. There are numerous reasons why we should keep computers in our society. They allow us to interact with people, learn about other places, and discover our family history. I hope this explanation helps you understand the importance of computers better.
539	541	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, Computers have become an indispensable part of our lives these days. Almost everyone owns and uses a computer. However, some people question whether computers are harming our society. This view is unfounded because computers are essential for education, people don't spend all day on them, and they are crucial for many jobs. So, how can these aspects be harmful to society? Clearly, they can't. Every person has received some form of education. But how can one pursue education without a computer? If you're working and need to obtain another degree for your job, you can't attend traditional classes during the day. In such cases, you can find an online school that offers courses at night. This way, you can continue working while still getting your education. Moreover, for school projects or essays, you often need a computer to search for information and cite your sources. If you need to type an essay, a computer is the obvious choice. Without computers, education would be severely limited, and you might end up in a low - skilled job at @CAPS1 or a similar place where no education is required. Some people worry that people are on computers all day, but this has no negative impact on society. Kids and adults know how to balance their time. They go outside, enjoy fresh air, and engage in various activities. They use the computer to check emails, play games, or visit social media platforms like Facebook and MySpace. They have the responsibility to lead a balanced life and make their own choices. It's their life, and they should be able to live it as they wish, without others dictating their actions. So, it really shouldn't concern anyone else. Many jobs rely heavily on the internet. Most office workers use computers to communicate with colleagues via email and solve work - related problems. Bank employees need computers to access customers' accounts and handle financial transactions. Construction estimators use computers to calculate costs and keep records. Video game programmers spend hours using computers to develop the games we love. So, how can computers be harmful to society? I still can't see any valid reasons. Education, reasonable computer usage, and job requirements are all strong reasons why computers should be widely accepted. Therefore, I strongly encourage everyone to reconsider the importance of computers and realize what our lives would be like without them.
540	542	1	3	Let's go back around @NUM1 years ago. Those were the days when communicating with out - of - state family members could take weeks. Knowledge was mainly found in books, and it often took a long time to find the information you needed. Everything was done with a lack of speed and precision. Computers have completely changed this scenario. With just a simple tap of a finger, we can communicate with people across the globe or search the web for new information. @PERCENT1 of people in the United States have relatives living in different states. I can relate to this as I have @NUM2 cousins in @LOCATION2 and @NUM2 in @LOCATION1. Without instant messages and emails, we would probably only talk to them once or twice a year. Some people claim that computers make people spend less time interacting with family and friends. But for me and many others, these modern communication tools have made interaction possible. Among all the @LOCATION1 technologies, the webcam amazes me the most. With this tool, you can have face - to - face conversations with someone on the other side of the world. It's truly wonderful to have a real connection with other cultures by talking directly to people from different countries. What people @NUM4 years ago could never have imagined, we can use at any time. Yet, many people still don't appreciate this amazing technology. My @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 have both used the internet to reconnect with old college friends and catch up with distant friends. These are grown - ups using the available tools to enhance their lives. The internet is not just for teenagers on @CAPS3 and @CAPS4. The amount of information available online is astonishing. The information that would be scattered across @NUM2 non - functioning books can be found in just a few minutes on the internet. Any question, whether it's personal or general, can be answered. People years ago would have been envious of this power that allows the average person to access all the information they need. I understand the point about the need for exercise, and it's valid. But in just five minutes on the web, you can plan an exercise routine with modern techniques. The computer has something for everyone. If you're looking for a place to enjoy nature, a quick search on @ORGANIZATION1 will yield thousands of results. If you're missing a dictionary, there are literally hundreds of websites where you can find a definition. People often take these machines for granted and think we can live without them. However, they probably don't realize how much we truly rely on computers. The technology is here, so why not use it? I would never miss an opportunity to talk to a distant cousin or a kid from another country. I can't pass up a chance to check on old friends who have moved away. Thanks to computers, I have these opportunities. I have that open door to discover everything I want. No one can know everything, but with computers, we can find out almost anything. These days, computers have opened up a world of possibilities for us, and we should make the most of this amazing technology.
541	543	1	3	"@CITY1 @CAPS1: I believe that computers (for now) are a good thing for our society. They allow you to visually explore far - off places through high - quality images and virtual tours. If you have a long - distance relationship, you can talk to your loved one in real - time via video calls, and they have many good accessories. What if you were looking for a new home? You could use Google to search for selling homes in a certain location, view detailed photos of the properties, and even check the neighborhood reviews. Then, you could find someone to move your stuff for a fair price by comparing quotes on moving services websites. Computers have many specialized websites that you can visit when looking for that special place. The computer is also handy when you are going on vacation. You can look up the weather forecast for that specific time to pack appropriately. If you are going somewhere far, you can use the computer to find a suitable plane ticket, compare flight prices, and check seat availability. Computers are truly helpful when it comes to exploring places! The accessories on the computer are endless. One big accessory that people like to engage with is games. Games are great to stimulate your mind and keep it active. Practically all of the grades of games require hand - eye coordination. For example, @ORGANIZATION1. In this game, you need to remove all the tiles before the time runs out, which sharpens your reflexes and strategic thinking! If you are bored, games are very fun. I think that games are a great accessory. Some people have long - distance relationships, right? Well, if you have a computer, you can have an online video date. This relieves many people when they know their loved one is not physically there. If you have an email, you can ""talk"" to your friends that you don't see at school. This gives you a chance to connect with them on a regular basis. Myspace and Facebook are very similar. These are what you can use to talk to your friends at school, share updates, and stay in touch. Computers are very useful. As you can see, I have stated many good reasons. Accessories, ""talking"" to people, and exploring places. Many people use computers in their everyday life. Computers are awesome!"
542	544	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1's opinion on the effects computers have on people is that computers are often used for the wrong reasons. Teens should be outside playing sports or having quality time with friends and family. But instead, they are overly addicted to the world - wide web, games, and various websites. Therefore, the computer and the concept of surfing the web are bad because it consumes children's time significantly, and educationally, computers can give the wrong information. Until the late @DATE1's, in @CAPS1's opinion, @ORGANIZATION3 laptops and desktop @CAPS2 did not exist, and this would have been a better situation. For example, children, teens, and even adults use the computer more than they should nowadays. At this age, middle - schoolers and high - schoolers should be focused on their grades and their personal development. But instead, they get too addicted to @CAPS3, @CAPS4, and @CAPS5 that they forget about their schoolwork and their priorities, and their grades start to decline rapidly. Even adults have this problem. For instance, business people, accountants, and assistants will constantly be checking their emails. Also, people who work at a desk or in a cubicle all day are almost always glued to the computer. In other words, I believe that jobs should cut down on how many workers they have on a computer, and family homes should limit the amount of time each member spends online. Another reason I think computers affect people in a bad way is because educationally, computers can give false information. For example, people could insert their own perspective of an idea on websites such as Wikipedia and @ORGANIZATION2. If a student was doing a project or just homework and decided to surf the web for some @ORGANIZATION2 or information, they don't know if their information is correct. I believe this means that the internet and the web don't outperform books or historical records. In conclusion, computers have a bad effect on people for the reasons that it consumes children and teen's minds, people use the internet excessively, and because educationally, computers can sometimes give false information. This shows that we need to be more cautious about our computer usage.
543	545	1	3	I think that computers are amazing. Computers are an amazing way to meet new people online. Through various social media platforms and online communities, you can connect with individuals from different cultures, backgrounds, and interests. You can engage in meaningful conversations, share ideas, and build friendships that might not have been possible otherwise. Whether it's joining a hobby - based group or participating in a global discussion, computers open up a world of opportunities to expand your social circle.
544	546	1	3	Dear, newspaper @CAPS1. I think computers have both a positive and a negative affect on people. On one hand, you can learn about places without having to physically travel there and get facts about what is in that country, such as the local cuisine, unique goods, and available jobs. You can explore different cultures through virtual tours and online resources. On the other hand, the computer can also be a problem because kids could spend too much time chatting or playing on the computer and not enough time going outside to play or attending sports practice. Moreover, sometimes bad things happen from talking to people on the computer. Some people on the computer aren't always who they claim to be. They might present a false identity, which can lead to dangerous situations. So if I have to choose a side on whether the computer is helpful or not, I would have to go with not. The computer is not very helpful because a lot of bad things could happen from just @NUM1 little mistake on the computer, like putting your name, address, or picture on the computer. This information can be misused by malicious individuals, putting your safety and privacy at risk. In conclusion, while computers do offer some learning opportunities, the potential negative consequences far outweigh the benefits, and we should be extremely cautious when using them.
545	547	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, I @CAPS2 that computers have benefits to society. First, it gives and teaches you social skills. Next, computers can help you learn new things online. Finally, computers also teach you hand - eye coordination. In the following, you will see why I @CAPS2 computers have its benefits to the society. First, computers have its benefits to society because it can teach or give you the social skills you need. On a computer, you can interact with others from around the world and make new friends. Through online forums, social media platforms, and chat rooms, you can engage in diverse conversations. Therefore, you can learn about their culture and what they do in their country. Also, you can talk and interact with family that does not live with you or is not with you at the moment. You can have video calls, share photos and updates, and maintain a close relationship. So as you can see, Computers have its benefits because it can teach you social skills. Next, the benefits it has to society is people can learn things online. For example, you can learn how to use a computer if you don't already know how. There are numerous online tutorials and courses available. Also, you could play online learning games for free or buy a @CAPS3 with more advanced options for learning. Another example is you can look up recent or past events you want to know about and conduct in - depth research. You can access a vast amount of information from reliable sources. So as you can see, Computers benefit society because you can learn all types of things online. Finally, computers have its benefits because it teaches you hand - eye coordination. For example, you can find all types of games using hand - eye coordination using the mouse and keyboard. These games require you to react quickly and precisely. Also, if you just want time to pass by, you can use the computer as entertainment by chatting with others and playing games. Believe it or not, you can find a large number of jobs that use a computer for any of these skills. As you can see, computers have its benefits because it teaches you hand - eye coordination and gives you some free - time entertainment. In conclusion, computers have its benefits to the social community. First, it helps you learn your social skills. Next, you can learn about any subject online for free if you're not the one paying the internet bill. Finally, it benefits you by teaching you hand - eye coordination. So as you can see, I @CAPS2 that computers benefit society in plenty of ways, making them an important part of our modern lives.
546	548	1	3	"Dear Newspaper, Computers are not something to be afraid of. They help many people in different ways, like the office workers, teachers, students, scientists, and locals dealing with their jobs and daily life. Hasn't a computer already helped you today? Because of that, computers help us learn, keep in contact with people, and are our future. Who has said that by using computers you don't interact with your family as much? Well, I can tell you that I'm staying in contact with my grandma, cousins, and aunts through my e - mail. With e - mail you can check up on news or simply write to friends and family! Also, if you are planning a trip to visit your loving family members, don't bother with a map that gets in your face all the time and you just ""happen"" to get lost, try going on Google maps and plan the shortest route to your destination without getting lost along the way. Computers can do more than creating a simple map, it can give you precious information! Many schools across the country use computers to help teach kids. The kids can look up historical events and in just a few seconds they have all the information they need! In most school papers, you have to type and provide what websites you used to achieve finishing the paper. What is also nice is that you don't need to go through huge books for one small piece of information. It is much easier, looking it up on the computer. Speaking of not using big books for information, computers don't use paper and will lead us to a healthier tomorrow! Millions of tons of paper land in landfills each day! By using computers we could read online and conserve paper! Another fantastic fact is that computers will grow in the future. People have already created touch - screen computers and computers will grow even more! Many people think that using computers is a bad thing, but look at the facts! Doesn't the newspaper write the newspaper on computers? If they didn't, they would be having hand cramps all the time! And what about doctors, don't they have your medical history on the computer? If not, all these papers would get lost! Like in the beginning, computers help us learn, keep in contact with people, and are our future, and we should embrace them with open arms."
547	549	1	3	"Typing and surfing the web can be exciting; however, is it worth the health risks that there are now? Before computers were discovered, human's healthiness was triple than what it is now. Computers can be useful and indeed have some benefits; on the other hand, they are harmful and they should not be used as often. They have unprofessional websites, they are not helpful when it comes to exercise, and they disturb individual's privacy. Young kids are let onto computers every day and they wander to the websites that the internet has to offer. Consequently, kids end up in inappropriate websites that they are not meant to be on. In fact, a significant percentage of kids enter unprofessional websites and a large portion of them have no parental supervision in the room alone. Therefore, young kids act up in homes and at school. However, kids are not the only ones who are affected by this. Computers have a disadvantage of being hacked or virused from uncensored websites. Moreover, computers crash or don't allow use of computer documents because of these viruses. Ever since the internet was invented, obesity and lack of exercise in a person's schedule has skyrocketed. A scientist, named Dr. Smith from the local research institute, said, ""Heavy computer users have lost their use of muscles, but they have gained over a considerable amount of fat causing a lot of them to not be able to do activities they did before."" I believe that this is definitely true because I remember that the same happened to my sister. She ate more and her exercise time was spent more on the computer than on her body. I know that some say that computers help in hand - eye coordination, however, is it really worth more than someone's healthy body? Many things are sold on the internet that are not in stores, but you don't trust the internet when buying these products. You don't trust the internet because you have heard so much about someone's identity or money taken away from them. In conclusion, we should be more cautious about our computer use to safeguard our health and privacy."
548	550	1	3	"Dear Local Newspaper, Computers are harmfully affecting the children, and they are going to affect future generations even more. Computers are fine in moderation, as are most things. If they are needed for a school project that's fine, but using the computer everyday rather than exercising is not okay. Supporters of technology say that computers have a positive effect. I have to disagree. They say they practice hand - eye coordination, they can teach you about far away places and you can talk with people online. Sports are a great way to exercise and practice hand - eye coordination. Tennis, baseball, basketball, hockey, etc are all great sports that practice hand - eye coordination. They are much healthier than IMing your friends all day. You sit on your butt all day and scream to your mom to get you a drink of water, or some dinner. ""Future generations are becoming way too dependent."" says Mr. Johnson, my 5th grade science teacher. How are you supposed to be able to support a family when you're older if you can't get up from the computer. ""Raising a family is hard work,"" my mom tells me, ""your family needs food which means someone needs a job, and someone also needs to get the food. That takes a lot of time and energy."" I agree with my mom, and if simple things like going outside for an hour a day are practiced as a child, having a job and raising a family will be easier. Rather than searching the internet for how to find a good online source to support your thesis paper go to the library! The internet is a relatively new data basis. However, it has grown so much. You cannot always trust internet sources. People who might have posted the website could very well be crazy. Plus websites are filled with viruses, and what happens when your computer is dead due to viruses and you actually need your computer for a school project? The simple alternative would be going to the local library and checking out a variety of books. The books are trusted and filled with information. The internet is also not a very safe place. Facebook, AIM, email, twitter, etc are all ways for people to communicate through the computer. Facebook, AIM and twitter are scary and not safe because you might not know who you are talking to. They do have a profile which you might be able to relate to, but they could be lying. ""The internet is a broad place open to strangers,"" my dad says. I am not allowed to have these ways to communicate because of the specific reasons that I stated earlier. My parents are doing this to protect me and I agree with their decision. Rather than talking to complete strangers go over to your friends' house. Your friends are the people that you want to talk to and spend time with. Overall, computers are bizarre pieces of technology that can be unsafe, not truthful, and are forcing children to become more dependent on adults. I have to disagree with the supporters of technology. There are many healthy alternatives to the computer. I believe that experts who are concerned that people are spending too much time on the computer and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends are right. We should choose the healthier alternatives for a better life."
549	551	1	3	Dear local news paper, I think the computers benefit society. The three reasons why so is because computers teach hand - eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places, and allow people to talk online with other people, and computers help to make better technology. I believe that computers have a positive effect on people. My first reason why computers have a positive effect on people is because computers teach hand - eye coordination and give people the ability to learn about faraway places. 3 out of 5 students use the computers to do homework. I was visiting a prompt last week. I didn't know a lot about ancient Egypt so I went on the computers and you know what, I got to know more about ancient Egypt and thanks to the computers I got an A+. So the computers have a positive effect on people. The next reason why computers have a positive effect on people is because computers allow people to talk online with other people. Say if a man went on a business trip and he left his phone at home, how will he talk to his family? Well, he had computers, he can talk to his family online. My family is back in Italy. I haven't seen them in four years so I went to the store and got a webcam and I got to see my family after four years. So computers do have a positive effect on people. My last reason why computers have a benefit in society is because computers help to make better technology. Computers help people to make better cars, lights, and so on. Without computers, society would be at a disadvantage because computers help the soldiers to win wars and even help people to live. My father was dying from a heart condition. Without the computer - assisted medical equipment, my father would die. Thanks to the computer, I have my father today. In the end, computers have benefits in society. The three reasons are computers teach hand - eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places, and computers allow people to talk online with other people and computers help people to make better technology. Spending time enjoying nature is good, but computers have benefited society greatly. I hope my three reasons can persuade the local news paper to agree with my position that computers have a positive effect on people, and we should continue to develop and utilize them for a better future.
550	552	1	3	Student Reporter: John Doe, Editor: 1, Reporter: 2, To the Editor of the local newspaper, I think we should have computers because they would help us meet new people, see new places, and learn new things. It would help us meet new people because we can e - mail them, and chat with them on various programs. It will also help us see new places because we can go on the internet and look up different places to see virtual tours and detailed information. It will also help us learn about new things because we can talk to experts and enthusiasts from around the world, and they could give us some ideas on what to learn about. This will help us all because we want to learn about new things, talk to new people and see new places. This is a good idea for all of us. We can all benefit from this because it's a great thing for everyone to have. I think we should have computers because it would help us meet new people, see new places, and learn new things. This is a great thing for everyone, not just some people. I hope you take this letter into consideration. Because it will help everyone learn about new things and expand their horizons, making our community more informed and connected.
551	553	1	3	I think computers are bad because people use them constantly to access Facebook and other websites that are sometimes a complete waste of time. Instead of spending excessive hours on the computer, people should venture outside, go for refreshing walks, explore the enchanting woods, and engage in regular exercise. Most people do not get the sufficient amount of exercise they need because they are glued to their computers. To address this issue, people should stop over - producing computers so that fewer individuals will use them. This way, people can exercise more and shed some extra weight. If the production of computers were to decrease, some people would stop visiting inappropriate websites. People should only use the computer for legitimate purposes such as researching for school projects or typing papers for homework. Both parents and kids need to exercise to maintain good health. No one wants to develop diabetes at a young age, so it is truly important to exercise to prevent such health problems. All the computer does is disrupt your normal routine and make you less likely to exercise. So, get off the computer, exercise, explore the outdoors, go for walks, and discover the wonders of the woods. You never know what amazing things you might find in the woods, like different kinds of bugs and insects. You might even spot a cute ladybug. There are all sorts of bees, and you might find one that looks truly unique. So, go outside and explore. You'll be surprised by what you find. When you go for walks, you'll see different kinds of houses, each with its own distinct color and style. There are small, medium, and large houses, and some will have very interesting color combinations. You'll also encounter different animals like dogs and cats, either in the windows or playing outside. You should go out and hang out with your family, friends, or both, and observe the beauty of nature. You could take pictures and create a scrapbook to cherish these memories. Just go into the woods and take a stroll. Once you start getting out and exercising, you'll think to yourself that you should do this more often instead of being on the computer. After all, you'll have more fun hanging out with loved ones and getting exercise at the same time, and the computer will just seem boring in comparison.
552	554	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, My opinion on the effects computers have on people is that computers have a good effect. It's great for education, mental exercise, and communication all over the world. However, it could also be bad because it would keep you from getting proper exercise, spending quality time with your family, and maintaining good health. But I still think that there are ways to use computers without experiencing the negative consequences. Some ways computers are beneficial for you are that you can obtain a better education when you have access to websites with a vast amount of information. Sometimes this information may be false, but if you know how to find reliable websites, you can get the right information. With all of this information at your fingertips, you can exercise your mind to achieve better results in life. You can also talk to people on the other side of the earth and gain more information from them. If I were to say computers are bad for you, I would say that it keeps you from getting enough, or maybe any, exercise. Computers might be the reason why there are so many obese people in the country. When computers are used too much, people distance themselves from their family and immerse themselves in different fantasy worlds that sometimes get you addicted to them. And staying on the computer for too long causes problems. You can get hurt by just sitting for a long period of time at once. Being on the computer for too long can also cause eye problems where you will begin to lose your sight and will need glasses, which will get thicker as you keep looking at the computer screen for hours and days. But even though computers cause so many problems, we can prevent them by using the computer to help us. People don't get enough exercise, but with the help of computers, they can find suitable times and ways to exercise so that they can stay healthy. They can also find information about how much time should be spent on the computer to avoid a decrease in sight or worse. Some people live far away from their family, so computers really help them stay in touch and be able to see each other. In conclusion, I think that computers are more beneficial than harmful because they provide you with a lot of information on various topics and you can communicate with people all over the world. And computers can help you prevent those things that are bad for you by showing you ways to use the computer that won't harm you.
553	555	1	3	"Dear newspaper, I heard you were discussing if more and more people using computers was a benefit to society. I believe that excessive computer use has a negative affect on people. They get to interact with people who aren't safe, they spend less time exercising, and they get into more trouble than before. Spending a large amount of time online in chat rooms causes people to meet potential predators. Take my friend Lisa; she was online one day when a man started to talk to her. She thought he seemed acceptable when he said he was 25 and a model. She flirted with him day after day until one day her friend logged on and found out the man was really 45 and a pervert. Lisa isn't the only one that this has happened to. 30 out of 50 people in chat rooms say they have been lied to like this. Website designer Mr. Smith says, ""More and more people everyday are falling for lies over the internet and getting in sticky situations like getting asked to meet the person."" Isn't it the saying ""Don't talk to strangers?"" Spending all your time sitting down on the computer means less time outside exercising. At tryouts, this girl Sarah wasn't in shape enough to keep up with the players. Instead of practicing like the rest of us, she was in her house talking on Facebook. She wasn't prepared when tryout time came, so she didn't make the softball team. The next year she made captain because she was out training every day before the big day. She's not the only one with a laziness problem. 40 out of every 100 Americans are couch potatoes and choose to go online rather than stay in shape. Nutritionalist, Dr. Brown says, ""This generation is worse than the last. They complain when they can't do something, but that's because instead of going outside, they're on their butts watching TV or online."" Computer use is a breath of fresh air? What do you have to lose by getting off it? Kids seem to get in a lot more trouble online than they ever have on the streets. They're out posting threats, dissing each other, sending personal messages or pictures, and worst of all, sometimes hurting someone so bad that the victim commits suicide. One year, the neighbor was more popular than this lady's daughter, so she created an online persona that the neighbor fell for. The online ""guy"" began trashing the teenage girl so badly that she ended up hanging herself. People, including singer Justin Bieber, have been caught in sexting. It's embarrassing, inappropriate, and against the law, yet it still happens. These people are not alone. 30 out of 50 people have gotten in big trouble through the internet. Governor, Mr. Johnson says, ""The internet and phones are destroying this society. There's too much real - life drama already."" Can't you see something wrong with all of this? My opinion on excessive computer use is that we should use the computers less before we all start interacting with people that will scare us, become couch potatoes, and get into huge trouble. It's really not worth the damage of getting scared, hurt, lazy, or taking your own life."
554	556	1	3	"Dear newspaper, Computers are everywhere in our nation. We have them at home, at school or at our work. Many people believe that computers are bad for our health or we don't spend enough time with our family. But I disagree. Computers teach hand - eye coordination, let us learn about faraway places, and also allow us to chat online with other people. Have you ever had trouble with hand - eye coordination? Sometimes mine is really poor! But when I get on a computer, it gets much better. Experts say that 30% more people with hand - eye coordination have improved by working with a computer. A teacher at our school said, ""My students have been working on the computers for about two months now and I have seen an incredible improvement in their hand - eye coordination already."" I agree with these experts too. So many people nowadays who have a computer have passed their hand - eye coordination test! When I grow up and soon get out of high school, I want to travel all over the world. But first, I want to be educated on where I go. That is why computers are so helpful. I can just click on a button and the internet will bring me to hundreds of sites where I can learn all about the places I want to visit. One time, my parents told me we were going to Paris for the day. So the night before, I did a bunch of research on different shops, museums, and places to eat. The computer helped me so much that if we didn't have it, then I don't know where we would go. President Obama said, ""One time when I had a big meeting in Tokyo, I had no knowledge about it. So I logged on to the computer and it brought me to a million pages on their culture, language, and much more. I don't know what I would do if I didn't have a computer."" I love talking to my friends. But once I'm home, none of my friends are around me, so I have nobody to talk to. If I also don't have the phone available, then that makes it even worse. But, if I go on the computer, then I can talk to a bunch of my friends. I can go onto my webcam to see who I am talking to or I can go onto another website to get an instant message. I love talking online because one of my best friends in the whole world moved down to Florida, so I don't get to talk to her very often. But if I go to the instant message website, then I can talk to her as much as I want. 80 out of 100 people surveyed said that they have someone they talk to over the internet. So I say the computer is important in our society. It helps complete a number of tasks. They teach hand - eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places, and it even allows people to talk to friends and family online. So I don't think computers are bad for us or our health. I think they are important and needed for a well - rounded life."
555	557	1	3	Dear, editor of the newspaper. I believe that computers are good for the future. The world has made many changes with its technology. I know not spending time exercising is bad, but learning about new things can't be that bad. If humans didn't have technology, some of us wouldn't have heat or fresh water. We use computers in every aspect of life. Computers are good for people who use them to learn about the world. Some people who have friends far away can use a computer to talk to them. Or even people who can't talk use computers to communicate for them. The medical field uses computers to save lives. Computers save lives in so many ways that it's scary to think if they were all gone, we could all start facing serious problems. We use computers in hospitals. For example, if there weren't any computers, the chances of finding a cure for something would take too long and the patient could die. Let's say someone has what looks like a normal fever and you just assume that's what it is. Two days later, they die because they had some rare disease and no one knew until it was too late. We use computers to purify water, ensuring that we have clean and safe drinking water. We use computers to keep us warm during winter by controlling heating systems. We even use computers in libraries. Why the library? Some people who have medical illnesses and can't talk have these small computers that can have something typed in them and it will speak the words. Most people use some kind of computer to talk, chat, and text. They might find it easier with a computer. The world is a big place, and many people don't know much about it. But if you go online, you could find out stuff that you might never knew existed or just plainly didn't know about. Kids even use computers for school and schoolwork. So many people rely on technology to get through their life. Computers even help people in school, like me who broke my arm and have to take some tests on the computer. Now, so many things in the military, airforce, and navy are computerized. The military uses thermal sights on guns and tanks so they can identify people in even the most extreme weather conditions. It can even locate a wounded soldier. They are even working with computers to make better bullet - proof vests so that more lives will be saved in war. The airforce uses computers to talk to people on the ground so they can protect them. They now have planes that can be flown by a pilot far away, which would save their lives even if the plane gets shot down. This also allows them to see people hiding and they can tell the people on the ground to stay down or take appropriate action. The navy uses radar, which is computer - controlled, to see if there are any boats or submarines coming near them and they have a heads - up if there would be an attack. We use this technology to help with other advances in the future. We could soon have a computer that could help out people in far - off places where there is a higher poverty rate. Computers save lives, allow communication, and are a great way for research. Computers are what we use to live, and we truly need them to survive in this modern world.
556	558	1	3	"Some ""experts"" are warned that people should not spend too much time on their computers. Yet, look at all of the numerous advantages that a computer offers. You can develop better hand - eye coordination skills, interact via the internet with friends or family who could live hundreds of miles away, and you can learn about diverse cultures all around the world, along with the unique people who live in those countries, without ever leaving the comfort of your home. In my opinion, computers overall benefit society, helping us learn more and more every single day. First off, there are many useful skills you can develop on the computer. For example, when playing interactive high - paced games, kids get a sense of awareness, precise timing, and excellent hand - eye coordination. Not to mention, with new advances in technology, people can now go to college without ever leaving home, and at a much lower price, while still getting a great quality education. Many people even work from home, thanks to their reliable computers. These are still only a few of the many skills that can be learned on computers. Secondly, why buy an expensive ticket to a far - away country, trade in all your money for the money they have there, and go through the hassles of baggage, etc. When you could simply go online and look it up on the computer? You can go online, look up some of that country's delicious recipes, beautiful language, amazing pictures, and interesting people without the hassle of going there. Not to mention, for kids who aren't old enough to travel to a particular place, or have to do a report on it, instead of rummaging through countless textbooks, newspapers, and libraries in general, they go online, search for their country, and they have most, if not all the info they need right there. So not only is it convenient, but you're getting the information you would've learned in the first place, thereby, extending your knowledge. Finally, the internet helps people connect. Leading experts from the U.S.A., or Family security agency, says that since people have started using programs like Skype and facebook, many more families, who live in different countries, have been able to re - connect and get to know one - another. For example, if you have an uncle who lives in Australia, you could both buy cameras for your computer, install them, and within minutes, be seeing each other and talking face to face. I think this is better than simply writing letters to them, as it's quicker, and you get to connect more. Same goes if a friend or you move away, but want to stay in touch. A quick facebook account or Skype, and you'll still be good friends. So all in all, yes, computers do benefit society, as they help teach people skills, learn about distant cultures and far - away countries, and connect people, who might live in different countries. I don't see anything wrong with these beneficial factors to society. So yes, computers have a positive effect on people, enhancing our lives in multiple ways."
557	559	1	3	Dear Local newspaper, imagine a world filled with gargantuan people seated at a monitor, their eyes staring at it blankly. Outside, the city streets are deserted, save for the squirrels running along fence posts. This is what will happen if people spend too much time on the computers. People will spend less time exercising, less time outdoors enjoying nature, and less time interacting with family and friends. This is why computers have a drastic negative affect on people. First of all, people spend huge amounts of time on their computers and small amounts of time exercising. In a recent poll done by Health magazine, it stated that 70% of people between the ages of 10 and 20 prefer to be online rather than outside exercising. That article also states that since 2010, child obesity has increased by 30%! Dr. Smith of Pediatrics at Children's Hospital states that “the reason child obesity has increased so much is because children spend so much time in front of the computer and less time outdoors. Do you want this rate to increase in the next ten years? Secondly, spending so much time inside decreases the time you spend outside enjoying nature. Bird Watcher's Monthly has had a decrease in subscriptions since 2015 because people are not interested in nature anymore. In a study done by Dr. Johnson and his colleagues at Environmental Research Institute, 80% of teenagers spend almost 50% more time indoors in front of electronic devices, most frequently computers, than they do outdoors. Dr. Brown says, “Due to the new advancements in technology, people tend to spend more time indoors than outdoors and that percentage will most likely increase as the decade proceeds”. Finally, spending so much time in front of the computer leaves you less time to interact with family and friends. In 2012, more than 80% of families ate dinner together. Now, only 40% eat together usually because they are in separate rooms in front of a monitor. This also leads to a higher crime rate, believe it or not. Because young children and adolescents don't have the person to support and guide them because they don't spend time together due to the frequent use of computers, there is a 20% chance that a child will commit a crime compared to the 5% chance a child would in 2010. Do you want that for our youth? Now imagine a world where people jog together in the park. As they jog, they see a group of bird watchers huddled together under a tree. As the joggers proceed, they come to a pavilion and see a big family celebrating the birthday of a family member. This happy thought won't become a reality if people spend too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. So, local newspaper I encourage you, to encourage others, to get outside and spend less time in front of the computer. You have the power to make a difference in your real lives. But the question is, will you? By taking action, we can create a healthier and more connected community.
558	560	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1 Newspaper, although computers have many benefits, they also have many faults too. I believe that computers and the technology these days have many more negative features than positive. Some of those faults are that it's bad for your eyes, you don't spend as much time with family and you exercise less, and the time you spend going outside is less often. Yeah, I get it that computers are very useful but they also harm your eyesight. If you haven't noticed, more and more kids have been getting glasses and contacts, due to the use of staring at a screen all day. I know more than 10 kids that have glasses now, I also know that over 5 parents I know now have glasses for the exact same reason. Using these computers is great for looking up your homework, but if you stay on it for over an hour or two a day you'll probably become addicted to it and eventually you'd lose your eyesight. The usual time a kid spends on their laptop a night is about 2 or 3 hours and the time they spend with their family is maybe an hour if the parents are lucky. Personally, I feel technology is the reason parents and kids are less connected. When the kids go on the computer, they go on Instagram or Snapchat and talk to friends that they see every day. So I don't find it necessary. Mostly the girls do this, but why not just talk to them in school since you see them for 6 hours everyday. The use of technology is being abused! The computers were invented for knowledge not scandalous ""webchats"" or ""Snapchat pages."" The world would be so much happier and mentally fit if we stuck to the original idea of technology. Now kids don't even take a quick step outside their bedroom after school, it's pointless! Most people even eat in their room so they can talk to people. So that's taking the parents' time away from their kids. Now that you have read what I had to say about technology these days, wouldn't you agree that it just takes time away from your actual life? I think it does and hope that you agree with me. We should all strive to use technology in a more balanced way to regain the quality of our real - life interactions."
559	561	1	3	Dear Newspaper Editor, I believe that the computer is good for the society because students do most of the studies online. We spend most of our time with our family and friends so we want a little bit of time to ourselves. We learn much more on the computer because it has a lot of accurate facts. After reading this essay I hope you will agree with my position. Students put most of their notes on a laptop and study what they did in class on the computer. When they need to look something up for history class they have the internet. High school students don't like going to the library so they go on the internet as their source. So when a student has a project due and the teacher wants it neat, the computer will write the project neatly. The computer/internet has become a big source of learning to our society, don't you agree? Our time is mostly spent with our families when our friends don't come over. We can go outside and play with them, sit down and play games. Having a little bit of time to ourselves on the computer won't hurt anyone. We don't use it forever. We either talk to friends or search for something useful after we've talked to our families. When we go online searching for information that couldn't be found elsewhere. People from different countries who aren't able to visit a particular place but want to know about it need a resource that is up to date. A computer is constantly updated with new facts about everything. I hope after reading this you will agree with my position. Mostly every person has a computer and it does not affect their lives negatively. A computer is a great resource for the public. People who want to meet new people can use a computer to do so. Students who want a great grade on those projects want to present it nicely. I believe that agreeing with me would be a very good choice. The computer enriches our learning and social experiences, making it an essential part of modern society.
560	562	1	3	Dear Editor of the Daily News, did you know that 80% of people today use the computer for necessary reasons? It's true! It's a fact that the computer can help you with keeping in touch with friends, getting the latest news, and even gives you map access. Let me tell you some important facts about the computer. Of course, we all have friends in different cities and/or states! Instead of over - charging a phone bill, many people keep in touch via email. Email is high - tech, and super easy! All you need is your friend's email address and you can send them anything from a friendly hello, to beautiful pictures of the family. Teens love to chat with friends and they're able to get to know each other better through the computer. Sites such as facebook are certainly popular with this generation of teens. The fun messages are what makes everything so great. Keep in mind all the available ways to get in touch with friends and see why the computer is so great. Every time I log onto the computer I'm able to see the latest news updates! I remember going on and seeing something pop up about my favorite band breaking up. Thanks to the computer I got to read all about it and I was extremely glad I'd seen that because if I hadn't I wouldn't have got to see their last concert. While I do understand, the computer may not be the healthiest activity, it definitely is a great news source and everyone reads the news whether it be political, or about celebrities. Knowledge about what's currently happening in our country, and exercise is equally as important therefore, I'd be the first to support the computer as a positive effect on people today. Have you ever been lost? Maybe you didn't write down the correct directions, or couldn't remember. Next time look up directions on the computer! It's so helpful and could really save you a hassle. There are so many websites that have maps you can print out, such as MapQuest. It's a much easier, clearer way to understand where exactly you need to go. In my opinion, it can help so much and it would be the right idea to embrace it today. Imagine all the places you could go just by getting a map online! Keep this in mind as one of the many great things about the computer. Now that you know some positives about the computer, remember how they could benefit you! Being able to chat with friends is one of the best! Don't forget about hearing the latest news, and finally, never get lost again, just print out a map. There's no doubt in my mind the computer has a very positive effect on everyone! The time is now to get out there and pick up a computer for yourself and experience its many advantages.
561	563	1	3	"Dear Newspaper, I think Computers are extremely good for numerous things and are highly useful for anything. I firmly believe this because every single year, new and truly exciting applications and websites are ingeniously created, which significantly make life much easier. For example, ""Facebook"" is an excellent way to communicate with friends and family. For me, I have family living out - of - state, and I'm always overjoyed when I log on to Facebook and have a chat with them. Or I can also talk to friends right after a long, tiring day of school. Another prime example is ""youtube."" On youtube, they have detailed how - to videos that show you step - by - step instructions on literally anything, even on news and music entertainment. Other applications like Word help you neatly set up writing essays and creative stories. On PowerPoint, it allows you to make engaging slide - show videos for school projects all the way to professional presentations. Even Excel lets you make accurate graphs and any chart imaginable. And let's not forget Google. Google helps you when you desperately need info on a person, place, or thing. And by using Google, it aids you when you need information for other applications like Word and more. See, computers genuinely help everyday people in their everyday lives."
562	564	1	3	"The question is does computers have a positive effect on society? Yes, computers definitely have a profound positive effect on society. Computers teach hand - eye coordination, give people the remarkable ability to learn about faraway people and places, and allows people to talk to other people online. Computers have a positive impact on people. First, Computers teach people hand - eye coordination. I mean, computers help people learn how to skillfully use their eyes and hands at the very same time. A comprehensive survey conducted by @PERSON3 shows that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people have better hand - eye coordination among those who use computers compared to those who don't. Professor @PERSON1 says ""people that use a computer are much more coordinated than any other person, it is a great discovery."" You @MONTH1 be thinking that a computer would make you less coordinated BUT, computers really help enhance hand - eye coordination in people. In conclusion, the more you get to learn how to use a computer, the better hand - eye coordinated you will become. Second, computers allow people to be able to learn about far away places and people. I mean that a computer can help you learn about a faraway country without paying a fortune in money to travel to the country. I remember the time when my mom and dad were going to go to @CAPS1 to see a lot of the famous landmarks, and my uncle came to my house with a brand - new computer. My parents ended up staying home and saved themselves a large amount of money. Famous explorer @CAPS2 smome says ""before I go anywhere, I always google it on my computer to learn about life, climate, etc., on the country. I know you @MONTH1 be thinking that it would be a better experience to go to the country, but it is really expensive to go to very faraway countries. In conclusion, computers can help you save money and help you learn. Third, computers let people talk to other people online. I mean people go to special websites just to talk to friends. A detailed survey done by @ORGANIZATION1 shows that @PERCENT1 of people talk to other people over those websites. Famous social worker @PERSON2 says ""When people use these websites, it helps them with their vocabulary and social abilities."" I know you @MONTH1 be thinking those websites are dangerous, but virus software can prevent danger. In conclusion, social abilities are enhanced with computers. Lastly, computers teach people about faraway places, help improve social abilities, and enhance hand - eye coordination. Computers can greatly benefit society and learning, so let's support the growth of technology today!"
563	565	1	3	Dear Newspaper, The world that we currently live in today is absolutely brimming with technology. Everything from the check - out isles at the grocery store to the coffee makers at home are being continuously upgraded all the time. The technology has many great aspects about it, but there's also a huge downside. The most common technology device is the computer; it's a great thing to own, but it's also very harmful. The computer can be used to bully, it can take precious time away from exercising, and it even negatively impacts your social and grammar skills. We all know the well - known websites such as Facebook, MySpace, and Twitter. They seem harmless, but they're really just a breeding ground for harassment. They're said to keep friends in touch, but kids use them to say extremely hurtful things about each other. Half the kids in my eighth - grade class have admitted to either getting bullied or bullying over the computer. If so many kids are getting hurt by them, then why do we all keep using computers? Many kids @MONTH1 say they don't spend too much time on their computers, but @NUM1 out of @NUM2 kids in my school admit that they do. Checking the computer is the very first thing they do when they get home from school and the last thing they do before going to sleep at night. All the time these kids spend on the computer is taking away from exercising and enjoying life as a child. I've seen many kids gain an excessive amount of weight because they don't eat proper food, they don't exercise, and they shut down from reality all because they are completely obsessed with their computers. Kids are even getting portable computers, which shows how addicted they are. Do you want your kids like that? However, all these programs and websites that are on computers have a way to interact with friends and socialize. But all of this is taking away from your social skills, even grammar. Most kids and teenagers would rather talk over the internet than face to face, and half the time they don't even spell words correctly or use proper grammar. In the long run, all this talking over computers is going to seriously hurt them when it comes to school and getting a job. I know that computers are good for school because you can research stuff for projects and e - mail your assignments. But the time spent, kids getting bullied, and the now lack of social skills is not worth it. We need to cut back on our society's use of computers because it will help us all when it really matters. Just ask yourself: do you want your kids getting bullied? Do you want to gain weight? Do you want to lose your social and grammar skills? Just ask yourself these questions, and you just might change your mind.
564	566	1	3	Computers are not having a negative affect on society. In fact, when you talk with someone online, applications like Skype helps build a strong relationship within that person. A highly useful aspect of computers is the development of hand - eye coordination. Education is also a valuable benefit that computers offer. You can learn about faraway places and magnificent monuments. The myth is that computers ruin relationships between friends and family. However, in some ways, applications like Skype actually improve them. When you go on Skype and talk with someone online, you actually strengthen the bond between you and that person. This information clearly proves that computers can actually support relationships. Hand - eye coordination is also something useful that a computer can teach. When you type on a keyboard, your fingers improve in terms of reflexes. If you continue to type regularly, your hand - eye coordination will steadily improve. Some people might say that a computer won't help you much, but applications like Skype are truly positive to use. A computer is more educational than what most people would think. On certain specialized websites, you can find something that can teach you. If you visit a historical website, someone could learn about different types of people. Lots of critics say that a computer is not educational. However, when you look at the facts, a computer can teach a great deal. It's easy to believe that a computer is not a good thing. But when someone looks at the facts objectively, a computer is a great thing to own. If critics can take these facts into full consideration, a computer is a far better object than what most people say.
565	567	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I think that computers can be a good thing and a bad thing for many valid reasons. First, I think it's good because it can greatly assist with school work, like conducting in - depth research and for other tasks that you might have to do for school. A second reason on why computers are helpful is because it teaches hand - eye coordination. It also enables people to talk to their family members from another country through a webcam. Although computers can be really helpful, they can also be bad for your health and family. I agree that it can lead to less time spent exercising. Instead of being on the computer all day, you can go to the park or take a walk, and do many other things. It can also destroy your interaction with family and friends if you stay in the house all the time using the computers while your family and friends want to spend some quality time with you. @ORGANIZATION1, these are the reasons why I think computers can be a good thing and a bad thing. I mostly think that computers are a good thing because if we didn't have computers, we wouldn't have most of the things we now have in the world. That's why I think computers can be more helpful, just depending on the way you use it and how much you use it. Those were the opinions I had on computers, and overall, with proper usage, computers can bring more benefits to our lives.
566	568	1	3	Computers they give you access to a vast amount of information and research from a great distance. But is it good for you? Those who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people. I believe they might be correct. I believe that a computer can be used for finding things out from far - off distances, and it can also enhance hand - eye coordination. I also believe that it is okay to use a computer if you are just using it for research or other necessary actions. When using a computer, it gives you the advantages of researching and studying far - away places. This is good because some people have a genuine interest in places around the world. Also, students need computers nowadays. Their teachers give typed assignments or PowerPoint presentations. Also, parents use computers for work or maybe to book a vacation when they want to get away from work. They need to somehow make the bookings. Also, some say using a computer can give you hand - eye coordination. Well, it does in fact when you type. Some may not know this, but typing is a skill. Some people type fast, some type slow, and some are average typers. Also, to teach little kids, maybe even some adults, people have created a typing game on the computer that will teach kids how to type. Also, some people who type super fast go to get tested to see how fast they type. The test gives numbers like seventy words a minute. People naturally type about thirty words a minute. I believe that people should be able to go on computers for needed actions such as research. Many kids have learned about these other websites such as Facebook, iTunes, YouTube, and Twitter. Some become addicted so they never get off. Also, being on all of these websites and more can expose you to things that may give you a virus. Viruses can come in many strengths. Some can crash your computer, some just send boatloads of pop - ups to your monitor. I feel that it is okay to go on the computer to do research or book vacations. If you are addicted to other websites, stop because you could crash your computer with one click of your mouse. Overall, I believe computers are a great source to get information off of but should not be an addictive so - called toy. Computers have a positive effect on people. Just don't be addicted and go outside and have some exercise with friends and family too.
567	569	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, Local newspaper, do you think that the computer is a good technology in our generation today? Well, I do not believe it is a good technology in our generation. Do not get me wrong. I do not dislike going on the computer, but there are so many reasons why computers affect a lot of children and some adults in this generation. Like one reason is when people are on the computer all day long, they do not get enough physical exercise. That is why kids these days are so overweight. There are more than @NUM1 million children overweight because of the computer. Like for me, I used to love going on the computer and I still do, but I see that the computer is destroying my health. A second reason why I believe it is bad for the generation is because there are a lot of inappropriate sites on the internet, where kids that are @NUM2 and younger could be logging on to. I think that people all over the world should start enjoying nature, go travel the world. Start doing things that people can't do on the computer. I think that more kids should start interacting with family and friends more often instead of just talking to your friend all the time. My last and final reason that is a big issue going on with the computer is people bullying other people on the internet. Local newspaper, have you ever thought about what you would do if you have any daughters, sons, grandchildren. If they were getting bullied over the internet or someone threatened to kill them or hurt them. I think you would be horribly upset and you would want that person to go to jail. For now on, I am going to think when I spend all my time on the computer how it affects my life and my family, friends. I believe other people in the world should do the same thing. In conclusion, the negative impacts of computers on our generation, especially on children and some adults, are quite evident. We should be more aware of these issues and take steps to limit our computer use and engage in more real - life activities.
568	570	1	3	"Your spending too much time on the computer, your mom and dad will shout. You realize it's time to get off and go outside. You spend about @PERCENT1 more or less on the computer each day, but there are good reasons. You can multi - task on it. You can talk to friends and family you haven't seen or talked to for a long time, and lastly, you can spend time outside as well as inside. If you were smart, you would not listen to those experts. Have you ever heard of the word multi - tasking? It's where you can do more than one thing at a time. For example, you can read and talk, or text and talk, or walk and be reading something. You have all these things you can do. Another example is when you're on the computer, you can listen to music and talk to friends or read. What you can even do is you can talk to your friends, listen to music, and do homework. What I mean when I say homework is when you have to type up an essay or something. The fourth and final example is that about @PERCENT2 of us can multi - task. One of my friends told me that they just bought a laptop with a built - in camera. Now they can talk to people they haven't seen in a long time. ""I haven't seen my sister since she moved to California @NUM2 years ago, so I thought I would use the webcam on my laptop to see her."" said a mother of the @ORGANIZATION1. A computer or laptop can be good for talking to friends or family you haven't seen in a long time. Another from a student says, ""If you were smart and understanding, you would know why everyone's on the computer so much"". When you're on the computer and your friends start to talk to you about things, you understand why. You usually don't see your friends unless it's lunch or before class. Computers help talking to friends move easier than writing letters or waiting for class to get out. You get off the bus and you realize that it's pure sunshine out. You decide to do some or all of your homework now so you can go out and play. You're outside for about a few hours. When you come in, it's around @NUM2:00 pm. You eat dinner and you just want to unwind from the day's gigantic adventure so you go on the computer. You can go on the computer just like wild animals enjoy their natural habitat outside. Only responsible kids plan their time accordingly. In conclusion, computers offer many benefits like multi - tasking, staying in touch with loved ones, and can fit well into a balanced lifestyle. We just need to use them responsibly."
569	571	1	3	Computers today are much different from computers back then. They help you with projects or homework, but many experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers. I think that computers help people in many ways, like teaching hand - eye coordination. They're useful because people can talk to friends and family members that they haven't seen in a long time, and computer skills are required in the real world. Hand - eye coordination is very important, and using a computer can help people build up this coordination. This helps because if one has to type a @NUM1 - page report, then one who has good hand - eye coordination, or typing skills, can finish a report in @NUM2 minutes or so. If one has poor hand - eye coordination, well, that @NUM2 - minute report will take about a few hours. No one likes to be sitting in front of a computer for a few hours. Everyone has friends and best friends that they talk to every day. But what happens if that friend moves out - of - town, out - of - state, or possibly out - of - country? They might be forgotten or never seen again. Well, thanks to technology and the advancement of computers, people can chat online on @CAPS1, @ORGANIZATION1 instant messaging, MySpace, or Facebook. They can catch up on things, check out what's new, even see posted pictures of them. The same thing can be applied to family members who have moved away. Who wouldn't want to talk to friends or family that haven't been heard from? Lastly, having computer skills is very, very important in the real world. Skilled people who have a good knowledge of the computer world can get great jobs like a computer programmer for the state, or they can create websites for their own businesses. Other jobs people with computer experience can have would be an editor of movies or @CAPS2 shows. That's big money there. No wonder schools have computer classes. It's to get students to have a good background of the computer. Computers are not that bad. They teach hand - eye coordination, let people talk to other people online, and can get people great jobs. Although many educated people might claim that computers don't have a positive effect on people, in reality, with proper use, computers bring numerous advantages to our lives.
570	572	1	3	Dear leader of the local newspaper, I have heard the strange misconception that computers are ruining our society. I for one, think that this is a terribly made thought. To begin, the computer holds tons of information that can't be found anywhere else. While books have to be republished as updates occur in the world, anything on the internet can be updated almost instantly. This is beneficial to students with school projects for subjects like @CAPS1. Subsequently, people could actually go to school via online schools and colleges. Whilst regular colleges could cost around thousands of dollars in order to get in, online colleges are much cheaper and affordable to anyone. Also, due to the high amounts of information online, schools seem to be growing obsolete as computers typically hold all information obtained in a regular school year. For example, a student researching a current event in @CAPS1 can get the latest data right away on the internet rather than waiting for a new edition of a textbook. Because of this, computers are definitely beneficial to society. To build up, the internet provided with computers can bring loads of pleasure to those who use it wisely. Because of the growing population of those who use computers, companies tend to make computer shows, which usually attract viewers by the thousands each day. This makes television seem obsolete as well. Another major thing is that software comes out for the computer almost every day, allowing many things to be done by users. Software typically includes games, movies, and music. For instance, a person can enjoy a variety of indie games or stream the latest blockbusters. Finally, since staying in touch with others is a good thing, chatting with others across the globe is very easy and reliable, allowing distant relatives to come in contact with you via various chat programs. Due to this, computers can bring loads of fun to users, and are thus beneficial to society. Lastly, due to the rising demand of computers, companies typically rely on computers for jobs. Since the internet population is growing, companies allow people to fill out applications and send in resumes in order to apply for a job in said company. Also, some jobs can only be done while online or using a computer. Many jobs these days, typically banks, rely on using the internet most of the time, and some actually are based in the internet. Because of this, workers can finish the job easily in one place, instead of having to travel around and go to a boring - looking building to do a boring job. With all of these reasons, I hope you see why computers are beneficial to society. Education just became a whole lot easier thanks to the internet. If education is not what you seek, you can then use the internet to have fun when you are bored. Finally, jobs can be completed even easier, and makes workers more responsible. So, leader of the paper, do you really, along with everyone else, think that computers are a waste of time in life? In conclusion, computers offer a plethora of benefits in education, entertainment, and employment, and are an essential part of modern society.
571	573	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 of the @ORGANIZATION1, there has been a long - standing debate on whether modern computer activities are good for people or bad for them. Some people firmly believe that it benefits society because computers can effectively teach hand - eye coordination. For instance, playing certain action - packed video games requires quick reactions between the hands on the keyboard or controller and the eyes following the on - screen action. They can also help people learn about faraway places, like exploring the ancient ruins of Rome through virtual tours. Moreover, they allow people to interact with friends across the globe in real - time. All of this seems to prove that computers are good for society, but truly it is not. People who use their computers too much can experience some harmful side effects, including obesity, red and irritated eyes, and even become victims of cyber - bullying. People are using computers to an extent where it is clearly bad for their health. The number one problem in the @LOCATION1 is obesity. It is quite evident that people are getting fatter every day. Computers are definitely playing a part in this problem. People are spending excessive time on their computers and are spending less time engaging in physical exercise, enjoying the beauty of nature, and interacting with family and friends face - to - face. These people are sitting for hours and hours in front of a computer screen, gradually getting heavier. They start to eat their feelings because of the loneliness they experience. This vicious cycle continues until the certain person can barely get out of their chair. Obesity is not the only problem that is damaging their health; their eyes are being damaged as well. It is obvious that more and more people are having problems with their eyes every day. Computers are the main culprit for this. When a certain person is on the computer for only an hour, they are causing significant damage to their eyes. The computer screen is straining their eyes horribly, and for the people who are on the computer @NUM1 - @DATE1 hours a day, they are pretty much on the verge of going blind. When I go onto the computer for only @NUM2 minutes, my eyes start to water. It is a truly devastating outcome of using a computer too much. Computers are clearly damaging people's health, and something should be done about it. Although computers aren't only damaging people's health, they are also ruining people's lives. Bullying has been a major problem in the @LOCATION1 for many years. Kids would be bullied all day in school and always had a miserable time. But when they got to go home, they could be comforted by their family and friends. Computers have recently introduced a system where you can video chat with friends or @ORGANIZATION2. This can be a wonderful thing unless used in the wrong way. As I pointed out before, kids are bullied a lot in school, but when they got home, they were able to leave that horrid life behind and be a normal kid. Not anymore. This new @ORGANIZATION2, video chat, @CAPS4, etc. has brought the unlucky bullied students a one - way ticket to getting cyber - bullied. I have heard of a tragic case where a student was cyber - bullied to such an extent that she committed suicide on the internet to show how depressed she was. Computers made that event possible. Video chat, @CAPS3, @CAPS4, etc. gives bullies a chance to make their prey so depressed that they consider suicide. I can understand why you would contradict my argument, but I truly hope that you will be able to understand why this is so important. Obesity, straining the eyes, and cyber - bullying should, in my mind, be enough evidence that computers are bad to get you to write an article about these horrid machines. They are causing a variety of problems in people's health, mind, etc. I really hope you will consider writing this article to raise awareness about these issues.
572	574	1	3	You must be insane! Computers are extremely important to society. My first reason is that computers can be used for in - depth research. Secondly, convenient purchases can be made. Lastly, you can easily talk and have video chats. These are my three solid reasons why computers are important to society. If you want to know more, simply send a message. Firstly, computers can be used for research. For example, what if your boss wants to find the prices of products in a particular market? All you have to do is go to www.google.com, and look it up! It is that straightforward. Also, what if you need to do research on @ORGANIZATION1 for school? Instead of spending hours reading numerous books about him, you can simply type in his name, and there's all the information you need at your fingertips. In @CAPS1, @NUM1 out of @NUM2 kids/adults use the computer for research purposes. This clearly shows the significance of computers in the research field, and this is my first reason. Secondly, purchases can be made with great ease. What if you would like to buy a plane ticket to @LOCATION1 to offer your help? You can go on the computer and buy a ticket at your own convenience, without having to wait in long queues at the ticket counter. You can order all types of essential items that are needed to be sent to @LOCATION1. Or perhaps you want to ensure that a relative or friend can have a special gift delivered right to their doorstep. How much simpler is this than going out and doing it yourself? This is my second reason. Lastly, you can talk and video chat. Suppose you own a business, and you and other people, who are all in different countries, need to have a video meeting. Or what if you have relatives that live far away that you miss a great deal? You can have a warm and engaging video family gathering. This is my last reason. I sincerely hope you consider my reasons why computers are very important to society, as they truly play a vital role in our daily lives.
573	575	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, Computers have a positive effect on people because it effectively teaches them hand - eye coordination, enhances the ability to learn about people and places, and allows for people to entertain themselves in various ways. As I said before, computers are very useful for the advancement of hand - eye coordination. Hand - eye coordination is extremely important in our current world because in order to play sports like tennis or type effectively on a keyboard, you must have good hand - eye coordination. When I was a boy of @NUM1 years old, I had a relatively low level of hand - eye coordination skills, and my performance in sports suffered because of it. Now, after a couple of years of playing online games that require quick reactions, my baseball, lacrosse, and basketball skills have significantly improved. Also, my typing speed has gone up from @NUM2 words - per - minute to @NUM3 words - per - minute. This allows me to write reports faster and gives me more time for thorough revision. But the internet also allows me to search the web to make the research aspect of my report go much faster. Throughout history, people needed to support their opinions with solid evidence. Now, the internet makes it very easy for a person to search and find facts relating to their topic. This kind of help can make school projects easier, make students more knowledgeable, and give an opportunity to help those in need. As I was getting ready to write my @NUM4 position paper this year, I realized I needed @NUM1 specific pieces of information. Usually, this would be difficult, but with the help of computers, research can be made a whole lot easier. Secondly, I learned so much while researching my @CAPS1 @CAPS2. For example, I discovered that in the United States, people don't really directly pick the president. The votes they give actually elect a speculative elector to go to the @CAPS2 to cast the final vote. Finally, as the earthquake in @LOCATION1 occurred, I was able to donate through the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 website, which was very convenient. These examples show how important the internet is to learn about people and places and maybe even give a helping hand. Finally, the last great thing about the internet and computers is that you can entertain yourself through online games and movies. My mom is always telling me I should find ways to entertain myself without dragging her into playing catch with me. The internet and computers allow me to play online games by myself at any time. Secondly, watching movies on computers can be a real time - saver if you want to relax at home. These are the reasons why I believe computers are important for improving eye - hand coordination, learning about different people and places, and the ability to entertain yourself. Though my opinion will only count to myself, I hope you will choose to stress the importance of computers in your future articles to make more people aware of their benefits.
574	576	1	3	"Dear Newspaper, I firmly believe that computers have made a great and far - reaching effect on people in society. I hold this view because they make you smarter, they fulfill entertainment needs, they also give you the option to socialize with others through popular websites, and engage in online chatting. These are things people need in their everyday life, and here's how. One reason why I believe computers benefit people in society is the simple fact that computers are excellent teaching tools. I mean, sure you can pick up a book, but why go through the hassle when with a computer, you can quickly and easily type in what you need to know. Within seconds, you have @NUM1 million sites that can provide you with the information you're looking for. Computers can also vividly show you places that you've always dreamed of seeing and learn about. They can tell you the exact geographical location and detailed information about the area. I know you're thinking to yourself, ""wow, how cool!!"" but that's nothing. Wait until you hear what else I have to say! Computers can give you detailed instructions on how to build stuff, providing step - by - step guidance to create a unique work of art. My second reason is that computers can offer a wide range of entertainment options, like playing exciting games, watching thrilling movies, and catching up on tv shows you missed because you were at work or doing something important. You can stream your favorite shows at your convenience, no matter the time. My last reason why computers benefit society is related to entertainment and socializing. You can make new friends or chat with the ones you have, using websites like facebook, @CAPS1, @CAPS2, etc. Making friends or keeping up with the ones you have in a positive way helps fight depression. If you're always happy and engaged on the computer, interacting with others, you'll have nothing to be depressed about. Also, if you have any questions at all that have been lingering in your mind, ask the computer and it will answer your questions thoroughly, leaving you satisfied with a comprehensive answer. As you can clearly see, computers can do many great things, and what I've said is only a few of the countless things computers are capable of. Just watch, computers will be an even more integral part of our lives in the future, and if you can't use one, you'll definitely have a hard time. Please, if you have a different opinion, consider my points carefully. Thank you for your time and consideration."
575	577	1	3	You say that computers are bad and do not help anyone in their physical life, but that's not entirely true. Some people go on the computer to find useful yoga poses and effective diet tips. These resources can greatly help them both physically, by improving flexibility and fitness through yoga, and mentally, by providing a sense of well - being and self - control over their diet. It's true that computers can sometimes get kids in a lot of trouble. They chat on platforms like (@CAPS1, facebook, twitter, etc...). However, they also don't know who's behind the computer screens. They spend so much time engrossed in that @CAPS1 thing that they don't pay attention to real life itself. But now, let's look at the good parts about the computer. You can easily find things you need, whether it's information about a rare disease for a school project or the best recipe for a special occasion. You can also check travel sites to plan amazing vacations, find the best deals on flights and hotels, etc... So you can't say that the computer is all bad; it helps a lot of people in many different ways. You should really consider the capabilities of the computer. They really do help in life, especially for people that have physical needs. For example, people with limited mobility can use the computer to access important medical information or order necessary supplies without leaving their homes. In conclusion, while there are some negative aspects to computer use, the overall benefits are undeniable, and we should view computers as valuable tools rather than just focusing on the drawbacks.
576	578	1	3	Computers are a ubiquitous tool that almost everyone uses daily, but there comes a time when one should step away and immerse in real - life experiences. Computers do offer certain advantages, such as teaching hand - eye coordination, enabling communication with friends and family, and providing opportunities to learn about distant places and people. However, they also lead people to spend excessive time on the screen, leaving less time for exercise, enjoying nature, and interacting with loved ones. Exercise is crucial in people's lives as it helps keep them in shape and healthy. A significant percentage of obesity cases are caused by excessive computer use. Sitting all day, munching on snacks while glued to the screen becomes a bad habit. Once started, it's hard to break. People often lose track of time when on the computer; they sit for hours, forgetting about their prior plans. It not only reduces the time spent on physical activity but also cuts into the time for enjoying life's simple pleasures. I firmly believe there should be a limit on computer usage so that people can allocate more time to exercise. Many are unaware of the harm it causes, and over time, they become unhealthier and weaker. In conclusion, while computers have their merits, we must strike a balance to lead a healthy and fulfilling life.
577	579	1	3	"Dear Newspaper, I believe that the use of computers is a truly horrible thing for the people of the world. The reason I think so is that people who are overly engrossed in computers don't exercise, fail to enjoy the great outdoors, and miss out on quality time with family and friends. When you're sitting in front of a computer, your body remains inactive. This is a serious problem because this ""lack of exercise"" can significantly shorten one's lifespan. If this trend doesn't stop, more and more children will become overweight and unhealthy. Children seem to care more about the internet than their own well - being. An expert, @PERSON1, stated that ""@PERCENT1 of children in school today are over @NUM1 pounds in grades @NUM2, when the average should be only @NUM3 pounds or less in those grades."" If the computer craze continues, kids will keep staying indoors instead of going outside to have fun. Smart parents want their children to play in the backyard. When children are inside instead of outside, they won't get essential vitamins from the sun. Experts at @ORGANIZATION1 said, ""If children don't stop spending so much time on computers, they'll never experience the true beauty of the outdoors."" Clearly, nature is something children need. Interacting with friends and family is vital for everyone. For instance, if a family member has a health problem and has to go to the hospital, no one is there to support them because they rarely communicate. One year, I learned that my great - grandmother had died of cancer. I had no idea she was sick, and I deeply regret not being with her at the hospital. Don't let such a situation happen to you. Talk and have fun with your friends and family. In conclusion, the excessive use of computers is terrible as it can shorten your life, make your children overweight, and cause you to drift apart from loved ones. So, spread the word and prevent this from happening to others."
578	580	1	3	"What if you want to talk to your family, and a large percentage of people communicate online? That's not necessarily a bad thing. The question is, are you for or against kids and parents spending too much time online? I'm fully in support of online communication. There are several reasons for this. Firstly, many kids have friends they can only talk to online as they can't text or use the phone. It's an easy way for them to stay in touch. In fact, most kids now communicate online. As @ORGANIZATION1 said, ""I think the internet is a great thing. I'd rather have my kids online than outside causing trouble."" A significant number, @NUM1 of @NUM2 kids, are online communicating with others. Secondly, kids often bring home projects and homework that require online research. Wouldn't you prefer your child to look up information accurately online rather than guessing and getting it wrong? I recall a time when I had a school project and guessed on the answers. It didn't do my grade any good. But when I used the internet for the next project, I got a much better grade. Lastly, many people have family members they can only connect with online. Even if you're online often, it's for a good reason - to talk to your family. For example, before I got the internet at home, I hardly talked to my family. But after my son got me connected, I can talk to them every day. Some do argue that people spend too much time on the computer, resulting in less exercise and less time outside. However, it's for a good cause, and it's not permanent. The internet is being used for positive purposes. In conclusion, the internet is a great tool as it allows kids to talk to friends, helps with schoolwork, and enables communication with family. The key is to decide whether you're for or against internet access and make the best choice."
579	581	1	3	Are computers benefiting society? I firmly believe that computers are actually not beneficial to society. In this article, I'll explain how excessive computer use leads to less exercise, less time with family and friends, and less appreciation of nature. If you're someone who loves spending as much time as possible on the computer, think about this: everyone needs a certain amount of exercise to stay fit and healthy. Since the advent of high - tech computers, our country's obesity level has risen. I believe excessive computer use is one of the main causes of this obesity epidemic, which is a major concern in our modern, computer - driven society. Apart from the lack of exercise, you'll also have less time for face - to - face interaction with family and friends. While you can communicate with family on Facebook, face - to - face interaction is a basic human need. Your family will always be there for you, but you need to build a strong relationship through in - person communication. The same goes for friends; having a good relationship with them is essential. Lastly, everyone should experience the beauty of nature. It's a shame to be stuck inside just to be on the computer. Despite the wonders of nature being accessible to all, @NUM1 of people don't take the opportunity to enjoy it. Being outside and having a good time is crucial for our well - being. However, none of this will happen if you're glued to your computer for long hours. In conclusion, computers are not benefiting society as people are getting less exercise, less social interaction, and less exposure to nature. We should prioritize these aspects of life over excessive computer use.
580	582	1	3	With just a click of a mouse, you can access the vast world of the internet. Computers and the internet are relatively recent innovations that have become a common sight in households. They've undergone significant improvements and gained immense popularity in the last twenty years. I firmly believe they bring great benefits to society. Computers offer an easy way to learn and communicate. Imagine life in @DATE1 without computers; it would be vastly different. I doubt I could have written such an excellent research paper without the help of a computer. The internet is a treasure trove of useful sources, including databases, encyclopedias, and articles. You can find information on almost any topic. With a computer, all you need to do is search for key words, and you'll quickly get what you're looking for. It's much faster than flipping through multiple books. Once you find the information, you can copy it into a @CAPS1 @CAPS2 document and print it out with ease. Another major benefit of computers is communication. Over the past few years, I've realized its importance. A family I've been close to my whole life moved to @LOCATION1 due to job opportunities. Thanks to the internet, I've been able to stay in touch with them. I'm sure many others have had similar experiences. Whether it's through email, @ORGANIZATION1 instant messenger, or Facebook, people can communicate with others worldwide. It's more convenient than having to coordinate phone calls. Without this global connection, our lives would be very different. Computers have also revolutionized the medical field. Scientists and doctors can discover new things and keep up with the latest advances. Doctors use computers to plan and perform surgical procedures, which has improved medical research and diagnosis, saving countless lives. @PERCENT1 of disease - related research tests use computers to analyze data. In conclusion, the technology of computers has had a profound positive impact on society. It connects people globally and aids in learning. I hope you can see how computers have shaped and enhanced our world today.
581	583	1	3	"Dear Local Newspaper, I wholeheartedly agree with the experts regarding people spending too much time on the computer. The reasons are clear: family and friends become distant, mood swings can occur, and there's also the issue of being overweight. Finally, computers can do a lot of things, but to an excessive degree. When you're on the computer too much, your family will start to worry deeply about you. If you were to stay glued to a computer for a whole day, it causes people to form a negative impression of how you are. Also, if you were to stay inside on a beautiful weekend and your friends come over but you say, ""I don't wanna go out"", they're just drifting away slowly. Since I am a teen, I usually stay up texting, talking, and going outside. I really hate to see one of my friends on the computer when I wanna hang out. When I was 12 or 13, I used to always be on the computer for like days to weeks, until my friends and family firmly said don't let this get to you. I had a friend who was a good athlete and very funny and nice, but when his mom got him a computer, I gradually didn't want to be his friend. When I was 13, I used to get mad at everything if I couldn't use the computer; it was like I was a total brat. Also, I used to be big (as in overweight) because I never went outside to exercise or even just be in my own room. The reason I stopped being his friend was that he would get extremely mad if I came over there to ask if he could come outside. Also, when he did come outside, he used to never do anything or run because he was always utterly tired. What I am trying to say is the computer can really change people in a lot of bad ways. The last thing which makes everyone change is what computers can do now. For example, a game called Call of Duty can get you addicted incredibly fast, and you barely do anything else. Another bad thing is Facebook; sure, you keep in touch with friends but if you stay on too long, it's basically hooked you into it. Lastly, online chatting rooms or games when you can create a person to look like you makes you think that's gonna be your life from now on. Also, people think that computers can do anything, but it really can't. Everything a computer can do is like a drug; it's addicting. Well, I just gave you a little overview of a lot of things a computer can do. To refresh your memory, I'll say it again. A reason why I agree is that family and friends seem distant to you at times, you get mood swings, and there's less exercising. Lastly, what a computer could do now. Since you know now of the dangers that can happen, I suggest you seriously rethink about computers and their impact on your life."
582	584	1	3	Dear newspaper, I firmly disagree with you about computers. I truly think that computers are extremely helpful with projects, homework, or letters. For example, you can use a computer to assist you with projects. If you have a project to do and you don't feel like making the trip to the library, you can conveniently use a computer to look up information on just about anything. And you don't have to painstakingly draw pictures; that's what printers are for. Also, when you have homework, most kids, teenagers, and even adults don't like doing it. That's where a computer comes in handy. You can just look up the answer online and then you're done in no time. Let's say you have to write an essay. I know nobody likes to write essays by hand. You can type quickly and design creatively with your own unique designs and make it look nicer than if you were writing it. Furthermore, I know nobody likes to keep up with loose papers, and if you lose one, then you have to start over, and that takes forever to do, especially if it's due the next day. You get bored and you don't feel like writing it over, and you get mad because you already did it. And when you had it in your hands, you mysteriously find your other paper that you finished and lost, and it makes you so angry. And then you have to worry about if someone stole it and copied it and put their name on the copied one but changed some of your ideas around so that they wouldn't lose major points, and your grade drops from an A to a C in no time flat. Lastly, you can use a computer to write all kinds of letters. You can write a parent - teacher note and people's report cards if you're a teacher, and you can also write a letter to a friend that might have moved away. Therefore, the types of letters you should be writing are love letters to your wife or girlfriend at work or in school, and you can write them fast too instead of writing it slowly and then your hand starts to cramp in the worst kind of way. So instead, you can write it fast, and they can get it fast if they have a computer. But if they work at a school, then they can get it because every school should have a computer so they'll be able to receive it. Another kind of letter you can write is a letter to your friend that you haven't seen in years or that has moved to another country or to another state. So I hope now I have convinced you about why it is essential to have a computer. But as you said, it isn't always good to be on the computer all the time, but once in a while, it's okay, especially in an emergency. If someone has just died in your family and you don't know how to get there and you don't have a gas map, you can go online and print out the directions so that you can get there and see which family member passed away. Now that you know the importance of a computer, I hope you use it wisely.
583	585	1	3	"Dear Newspaper, Computers! Computers! Computers! Computers seem to be the talk of the year. Many people believe that computers are needed for everyday life, but I would have to strongly disagree. In my opinion, we do not need computers. The effects computers have on kids and adults are truly astonishing. Humans today are not spending as much time in nature and exercising for a healthy body and a healthy planet. Also, as us kids are growing up, we have too many unearned advantages because of computers. Thirdly, so much money is being used towards computers and not what's truly important! As you can see, these three reasons alone should persuade anyone to believe that computers are harmful to all areas of life. First off, as we continue to use computers, our natural environment is going to waste. The effects on nature and people are truly horrible. Pollution is being spread all over the planet! People are becoming alarmingly addicted to computers. I know it will surprise you when I tell you that the average person spends about ten hours on a computer a day! This is about half the day! This is a terrifying effect on people because now these computers are brain - washing us! Instead of going on the computer all day, we should be going outside to enjoy the fresh air and the warm sun. Moreover, computers have us sitting inside all day and not getting any exercise, which is a significant health issue. We need to learn about the little things and be thankful for what we already have! Consequently, banning computers would have a positive effect. Today, many are losing their ability to write by hand, forgetting about the simple things life has to offer. Would writing an essay with a pencil and paper be so bad? This might be old - fashioned, but there are an enormous amount of great effects for using pen and paper. Maybe, the United States would become smarter and contain more knowledge. By writing everything out is proven to help remember important facts easier and for a longer amount of time. Writing on paper is like writing it in your brain. Therefore, students, children, and adults would benefit by having better handwriting. Since most information is typed on the computer, people are forgetting how to write neatly, clearly, and responsibly. Mrs. Smith is an English teacher that has been with the Lincoln school since before computers. She has seen the horrible effects taking place on her students right before her eyes. Mrs. Smith told me, ""Sadly, students are completely absorbed in computers and have no life, energy, or reactiveness in them anymore! Kids have too many advantages with computers and not taking the time to learn the basics. Last, but most definitely not least is my third reason as to why computers are affecting humans negatively. Humans are spending huge amounts of money on getting the latest computer technology. Most of people's paychecks are being used for their computers. These fancy computers are very expensive, but also very useless. In my opinion, many people are just following a trend. Instead, the money can be spent on schools, and especially the wars! Do you hear the humming of the computer, the clicking of the buttons? Realize that these sounds are not what you should be spending your money on! To wrap it up, computers affect people in many negative ways. There are many reasons to support this, but here are three. One is that people are not spending any time in nature! Another is that people of all ages are becoming brainwashed by this electronic device and not spending the time to learn things in quality. Thirdly, people are using all their money on those computers! I know some people think computers are very useful, but I know now, after you have read this article, you know how unuseful computers really are and how they are detracting from a more fulfilling and healthy life."
584	586	1	3	Dear newspaper editor, In my opinion, computers have a highly positive effect on people. The Internet allows people to communicate easily and effectively. People can learn about things, places, even their own family history. I also think that with an appropriate dosage, it could help your body. If the Internet was never invented, how would you talk to people from around the world? Mr. editor, what if you were fourteen and had no friends. Well, you could always go on myspace.com, facebook.com, or any other online community and make friends. Another thing that could happen is a family member or friend goes to another country for a vacation and can't make long - distance calls. You can talk to them on Skype or something like that. If you're not really into using the Internet for communication, you could use it to learn. With the Internet, you can learn a vast amount of information. You can even go to school online. As I was saying, you can learn about anything. One time when I had a project at school on Frederick Douglass, I used the Internet for help. I learned about his family, his childhood, where he's from, and lots of other important facts. The Internet can be a great search engine, but don't stay on for too long; your body needs you to take breaks. I think the Internet can also improve your health. People always say if you stay on the computer, you get fat and unhealthy, but I don't think that. First, being on a computer using the mouse is helping your hand - eye coordination. You can also look at diet plans, find medicine for your health, or find new ways to exercise your body. So that's why I think the Internet can help your body. All of these reasons are why I think the Internet has good effects on people. We should embrace the Internet in a balanced way to fully enjoy its benefits and enhance our lives.
585	587	1	3	More and more people use computers. In fact, about 80% of Americans have computers, and everyone uses them. I think they are very good to have because you can use them for emailing, jobs, and schoolwork. This is why I think having a computer is a good thing. What do you think? As I was saying, computers are great for emailing, even instant messaging. Let's say you play baseball and you forgot what time your game is. You can just push that power button and quickly email your coach asking what time you need to be at the field. Also, there's instant messaging; it's when you can talk to your friends online. It's a great way to communicate and meet new people. Emailing is amazing; it's so high - tech. You can email one of your family members who live thousands of miles away from you. I once did that. My aunt Lisa was in Florida, and I asked her to send me pictures of the water and the beaches, and she did. They were truly eye - catching. Next, the reason why computers are good to have is for jobs. In today's world, everything is run by computers. For example, cash registers, ATMs, and cars are all run off of computers. So having it for a job is extremely beneficial. Let's say your boss tells you to fax over a copy. You can do it from the computer within a minute. I know my dad's job requires a lot of paperwork, and he keeps it all organized on his desktop on his laptop. This is why most jobs have computers. Do you have one at your job? Lastly, computers are invaluable for school. For example, my teacher uses his computer to take attendance, assign homework, and grade papers. If he didn't have that, he would be completely lost. It's also good for the kids too. Every week in social studies, we have to look up the presidents, and I use my laptop for that. Did you know there is a program where you can look at your grades and missing assignments? It's called PowerSchool. Computers are great for school. I think everyone should have one. So what do you think about them? Are they amazing or what? I think they are very helpful because you can use them for emailing, working, and schoolwork. If it wasn't for computers, we wouldn't really know as much as we do now. About 80% of Americans have them. Computers are gonna help you through life a lot. Welcome to the digital age where computers are an essential part of our daily lives, and we should make the most of their capabilities.
586	588	1	3	"Dear the newspaper, Computers are truly remarkable resources and are incredibly helpful in numerous ways. Since we have the advanced technology, why not make full use of it? Computers offer us simple yet highly useful programs like Microsoft Word or Photoshop, outstanding capabilities to look up any information you desire, and the means to keep in touch with far - away relatives using platforms like Facebook or video chats such as Skype. Can you imagine that you were just about to finish an essay for school when you misspelled a word and had to start all over? Well, this was what happened frequently when computers weren't around and you had to rely on a typewriter. Unlike a typewriter, computers have programs such as Microsoft Word, where if you make a simple mistake, all you have to do is press the backspace key. With programs like this, creating essays and flyers is extremely easy. There are also a lot of other programs like PowerPoint, Photoshop, or video - editing software. These operate in real - time. You can simply insert your camera chip into your computer and, ""voila,"" instant editing is possible. Programs that you can download make life a whole lot simpler and save you a significant amount of time. Along with the programs to write a paper, you can use the internet and Google to obtain the information! All you have to do is type in a short phrase and instantly get thousands of sites, all packed with information. And instead of spending ten minutes in a dictionary.com, you can find the word in a split second. I took a tally and 8 out of every 10 kids use the internet at least once a day! Let's say you had a party coming up, but had nothing creative to cook for food. Just type in ""creative foods for a party"" and you will easily have hundreds of new recipes to choose from. The internet is an extraordinary invention that is very simple and helpful to use. Another fantastic thing to use on a computer is social connections such as MySpace, Facebook, or Skype. This is a great way to catch up with old friends from high school or college, or plan a big event while being relaxed at home. If you had soccer practice at night so you couldn't hang out with friends, but still had time to do a quick chat, this is perfect. Skype and other video chats are amazing. They are very convenient when you need to speak with someone all the way in Australia for business and don't want to travel. All you have to do is open a link and ""bam,"" they're right there! These are great for businesses and long - distance relationships. I have an uncle and aunt who live in Australia and we use Skype to keep in touch. It's a fantastic way to communicate across the globe. Computers may make us ""look"" lazy, but they give us a lot. They save time and allow us to have the convenience to run around and get exercise. Computers have amazing programs that help us in all ways, the internet for quick information, and social connections to keep in touch with family, friends, and businesses. Computers are one of the most convenient things we have and I strongly suggest you would agree with me."
587	589	1	3	Dear @LOCATION1, I firmly believe that going on the computer has a positive effect on people. It is an undeniable fact that some people are not getting enough exercise. To address the issue of not getting enough exercise, we should engage in sports or participate in family activities to at least get out of our houses. Everybody needs to stop being lazy and get active. I think that an exercise day should be established and turned into a tradition. It could be twice a year, or more frequently, like once a month. Whatever the frequency is picked, as long as there is one day when people in @LOCATION2 or even more than @LOCATION2 can exercise on. By doing so, we can strike a balance between the benefits of computer use and the importance of physical activity.
588	590	1	3	I use the computer all the time and I'm healthy. Just because you use a computer more than getting exercise doesn't mean you're not healthy. I think computers help a great deal in life. Now I will talk about some of the things that computers help out with in life. Computers are very useful for finding out what the weather is like and everything you need to know. It will even assist you if you have a job and don't know what time to clock in to avoid wasting time. Computers are also a source of fun. You can visit different websites and play any games you like. You can also talk to people on them. Or receive emails, which is like getting real mail but from a computer. However, there may be some issues. People are using them too much. They need to get more exercise. So, that's what I think of computers. Hopefully, people will get more exercise now and enjoy the benefits of both a healthy body and the convenience of computers.
589	591	1	3	Dear, Since so many people in the world use computers, we all know what computers are used for, like searching the internet, playing games, doing work, and for school. Some people think that computers are good to use to help teach hand - eye coordination, learn about other places in the world, and talk with other people online. I am in 8th grade at Mystic Middle School. I think that computers are not as good as some people think. Have you ever heard of computer camps? This is where some kids go because they are addicted to the computer. At this camp, the kids are pulled away from the computer and pretty much forced to join groups that do activities like fishing or working together to solve a mystery. This camp is pretty much known as a reliable solution for kids that are addicted to the computer. Another reason that computers are bad is because of the internet. The internet is a very dangerous place because you can chat to people that you don't even know. You never know, the people could be mentally unstable. And they might try to find out where you live and come after you. So you always have to be careful who you talk to; otherwise, you could get into trouble. Nothing ever really goes right with computers; they always get slower and slower every time you use them. About every two years, a kid or parent could go through a computer. Also, if your computer doesn't have the right protection, it could get a virus and cost a person a few hundred dollars to get it fixed. Anything could happen at any time with your computer; out of nowhere, it could just die and not work, and all of your data will be gone forever. Now that I have explained my stance on computers, people will think differently. Would you want to end up like one of those people who are in a camp because they are on the computer too much? Or you never know, you could disappear forever and never be found. I already know how much it costs for computers to get fixed, but you might have to find out the hard way. That is why I think that computers just cause more trouble for people.
590	592	1	3	Do you honestly believe that Computers don't benefit society? Well, they definitely do. Computers are excellent tools for re - connecting with people. They also offer a fabulous search engine and the ability to watch videos. Computers are increasingly becoming an integral part of the human lifestyle. Computers help you re - connect with people. My mom uses Facebook and she found friends she hasn't seen since the early 1990s! It's a great tool to communicate with your friends in your daily life. Also, you can use your webcam to have video chats and actually see them. Therefore, computers benefit society in terms of social connection. Computers also have the best search engines. Doing research for a paper on Ancient Greece? Google and Wikipedia are all you need. They can basically provide you with all the material for an A - grade paper. If your newspaper hasn't arrived yet, the internet can offer you the news and more! The only place to get millions of songs free for your iPod or phone is on the computer. It is one of the greatest electronics ever invented. The amazing computers also allow you to watch videos on the internet. You want to have a real good laugh? Well, YouTube is where you should go. You can also learn about history, today's lifestyle, and more. If you want, you yourself can upload videos too! It's a great site, and great computers truly benefit society. After my essay, I can honestly say that computers benefit society in multiple ways. Computers help re - connect with people, have a fabulous search engine, and enable video watching. Computers are growing daily, helping the user get the most satisfaction. They are indeed very beneficial to society.
591	593	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I think spending too much time on a computer is indeed bad. One of the key reasons is related to exercising. People should be outside, jogging briskly or working out vigorously and truly enjoying the beauty of nature. Moreover, they should also be actively socializing with friends, sharing laughter and experiences. Now, my second reason is about spending quality time with your family. Being with your family is extremely important because they are a source of endless fun to go out with. Also, they are wonderful to socialize with, whether at home or any other place. Sometimes, socializing with people on a computer is not as good as interacting with real - life people because socializing with friends and family is much easier than sitting on a chair, typing a bunch of words to explain the conversation you're having. And last, my final reason is being active. People should be active because it's a lot of fun, and you're socializing with people while playing sports. It keeps you fit and healthy. Also, being active can strengthen your lungs and heart. For example, football keeps your legs strong and well - built, and basketball keeps you quick and constantly on the move. It's good for you because being active gives you a healthier, stronger, and well - shaped body. So, therefore, I firmly think spending a lot of time on a computer is bad.
592	594	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, it might @MONTH1 be true that computers @MONTH1 make people exercise less, enjoy nature less, and spend time with family and friends less, but computers do benefit the society in numerous ways. Computers are a great aid for students with their homework and projects, and they also enhance communication among people. Besides the telephone, which has its own role, computers have some drawbacks too. Students need computers to help them complete their homework and class projects efficiently. They can assist students in creating excellent presentations, and students can use the vast resources of the internet for in - depth research. Having computers will surely help raise a student's grades and pave the way for a more successful life in the future. Parents and kids can communicate with long - distance friends and/or relatives, and they can also talk to co - workers, bosses, teachers of their kids, and with their own children/parents. Having computers would greatly increase communication with some people and help maintain close contact with family members. Besides all of the good things, computers do have bad qualities. They can lead to children accidentally seeing inappropriate sites, and there's also the risk of getting a virus that crashes your computer! Most of the programs designed to get rid of viruses also block children and adults from seeing inappropriate sites (like gambling, pornography, etc). We need a computer that is pre - installed with the best up - to - date virus protection system, which helps protect children, teens, and adults from viruses, inappropriate sites, and cyber - bullies. Having these features will make a computer almost perfect! The computers everyone needs should help students learn, keep enhancing communication between people, and be pre - uploaded with programs to protect people from viruses, bad websites, and cyber - bullies. Computers are an essential part of our lives, and without them, our lives would be extremely difficult and unfulfilled.
593	595	1	3	Dear, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 I think people need to clearly distinguish between the virtual world of computers and the real world. There are a lot of people spending too much time on the computer and not spending enough time with their families or doing things that are truly important. While you're on the computer, you're not getting any exercise; you're not getting stronger; you're just sitting idly. That's one of the main ways people gain weight because they're not moving around, just sitting still. When you're on the computer all day, every day, you're missing out on what's happening with your family; you miss out on all the important moments and events. I think people need to cut down on their computer time, get some exercise, or call one of your cousins, brothers, or even your mom and find out what's really going on because they are the ones who truly matter! But you really can't tell people exactly how long they're allowed to spend on the computer; you can only give an opinion and hope they listen. By making small changes in their computer usage, people can lead a more balanced and fulfilling life.
594	596	1	3	"Dear Local Newspaper, Technology is really a fascinating aspect of life, isn't it? Take a computer for example. They can quickly check information online, give people the opportunity to learn in - depth about far - away places and people, and even enable seamless communication. This absolutely brings great benefits to society. Well, it makes life a lot more convenient, easier, and faster for people. Don't you agree? Do you ever forget what your homework was or what time an event starts and ends? Well, you can always check information online, @CAPS3 you ever forget! So there, you can stay on task and get ready early. For example, if you need to know what time a movie starts at the movie theatre, you can simply check online! Also, if you forget the steps of how to do something on your project or homework, you can check online! So whenever a student forgets, he can check online instead of coming to school the next day and saying, ""@CAPS1 I didn't know what to do,"" or, ""@CAPS1, I forgot how to do it."" @CAPS2 you ever want to travel to places but knew nothing about the place? Or how much would it cost? Or have you ever wanted to learn about a famous person, for example, @PERSON1? Instead of going to the library and painstakingly reading through all those books to learn something, you can just go online! There are millions and millions of detailed websites about places and people. Therefore, it makes it much easier to learn about a certain place, person, or thing. The computer can be really helpful and useful. Plus, you can plan a vacation to a place and be sure you will have enough money by accurately checking the price online! So you won't have to worry that you won't have enough money when you get there. @CAPS2 you ever want to communicate with your friends all day long without wasting minutes? In fact, you can communicate with multiple friends on the computer. For example, chat rooms can reach up to hundreds of people. Therefore, you won't have as much trouble trying to communicate to all your friends at a time on the computer than on the phone. Also, you can communicate with people around the world. This includes your family members or relatives etc. @CAPS3 they live on the other side of the @LOCATION1. Plus, @CAPS3 you have not seen them for a while or haven't talked to them, you can webcam or video - chat with each other. Keeping in contact with important people or your friends is a great thing. The effects that computers have on people are really something you should be grateful for. You can check information about something @CAPS3 you ever forget. You have the ability to learn about people and places easily, and you can communicate with your family and friends effectively, making our lives more connected and informed."

596	598	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, you ever just wanna go outside and play a game of football with the ones you love? Well, I know I do, @CAPS2. I believe that almost @PERCENT1 of kids are on the computer @NUM1 because they have nothing to do or it is addicting. The reason that I believe in this strongly true statement is that people are concerned about how much time people spend on the computer and not with their families. One important fact about kids being on the computer is how dangerous it can be. Nowadays, kids don't realize how dangerous being online can be. For example, I remember a time when my cousin said that he went to the movies to meet up with some girl he met on MySpace, but all he saw was a bald-headed, sex offender. That person told him he was the one talking to him online and wanted my cousin to go over to his house and play Xbox. My cousin screamed ""hell no"" and left to my house because the movie theater was closer to my house. Now, being safe is important. Would you rather have your children safe with you or with some stranger? Computers can also be helpful at times when needed for school or your job. Only some people would think it's fun to stay home and go on the computer for no reason. Secondly, don't you want to spend time with your children before they go to college or something? Just the littlest thing like playing a game of football will affect them and create a better bond with you and your child. Something you can do to get them to go outside with you is take the computer away for a week and have fun with your child. Play some of his/her favorite sports. So, without the computer, you can build a bond with you and your child. So, the time has come to decide: let your kid be lazy on the computer and get into trouble, or go have fun with them?"
597	599	1	3	"There has been a debate whether computers benefit society or hurt society. I personally agree with the statement that computers benefit society. I think that computers do improve your hand - eye coordination. When you can type fast and accurately, you know your hand - eye coordination is doing well. I remember as a kid, I would watch my grandmother type about seventy - five words per minute. Just from her years of practice, she became very computer - coordinated. My hand - eye coordination is becoming a lot better because I have typed for a long time. Scientists say that @PERCENT2 of people that type for at least four years become better hand - eye coordinated. Typing fast keeps your fingers quick and agile. I once read a book on computers, and an expert said, ""the invention of the computer keyboard could possibly be the greatest hand - eye coordination practice ever."" Another great thing about computers is that they allow you to learn about far - away places without really going there. In school, you can do projects on other countries without traveling, just by using a computer. I once had to do a class project on @LOCATION1 and got a @PERCENT1 just by using a computer. People can look up information on countries for pleasure too. My mom just wanted to learn about @LOCATION2, so she just looked it up on the internet from her computer. You can research schools too. My older sister went online to look at colleges without actually traveling to the actual college states. Finally, one more thing you can do on a computer is talk to people online. There is such a thing as @CAPS2 - mail which allows you to write to people over the internet on the computer. I remember when my baseball coach was going to tell me I made the team, he just @CAPS2 - mailed my parents because it was the most simple way to get it done. There is also such a thing as @CAPS4 (instant messaging) that allows you to immediately talk to somebody and for them to immediately talk back to you. I remember I used to go on @CAPS4 every day to talk to friends. Also, you can video chat, which allows you to directly see somebody and actually talk to them physically. I read a news article on video chatting, and an expert said, ""video chatting is the single best way to communicate with someone without being right in front of them talking with them."" These reasons clearly show why I think computers are a big help in our society."
598	600	1	3	Dear People of the Newspaper, I think that computers are good in some ways, like to look something up about the other side of the world. For instance, if you have to do a paper on a topic related to the other side of the world, a computer is up - to - date, unlike a book. So, computers have a good effect on school kids and work. However, most people spend all day talking to people on them and don't go outside and get fresh air. So, computers have bad effects on some people and good effects on others. They are all needed for work and such. I think that most people use computers too much for talking to people and for gaming. But some people don't go on it for a long time and go outside. They use a computer only if they have to for work. The effects of computers are that too many people overuse them on Facebook and stuff like that, where they could go outside, sit on a swing, text, and get fresh air. In conclusion, while computers offer many benefits, we should be aware of the potential negative impacts of over - use and strive for a balanced approach.
599	601	1	3	Technology is advancing every day. One main technological device that is popular is the computer. More and more people are using them; however, not everyone agrees that it benefits society. I believe that it does benefit us. One reason is that you can explore things at home. Before computers, you would have to go to the library, find the book you need, and then search through it until you found the information you needed. Those things alone could take hours, especially if you don't live near a library. However, with computers, you could just type it in on a search engine and find what you're looking for. That could save you gas money because you don't have to drive anywhere. Another reason is that you can communicate online for free. Without a computer, you would either have to go see that person by driving, talking on the phone, or texting, which are all expensive. On the computer, you have e - mail, @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and many more. All of them allow you to communicate in different ways. If you want to look at pictures, take quizzes, play games, or talk, that's @CAPS2. And finally, for e - mail, you can send people letters, videos, or you can just talk to other people by typing, just like with all the others. In conclusion, the computer's ability to save time, money, and provide diverse communication methods clearly shows that it is a beneficial technological device for society.
600	602	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, as you @MONTH1 know, computers are not only very helpful machines. Computers supply a large amount of people with online education. On the computer, you can learn anything. In fact, my cousin @PERSON2 earned his degree in accounting through an online college. @PERSON2 now has a well - paying job in accounting. Without the computer, people would not be where they are in life right now. Not to mention, just @DATE1, I was assigned to complete a history paper on @LOCATION2. All I had to do was do around an hour's amount of research on @LOCATION2's culture and history. I received a good grade on my paper. Computers are very helpful in helping people learn. Which brings me to my next point, computers teach hand - eye coordination and creativity. The computer has many different and useful features. The computer integration, as @PERSON1 said, is sophisticated. It not only allows you to be creative in your own way but also gives you good hand - eye coordination. Many people are drawn to the creativity and benefits they get from using a computer. @DATE1, studies have shown that @PERCENT1 of people say computers are a great way to communicate without physical contact. The computer is not just a tool; it supplies people with boosts in creativity and hand - eye coordination and is also a main way of communication. So, @LOCATION1, to all the @CAPS6 editors, writers, and readers, computers are helpful machines. Those who miss out on using a computer are missing out on a lot. In conclusion, the multiple benefits of computers in education, skill - building, and communication make them an essential part of modern life.
601	603	1	3	"Dear @LOCATION1 @CAPS1, @CAPS2 are high - tech devices that allow us to connect with friends and family in other places like France or @LOCATION2. They provide a convenient way to stay in touch, whether it's through video calls or instant messaging. They also allow us to research new information, perhaps for a school project. We can access a vast amount of knowledge from various sources with just a few clicks. And let's not forget about the addicting games that can be a source of entertainment. Computers have modernized our life, but it's a double - edged sword. Their effect on human beings is despicable. We have taken these simple devices too far and haven't used them in moderation. Did you know that at least an hour of @MONEY1 exercise is needed every day? Well, @CAPS3 from all over the world are not getting enough exercise because of @MONEY1 computers. Parents' hard - earned money is being wasted away on these extremely expensive computers. They can pay anywhere from @NUM1! What a waste of @MONEY1 money! @PERCENT1 @MONEY1 kidnappings are caused because of @MONEY1 too much information on the internet. Do you want that for your child? Computers were once helpful devices that have now turned into @CAPS4 warping machines. @PERCENT2 @MONEY1 the world's @CAPS3 are obese today. Why are they obese, you ask? @CAPS3 are growing fast; they are meant to be active and playful. Without any active sport like dancing or basketball, they are going to grow big. Kids spend as much as @NUM2 hours a day on a @CAPS2 and are not keeping active. @CAPS2 pull kids in like a magnet. This obsessive @CAPS2 time leaves no time to keep healthy, active, and fit. I remember one time when one of @MONEY1 my friends, @PERSON1, got a new computer. She wouldn't come out and play basketball with us anymore; she just stayed inside. Eventually, Sally became obese and got diabetes. Parents, is this what you want for your @CAPS3? Do you want to pay for a machine that makes your @CAPS3 extremely unhealthy? Times are tough, money is tight, and electronics are expensive. A @CAPS2 can cost anywhere from @MONEY4 to even @MONEY3; that is a ton of @MONEY1 money. Parents work hard hours, for example, @NUM3; that is a long day, and they probably don't make enough money to be wasting it on a @CAPS2. An average household spends @MONEY2 on computers in a lifetime. Do you really want to be buying your @CAPS3 a machine that costs an outrageous amount of @MONEY1 money that will only make your @CAPS3 unhealthy and pull them away from their sports? I remember when my mom bought me a new @CAPS2 for @NUM4 dollars, and the next day it broke. What a waste of @MONEY1 money. Help your @CAPS3, don't buy a @NUM2,000 - dollar @CAPS2, keep your @CAPS3 active and healthy. Make sure your green stays in your wallet. Hey, a small window pops up on your screen. ""Who are you?"" you respond in an anxious voice. ""@CAPS7, your friend @CAPS8's friend,"" says the little window. You respond with an @CAPS7 ""hi."" ""Hey, you want to come over? It's the cool thing,"" @CAPS9. ""Ok,"" you respond. What's wrong with this situation? Well, a lot of @MONEY1 things are wrong, but this happens to @PERCENT3 @MONEY1 online chatters. Just remember, online you can be whoever you want to be. You could be only ten, but say you're @NUM6. So many @CAPS3 are kidnapped because of @MONEY1 online chatting. You can talk to your @CAPS3 all you want, but it doesn't mean they won't be in that situation. The less time your child spends on the @CAPS2, the less chance they will have of @MONEY1 being kidnapped. The @CAPS2 is so dangerous. Would you ever put your child in danger? Computers used to be helpful devices full of @MONEY1 information, enjoyment, and talks with aunts, uncles, and even your friend @PERSON2. Now these computers have transformed into persuading boxes full of harmful side - effects. Do you want your child to feel the wind in their ears, the sound of their heart pumping vigorously, and the smell of grass, or do you want them to experience the bright screen in their eyes and the thrill of just beating level @NUM7? Do you want to spend @MONEY1 on unhealthy contraptions? And lastly, do you want your @CAPS3 put in danger by simply just using a @CAPS2 at home? Computers are @CAPS4 morphing devices that take away @CAPS3's points in life. Do you want that for them? In conclusion, we must be cautious about our computer use, especially when it comes to our children, to protect their health and safety."
602	604	1	3	"@ORGANIZATION2, there are @CAPS1 many reasons why the computer technology benefits the society. For starters, the newspaper companies use computers to write the @ORGANIZATION2 paper. They can type up articles quickly, edit them easily, and format them for a professional look. Personally, I believe that computers benefit the society for many reasons. Computers help with education, career building, and help people connect with family. By reading this letter, I hope that this makes computers appealing to you. One reason why people benefit from computers is how they help with education. In a poll taken at @ORGANIZATION1, @PERCENT1 of the students say that computers help them with their academic career. They can use computers to research topics, write papers, and even take online courses. Also, many adults use computers for an education too. In the student body in the class of '@NUM1 at @CAPS2 high school, most of the students quit school before they could finish senior year. @PERCENT2 of those students finished their high school and college years through online classes. These online classes offer flexibility and access to a wider range of courses. Another reason how computers benefit the society is by helping with careers. At @CAPS3 industries, @PERSON1, the @CAPS4, says, ""I don't know where our business would be if we didn't use computers."" According to a poll taken by @CAPS4's of many high - running industries, @PERCENT3 said that their business revolves around the internet. This could very well be the poll your @CAPS4 took. Computers help businesses with tasks such as inventory management, customer service, and marketing. Finally, computers help families that are separated connect with each other. A marine said that he tries to contact his family as much as he can while he is at sea. Through video calls and messaging, he can stay in touch with his loved ones. If anyone deserves to contact their family that they haven't seen in two years, it should definitely be the people in the army. In conclusion, the computer technology has benefited many people. A system that could regulate people's computer use could be implemented, but it would not make anybody happy. The changes could be made, but if anyone tried to take something important away, would you not do anything to stop it? In the end, we should embrace the benefits that computers bring while being mindful of their proper use."
603	605	1	3	Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, I believe that if you allow yourself to use the @CAPS5 @CAPS2 for @NUM1 minutes a day at the most, that will allow you plenty of time to go outside and exercise. Using the @CAPS5 is fine in moderation, but if you are constantly on the @CAPS5, it can't be healthy @CAPS2. You (unless it's your job) should only be on the @CAPS5 @CAPS2 for @NUM1 minutes to an hour a day! Some people are on the @CAPS5 so much that their eyes get worse and worse. Not only does it affect your physical health, but it also takes a toll on your well - being. There are some stories of blood - shot eyes, pink eye, or even @CAPS4. This is a very serious issue. The people who are like this are called @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7. According to @CAPS8 @CAPS9 @CAPS10, over @PERCENT1 of people say they know or are someone who is a @CAPS5 addict, and scientists say in the next year that number will double or even triple. I know that people need to use the @CAPS5 @CAPS2 for things such as email, projects, ideas, or even models. But really, does anybody read a book anymore? Reading a book can be a more relaxing and beneficial activity for your mind and eyes compared to constantly staring at a screen. In conclusion, we should limit our @CAPS5 use to maintain our health and well - being and not let it completely replace other important activities.
604	606	1	3	Dear newspaper, In my opinion, I believe that kids and adults spend more than enough time on their computers. I can see how it benefits you in some ways, but it keeps you away from health, being outdoors, and exercising. It also can have an effect on your eyes in your later life. People go on @ORGANIZATION1, @LOCATION1, and @CAPS1 search engines, and a little more than half of those site's results are fake. Those false results can mislead people and cause problems, especially in academic or professional settings. And the more people go on computers, the easier it is to get caught plagiarizing, and that is a big thing in the community. Those are some ideas, but I have some more, don't worry, and details to go along with those ideas. People need fresh air, exercise for their body, and to enjoy the outdoors. You can do all of that stuff if you just get off the computer. And instead of searching the places online and what they're all about, just go visit them. You will get fresh air, exercise, and experience. And after having that experience, you will pass it on, the real experience. Other people will not get any of that fake stuff. For example, you can search @CAPS2 online, and they just have pictures of food. But if you take a visit there, you will get to really taste the food. Would you rather be sitting in a chair, staring at the computer, or having fun outdoors visiting places you have never seen before? You will never get or learn anything by plagiarizing. Plus, you will get caught and face consequences. But if you think a little or maybe had experience with your writing tool, then you will learn and grow. That is also because kids are too lazy to figure it out because they are not outside doing things; they're inside and used to being on their computer all the time. I guess I also agree with using computers because they give you skills that going to places don't give you. Like, you also need skills, mainly, hand - eye coordination for typing the long papers for college, and those skills will get you far in life. It's like a chain reaction: you type on the computer a lot, you will have good hand - eye coordination. If you have good hand - eye coordination, you will do good in school, and it goes on. And you end up being successful. Another benefit with computers is the sales. More and more people are buying computers, which helps the economy. So, I guess I agree, but my opinion will stay strong with not using computers excessively. In conclusion, while computers have their benefits, we should balance our time on them with outdoor activities and real - life experiences to maintain our health and personal growth.
605	607	1	3	Dear newspaper, I read an article in the newspaper that said how people being on their computers is a benefit and could be a bad habit. I actually think it's a good idea about people being on their computers. I have a few reasons why this is a good thing. Whenever a student needs information on a certain topic, then they use the internet for help. Research is helpful because there could be a lot of sites online that could give you what you need. The topics typed into search engines will help find any information useful to you. You can access a vast amount of knowledge from different sources with just a few clicks. Whenever a teacher @MONTH1 needs an assignment typed, you can type it on your computer and have it ready the next day. You can also find interesting pictures on what you're learning about. Sometimes the internet could have more information than a certain book you would look into. It would sometimes be a good idea not to search for something all night, or someone's going to be mad at the electricity bill. Also, it would be good if you double - check your information because it could be fake. Using the internet doesn't need to be for work only. People use computers to shop online, check times for movies, and talk with friends. People talking to friends online is good because they @MONTH1 not be able to talk however they want in school, and you @MONTH1 not get to see them on the weekends. Teens who talk online usually talk with their best friends. If one friend in a group of friends is probably in the same town as you, then they could talk by using their laptops they bring anywhere. Then you could probably hear about something that you (and your friends) have in common which @MONTH1 be coming somewhere that's by where you live. So being on the computer to talk with friends isn't so bad. Students who are young usually get to learn to type. This could help them in the future if they need to type up an assignment for school, a job application, or a college application. Learning to type is good because you also get to see which keys are where and
606	608	1	3	Dear, Newspaper @CAPS1 my name is @CAPS2, @PERSON1 and I firmly believe that this idea based on why people need computers is a truly good statement/ @CAPS3. My well - considered @CAPS4 opinion is that some say people use their computers so much they don’t exercise. But that is not true due to the fact that computers have useful programs, like those on how to watch your weight, monitor stocks, and so on. Also, technology helps people around the world through various websites and programs, such as those for video chat, and @CAPS5.com for instant messaging. In terms of teen - related stuff, computers help people with video chatting, emailing their resumes to jobs, and showing details about their recent jobs. The technology of computers also helps @CAPS6 save time and resources. Most reasons we need tech equipment is that people use it in fields such as the navy, @CAPS6, and dealships across the world industry. Why is that good? Well, my point of view is that businesses need it to order their stocks for store carriers and more. For @CAPS6 in the field, it can be used for @CAPS7 sean, pregnancy, pulse radar's and more. On the negative side, some readers think people get addicted to technology. But the truth is that people really need technology. Look around you, and you'll find that almost everything in this world has been made with the help of technology. The bottom line is that people should agree that computers help people speak, @CAPS9, email, improve lives, help find family and friends, and give directions. So, in my point of view, @CAPS9 tell your dean @CAPS1 and readers that interacting with technology is a good way to control how or what you do on the computers. In my way, I make sites audio - engaging and interesting. Technology allows people to find and create ways to make money or achieve interesting positive outcomes. Every person in this world interacts with tech equipment these days. Those who have read this article should pass this story on to people who view technology negatively and help them think about it positively.
607	609	1	3	Dear Newspaper, I wholeheartedly think Computers are a highly beneficial effect in our lives. Some of the compelling reasons why I say this are that they are excellent when researching, have fun games and activities, and they keep you in touch with long - distant relatives. First, if you've just been given an assignment for school or work, say in @MONTH1, you'll have to type and research on whatever topic. A computer is an outstanding source of knowledge whether you're researching something or even checking your bills, @CAPS1. Computers are incredibly fun as they offer a plethora of games and activities for you to play and engage in. Just imagine you're sitting in the house on a rainy day, bored out of your mind and with nothing to do. Simply go on your computer and play some games or find some activities that your whole family can enjoy. Lastly, Computers are great for staying in contact with long - distant family members. These days, all you have to do is get a webcam and hook it up to your computer. Now, whether it's your grandma, grandpa, cousin, uncle, or whoever, they're right there. You can talk to them just like you were on the phone, but with no cost. In conclusion, as you can clearly see after all I've written, computers are good for researching, playing games or doing activities, and staying in touch with family. In my house, the computer is mostly used for the webcam to see my grandma in @LOCATION1. Well, I sincerely hope this letter changed your opinion on this remarkable invention, the computer.
608	610	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1 times, many @CAPS2 people think that computers are good for society but I strongly disagree. In my view, the risks of computers far outweigh the benefits. My first example is my father. My father has never turned on a computer in his life, and his business is thriving. My father and his father have all of their important records stored safely in a secure safe. One of my father's friends, on the other hand, had all his data on his computer. When a virus hit, all of his files were lost, along with his crucial business records. My father still hand - writes all of his papers. He says, ""If I need to type something out, I'll buy a typewriter."" Also, on social media platforms like Facebook, someone can access everything that another person is doing. This is where a lot of people pose as someone else, and unfortunately, @CAPS2 people end up getting kidnapped or killed. A very valid reason is that when people store a lot of personal information on their computers, if a virus strikes, that person can know everything about you that you've put online. For example, I was watching a show on the Discovery Channel when a man hacked into a MySpace account and used that person's name to communicate with others and try to create a security threat to the Pentagon. That person almost got caught but was never apprehended. So, you can understand why my family does not like computers. My family is always busy at the farm or in the barn working. We have no time to be on the internet. The only thing we think it's useful for is schoolwork. What ever happened to the old - fashioned way? No computer, no problems. Let's embrace that simple and secure way of life."
609	611	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I have @NUM1 significant reasons regarding the effects computers have on people. First, computers are not good for your eyes. Second, I'll explain the reason why people get on computers a lot. Third, there are numerous games and popular places to go online like MySpace, Facebook, and even Twitter, and much more. Keep on reading so I can tell you all about my three reasons. First of all, computers are not good for your eyes because computers are somewhat like @CAPS3's, but not really. Computers have a vast amount of information, while @CAPS3 don't really have so much information you can browse through. My second reason is that the more time people spend on computers, the more likely they are to become blind. Just being on the computers for an hour or more can have a negative impact. Third, some people wrongly think that just because they wear glasses, they won't get blinder by using the computer. But they are mistaken; they will actually get more blinder. As you're reading, you'll find out my second reason for spending too much time on the computer. My second reason is that people get on computers mainly to pay their bills or do their taxes. However, this is not entirely good because when you're doing your bills or taxes, you expose a lot of information that people in other countries or states could access without you knowing. Secondly, people also get on the computer to order something or buy a ticket to fly to a place they want to go, whether it's a vacation destination or for a business trip. They also get on websites that they hope will improve their lives, like meeting someone special. As you keep reading, you'll find out my third reason for spending so much time on the computers. My third reason is that there are a plethora of activities to do on the computer. For example, MySpace, Facebook, and Twitter are the most popular websites where people get on just to meet new people and talk to old friends. In conclusion, people should not be on the computer too much because it affects their health, invades their privacy, and there's a risk of meeting strange people. We should be more cautious about our computer usage.
610	612	1	3	In our society, computers play a huge and indispensable role. Some people firmly believe that this enhances our society and benefits the people in the @LOCATION1. Other people, however, think computers are harming the @CAPS1 citizens. I firmly believe that computers can take our society to the next level and enhance the lives of people. Computers can benefit people in multiple ways, such as by improving hand - eye coordination, giving people the ability to learn about the world, and allowing people to communicate with others easily. Computers can teach hand - eye coordination, which is extremely helpful for people to work with their hands. An argument against this is that computers take the place of exercise. But for a lot of @CAPS2, a sport is their form of exercise, and in every sport, you need good hand - eye coordination. Computers don't replace exercise; they enhance a person's ability to play. For example, to be a goalie in any sport, you need fast movements and excellent hand - eye coordination. A computer can help a goalie save more goals by increasing their hand - eye coordination. Having good hand - eye coordination can even save your life. If a knife was coming at you, human nature would tell you to cover your head with your hands. But if you had good hand - eye coordination, you could move your body away to avoid the knife. Computers not only help you physically but also mentally. Computers can transport you around the world without you ever leaving your room. They can teach you about different cultures and ways of life that you didn't even know existed. The @CAPS1 who cannot afford the luxury of seeing the world firsthand can use computers to see the world from different points of view. If a student needed to know all about one country, they could go on the internet and take a virtual tour. Since a student might not be able to go to the country, the computer becomes the next best thing. They can get all the information they wanted with just one click. Family, friends, and colleagues are all people you need to communicate with. Computers have made communication incredibly easy for anyone. Now you can talk and see a person in a video chat. This benefits society because if you're talking to a business partner, you can point to graphs and charts you've made. You can also see a loved one that you miss. There's a different type of communication for every person. You can email, @CAPS4, instant message, etc. Communication connects people around the world, making it a small world after all. Computers have truly taken our society to the next level. People can travel the world in an instant, talk to anyone, and improve their hand - eye coordination. Computers are constantly evolving in @LOCATION2, keeping us at the forefront. In conclusion, it's clear that computers have brought about amazing advancements, and we should wholeheartedly embrace their positive impact on our society.
611	613	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 people are increasingly using technology in their daily lives. A large number of them feel that it is significantly helping and improving their learning ability, while others strongly disagree. I personally feel that computers are both an advantage and a disadvantage. I say it can be an advantage because it is giving people a wonderful chance to experience knowledge and information above and beyond what they are learning in traditional settings. I say it is a disadvantage because a great many people are constantly on the computer and they don't get a sufficient amount of exercise. There are clear pros and cons to computers, but mainly cons. How long do you typically stay on the computer? @CAPS2 people often find computers more entertaining than going outside and getting some fresh air and exercise. Since technology is rapidly advancing, more and more people are eagerly going out to buy computers. A lot of teenagers are spending excessive amounts of time on the computer, playing exciting games and frequently going on their favorite websites. That is one significant reason why children from the ages @NUM1 and up are becoming obese. They don't get enough physical activity. That also leads into the issue of people spending quality time with your friends and family. I know a great deal of people like to spend precious time with their friends and family. But what if you were always glued to the computer and never made any time to hang out with your friends or family. Your friends might kindly ask you to go to the park with them, and you might casually say no. Your friends are going to gradually start pulling away from you. You might end up being extremely lonely. Being on the computer constantly can truly ruin your life. If you are choosing the computer over other important things, then I think we definitely have a problem. Going on the computer all the time can easily become an addiction. I don't think people fully realize it, but it can. It can completely take over your life. I say this because when you have an addiction to anything, it is incredibly hard to stop. It is possible to stop all by yourself but that's very rare. Majority of the times it is best to seek appropriate help. I sincerely hope you will take all of these reasonings into careful consideration.
612	614	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1, I am writing to you to inform you that I wholeheartedly agree with the points said on the writing prompt. First, I will be elaborating on how people use the computer too much. Secondly, I would discuss people who talk online way too frequently. Lastly, I would emphasize the issue of spending too much time on their computers. To start, many people use computers excessively. First, people are fond of going on social media platforms such as MySpace. Secondly, they like playing various online games. Lastly, some people like to communicate with others online. For example, if you visit someone's house, you are almost always going to see a young kid or a parent online somewhere or engrossed in playing online games. Also, people talk online an excessive amount. First, they visit Facebook all the time. Secondly, they go to MySpace, which poses a risk of having your identity stolen. Lastly, kids love to go on MySpace; it's similar to other social media platforms. For example, people might approach you and say, ""Do you have a certain account?"" and then ask, ""Can I get your email address?"" Certainly, spending too much time on their computers is detrimental. First, kids might encounter problems online and fail to prevent the problem from getting worse. Secondly, they might be arguing with a friend. Lastly, they might not be physically active but instead prefer playing or visiting other online websites. So @CAPS1, have you started to agree with why people should get active outside and have fun? In conclusion, this was why I agreed with being active because being on the computer all day would make it difficult for you to adapt to an active lifestyle and hard to break the habit of being on the computer @NUM1. It is essential to balance computer use with real - world activities for a healthy and fulfilling life."
613	615	1	3	Computers should be for everyone! Don't you think? I definitely do. And here's how @CAPS1 is going to convince you. Computers can basically be called a remarkable gateway to learning. The positive effects that computers have on people are numerous. It teaches excellent hand - eye coordination, gives people the amazing ability to learn about faraway and exotic places, and even allows people to conveniently talk online with other people from all over the world. These great qualities that computers possess for people are truly fantastic. Also, the fact that computers just keep continuously upgrading as time goes by is really exciting. So, by you reading this introduction, I hope you are satisfied with what I am going to present in order to show you that computers are positive devices and can be extremely helpful to everyone. Firstly, as I started in my introduction paragraph, computers help teach people hand - eye coordination. This, I believe, is a very important skill to know because without it, there aren't many complex things you could do. For example, flying a plane. You wouldn't be able to do that without both hand and eye coordination because you would have to manually and precisely move the plane controls, and check to see if everything is in proper order by multi - tasking effectively. Furthermore, this is just one given reason on why computers are positive towards everyone's benefit. Secondly, computers give people the ability to learn about faraway places and interesting people. This is also highly beneficial for people's growth because there is a wealth of knowledge in every bit of it. You're learning about others' unique cultures, rich heritage, and fascinating family history, and so forth. This could also help you in the long run with any job you want to pursue because knowledge can open many doors. It can get you very far in life, so learn as much as you can, and I believe computers can facilitate that. This is another reason why computers can be positive. As for the last reason, I say that people can also talk to other people online on the computer. This is also advantageous because again, like I stated in my @NUM1 paragraph, you can learn many new things that way and meet new and diverse people. Now don't you think computers can benefit anyone? I do and will always have the same positive opinion towards computers. For my conclusion, I would like to say that I hoped you enjoyed every bit of what I had to say, and you can also agree with the positive effects computers have on people. I truly believe that computers are beneficial to all people and should continue to be an integral part of our lives. It benefits society in countless ways, and I enjoy every bit of using it.
614	616	1	3	"Dear Newspaper, People always firmly believe that technology today, such as computers, is making more and more people lazy and preventing them from going out into the real world. For instance, there are people who don't spend enough quality time with family, become very unfit, and also face risks from @CAPS1 websites and people they talk to online, which can put them in harm's way and cause them to get hurt. First, who wouldn't want to spend time with family and discover the things that have happened to them? Well, it's @CAPS1 people because they are too preoccupied being on the computer instead of going on exciting camping trips with the family, visiting an amusement park, or attending some family gatherings. People who think that the computer is a useful thing may not realize that @PERSON1 said, ""@CAPS1 people learn much easier from family or friends than from a computer."" Second, @CAPS1 people are becoming @CAPS2 because of excessive computer use. Instead of going for a relaxing walk or having a nice day outdoors, they sit in their rooms and immerse themselves in virtual things instead of experiencing the real world. @CAPS1 people who are sitting on the computer all the time might consider joining a sports team where they can exercise every day. Last, @CAPS1 @CAPS3 individuals who go on the computer, both children and adults, are at risk because of the act of talking to people they have never seen or really know about. When you are online and someone claims to live where you live, they could be lying, and you could take them seriously and arrange to meet up with them, and that is how you can get into serious trouble, like getting killed or going missing. Also, the computer allows you to put pictures and videos online, and a lot of teens and adults are posting very inappropriate pictures of their bodies on the internet, which people shouldn't be seeing. I hope that if you or a family member is always on the computer, you should remind them that they need to spend time with their family, they can become very unfit, and they can be at risk of getting hurt by people they don't know. It's crucial to balance computer use with real - life activities for a healthy and safe life."
615	617	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I do not believe that computers benefit society. I feel this way because I have heard that some experts are seriously concerned that people are spending an inordinate amount of time on their computers and less time doing productive things. The main reason why I am against keeping computers around is because the people that use them the most are neglecting their families as well as their friends. The second reason why I am against keeping computers around is because they are extremely time - consuming. Last but not least, I am against keeping computers around because people are spending too much time on the computers and less time exercising. Now, let's talk about the way people are neglecting their families and friends. Computers are very addictive, so I can understand why people would neglect their loved ones for them. Though I can understand why certain individuals do it, I don't think it's morally right. I have many friends who would rather be on Facebook or MySpace than hang out with me. The websites listed above can really make you completely forget about reality. My friends will forget about interacting with any and everyone just to spend the whole day on the computer. The reasons listed above clearly tell you why I believe that computers should be restricted because of the neglect they cause. Now, let's talk about all the time that is being consumed by computer users. I believe that time is a very precious and valuable thing and you should not waste it. So when I read about people wasting time on the computer all day, I, myself, was extremely upset! Statistics show that the average teenager spends @NUM1 hours a day on average on the internet, and statistics also show that the average adult spends about @NUM2 @NUM3 hours on the computer a day on average. When I read the above statistics, I came to the harsh realization that people spend too much time on the computer doing nothing productive. Now, let's talk about exercising a bit more. I, myself, know that too much time is being spent on computers. By me knowing that, I am well - aware of the fact that children are not getting enough exercise. Exercise is very important for a growing child, and if they are not getting all the exercise that they need, it can cause serious health problems in the future. Statistics show that around @PERCENT1 of children under @NUM4 years of age are obese. The above reasons clearly tell you why I believe that exercise is more important than spending time on the computer. In conclusion, considering the issues of neglect, time - wasting, and lack of exercise caused by excessive computer use, I firmly believe that steps should be taken to limit computer usage, especially for the well - being of our society and future generations.
616	618	1	3	Dear @CAPS1: People are spending far too much time on computers. This holds true for children and adults alike. Just think about it—anything you can do on a computer, you can do without a computer. That said, people need to spend more time outside experiencing nature. Lastly, some bad things can be shown and can happen while online. I challenge you to name one thing you can do on the computer that you can't do without. You simply can't even name one. Think about it; you can research and find pictures from books and magazines. Instead of using social networking sites, you can actually go and see the person, or if they are far away, you can call them or write them a letter. To find out about current events, you can read the newspaper or watch the news. If you like using computer design programs, try drawing a real picture instead. Lastly, if you download a lot of music, you can just buy a CD or, better yet, go to see the band live. Face it, you can't do everything on a computer that actually requires the computer. Artificial simulations are no match for the real outdoors. On a computer, all you can do is watch, and even that is nothing compared to the real thing; it's just a snapshot of it. Outside, you can feel the gentle breezes, the warm sun, and the cool grass. You can smell fresh pine and clean air. You can hear all the other creatures surrounding you. Going outside is better for you, too. Outside, you get exercise and vitamin D, while inside, you get fat, lazy, and sick. Can't you see how great the outdoors are? Computers can do more harm than good. They can show children inappropriate pictures and talk about inappropriate topics. They are even now being used to sell illegal drugs. Children also often use the internet irresponsibly and do things that can disrupt friendships and get them into trouble. The computer has also made it a lot easier for kidnappers to find children and kidnap them. They do this by pretending to be the child's peer and then using the information the child provides; they will make almost a guaranteed kidnapping. This is happening more and more frequently. The computer isn't as helpful as you thought. Computers are not really beneficial to our society. They have no real use that isn't already taken care of. They cannot replace the real outdoors. Lastly, they can be easily used for bad, even illegal purposes. As you can see, computers should not be used as much as they are being used by the general public.
617	619	1	3	Dear local newspaper, as a society, we have come very far regarding advancements and inventions. One invention has made a large impact in the world and still ceases to amaze—it's the computer. This remarkable piece of technology has so many benefits and positive effects on people that without it, everyone would be stupefied. For example, this device allows people to keep in touch using a common social network. In addition, specially designed computers can attend to people's specific needs. Furthermore, they allow you to expand your knowledge. Therefore, computers have positive effects. Just think of all the people you've emailed or instant messaged in the past week... Your dad, while he was on his business trip, your aunt and uncle who e-mailed you pictures of their new - born baby, your friends from camp... The list can go on and on. Computers like laptops or desktops provide social networking like Facebook, i - chat, video chat and more so you can keep in touch with your family and friends. For example, in my life, I use my laptop to video chat with my sister, @PERSON3, who is a freshman at college in @LOCATION1. It's our way of keeping in touch instead of not seeing her for months on end or having to pay for plane tickets every weekend to go down and see her. With the computer, keeping in touch with people in different towns, states, or even hemispheres is a piece of cake. However, computers also provide support for those with medical needs. If someone has just been rushed to the hospital for an emergency, computers will be used to monitor that person. @PERCENT1 of hospitals nationwide say that computers are essential in their facilities. For example, when my grandfather, @PERSON2 was being cared for at the @CAPS6 hospital, computers were used to make sure his heart rate, oxygen levels, and blood pressure were all in check. And, if something was wrong, the computer would alert the doctors. Therefore, computers are also a huge help in the medical department as well. Lastly, computers can expand one's knowledge. There are thousands upon thousands of websites; all of which can teach people different things. For example, if you are going on a trip to @LOCATION2 and wish to learn about their culture before you leave, you can just type it into your internet browser on your computer and bam! You're fully prepared for your vacation now because of your computer. Also, in my life, my teachers assign us research papers requiring us to find information on a topic. Perhaps going to the library isn't an option; how are you going to acquire the information? The answer is simple, go on the internet! Internet research is the top way amongst all colleges and universities to research. I was recently assigned a @CAPS7 @CAPS8 project by my social studies teacher, @PERSON1 where we got to choose our topic of community service and research it. Every student in my class used the computer in some way, shape, or form for their project. Thus, computers can allow you to get information efficiently. In conclusion, computers provide an abundance of uses. Primary ones include the ability to exchange messages with friends and family, help in the medical field, and expansion of knowledge. Henceforth, I believe that computers serve as a positive advancement in technology and its effect on people is rather great.
618	620	1	3	Dear, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, do you think computers have a positive or negative affect on people? I think it has a positive affect. There are a few reasons for this. First, computers are used for education around the world. Second, it helps us connect with and meet new friends. Lastly, you can use a computer for world news. As you can see, those are just a few reasons. First, computers are used for education around the world. For example, some people use it to go to college online, taking courses at their own pace. Others use it to find information on things like Egypt, a place where we can't always physically go. Second, it helps us connect with, and meet new friends. We can chat with our friends, which is very useful. If we need to know what a homework assignment was, we can just chat with a friend. We can also join online groups based on our interests to meet like - minded people. Lastly, you can use a computer to find out about world news. We can go and find out if something serious happened, like the earthquake in Haiti. We can get real - time updates and in - depth analysis. As you can see, those are just a few reasons I think that computers have a positive affect on us. I hope you agree with me.
619	621	1	3	Dear, @PERSON1 I think that computers are good for people. It helps them find where they're going, like a good guide to people and also with '@CAPS1' to show a computer's usefulness. If you go to look for a job, having experience with computers can help you get a good - paying job. As you get older, having computer skills is essential to get a head - start in life. I know I've realized this as I got older. I want to have a normal life, though in truth, nothing is truly normal. Also, the computer is great for looking up reviews. It can tell you if a place has a five - star or a @NUM1 star rating, and you don't want to go to a place with a low rating. You'd rather go to a well - rated place. That's why a computer is so much more useful. A computer tells you valuable information. I have firsthand experience; if lots of people use computers, my teachers use computers every day on a regular basis. They look up information and send it into the computers and give them names. What I'm referring to with my teachers is this computer. That is what I think about why computers are good for people.
620	622	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, don't you think that nature is better than spending way too much time on the computer? Well, generally speaking, I think it is, and I'll give you only three reasons why. First of all, it's about the obesity percentage in @LOCATION1. Second, you can spend a lot more time with your family. Finally, you can enjoy what nature has to offer. I think that the great outdoors is the way to go because @LOCATION1 needs some exercise rather than spending time on the computer. Also, because the obesity percentage rate is advancing up really high. In @DATE1, @PERCENT1 of the population are obese or overweight. Last year in @DATE2, it was @PERCENT2. Wow, the rate went up like @PERCENT3 each year. This info was online at www.tomatotalks.org. Another thing I would like to consider is that spending more time with a family or even a friend is a good thing. All statistics show that spending time with your family anywhere, especially at the dinner table, is a great way to talk about your child's problems in school, and also to learn from their parent's mistakes. You can also share great laughs. Finally, you can discuss what they will do for their future. Last, but not least, you can enjoy the great outdoors and also discover some of the most important creatures such as insects, reptiles, and mammals. These creatures are the most important things in our life to learn about. Also, trees that give us oxygen are vital. Mother nature has its great benefits when your career is all about science. Computers are educational, but nature is better! In conclusion, we should prioritize spending time in nature over being glued to our computers to combat obesity, strengthen family bonds, and learn from the natural world.
621	623	1	3	The people who are concerned about the bad effects of computers are right about a couple things, but good does come out of it. For instance, when the military needs recruits for the army, they can post up their ad on the computers that everyone will see. And for those people who drop out of school and want a second chance, they can apply for school online. My last reason is that those people who have a hard time finding work can always look up the best job for them over the internet. Read More to find out how the internet is good for society. First, as the army keeps losing more and more soldiers in combat and they try to recruit people, they can post their ad up over the internet. Sure they can mail it out, but that would take forever for people to find out about it and learn about it. For example, they can post the ad up on myspace and have thousands of people looking at it in minutes. Finally, the internet is a great way for the military to recruit soldiers. Next, the internet also provides a platform for people to learn new skills and knowledge, which can enhance their employability and contribute to the development of society. In conclusion, despite the potential negative impacts, the internet offers numerous benefits and is an important part of modern society.
622	624	1	3	There are many great things about computers. If we were to lose them, then our lives would change dramatically. You can use computers for exercise, and it is also up to the parents on limits. Last, it can save lives. Computers are great. If we were to lose them, there would be no more internet. You wouldn't be able to talk to friends on social media or e - mail. Cell phone prices would go through the roof. We would technically be going back 30 to 40 years. Last, without computers, there would be more difficulty in large companies. Computers can help with exercise. One way is we can find the closest gyms on the internet. We can quickly find what is healthy to eat. You can also get one of those fitness apps for a computer. Also, you can find free workout videos. Next, it should be up to the parents. It is their discretion. If they see that the child is spending too much time on the computer and gaining weight, they can easily limit it. They can say that for every hour you're on the computer, you have to do an hour of exercise. Lastly, the computer can save lives. Before computers, medicine like Tylenol was used for everything, such as a stuffy nose, headache, cold, etc. Now we can go on the computer to find whether the medication is at all dangerous. You can also find the nearest hospital. Finally, computers can do a lot of good. Even though it can make us less healthy if you spend too much time on it, it can save your life. It can also affect companies and our lives. Parents can give limits, and computers can be used to exercise. So, after reading this essay, please don't take away our computers.
623	625	1	3	"Wouldn't you agree that spending time on the computer takes away half of your life? Going on the computer can have a negative effect on you! Personally, I think not going on the computer benefits you. There's more time for your family, going outside, and staying healthy! Certainly, going on the computer will mean less time for exercising. For example, let's say you went on the computer for an hour. That hour could have been used to go outside and stay fit! Think about the choices here; you could either sit on a chair and play on the computer or take a nice run and burn a ton of calories! Statistics show that 70% of people that go on the computer instead of getting exercise are at risk for health problems including obesity. As you can clearly see, going on the computer really isn't the healthiest choice. Most definitely, going on a walk or enjoying nature is better than going on a computer. A girl named Lily, from New York, said, ""I love to enjoy the beauty of the outdoors that God gave to me. I wish I knew that years ago while I was a lazy woman on the computer. If you just even look out your window to see this beautiful world God created for us, you would want to go out there and enjoy it! Everyone wants to live like they're dying, or in other words, live life to the fullest! In order to do that, you have to see life and go out there and experience it, not sit on a computer! Without a doubt, this world is gorgeous, and it is worthwhile to see the nature! Everyone knows that family comes before everything! For example, you might love the computer, but that love should not overpower the time you spend with your family! One day on a Friday night, Sarah was on the computer, and her mother called saying, ""Sarah, it's time for dinner."" Sarah ignored her mom and chose to go on the computer! Now you really cannot give up time with your friends and family since they are so important! I know with my heart and have seen that my family means the world to me, and everyone should show more time for each family member, not the computer! It's now or never to decide if computers benefit society or not! With no computers, you could have so much free time for your friends and family if you could only imagine! Most importantly, it will not only benefit you, but it will mean a lot to your family. So, what are you waiting for? Get off the computer and spend some quality time with your family!"
624	626	1	3	Does computers have an effect on people? Do they have a good effect or bad effect? Dear Local Newspaper, I agree they have a good effect on people because you can learn from them. You can look at maps if you're leaving the state. They're good for talking to people online, and you can shop online. I don't think adults spend too much time on computers rather than exercising. I think kids are mostly on the computer playing games and other activities. Some people use computers for homework, writing papers, or searching for people. Computers are good ways to learn about people and words. They're not just for playing games and listening to music; they're for good use. You can look up restaurants and look at their prices. Netflix shows a site where you can look at episodes of TV shows online. I think computers are better than books and dictionaries because you can do all that stuff on a computer. Some people think computers are good things to have because it's fast and easy. Some people think computers are a waste of time. Computers are good because if you need to write a paper, you can type it and print it instead of having messy handwriting. Computers are good if you're in a rush to search something; it's fast. Computers are useful for anything like books, writing papers, websites, chatting with friends, web maps, music, games, and etc. They do have a good effect on people and kids. In conclusion, despite some people's concerns, computers offer a wide range of benefits and are valuable tools in our daily lives.
625	627	1	3	Dear local newspaper editors, I do agree that exercising is important. I think that people should exercise more and spend time with family and friends. The issue is whether people should spend more time on their computers or less time, and instead focus on exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. Should it be the other way around? The first reason why I think that people should spend more time exercising than on their computers is because I think that parents should watch and be responsible for the way their kids eat and keep themselves fit. It's not right for parents to see their kid eat and then not encourage them to go out exercising. My second reason is that I think that people should spend time enjoying nature rather than being on the computer. The reason I think this is because they would never know what they're missing if they're always on the computer. How can you experience new things if you're glued to the screen? My third reason is about interacting with friends and family. I think that people should spend time with friends and family rather than on the computer because when interacting with friends and family, you learn things that you never knew about them, and you can discover new places and things in your life. For example, over vacation, I did more things and learned more things about my family and friends than I ever knew before because I spent time interacting with them. I learned how fun and interesting and happy they are. Where is that kind of experience on a computer? Please don't waste your life. Live your life. It's now or never to decide if people should spend more time on computers or more time exercising, interacting with family and friends. In conclusion, we should prioritize real - life experiences and relationships over computer time for a more fulfilling life.
626	628	1	3	Dear @LOCATION1, @CAPS1, can you even begin to imagine where the world would be without computers? Our daily lives would be incredibly dull and boring without new technology. Computers help society carry out various activities that would be utterly impossible if we didn't have computers. They give us the ability to learn comfortably at home, connect with other people from all over the world, and provide a great source of entertainment. From these reasons, our lives have become easy and convenient, which is what @CAPS2 people strive to accomplish. The ability for an average person to learn has greatly increased. It has gone from just being able to go to school to the @CAPS2 various effective ways to increase your intelligence on the computer. Programs such as @ORGANIZATION1, which teaches people how to speak a language fluently, are readily available on the computer. These programs are like going to school, but more accessible to the public. To further help the public, there are reliable ways to gain college degrees online. That's how beneficial computers are. Even if you go to school, a computer @CAPS1 still helps you excel in your work as @CAPS2 useful sources of research are available on the computer. And when you want to have fun on the web, a computer is a great place. However, some people still think computers aren't good. They claim that people are gaining weight. On the other hand, the computer provides people with useful websites to help lose weight. They also say people aren't enjoying nature, even though there are @CAPS2 interesting ways to appreciate it on the computer. Lastly, it is stated that you don't... Well, in conclusion, computers greatly benefit us and are indeed good. New technology is a great thing and should keep expanding because of the ability to learn, connect with people, and have fun. A computer helps the general public in numerous ways. Please, think of what I have said and buy a computer!
627	629	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 throughout the ages, technology has constantly been evolving and significantly improving the way we think. From the first simple telephone in the @DATE1's to today's highly advanced touch - screen iPhone. From riding horses to riding extraordinary fast sports cars and high - speed bullet trains. The advances in technology have proven that there is no limit, like the invention of planes that let us soar through the sky. We have even reached the moon and left our mark! Computers have only become faster and more powerful. Although more and more people are using one of our greatest technological advances, computers, some believe it doesn't benefit socially. I vehemently believe that computers benefit society greatly. They have the ability to inform and teach us what seems like infinite information. Second, they have made the world a smaller place through seamless communication. Last, they even have the ability to locate missing people. Computers are constantly helping society. They follow the path of technology to make life @CAPS3 more comfortable. First of all, computers are a great benefit to society because they have the remarkable ability to inform and teach us what seems like endless information. Today, when someone wants to know something, the first place they usually turn to is the computer. This is because search engines such as @ORGANIZATION1 have almost no limits to the amount of information on the topic being searched. This has not only made living @CAPS3 more convenient, but has also helped students in studying for tests from elementary school all the way up. Computers also offer a wide range of functions for the average person. From online banking to creating powerful PowerPoint presentations, computers are equipped with all the tools! For this reason, even older people such as @PERSON1 initially find computers a bit strange. Second, computers benefit society because they make the world smaller through efficient communication. Sixty years ago, it could take a long time to reach a relative on the other side of the world. Today, you can easily have a video call with a relative in @LOCATION2 from @LOCATION1 in less than ten seconds. Not only can you talk to grandma or grandpa but you can even see them smile. Children can even engage in activities such as @CAPS4. When there is a crisis, they can still talk to worried family members. Finally, computers benefit society as they have the ability to locate missing people. Take the record earthquake in @LOCATION3. There were cries of mothers looking for their children whom they had lost. It is thanks to computers that these families were reunited. On many sites on the internet, @LOCATION3 set up person locators. These locators allowed you to write down your name in case a disaster should happen. Not only this, you can also find your family. All they had to do was... Computers have even made our society safer. What more could we ask for? In conclusion, I strongly believe that computers are beneficial to society because computers contain a vast amount of information and useful programs. They have proven that the earth is a ""small world after all"" and they have made the world safer. It is no wonder that many people are buying computers, so why don't you get one?"
628	630	1	3	"Dear Newspaper, I am writing you this letter about computers in the hope that you will publish it. Over @NUM1, a large number of people in @LOCATION1 have a computer, but are they really healthy? I don't believe computers are a good thing. People spend too much time on them and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and most of all, they are highly dangerous. I don't believe computers are a good thing because people don't exercise like they used to. Some people spend @NUM2 out of @NUM3 hours in a day on computers. For others, it's their whole life. People spend so much time on computers that they lose touch with the outside world. Ever since computers came out, obesity has gone up. All some people do is chat to other people and think ""they don't have to know what I look like."" They sit at the computer, eating and eating. That's not healthy at all. I don't think computers are good also because they spend less time enjoying nature. It used to be that when I had some free time, I could call up a friend and ask them to take a walk with me somewhere and they'd say ""sure!"" Now they say ""@CAPS1, let's get on the computers and we can take a virtual walk."" That's not the same as an actual walk with the wind in your face, the fresh smell of the outdoors, and all the beautiful animals. At least not to me. Nature is a thing of beauty and if you don't enjoy and appreciate it, it'll turn into something unappealing. Nature used to be the most peaceful thing, now it's the internet. I don't think computers are good because most importantly they're dangerous. Little kids, like myself, think they're grown up and go on computers and meet rapists, murderers, thieves, all kinds of criminals. Also, people send hurtful and violent things to each other and if you're on the computer a lot, bad people can track you down. Also, the military and @ORGANIZATION1 keep secrets on computers but if you're smart enough you can hack it. Computers aren't safe for anyone or anything. Well, I've told you my main @NUM4 reasons why I think computers aren't such great things. They're not healthy, emotionally or physically. People don't exercise, they don't enjoy nature, and computers are highly dangerous. All I can do is hope you publish my letter so everyone can see my point of view and make their own decisions. In the end, we should all be more cautious about our computer use."
629	631	1	3	Dear Newspaper People, I think that the effects that computers have on us are undeniably good. You should whole - heartedly agree. One reason why you should agree is because computers are like excellent teachers. For example, you can go on well - designed websites that teach you all kinds of things, like complex math concepts. Also, you can enroll in cyber school or take high - quality college classes online. Another reason why you should agree with me is because on computers we can communicate in a much easier and efficient way. On computers, you can send detailed e - mails and use a high - resolution webcam to talk to people face - to - face. You can also have a Facebook or MySpace account to chat and learn more interesting things about people. Last of all, computers are a great source of entertainment. On computers, there are lots of free and engaging games to play. Also online, you can watch high - definition movies and listen to your favorite music. Last, you can have a lot of fun creating games and other interesting stuff to share with everyone. Without computers, we wouldn't be able to do any of those wonderful things anymore. I think that it would really be a huge loss and tons of people would agree with me. That is why you should agree with me that computers are an essential and beneficial part of our lives. In conclusion, let's embrace computers and make the most of their many advantages.
630	632	1	3	People using computers is a great way for them to talk with distant relatives or friends, learn practical keyboarding skills, and research about far - away places. First, the wonderful technology that computers have is truly amazing. They can surf the web in mere milliseconds. This benefits people because if you were doing a research paper on China, many reliable search engines let you surf the web at blazing fast speed, and in a short time, you could have all the comprehensive information you needed. Scientists say that @PERCENT1 of computer - users have fast internet, and they highly recommend it to other, first - time buyers. The computer that I use is a unique computer that was customized to my specific liking. I like playing exciting games and editing high - quality videos, so I got an outstanding graphics card that has extremely fast speeds for rendering videos. This allows me to play games and edit videos smoothly, and my @NUM1 gb hard drive is capable of storing all my important programs and projects for future use. Doing many things on the computer can really improve your hand - eye coordination. In fact, about @PERCENT2 of computer users say that over a period of using a computer, they were able to type @PERCENT3 quicker than they could before. That's a very good improvement, but the average person who types could write a certain amount of text in @NUM2 minutes. I can type that much in about @NUM3 minutes because I have been typing regularly for @NUM3 years. Computers are a big part of my life and I still have plenty of time to do other things with my family and friends. The last thing that computers help us people with is chatting with friends on popular websites, like Facebook, MySpace, and @ORGANIZATION1. They all let you share interesting things with all of your friends, and if you needed to, you could chat with far - away friends or relatives. This helps because if you haven't talked to your cousin in a while, you can check up with him and talk about various things. I have a cousin who graduated from college and is now teaching in @LOCATION1, and when our family gets together, we web - chat with him on @ORGANIZATION1 and it is very helpful because we haven't seen him in @NUM5 years, and we all wanted to see what he was up to. He was also able to send us nice pictures, which helped because we all missed his face. So, from the blazing fast speed of web - surfing to the ability of chatting with distant relatives, these are key factors that show us that you can have a great time on computers and still have enough time for family and friends. In conclusion, computers are a valuable addition to our lives, offering both fun and functionality.
631	633	1	3	"Dear local newspaper, Computers have a good effect on people in our community. From computers, you can learn a wide range of knowledge, talk to people from out of state or even out of the country, and also you can improve hand - eye coordination. Computers can help you learn in many ways. One way you could learn from computers is that students can go online and get detailed information for their school projects. By finding this information, it can help the students get better grades. Also, the students can use the computer as an effective way to study. There are educational games on the computer that kids play, and without realizing it, they are learning and studying for school. Another way to learn is through online classes. This could help people who do not have enough money to pay to go to traditional classes. As you can see, there are many ways to learn from having a computer. The computer can also help you talk to people from out of the state or country. This could help families stay connected when they live so far away from you. My cousin @PERSON4 and my aunt @CAPS1 math live in @LOCATION1, and I hadn't met them until the @DATE1, when they came down. Now that I have met them, I am able to stay in touch with them through the computer. Dr. @PERSON2 says, ""Staying close with families and friends is not only important for your health."" By having computers, we could talk to our relatives and help our health. When you get out of college, people often let go of some good friends because they could live in different states. The computers can help you stay connected with them. Lastly, computers can help you with your hand - eye coordination. When you are trying to type a word and by hitting the key you want, you are learning this skill. I have seen some kids with special needs, and using the computer is helping them learn hand - eye coordination. There is a girl in my school named @PERSON3, and we help her by letting her play games on the computer. In my class, I've had to help her with picking things up, eating, and walking with her hands alone. Her helper teacher, Ms @PERSON1, says the computer game has helped her. In conclusion, the effect that computers have on society is clearly good."
632	634	1	3	Hi, do you think that if you use the computers too much, then you will not exercise and you will not enjoy the outside nature? You might think that spending time talking and playing with your friends and family will be affected. However, computers are needed for our various needs. One click on a computer can help a lot of people and can even save lives. And as our technology becomes more advanced, we will also benefit. For example, it can help a person look for a new job. You can still talk or chat with your best friends or just your grandma. The computer can assist with your homework or help someone learn to talk in English. It can also jump - start a new job or a new store. People can use it to find products that their customers will like and buy. So, if the customers like it, they will come back for more, which can lead to the business hiring more people and expanding into multiple stores. Another good reason is that the computer is useful for cooking food and creating new recipes, all with one click of the mouse. In conclusion, despite the potential drawbacks, the benefits of computers in our lives are undeniable.
633	635	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 of late, there has been controversy about how computers affect people's lives. I believe that the effects on people are negative. My main reasons for this argument are related to the person's health and the user's well - being. Did you know that over @PERCENT1 of kids and teens are obese, and @NUM1 computers can contribute to this statistic? If a person is eating unhealthy but is active, they can still be fit. But if they go on the computer instead of working off the calories, they become fat. This can be a serious problem. Becoming overweight has many health risks like heart problems and other issues. It also could prevent a person from exercising. If they are overweight, their legs could ache, and a simple set of stairs could become a huge challenge. Do you want to see an increase in obesity rates? I would think not. If you watch TV, you might picture perfect families. We all know that no family is like that. Introducing computers could mess up family interactions even more. For example, my cousin used to be an outgoing and friendly person. Now, because of computers, he is a homebody who does nothing else but play on the computer. He gets up, eats breakfast (which is usually not very healthy), then plays on the computer until lunch. He eats a small lunch and right back to playing. After a long @NUM2 to @NUM3 more hours of playing, he gets off the computer, hops into bed, and goes on his laptop all night. This greatly affects his family. They try to get him off, but all he does is stay online. He can't interact with his family, and this has a huge impact on it. Even though he could get off and talk, one of the only ways of talking to him is through Facebook. Now, because of this, his family is in a difficult situation. We can easily avoid this by telling everybody these known facts. My final argument for you is about the user's well - being. Many of us teens have a Facebook account. When I have homework, I need to use the internet for facts and stories. But often, I end up going on Facebook. If anyone does this, it will affect our grades. If we chat on Facebook, we are not doing our homework. If we aren't doing our homework, we won't get a good grade. This could lead to other serious problems. Another thing is that you could actually become addicted to your computer. It could be so addicting that you might rely on it. There was once a teen who tried to kill himself because he didn't have his computer. So, @CAPS2, you can see there are many negative effects on a user of a computer. It could cause many problems in the future like health issues and affect family happiness. So, spread the word for the sake of thousands of people. In conclusion, we should be aware of these negative impacts and take steps to minimize them.
634	636	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I feel that computers are very useful to society. For example, millions of people, large companies, and small businesses require the use of computers in order to optimally run their operations. Everyone who uses computers on a daily basis can confirm that they are very useful. In fact, computers are so useful that some schools are starting to take notice. I highly recommend that you get acquainted with such a useful and well - recognized piece of technology. Did you know that many billion - dollar companies and small businesses require the functions that a computer has to offer? For example, my mother is a former - district manager of the fast - food company, @ORGANIZATION1. When she worked at the company, they gave her a laptop that she could use only for her work. This clearly proves my point that companies and small businesses require the features of a computer to smoothly run the business they operate or are employed at. The technology of computers has brought education to new heights. Some teachers (including my own, @PERSON1) have taken the initiative to incorporate the modern technology of computers into their teachings. Classes have even been created in schools because of the popularity of computers. For example, at my school, a computer education (or, comp, for short) class has been created for kids to understand the knowledge and skills that using a computer can give them in the real - world. In my opinion, it is great that computers are incorporated in so many places. Computers are used by millions of people every day. Big corporate businesses like @ORGANIZATION1 and @ORGANIZATION1 are starting to see the brilliance in using computers in their company. In fact, computers are so useful and helpful that teachers have started using them in their classrooms. I hope it is not just me that sees the good that a computer brings, but anyone else who reads this letter. In conclusion, the positive impact of computers on society, both in business and education, is evident and should be embraced.
635	637	1	3	Dear, To whom it may concern, I am writing this to inform you about how computers impact society. I initially thought computers aren't that great because of certain website - related issues. People use @CAPS1 messaging, and it's also a way of getting connected to others. I also think that some people may be addicted. You can search for someone or @CAPS5 on the computer. Sometimes, you may find top websites that are inappropriate for users. Some computers can have a negative impact on the education of kids who are trying to learn. The majority of kids use computers for internet access, and most of them will be on the computer playing games that may not be suitable for their age group. My first reason is that when people get on the computer, they find websites that others use. For example: @CAPS2, @CAPS3, @ORGANIZATION1, etc. Many people use websites to check their emails. For example: @ORGANIZATION2, @LOCATION1L, @CAPS4.mail, etc. My other reason for why people use websites is for @CAPS1 messaging. People use @CAPS1 messaging to connect with their friends, family, and other people they may not know. People say it's a faster way to connect with those they may not otherwise be able to reach. For example, if a person doesn't have a phone, doesn't live close by, or lives in another town. I also think it's good for researching people. For example, if you know someone but can't find them, you can browse for information. Another aspect is that some people may be addicted. For example, they go on a website and keep going back to it over and over again. They don't stop using it until something forces them to. Additionally, people think it keeps them busy. For example, if you don't have anything to do, you can go on the computer. Lastly, you may find top websites that are inappropriate for users. For example, you find a website but it's not suitable for minors. Only @CAPS5 adults could watch it. However, computers aren't all bad for education. For example, you can learn from appropriate websites that build your mental skills. In conclusion, my opinion is that computers do benefit society because they mainly help you brainstorm, and you get to know different websites and learn about them.
636	638	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1 times, I am writing in regards to the article recently written in your newspaper on computers. I firmly believe that they are a vital part of the world today because; you can efficiently find information for a project or article in far less time than painstakingly searching through books. Moreover, you can promptly get important news updates, and entertainment is only a single click away. My first reason focuses on the vast information available on the internet. Say you were writing a detailed paper on ancient Egyptians, and you need to know how to spell ""hieroglyphics"". In a dictionary, that would take a few minutes of flipping through pages, while online it would take about @NUM1 seconds. Or if you wanted to know the exact date when @ORGANIZATION1 died. It would take hours of scouring numerous textbooks until you finally found it. Online, it might take you just over a minute. The second reason I like computers is for news updates. You can quickly figure out what happened in recent natural disasters, or how your stock is performing at any given moment. Also, computers played a significant role in the recent election, and will continue to do so for a long time. The weather can always be easily found on the web for any location in the world. This is extremely useful if you're planning a trip somewhere, which you can also conveniently do with a computer. My third and final reason is that it's nearly impossible to get bored on a computer. Everywhere on the web, there are cool games or funny videos. On the web, there are about @NUM2 gaming sites and @NUM3 sites with funny/weird/cool videos and pictures. Many other platforms like Facebook let you share pictures with your friends, family, and relatives. Or you can have interesting chats with complete strangers from around the world. So next time you need information, news, or you are just bored, simply go on your computer, and have a great time."
637	639	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, it has come to my attention that people are spending too much time on computers, and I whole - heartedly agree because people spend so much time on computers that it gets addicting. As a result, people don't get enough exercise, and their eyesight gets worse. So please keep reading my letter and I will tell you the side effects of excessive computer use. Most of all, it gets really addicting for a lot of people, to the extent that they don't spend quality time with their families or siblings. Some kids get so addicted that they come home from school and start using the computer all day long, neglecting to study for a test or do their homework. Now, people spend so much time on the computer that they don't exercise or play sports with their friends. Instead, they just sit all day and become lazy and overweight, all because of the computer. We only really need the computer to check @CAPS3 and Facebook, like I do. But I just quickly check my Facebook and then go play basketball. One of the biggest problems that I think is when you sit on the computer for too long, you get a headache and it ruins your eyesight. So thank you for reading my letter and I hope you agree with me that we need to limit our computer time.
638	640	1	3	Dear, I strongly believe that computers are truly great. There are a lot of wonderful things you can do on the computers. A lot of people are saying that computers have bad effects on people, such as not getting enough exercise and not spending enough time with your family. I do not agree with that because say you have family in a different town, city, or state. There is a website where you can have a webcam conversation with people from all over the world with anyone. This is a really good opportunity as it is free and you can do it at any time. And if you have a laptop, you can do it anywhere! My next reason is that you get to see places you have never seen before with direct pictures. For example, when our family wants to go on vacation to a far - off place and we know nothing about it. You can go on the computer and look up the place. You can see what it is like and also read what other people said about it. Like if it is really hot, or cold, whether it is a good experience for kids, anything you want to know, the computer has the information. My last reason on why computers are good is because of studying. One thing that always happens is I leave my textbook at home. I can go on the computer and see what we had to do for our studies. Also, you can use the computer to study and learn easier ways to do something for any subject. Surveys show that @PERCENT1 of the kids who study on the computer pass their tests and get a higher grade percentage +@NUM1. Also, if a kid is studying and doesn't know what a word is, they can look it up and figure out the definition and how to use it in a sentence. That is why I think computers are a great tool for your well - being and personal growth.
639	641	1	3	My opinion is that people spend too much time on computers and don't concentrate on their family. Another reason is that people will not do school work if they are too concentrated on the computer. My third reason is people won't enjoy hanging out with their friends. Those are my reasons and now let me explain them in more detail. First, people will be so concentrated on the computer that they forget about their family. They will be overly focused on the computer and not have any fun with their family and friends. People often ignore their parents when they are on the computer. I know this because my sister goes on the computer and completely tunes out my mom and dad when they are talking to her. Please take my advice or your kids will be ignoring you when you are trying to talk to them. @PERCENT1 of children go on the computer and ignore everything around them. Now I can move on to the next reason. Second of all, people concentrate too much on the computer that they don't do their homework or any school work. If they don't do their homework, they could get bad grades on their report cards. If they get bad grades, they could fail the marking period and have to repeat the grade. Please listen or your child could end up staying back. Now for my third reason. Third, people won't enjoy hanging out with their friends. On the weekends, instead of being on the computer, you should go out with your friends and have a great time. In conclusion, we need to limit our computer time to have a healthy family life, good academic performance, and enjoyable social interactions.
640	642	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I am writing a letter to you today because I have heard a complaint that more and more people are using computers and getting less exercise. These experts that are concerned also say people need to enjoy nature, and interact with family and friends more. These experts might be smart but they are wrong. I am going to tell you how they are wrong. My first example is that people that go on the computer a lot still exercise. Take Twitter as an example. The football player Ocho - Cinco ""tweets"" all the time but that doesn't mean he doesn't get exercise. There are plenty of sports players that are on Twitter and they are in great physical shape. Most of the kids in my grade, including me, have a Facebook. Most of the kids are fit. Just because they are on the computer a lot doesn't mean they can't exercise. My second example is the effect of the computer in an educational context. Students use the computer for a lot of things. We use Wikipedia for our projects and to research a person. Some schools nowadays almost depend on computers. I remember when I lived in the country, we never really had to type anything unless it was a project. When I moved to @CAPS3, I am always typing something. Even a rough draft, they want me to type. In the country, I would write out my final draft by hand. I have to use the computer. Schools also are teaching us about the computer more and more. As we learn more and more things on the computer, we are on the computer more and more. When someone finds out a new website, they are going to tell their friends and it will spread from one person to another. My third example is how the experts say that people are spending too much time on the computer and less time interacting with family and friends. My grandpa, aunt, and other family members have a Facebook account. That means I can still interact with family and friends. The people that are on the computer a lot and are adults probably don't have family over every night and probably go out with friends every once in a while. Computers also benefit society. For business people, they might have to create a PowerPoint and they have a computer to do it. When experts say we need to enjoy nature, interact with family and friends, and do more exercising, they might be right, but we can do all these things while still using the computers. If you take a survey in @CAPS3 to see how many people are on the computer almost everyday and then you ask them how many of them exercise, you would see that you can do both. So, we don't have to choose between using computers and living a healthy, social life."
641	643	1	3	"Today more than @PERCENT1 of our population spends excessive and expensive amounts of time each day on the computer. I agree that having a computer in your home is beneficial at times, but to me, the disadvantages outweigh the advantages of spending too much time on a computer. Disadvantages such as cyberbullying, illegal websites, the criminals that use the internet to target days, and the interference that spending too much time on the computer has with your grades and other schoolwork. I think that the largest number of people affected by spending too much time on the computer are kids. Mostly, kids right after school, drop their backpack, and instead of sitting at the kitchen table or study area to do homework, they sit right down in front of the computer. Then what happens to that homework? It usually doesn't get done. That absence of homework could make an enormous decline in a student's average. However, homework is not the only schoolwork affected by the computer. Even in school, kids use the internet on their cell phones. This provides a huge distraction for kids and usually ends up with the result of kids not completing the task assigned to them. Not getting work done is not the only problem the computer presents to kids. It also helps with bullying; cyberbullying. A lot of kids are bullied and picked on at school, but then that bullying carries itself to the child's home through the computer. Once at home, a kid can get hurtful emails or instant messages. These hurtful messages @MONTH1 do a lot more than just hurt someone's feelings; it can hurt their self - esteem and how they feel about themselves. Then, as if cyberbullying and not doing homework weren't bad enough, there are also criminals on the computer. These criminals prey on kids. They can find passwords to accounts. They can find out personal information about you because of how much time you spend on the computer each day. Once they find out enough about you, they use it to gain your trust, and the problem only escalates from there. Although many kids are affected by the amount of time they spend on the computer each day, they're not the only ones. Adults are affected just as much and just as easily. One thing that lures adults into spending all their time on the computer is all the ""great deals"" they can find on the computer. But many of these great deals come from fake or illegal websites. Websites that are selling stolen merchandise. They then show you all the benefits of buying from them, and then once you believe them and buy what they are selling, they have all of your personal information. From there, you can end up with an empty bank account or even identity theft. Does that really sound like a ""great deal?"" @CAPS1 to me, the disadvantages of having a computer definitely outweigh the advantages of having a computer. I think that people need to step away from the computer desk, get good grades, avoid bullying and criminals, keep their bank accounts full and their identity safe. Instead, they should spend time outdoors, with family, or enjoying life!"
642	644	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, I believe that computers can be a very good thing to implement in society. First of all, if people never used computers, they would miss out on an immense opportunity to learn about the world around them. Also, with computers, people can communicate with people from across the world. If people use computers more often, they'll probably develop the skills to pursue job opportunities on a much wider market. Because of this, computers can greatly help any community. Computers can give many chances for exploring education. People can pursue a large amount of information with a relatively small space as opposed to using a large area of books. People can find almost anything they want to know about on the internet relatively easily. Whether it's for solely learning or for reference. For instance, if someone is making a project at school, computers can expand on many people's opportunities for education. Secondly, the internet can be used as a widespread communication tool. Any document or piece of information can be transmitted from say, @LOCATION2 to @LOCATION1 @CAPS2.C in a matter of seconds. Similarly, if two people are separated by a large distance, they can easily communicate. Since the invention of social networking, people that @MONTH1 have lost touch can easily meet again and discuss things. With computers, communication is becoming faster and faster. Finally, because of an over - expanding job market, the use of computers is becoming a common requirement of many professions. Most jobs that pertain to engineering require the use of different programs for modeling and drafting. Also, now most governments are networked with files on computers. Also, most any job that has to do with any sort of business has a requirement for the person needed to be able to type quickly. Because many jobs require experience with computers, they should be a part of any community. In conclusion, experience with computers can benefit any one person and the entire society all together.
643	645	1	3	The computer affects people's lives by taking them away from their family and has @NUM1 reasons why the computer affects people's lives. They do not know what is happening outside. Their family is affected. Their job is affected. Please listen to my reasons why the computer affects people's lives! My first reason is that they don't know what is happening outside because they are too busy on the computer. Their friends could have won something important and they wanted you to be there, but no, they are just so busy on the computer. They are going to miss out on nature or hanging out with friends. Like if they are supposed to meet a friend at a place and they don't show up, it just means they were on the computer all day long. My second reason is their family. I say their family because they could miss out on a lot of things. Such as a family reunion, a family vacation, and many more. It's like if one of their family members is hurt and they are trying to call you, but you don't pick up the phone because you're too busy on the computer to pick it up. You can lose your wife because of the computer because you forgot her birthday, her anniversary, and more because you are on the stupid computer. About their kids, what happens if they want to play? They have nothing to do. You say no because of the computer. The family will get angry. My third and last reason is their job. They can lose their job because they missed work because they were on the computer doing nothing work - related. If they lose their jobs, they can't pay for things. They can't even use their computer. They are going to be in their house with no light and no computer because they have been on it too much and did not pay attention to what was happening. They will all feel like they are going to be in a bad situation because they don't have their computer. Or the computer shuts down, and they don't have enough money to get an electrician. Those were all my reasons. They don't know what is happening outside. Their family is affected. Their job is affected. Thank you for listening to my reasons.
644	646	1	3	Today in our society, almost everyone uses computers whether @CAPS4 to do research, play games, or interact with others. These are all positive things. The schools across America are using computers from @NUM1 grade to online colleges. People benefit from computers by getting everything and anything done from them. @CAPS2 anyone who has a brain can realize that computers are a positive in today's society. First off, computers are a positive thing because they can get almost anything done for you. You can play on them, and interact with others. The reason that the computer being able to get almost anything done for you @CAPS4 is a good thing because if you need to get work done, you can do that. If you need to do research, @CAPS1 can do that, and @CAPS1 can help you in any subject. The reasons that playing games can be positive @CAPS4 @CAPS1 does not only give you great hand - eye coordination but @CAPS1 also exercises your brain and can be a learning experience for young children. The reasons that interacting through the computer @CAPS4 is that you learn how to be professional and talk through email for businesses and make many connections. @CAPS2 please use your brain and that computer in our society today. @CAPS2 to keep on going, Americans are the smartest people in this world and are doing very well. I @CAPS3 have to say you like it, and that @CAPS4 is why we send every one of them to school @NUM2 of every year. With that said, they use computers. Anyone who says that computers are bad should think about what they love to do while using a computer. Using computers can benefit your life. @CAPS2 as you can see, computers are a great thing for the good and can benefit today's society. @CAPS2 I beg you for your sake, please use computers and benefit your life. It's for your own good.
645	647	1	3	Dear @LOCATION1, I believe that computers benefit the society. Computers help us in many ways, but the @NUM1 main reasons are that they help us store important documents, get better at or learn foreign languages, and get information. So without further ado, here is more extensive reasoning. First of all, computers help us store many documents. Without computers, companies that involve auctioning and many other things would have to store everything in filing cabinets. That would take forever, and there wouldn't be enough room, so a lot of files would @CAPS1 be lying around everywhere. @CAPS1 think about it. You use computers to create, store, and send your newspaper articles, and without computers, you wouldn't be able to keep everybody up to date. Secondly, they help us learn or get better at foreign languages. Computers help us understand what other people are saying in other countries around the world. Like I have a grandmother who learned Spanish. Now I can talk to her, and she can understand me. Finally, computers help us get information. They help us get information for a project at school, records, directions, etc. In the year @DATE1, people didn't have computers, but when the first router was made, the people's knowledge went up @NUM2 points. Farmers became more prosperous, slaves became very rich, and a kid even graduated college at age @NUM3. So before you say people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends, think about what computers do for us. @CAPS1 think. So furthermore, computers benefit us a lot. They are storing devices, helping us get better at learning a foreign language, and getting information. So please make the right choice and think about what computers do for us.
646	648	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I think computers play a big role in modern society. For this reason, I think that @CAPS4 should take the advantage that @CAPS4 have. @CAPS4 could do lots of things. @CAPS4 could use it for @CAPS7 - related @CAPS6, like accessing educational resources for school - related tasks. @CAPS4 could use it for @CAPS5 @CAPS6, such as creating digital art. @CAPS4 could also chat online. @CAPS4 could use it for @CAPS7 - related @CAPS6, like getting information for homework and projects. @CAPS4 could use it for info on a project or homework, like researching historical events or scientific concepts. @CAPS4 could use it for the @CAPS8, @CAPS9, and @CAPS10, and many other reasons why @CAPS4 should have @CAPS12 for @CAPS7. @CAPS4 could use the computers for @CAPS5 @CAPS6, like making creative holiday and birthday cards or paying bills for mortgages online. @CAPS4 could book a hotel online, comparing different options easily. @CAPS4 could play on or against others with online games. @CAPS4 can use it for bidding on eBay or Amazon. Pay bills for long - distance calling. @ORGANIZATION1 the @CAPS13 if you missed it, or just @ORGANIZATION1 shows in general. @CAPS4 could use it for chatting online, like sending detailed emails or talking on ooVoo. So, that's why @CAPS4 should take the advantage.
647	649	1	3	Dear Newspaper, In my opinion, I firmly believe that computers truly benefit society. One key reason is that people can learn about new and diverse things. They can discover far - off places they've never heard of, like ancient ruins in remote regions or unique cultures in distant countries. Also, they can stay updated on what's going on in the world, from global news events to local happenings. It makes life a little easier than it is. And lastly, people can meet new people while they're on the computer. First off, we can greatly benefit from computers because we can learn new things. People can find places that they've never heard of, or they can see what's going on in the world. Computers can be a great help to kids that are in school who want to learn new things, providing them with vast knowledge at their fingertips. Computers help you find out important information that you might need to know in the future, such as career - related details or health - related facts. Secondly, having computers in our society can make life a little easier for some people. On computers, you can order things from online websites instead of trying to go out and buy them. For people with no transportation, this'll help make their lives a little easier than it is. Or, for example, if a person wants to buy something that isn't in stores yet, they can go online, and they might have it up there. Lastly, having computers can help you meet new people. If someone just moved from another town or state, this will help them meet new people. Or if a student doesn't know anybody from their new school, they might find them online and then they'll be able to get to know each other. In conclusion, computers help our society in a lot of ways. They can help us learn new things, we all can meet new people, and computers can make our lives a little easier. That's why I think we should keep computers in our society.
648	650	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, imagine a world where no information could be saved for the whole world to observe, a place with no communication with loved ones or friends; or a life with no possible way of learning of catastrophes on the other end of the earth. Clearly, a life without computers is utter chaos. Computers provide education and help us stay in contact with friends and family. I'm sure our world greatly benefits from this miracle. Medicine, @CAPS4, @CAPS5 constructing and revolutionizing our life has been made possible by computers. @PERSON1 is an old family friend of mine. He was one of the few people who was working on the mission to go to the moon for the very first time. They were astonished with what their astronauts saw. But computers made the experience a reality. @PERSON1 remembered receiving some of the first footage of the moon on to his computer, before the photographs and video were released to the public. However, @PERSON1 is not the only person who agrees. Johnson, a principal from a private school in @LOCATION1, after winning an award for best school in @LOCATION1, states “@PERCENT1 of our education comes from the computers. We make our students get involved in technology. These are the people who progress to make the best medicine, cars, and computers. Our students all are beneficial to our world today.” Why would @CAPS6 settle for anything less for our children's education? In the middle of tragedy; faced with a difficult decision; or even just lonely, longing for someone to count on; who do you turn to first? Your loved ones, they are always there for you when you need them. Now because of our access to computers, whether across the world or just the other end of the block, we will always be in contact with the ones we love. @PERSON2, my friend, found out her aunt was diagnosed last year with cancer. However, she was in a boarding school in @LOCATION2 while her aunt needed her support. Instead, she was with her every step on webcam, emailing, and @CAPS7, like having virtual family dinners. She could even contact her aunt's doctors to see her condition after. Her aunt conquered cancer with her niece's support and is living happily. With only a @NUM1 chance of living, @PERSON2 gave her the support she needed through the most difficult @CAPS2. Not only did she see the positive effects of staying in contact. Marcos, a family therapist, says “@NUM2 of happy families stay in contact after separating through the internet.” How could anyone ever leave those who you care most about behind? Imagine a world with a full education for our children to take advantage of and a place where we can stay connected with each other all the time. That's the world we live in.
649	651	1	3	@ORGANIZATION1, @DATE1, it's evident that people have been doing less exercise and not enjoying the great outdoors. There are some people who are having less family and friends time. I say it's because of computers! This machine is a great resource, but people are starting to get addicted to it. We need to reach a message to those people. Yesterday, I went to my local library and found @NUM1 computers in the library. All of the computers were filled with people, and there was a line with @NUM2 people ready to go on next. I asked those @NUM2 people “why were they there?” “for homework,” said a teenager. Another said, “just to come and play.” I also asked, “how do they stay fit?” “I don't like staying fit,” said a beautiful lady. “Staying fit isn't easy if you're always on the computer,” said the teenager. The responses I got from those people were unbelievable. If we don't stay fit, how are we going to survive from all these diseases and cancer? This reason has plenty to do with not staying fit. I don't know about you, but I care about my family. I would never spend the rest of my life in front of a computer instead of with my loved ones. In the end, I was surprised to find out that projects, homework, and research can take up half of your time with your family. Because of the computer, you can find some resources for you and your friends and family, but you can't be doing it for more than minutes. The great outdoors should be one of the best places to be because it's quiet, it's amazing, and it's a large area. If you're looking up the outdoors on a computer, that's a waste of time that you could have been spending with a family member in the park or wherever. My father says it's great to read about it, but it's better to live it. The days are getting shorter, let's live it like we mean it.
650	652	1	3	Dear Local newspaper, I agree that computers have a significant effect on people. It helps people learn hand - eye coordination, gives people the ability to learn about far - off places, and you can talk online with other people. Computers teach hand - eye coordination. As @CAPS1 grow up, they learn about letters of the alphabet and spelling. There are many well - designed online programs that teach @CAPS1 how to type accurately and quickly. Once the @CAPS1 get into learning how to type, they end up typing fast, which is useful for future work and study. Computers help @CAPS1 of the future learn, and with all these learning websites, @CAPS1 will be able to solve new things, like complex math problems or understand scientific theories. Isn't it a blessing to be able to meet people from far - off places? You'll get to learn their cultures. Would you want to know something about their daily lives? They have unique daily routines that you'll find fascinating. Well, learning a new culture is a faster way of making friends. You might connect with people who have different perspectives. One day, you might meet people who don't just want to be friends, maybe more than that. Be positive about online chatting or online dating services. As you can see from my reasons above, the computer has an effect on people. The computer teaches you hand - eye coordination, it also gives you the ability to learn about far - off places and people, and it allows you to chat with other online people. Make sure you stay positive and be safe on the computers, as there are also some potential risks, but with proper precautions, you can fully enjoy the benefits.
651	653	1	3	@ORGANIZATION1, The computer to me is very beneficial. I say that because if it weren't for the computers, we wouldn't have as much knowledge about other countries like we do now. Also, it serves as another source of communication. Another reason is that the computer helps kids get their work done faster. Hopefully, after reading this, you will think the same as I do about computers. First, the computer helps people know about what happens with people in other islands. For example, you heard about the @CAPS1 that happened in @LOCATION1 on TV. But what if you wanted to get more information about it? All you have to do is type it in, and it gives you a lot of information. Also, it shows how the situations in other places are and how people have to deal with all of that. Another example is communication. The computer has allowed people to have a conversation without a phone or being in person. That helps people a lot because not everyone likes to be on the phone all day (like me), so it's an alternative form of communication. Also, you can go on websites like @CAPS2, @CAPS3 or other places to talk to your friends. Some people prefer to have pen - pals. A pen - pal is a way you can communicate with someone you've never met and from another country. Moreover, you have multiple reasons on how you can communicate from your computers. My third reason why computers are beneficial is that they help get work done. For example, let's just say you had to find some definitions. Instead of looking the word in the dictionary, you can just type in the definition. Also, if you have to do a project on a historical figure, you can go on the computer and find information on him/her. So, I hope you take this into consideration that computers are great for society. In conclusion, computers have become an indispensable part of our lives, offering knowledge, communication, and work - efficiency benefits that are hard to ignore.
652	654	1	3	Dear to whom it @MONTH1 concerns, @CAPS1 name is @PERSON1, and I feel computers are bad for society. Computers have been the big difference when comparing the @NUM1 to the @NUM2 centuries. People have come to rely too heavily on computers. The global communication facilitated by computers has not been very helpful, and people are spending hours on their computers every day instead of exercising. On the whole, I feel society would be better off without computers. At the end of @DATE1, before the millennium would take place, everyone feared what was called @NUM3. The year two thousand would supposedly be when all computers shut down and didn't work. Computers were at their beginning for society, so everyone thought they were great. People were panicking over the thought of their precious computers not working. The entire nation had become reliant on computers. Everyone hid in attics and basements waiting for the world to end. Do you know what happened? The sun came out the next day, and everyone logged onto their emails with a sigh of relief. Not only relief for the world not ending but for the life of computers to be able to go on. People still rely on computers just as much, if not more, today. I recently visited @LOCATION1, and in a restaurant, everywhere I looked, people even had their laptops that they had to take everywhere with them. In conclusion, the @CAPS2 society is at a sad state with how much they rely on computers. A quick instinct is to say communication when asked why humans need computers. Why is that? We have telephones. Are there national television channels? We have plenty of means of communication, such as maybe writing a letter to someone. Communication would not be a problem; in fact, it has mainly caused trouble. Computers and the internet allow news to be spread quickly, even if it isn't accurate, damaging someone's career and publicity. They also allow communication with foreign countries. Excessive communication that can get countries into wars. Normally, the @LOCATION3 would have no idea what's going on, but with the internet, the nation is involved quickly. Computers breed bad communication, and you can easily communicate other ways with family and friends. Since I am a teen, I also know the problems with youths and computers. Often times, kids don't want to go outside and instead sit inside on the computer. Obesity is a rising issue in @LOCATION2, and kids need to exercise. Kids also dislike going on trips like camping outings because they don't want to leave their computer. Without computers, kids would get more exercise and be less overweight. Now you have seen @CAPS1's reasoning that society would be in much better shape if there were no computers. In essence, the over - reliance on computers has brought more harm than good to our society, and it's time we re - evaluate our relationship with them.
653	655	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I think computers are used way too much in this society! People spend more hours sitting in front of the computer than exercising because people find it more thrilling spending more time with computers than on treadmills! People in this society think we are spending too much time on the computers, while others don't realize how long they've been staring at a screen for! I am one of those people who like using the computer a lot, but I have realized changes. I can tell that many others and I have spent so much time with the computer screen that we have drifted away from our families! I never really thought about how much I don't talk to them anymore because I'm too busy cyberly chatting with friends. Although, I don't think we should get rid of the computer either. Online, we can research almost everything in the world. I can even type my name in a research bar and find information about me and anybody else with the exact same name as me! The internet has become more technical in the past years. Without it, these days, just about everybody would be lost! The internet should be used less on blogging and chatting, and should be used more on things more useful like @CAPS1.com or @CAPS2.com. I hope you consider this. In conclusion, while computers and the internet have their advantages, the current over - usage is causing negative impacts on our social lives and physical well - being. We should strike a better balance and use them more judiciously for truly useful purposes.
654	656	1	3	I believe that computers are a great help to society. I believe this because when you don't know something, you could go on - line to look it up. Also, if you are too sick or don't have time to go out and buy things that you need from stores, you can buy it on - line and have it delivered right to your door. My final reason is that computers can save paper by having a lot of documents on your computer. My first reason was that if you don't know something, you could look it up. A lot of times, you could be watching TV or talking with someone and you might wonder what something is or means. Instead of just letting whatever you didn't know just pass on, you could look it up on a computer and educate yourself and possibly others too. My next reason was that if you are too sick or don't have the time to go out and buy things that you need from stores, you can buy it on - line and have it delivered right to your door. This is a great help to the people who are too sick because sometimes they are so ill that they can't leave their home. Instead of starving to death, they can have food or anything delivered to them if they just click a couple of buttons on the computer. Now, also this could help the people who are too busy to go to stores. Right before they leave, they could press some buttons, and when they get home, their stuff is sitting there for them. Back when my dad was a @CAPS2 and my mom was a vice - president of a drug - producing company which sold oxy - cofin, they had to have a grocery service ship foods to our house. They had to have this happen because they worked long hours and they didn't have the time to go to a grocery store. They had the food delivered to our house, which was a huge help. My last and final reason is that computers can help save a lot of trees and paper. A big thing now is that we have to go green, right? Instead of cutting down more trees, we can just have all that information on our computer, which doesn't require any paper. These are just some of the reasons why computers are a help to society. I could come up with many more ideas but can't fit them just in this story. In conclusion, computers offer numerous benefits such as knowledge acquisition, convenience in shopping, and environmental protection, making them an invaluable asset to society.
655	657	1	3	The use of computers is great for everyone. Using a computer can help you learn about different people from around the world. Also, you can have the ability to talk to people. With a computer, you can also learn about places all over the @LOCATION1 and the world. With a computer, everyone can learn about people all over. If you were going on a vacation to somewhere in @LOCATION2, you could learn about what those people do. Also, you can see what people your age do for a living. If you had to do a project for school about a place outside of the @LOCATION1, the computer would help a lot. You can search what they wear and what holidays those people celebrate. Learning about people will help you make friends too. If a foreign exchange person comes to your school, you can search about their culture and talk to them about it. While using a computer, you can also talk to people. With the use of @CAPS1 or A.I.M, you can talk to your friends easily. You can ask them what homework you had if you weren't in school. You can also become better friends with people you didn't know that well by saying hello or asking how was their day. You can also email. If you meet someone you made friends with on vacation, you can email them. You can also go to websites where you can talk to people in other countries. If you have a webcam, you can even video - chat and ask them questions about their country or what they like. Also, you can video - chat with all your friends too. Using a computer, you can learn about places around the world. If you were going to a place you didn't know, you could look up the amazing restaurants. You could also look up fun things to do with the family. If you needed to do a project, you can look up what the weather is like and what the people do. If you wanted to help out a country that just had an earthquake or hurricane, you could look up what you could do to help that country. Those three reasons are why computers are essential to people. You can learn about different people, talk to your friends, and you can search and learn about different places around the world. In summary, computers open up a world of opportunities for learning, socializing, and exploring, making them an essential part of modern life.
656	658	1	3	@ORGANIZATION1, The dilemma over computers needs to be noticed. People need to realize that computers are one of the greatest inventions of our time. However, in my opinion, people take this as an advantage and misuse them for purposes they shouldn't be used for. Computers are not meant to be solely for playing games or constantly instant messaging. They are primarily meant for learning purposes and for work or school. Why do people use computers for things they don't really need? People use computers for fun! They instant message, listen to music, go on @CAPS1, @CAPS2, or @CAPS3. People also use @CAPS4 and play games on unknown websites. Computers are not meant to be for such activities; they are for school and work, like using @ORGANIZATION2, Word, @ORGANIZATION2, and PowerPoint. If computers were used for those proper purposes, people wouldn't be in the state they are today. In @LOCATION1, the computer is extremely popular, and people absolutely love it! But these people are often unfriendly, mean, and sad. They are also incredibly out of shape. I know so many people who use computers instead of doing homework and getting fresh air. All they do when they go home from school is eat and play on the computer. I have a hard time understanding why they do that, but I guess they feel they have nothing else better to do. I also know people who use the computer the right way, and they are very happy. They have a lot of knowledge, and there's never a dull conversation with them. Those people use the computer every day, but they use it correctly only for learning, and they are very smart and get good grades in school! Basically, what I'm trying to say is that people who use the computer correctly succeed in anything they do because they know how to use and understand it. But people who use it in the wrong ways will just be miserable because they don't know much, they have average grades, and they are unhealthy. In conclusion, we should all strive to use computers for their intended educational and work - related purposes to lead more fulfilling and successful lives.
657	659	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, Computers are a great way to learn about the world and its people. Computers can teach people about things that are foreign to them. They keep people in touch all over the world. Computers also come in handy when something needs to be looked up right away. Computers are very helpful when it comes to learning. They can teach you things that most books can't, such as hand - eye coordination, as well as the current populations of countries and cities. Also, computers give you the opportunity to see pictures of places and people that you couldn't find in books, photo albums, or newspapers. They also help in schools when projects are assigned. Kids can use computers to find information they need quickly. Kids can also use computers to write essays or print pictures for projects. Computers are definitely a staple for learning & education. Computers are also great for communication. People can chat with one another on networking sites such as @CAPS1, Facebook, MySpace, and Twitter. On these sites, people can send messages to their friends, alerting them of something, or chat with their friends to see what's going on and keep in touch with family and friends on the computer. Family members can e - mail each other to inform them of an event or news. I have actually had an experience with e - mail that was very helpful. My family members and I had been speaking of traveling to Block Island, and two days before we were going to leave, we received an email from the owner of the house we were going to stay at stating that all phone lines were down and part of the house was ruined due to a storm. If it weren't for computers, we would have been in a sticky situation. Computers also come in handy in times of need or confusion. People can check their local weather forecasts to see if the weather will affect their plans. Also, if someone doesn't know where a house or store is located, they can quickly look it up on the computer. Finally, if something is unavailable in a store, people can shop for it online and have it shipped to their doorstep. Computers have helped this country grow and prosper. Why bother to go against them when they benefit society so much? Computers are helping the world become a better - educated, connected, and informed world. In conclusion, the value of computers in education, communication, and daily life is undeniable, and we should embrace their continued use for the betterment of society.
658	660	1	3	"The topic that is on many minds in our country is, ""Are computers beneficial, or harmful to our students?"" @CAPS1 have evolved from desktop computers, and before that, typewriters, but have they gone too far? While the blank screen of a computer in @MONTH1 might distract some, the benefits definitely outweigh the drawbacks in a situation like this. Being able to have faster research, easier communication, and the use of computers in wartime are great capabilities of the modern computer. Also, due to advancements in technology, computers are very helpful because they assist @LOCATION4 in our daily lives. Many doubts about the computer exist, but the computer can surpass all of them. In a time - crunch situation like college or high school, speed is everything. Computers allow students to research faster and with more accuracy by being able to search for key words. Before, students would have to do the painstaking process of searching in books. More often than not, they wouldn't find what they were looking for, but with the modern age, students can get the information they need fast. Also, having computers in the classroom helps so that teachers can get the info they need for an upcoming class. If speed is what you need, then you will look for a computer. Besides speed, computers also give you another great thing, communication. With emails, @CAPS2's, @CAPS3, @CAPS4, and blogs, knowing what your friends are doing later is just a click away! This is much easier than calling the person. Also, having this access to friends can help when one moves away. If you miss a long - lost friend or cousin, just search their name, and you can talk to them! Having friends so close at hand can really make life great. Out in @LOCATION3 or @LOCATION1, soldiers rely on computers for valuable information, such as radar or robots. Having computers do the ""dirty work"" can help in times of war and can save valuable lives. Not having these computers would mean certain death for some people in the @LOCATION4 armed forces. Computers sometimes take the place of humans in things such as @ORGANIZATION1's, or unmanned aerial vehicles, and save many lives too. Whether it be Facebook or bombings, computers help in a vital way. It was @DATE1, and @PERSON1's communist regime was ruling New @LOCATION2. One man stood in front of a tank, refusing to move, showing courage and wanting a democracy. Fortunately, this was all caught on film. How was it broadcasted to the world? Using the computer and the internet. Today, many people are able to learn about that due to computers. In many ways, computers help @LOCATION4 in our daily lives, and for most of @LOCATION4, without them, we would be lost. In conclusion, the numerous benefits of computers in education, communication, and warfare clearly show that they are an essential part of our modern world."
659	661	1	3	In present day, most people live on the computer. Whether it's for work or pleasure, everyone uses a computer. In a recent study, researchers determined that an average person spends @NUM1 years of his or her life on the computer. That's a total of @NUM1 years of life wasted. Most kids spend all day on the computer on @CAPS1, Facebook, @CAPS2, and YouTube. They could be using that time to be around family and friends, making memories. Kids don't realize how short life is. They should be hiking, camping, spending time with friends and family. I think years from now, when kids grow into adults, they will be looking back and regretting not spending more time with their family or not taking opportunities to explore the world we live in. Instead, they will be looking back and thinking about the hilarious video on YouTube that got over one million hits. Also, as you @MONTH1 know, child obesity is on the rise. There are more overweight kids than healthy ones. If you look back to the times before computers, you will notice that you will rarely see an overweight child. The computer is to blame for this new pandemic. Kids should be outdoors playing sports and getting fresh air. I bet that if computers were taken away for @NUM3 year, then the changes in health would be drastic. Kids would be a lot healthier and have lost the weight. I hope that everyone can see the harms of the computer by reading this, and they will get rid of this poisonous object. In conclusion, we should encourage kids to limit their computer use and engage in more physical and social activities to lead healthier and more fulfilling lives.
660	662	1	3	Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1, you @MONTH1 know a lot of people nowadays are constantly on the computer, and many people think it's a problem. Well, you should know the computer is helpful in many ways, such as for learning, entertainment, and even health - related research. That is just a few out of the hundreds of different things there is to do. The computer can help you get in contact with relatives you haven't seen in a long time. Or maybe if you have been having some health problems, you can go online to see what is wrong. I remember my mom has been getting really dizzy and sick, and her doctor told her everything was fine, but it wasn't. So my mom checked up what was wrong on the computer and found out she had a disease. When she went back to the doctors, they figured out she really did and put her on a medicine. In my opinion, the computer was one of the best inventions made. It can be used for so many things. You can also purchase items over the computer. So now I hope you agree with my opinion and support the use of computers. In conclusion, the multiple benefits of computers in various aspects of our lives make them an indispensable tool, and we should recognize and embrace their positive contributions.
661	663	1	3	Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 you see, owning a computer can significantly affect you. Having a computer can lead you to develop lazy behavior, as you may find yourself sitting idle for long periods. It can confine you from being outdoors, where you could enjoy the fresh air and natural surroundings. Moreover, it can keep you inside so you don't hang out with family and friends. Everyone loves having a computer, but have you ever thought about what it can do to you? Spending all day or even half your day on the computer will surely make you lazy. When you're lazy or becoming lazy, you don't want to do anything, and without doing anything, you can easily become overweight. So, you need exercise because it's good for you, and exercising can protect you from health problems such as @CAPS1 diabetes. Get off your computer, and go for a walk. Why would anyone want to be indoors on a computer when you can go enjoy what nature possesses? Being so drawn to your computer can trap you indoors instead of breathing fresh, clean air which is outside. Being outside can be lots of fun too. You can go swimming or even have a picnic in your local park. When you're outside, you can also see all the breathtaking scenery, wild animals, and exotic plants and flowers that live among us. If you just go outside for at least an hour a day, you'll surely see how much better it is than being on a computer. Staying on the computer for too long can prevent you from what really matters, your friends and family. Why talk on the internet to a friend when you can meet up with them and do something fun? Friends and family are really important, and if you don't spend time with them, they can become upset. Being with friends and family are supposed to be the best moments of your life, so don't spend them on the computer. Go call up a friend and do something fun. I hope by now you understand that being on the computer or having one is not the best idea. Having a computer can make you lazy, restrict you from enjoying nature, and can have you not spend time with family and friends. If everyone got off the computer for at least an hour a day, they'll live a happier, healthier life. So, turn off your computer, get off your couch, and enjoy your life.
662	664	1	3	"Technology has been growing and changing rapidly. Just look at Apple's new @CAPS1, a decently sized touch - screen computer. Computers have been rapidly changing too. But I think that @CAPS2 need to cut down on the use of electronics. Being on the computer for a long and large amount of time can damage your eyesight, give you arthritis, and takes time away from exercising; one of the things many @CAPS2 need to do. Many @CAPS2 have been spending far too long on the computer. Although it can be very useful, it can also be very damaging to your eyesight. Many people spend large amounts of time staring at the computer screen. If you stare at something for too long, it can damage your eyesight and make it worse because you're straining your eye lens. Also, the lighting from the computer is very hurtful to your eyes. The light coming onto your eyes is like staring at the sun but not quite as damaging. The sun will instantly damage your eyes, while over time, a computer slowly damages your eyesight. If your eyesight is already damaged, a computer will worsen it. The more time spent on a computer, the more you damage your vision. Since your eyes are already bad, you might think ""well, they can't get any worse."" However, the truth is they can. Not only is the light and the amount of time spent on the computer damaging to people with @NUM1 vision, but it's even more damaging to people without. Arthritis can be genetic or common to people who constantly crack their knuckles. It can also be common to people who spend excessive amounts of time on the computer. AIM is very popular to people of all ages. It's a way to instantly gossip or chat with friends. But it takes a lot of typing. Typing too long or too much can cause your fingers to lock up and make it harder for your bones to move over your joints without pain. If this constantly happens to you, you could be a candidate for arthritis. Not letting your fingers take a break can also be one of the reasons your fingers hurt. If you never let them take a break, they can also lock up and it can be very painful. You should spend less time on the computer if you don't want arthritis. Because of all this new technology, less @CAPS2 go outside and play or hit the gym and exercise. That might be why many @CAPS2 are overweight. Being on the computer for too long takes away time you could use to exercise or get some fresh air."
663	665	1	3	"I think that a computer is a good idea because when people are online, they like to talk to their family and see them via the video cam. When you don't want to go out, you can just go online and have fun. Like, would you like to be interrupted while watching a movie you like? You'd be like, ""Oh, go clean your room,"" and you'd go like, ""Oh wait, this movie is good."" Computers are the best system for going online. Everybody uses computers. Without a computer, how are you going to check your Yahoo @CAPS1? My mom loves to be on @CAPS2. How are you going to check your messages if you don't have a computer? If they take computers out of sale, everybody is going to try to make one. And the people from Walmart are going to be like, ""They're making more money than me,"" like the people from [store name]. They've got good computers. No one should force people to get offline. The Apple store has a great selection when people go over and buy some computers. People spend all the time online because they like to be online. If I like being online, you're not going to take the computers and say, ""You're searching more in the computer."" But it's all about computers. When your mom is always at your house being boring, go buy a computer when you get money. In conclusion, computers offer so many benefits that they have become an essential part of our lives, and we should make the most of them."
664	666	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @ORGANIZATION2, I believe that computers have a positive affect on people who use them. Because they teach hand - eye coordination, give us the ability to learn about far - away people and places, and allow us to chat online with people. The first reason of why I think computers have a positive affect on people is that they teach hand - eye coordination. For example, we need to use our hand - eye coordination skills when we type to find the letters. This helps us increase our hand - eye coordination because it helps us think about what letters we are typing, locate the letters on the keyboard, and push them. Also, when we type long passages, it increases our hand - eye coordination because we get used to writing the long paragraphs and we become more familiar with where the letters are on the keyboard, and our speed increases, which means we can get more work done in a shorter time. Believe it or not, @PERSON1 from the @ORGANIZATION1 hospital took a survey that showed @NUM1 people who type essays instead of writing them by hand have a greater hand - eye coordination skill. Computers also allow us to learn about far - away people and places. For example, computers make it easier to research far - away people and places. Using a computer can help us understand and learn about people and places without a trip to the library. Also, computers allow us to access more info about recent events that have just happened around the world. Also, computers make it faster to research topics because looking for a book in those big libraries can be stressful, not to mention difficult. Also, information on a computer can never be checked out or not available like library books. Lastly, you have information right at your fingertips, so you will never have to leave your house. The last reason is that computers allow us to chat online with other people. This can help us because it allows us to talk to friends and family from around the world. Also, it helps us talk to our parents if they're away or if you're on a camping trip. Chatting on a computer is a great way to make friends with people you don't know and block people you don't want talking to you. So, in a sense, you can be in control of your friendships and who you're friends with. Computers are the greatest advance in technology since the wheel, and they have helped so many people. In conclusion, the positive impacts of computers on our lives are undeniable, and we should continue to embrace this useful technology.
665	667	1	3	Dear, @CAPS1 paper @CAPS2 The computers we have do benefit our society, because it makes people smarter, it's a way to talk to people who live far from where you live, and it's a great way to do homework if you're still in school. Having a computer is a great way to get you smarter. You could go on different websites to help you learn what you're stuck on in school. I remember the time I was having trouble in math, so my teacher gave me this website called @ORGANIZATION1. It goes over what you need help on, and you get a live tutor. The computer could even teach babies how to talk. It taught my cousin how to talk, and he's @NUM1 @NUM1/2 years old. Isn't that amazing what computers can do? Next, I will talk about how computers are a great resource to talk to far - away people you might know. When you have computers, you could talk to people that live across the @LOCATION1. Wouldn't you want to talk to somebody long - distance without paying extra money on your cell - phone? I remember one time I was talking to my dad because I had no minutes on my phone, and it went great talking to him on the computer. Having a computer is kind of like a bigger cellphone. You could talk to a family or a friend if you or they don't have a phone. Lastly, I will talk about how you could do homework. Having a computer, you could do a lot of homework. Last time I was on my computer, I had to find out about @PERSON1 for math, so I typed his name, and his biography came up, so I wrote about him. You could use it for all subjects, especially language arts. You could type up papers and look up different things you had to do in class. Would you want to write a @NUM3 - page essay and make your fingers cramp up just from writing? No. So, you just go on the computer and type it up without cramping your fingers. @CAPS3 reconsider your opinion, because computers can get you smarter, talk to far - away people, and help you with homework. In conclusion, computers have become an indispensable part of our lives, offering numerous benefits that enhance our learning, communication, and productivity.
666	668	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I understand the controversies surrounding the use of computers. Computers stand at the heart of modern technology. I truly can't envision a world without them. However, during @MONTH1, having a computer can lead children to play uneducational games. Yet, computers offer far more in terms of teaching and assisting children. I know that for your company, operating without computers would be a nightmare. They provide education not only to children but also to adults. First of all, computers are proven to be the second - best source of education, right behind school, and they are also the best source of information. There are millions of websites dedicated solely to various forms of education. Moreover, there are @CAPS1's that offer online tutors or just academic work. Computers can provide practically anything you need. For work and adult use, people utilize computers to sell products, communicate with others, or simply look up new topics. The technology of a computer surpasses that of any other item. Without a computer, life would be much more difficult. Instead of just sending an email, one would have to send out physical mail. Most information would have to be retrieved from books. In fact, even the internet has a vast selection of books for purchase and reading. I am aware that some people feel that children are spending too much time on the computer chatting with friends. But children need to be social. If they weren't talking on the computer, there would just be more texting and calling. The computer makes life so much easier that taking it away would cause stress and leave less time for other important activities. Lastly, computers are essential for handling documents and are the best way to type. Your company can definitely agree that without the ability to type documents, life would be in chaos. Everyone writes up documents, needs to send them, open them up again, and edit them. The only other option for typing is a typewriter. Typewriters can't save anything, delete content efficiently, or perform half of the tasks that computers can. Your whole job depends on the computer and typing. How would you feel if you couldn't use a computer? In conclusion, computers are a necessity in our lives. Without them, life would be difficult and stressful. Computers offer education and information to everyone. Their technology is truly remarkable and makes everyday life more convenient. I couldn't even imagine a world without documents and typing. I'm sure you will agree with my view. I hope you choose to inform others with this information. Thank you for your time.
667	669	1	3	"@ORGANIZATION1, I am writing this letter to inform you about the use of computers. Computers can be a source of fun and interest. However, people are spending an excessive amount of time on the computer. In my opinion, you should spend time interacting with people in your society, your family, and friends. I also think that it is easy to get addicted to the computer. I should admit that I was once a person who spent a great deal of time @NUM1 on the computer, and it wasn't a good situation. You should be cautious when using the computer because these days, it can be quite dangerous. It is truly appalling that people spend more time on the computer than with their own families. Don't you agree? Well, you should. Your society, family, and friends should be the most important things to you. You shouldn't spend your entire day on the computer; instead, you should interact with the people around you. Nowadays, you will see plenty of people engrossed in their computers and not spending time with their families. This situation shouldn't persist. Although the computer is fun and interesting, there are people around you who wish to spend time with you. You should think about this because this problem is occurring too frequently in the world. @PERCENT1 of the people in my school say they are addicted to the computer, and @PERCENT2 of the people in my community say they are addicted too. Those are very high percentages, don't you think? This is a terrible situation and should stop. The computer is like a drug. You might get on it once, and then you'll just want to stay on it every day, all day. The first time you use the computer, you can become addicted right away. I'm not saying you should never use the computer, but make sure you won't get too addicted because it can happen very easily. My mother always said, ""Be safe on the computer."" At first, I didn't really understand what she meant, but now I do. Whatever you do on the computer will remain there and be saved, no matter how hard you try to delete it. So, you should be careful and don't put anything on the computer if you wouldn't want anyone else to see it. Anyone can access what you post, so you should be cautious. Kids are meeting people they don't know and trying to meet them in person. So, you should be vigilant because the computer is a place where people can lie. Now you should understand where I'm coming from. You should now agree with me and understand that people should spend more time interacting with others, avoid getting addicted, and be safe while using the computer."
668	670	1	3	"Some people believe that computers have a positive impact on people. However, in reality, excessive computer use can rot your brain. I think that spending too much time on the computer is a waste and serves as an excuse to avoid spending time with your family and going outside to enjoy nature. This is why computer time should be reduced, and family time should be increased. Undoubtedly, computers are the kind of things that can damage brain cells if you spend too much time on them. Teenagers are the main group affected by this. When they get on the computer and use platforms like MySpace and Facebook, they aren't learning anything and are actually killing major brain cells. When they go to school to take the CMTS, they are likely to fail because they won't have learned anything due to excessive computer use. Also, this is a significant problem for families because they don't spend time together as they are constantly on the computer. The excuse parents often give is ""@CAPS1, I'm on the computer,"" and then they never engage with their children, which makes the children very upset. This leads to anger problems, and then the children stop listening to their parents. It's all about cause and effect. My friend on @NUM1 has anger issues and doesn't listen to anyone, all because her family never spent time together. Consequently, people spend most of their time inside on the computer. You guessed right! My sister is on the computer @NUM2 and never goes outside to enjoy nature. People can develop a condition where they hate going outside, and we don't want that to happen. Doctor @CAPS2 Brown says that everyone should go outside to relax, preferably every day, because staying in the house isn't good for you. The computer is preventing this from happening. On the other hand, the computer is a useful device and can be very handy at times. For example, if you need perfect directions or have a question to answer, it can be a great help. Sometimes, you just want to talk to old friends you haven't seen in a while. Computers are good for many things, but too much of it isn't good for us. Lastly, I'd like to say that the computer has great utility, but I think it just gives us excuses not to spend time with our family and not to go outside enough to enjoy nature. We should strike a balance between using the computer and living a real - life, social existence."
669	671	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I was shocked to learn that there are people who believe computers don't benefit society. After hearing this, I felt compelled to share my opinions. Computers are indeed beneficial to society. They assist us in communicating, performing important tasks, and having fun. Computers help us communicate in numerous ways. We all want to talk to our friends, but we can't be with them all the time. So, the internet comes to our rescue. We also have friends we don't see often, but with the internet, we can talk to them as long as we want. Moreover, computers also help us make new friends. They can also be a great source of entertainment. There are many reasons why computers are fun. Social networking sites, such as Facebook or MySpace, are enjoyable to use. There are also many fun activities on the internet, including video games. Many video game consoles are connected to the internet, allowing you to play with your friends. However, computers aren't just for fun and games. They can transfer very important information, such as homework and details about after - school activities. Computers also store all of our government's information, ranging from something as seemingly insignificant as plans for renovating a town - owned building to information related to the Department of Homeland Security in the United States. Without computers, none of this would be possible. This should convince you that computers are necessary in our daily lives. From communication to handling important matters, computers have helped us and will continue to do so in the future. In conclusion, computers play an indispensable role in modern society, and their benefits far outweigh any potential drawbacks.
670	672	1	3	"Dear whomever it may concern, my name is @CAPS2 @CAPS3, and I think that the effects that computers have on people are not positive. I think this for several reasons. Firstly, because of computers, nobody goes out. People don't go for walks because they are occupied with something on the computer. There is now no need for anyone to visit a store of any kind because you can order everything online and have it delivered right to your front door. Also, for a large number of people, they don't even have to go to work. They can work for any company right from their home computer. People can even complete high school and college on their computers by taking online courses. This brings me to my next reason for believing that computers have a negative effect on people. Students can now type out all their assignments. Some schools even provide laptops to students for use throughout the year. Being able to type out everything means that students would hardly ever have to pick up a pen or pencil, which would make their handwriting worse due to lack of practice. Another way computers have a negative impact on students is because of the internet. You can find any and every piece of information on the internet, from math books to dictionaries and other reference books. As a result, some students don't even know how to look up a word in the dictionary, let alone find necessary information in a book. I think this gives students a wrong perception and sense of reality. When they enter the workforce, not everything will be done on a computer, but this is all they are being taught to rely on. Lastly, people are losing their desire to do everyday things. Why go out with friends when you can talk to them online? Why go out to dinner when you can order it online? People are starting to see no point in going out and doing things because they think there are ""more important things"" to do on the computer. I personally think computers are brain - washing us, and pretty soon, the world is going to be overly dependent on computers. Based on everything I just said, I don't think computers have a very good effect on people. They are making the world a very restricted and controlled place. Considering this information, I'm sure you can understand why I hold this view. In conclusion, while computers have their uses, we need to be aware of their negative impacts and take steps to ensure a healthy balance in our lives."
671	673	1	3	"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1, in my honest opinion, people these days really do use computers a great deal! Some individuals simply don't care about engaging in exercise or enjoying the beauty of nature. Perhaps some people even lack friends, so they end up spending a large amount of their time on the computer because they feel they have no other fulfilling activities. Or maybe they just get hooked on websites that are highly addictive. For example, @CAPS2.com, many people and kids have accounts on it. They chat with their friends or maybe even their boyfriends. Anyway, that's my opinion. Another opinion I hold is that I think people should not spend the majority of their time on the computer. I think this because people should be having a great time, socializing with others, and truly living their lives! So, this is what I think, my opinion about ""Computers"". In conclusion, we should strike a balance between computer use and real - world experiences."
672	674	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 of @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS2, have you ever pondered why our exercise and time spent in nature seem to be decreasing? In my view, I don't think computers are the culprit. I firmly believe that computers have a positive impact because they can help you connect with people from different corners of the world. You can interact with them, learn about their unique cultures, such as their marriage traditions. You can also discuss their schools and ask them various questions. Secondly, computers are beneficial as you can learn a wide range of things from them and discover useful how - to guides to simplify life. You can study more effectively with different learning resources available on the computer, which can be a great help for school. Thirdly, computers are a great way to stay in touch with far - away relatives. If you haven't talked to them in a long time, you can find out how they're doing and what their lives are like. When you finally meet up, you'll have so much to catch up on. In conclusion, technology will undoubtedly be a great asset in the future. The wonderful computer will help you maintain close relationships with your family and friends. Now it's time to embrace this amazing technology because it will be with us for years to come!
673	675	1	3	"Would you ever think that a computer can consume too much of your time or prevent you from doing many other things? Does using a computer disrupt your life in some ways? I would say no. Computers have become an integral part of our daily lives, and almost everyone needs or uses them in some form. People rely on computers to catch up on the news when they miss it on @CAPS1. They turn to the remarkable technology we have, such as laptops or phones with internet access through @CAPS2.C. This is now a natural part of our lifestyle. The computer doesn't stop you from going outside and engaging in other activities; it's a personal choice when you say, ""I love this technology so much that I want to stay on it."" So, is it the computer that messes up someone's life, or is it the person's own preference? A @CAPS2.C can do so many wonderful things for you. For instance, when you have a lot of homework and a project to complete, you can use the computer to work efficiently. You can listen to music while typing your project. Even though you're not outside being active, you're still doing something beneficial for your future, like improving your typing speed for a job and learning how to use a @CAPS2.C proficiently. Computers have been around for a long time, and since their introduction, we've become smarter and more talented in many ways. Both kids and adults can stay informed about what's happening around the world. Technology has been a great help, especially when people need to get things done quickly. Even @NUM1 - year - old people can conduct research on things they've never known and discover countless applications for the computer. Although some people spend long hours on the computer, they still need to interact with their family. In conclusion, computers are a natural necessity, and while some may overuse them, they offer numerous benefits that enhance our lives."
674	676	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, I firmly believe that computers are beneficial in many aspects. For example, computers can sometimes keep kids off the streets, thus preventing them from getting into trouble. The computer offers a wide variety of games that can keep you occupied. It also has Microsoft, which is extremely useful for writing projects and similar tasks. Computers are a great help to many people. As I mentioned earlier, some of the games on the computer are educational, covering subjects like science, math, reading, and social studies. However, computers also have a dark side. When most teens use the computer, they often like to visit a site called Myspace. Myspace allows you to make friends from all over the world, talk to them, and post pictures of yourself. But if you have friends from different states or even the same state on Myspace, there's a risk that some of them might have bad intentions. They could start a conversation with you, asking for your name and where you live, and potentially pose a danger like attempting to rape you. Another problem is that when @NUM1 graders enter middle school, @NUM2 graders might tell them about inappropriate websites, and the younger kids could get in trouble by visiting them. Well, you've heard my opinion. I hope you understand that while computers have advantages, we also need to be cautious about their potential risks.
675	677	1	3	"Dear @LOCATION1 press, I am convinced that computers have a terrible impact on society. The reasons I believe this are quite concerning. Firstly, kids can become what some people call ""braindead"". Secondly, the rate of childhood obesity, which is already on a significant rise, can be exacerbated by excessive computer use. And finally, kids often develop poor eyesight from spending too much time on the computer. The first reason is that many kids just sit in front of the computer, munching on snacks while they're engrossed in it. They develop an addiction, and as a result, they don't get enough exercise and keep getting fatter. This issue of childhood obesity is a widely - discussed topic, and with the prevalence of computer use, it's unlikely to improve anytime soon. Studies show that @PERCENT1 of kids who use the computer for more than an hour and a half a day are showing signs of mental dullness. If this trend continues, our next generation may not be as smart as they should be and will struggle to keep up with other countries, which could be a real setback for our nation. The last but equally important reason is that kids are developing poor eyesight. This can have a long - term negative impact on future generations. If this continues, it's almost like a domino effect, and the entire generation may end up needing glasses. In conclusion, the negative impacts of computers on kids, such as obesity, mental dullness, and poor eyesight, are serious issues that we need to address to safeguard the well - being of our society."
676	678	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I think people are spending too much time on the computer, and these are my reasons: less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with friends and family. My first reason is the lack of exercise. People are so busy on the computer, playing games and chatting with others. Don't you think you should be outside, running around or playing sports, instead of sitting in your house, doing nothing on the computer? People should get at least @NUM1 of exercise. You can be on the computer for a short while, but not for @NUM2 straight. Take a break from the computer and go outside to enjoy the weather and the outdoors. It's hard to believe that people can't spare @NUM1 from their computer time. It's as if the computer has taken over their brains, and all they want to do is stay on it and never get off.  My second reason is about enjoying nature. Go outside for a bit and see what's happening. Take a walk in the woods and look for animals or their tracks. There are so many fun things to do outside, like climbing a tree or going fruit - picking. You don't have to be inside all day, staring at the computer, playing games and chatting with friends. You could be outside, enjoying the beautiful weather. People need to realize that there are better ways to spend their time.  My third reason is interacting with friends and family. It's important to spend time with them, to see how they've been and what they've been up to. But instead, people are always too busy on the computer, doing things that aren't really necessary. There are far more important things in life, and people need to understand this. Family should come before the computer, but these days, people often put family second. They never want to talk to or see their family because they're too busy wasting time on the computer. Checking your email is fine, but spending time on chat platforms like @CAPS1, @CAPS2, or @CAPS3 is just a waste. People can hang out and do things together without being on the computer. They could just call their friends instead.  I have a @CAPS2 too, and I know it takes time away from hanging out with family and other activities. But I make time to hang out with friends and family, enjoy nature, and exercise. So, I don't understand why it's so hard for others to do the same. In conclusion, I think people waste too much time on the computer. As I've said, there are more important things in life, like exercising, enjoying nature, and spending time with friends and family. I hope you'll take my ideas into consideration. Thank you for listening to my thoughts. I hope people can realize that they don't have to be on the computer @NUM4.
677	679	1	3	Could you live a day without a computer? I talk to my friends every day on the @CAPS1. It's a great way to stay connected with them, especially when we can't meet up in person. I learn about current events that I wouldn't know without a computer. A computer also helps me through my daily life in numerous ways.  I acknowledge that I should get outside and meet up with my friends. However, sometimes when it's raining or snowing outside, I just want to talk to them online. Another great thing about talking online is that I can talk to all my friends at once, not just the one I'm playing with at the moment. I've noticed that even when my friends go away to different places, they can still stay in touch because of their computers.  Not only can you stay in touch with your friends, but you can also learn about the current events. Whenever I go into @CAPS1 @CAPS2, my @ORGANIZATION1 page comes up and shows me the latest current events. Without a computer, I wouldn't be able to see who won last night's ball game or what's happening with the health - care bill. These are important things that help me keep up with what's going on away from my town. A computer also lets me learn more about what the healthcare bill actually is and how it affects me.  Not only does a computer teach me about current events, it also helps me in my daily life. When I'm eating breakfast, I check my email and look at the weather forecast on the computer. During school, I type up my essays using a computer. When I get home, I check the homework assignments and talk to my friends online, all on the computer. That just goes to show how much I rely on computers each day. I rely on my computer so much that I would be lost without it, and I would get only half as much done.  I strongly believe that computers are a necessity. They allow me to talk to my friends when we can't meet up in person. They keep me up - to - date with current events. I think computers have become an integral part of our daily lives, and it's hard to imagine life without them.
678	680	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 man, @CAPS2, would you want people to be on a computer all day, doing nothing productive? How would you feel if no one was out getting exercise, and no one was using the playgrounds, parks, and beaches? Everyone would be sitting at home, on their nice, new, fancy computers. When you really think about how much time people spend just sitting around, doing nothing, @CAPS2, would a computer solve that problem? It really @CAPS4't.  This is what I would say about having computers: People spend too much time on them. Exercise is needed every day. Spending excessive time on computers makes your body weak and your eyes strained. When it comes to computers, everyone wants to get one, but when we talk about exercise, it seems like people's minds just switch off. This happens because people are really starting to spend lots of time on computers. If they work on computers for a long period during the day and then head home to spend more time on the computer, @CAPS5, what's that doing to your body? It's not helping at all.  I like computers too, and I enjoy spending time on them. But sometimes, when I'm supposed to get something done, it doesn't happen because I get engrossed and forget what time it is. This isn't fun. Sometimes, people are so engaged in their computers that when someone is talking to them and telling them something they need to do, they just nod their heads as if they understand. But when you ask later if it got done, it hasn't. You know they weren't really listening.  Exercise is really important for your body. It doesn't have to be anything extreme, but don't waste your time on the computer. This happens to @NUM1 to @NUM2 or families when they come home from work or school and immediately jump on the computers. Families aren't getting enough exercise or spending time together because computers get in the way. Exercise would help keep you healthy instead of relying on electronics.  Computers are like little robots that control your mind and body. They suck the life out of you. They strain your eyes, make you irritable, and you don't really want to do much. Maybe if people spent less time on computers and more time focusing on their families and nature, they @CAPS4't be so weak and tired.  I know a lot of people who @CAPS4't want computers to be banned, but I think it would help for a lot of reasons. It would make families closer and bodies more focused. From my experience, computers do help in some ways, but when it comes to real - life situations, they don't help most people. I hope you understand @CAPS2 why I say these things. But if you do care about health and activities, @CAPS5, you would also say that computers aren't very helpful.
679	681	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2, I am going to inform you that more and more people are using computers instead of spending time with their family. I agree with the many effects that computers have on people. There are several reasons why we should use computers.  My first reason is that it gives us information. It provides us with weather reports, school openings, delays, and closings. It also tells us about the situation in @LOCATION1 after the earthquake. It offers a vast amount of information and allows us to visit other websites to find more. Moreover, it allows us to have fun and play games on the internet. It can be a great help with our homework. It can also assist us in finding things like jobs and other opportunities.  My second reason is that we can interact with people. We can talk to people we've never met before. We can find out information about them and learn a little about their lives. It can even help the police find information about criminals and track them down. It's better and faster than using the phone to communicate. And it can make people have a great time, which makes them want to stay on the computer for a long time.  My third reason is that it keeps us updated, especially for those who love sports. It would tell us the most recent news about teams and players. If you're a sports fanatic, you can watch live games on the computer. You can also post about games and have a chance to see the players interact with their fans.  In conclusion, these are the reasons why we should use computers. It can provide us with information from all over the world. It allows us to interact with people we've never met before. And it keeps us updated on the sports we love, especially for sports enthusiasts. Computers have become an important part of our lives, helping us in various aspects.
680	682	1	3	With more and more people using computers, I think that this does not benefit society. I think this because more cases of suicide are due to online bullying, people get @CAPS2 addicted and don't exercise, which leads to obesity, and because it is bad for the environment.  Now more than ever before, people are bullying, but not in the traditional way. Now, bullies have found a new way, by creating web pages, emailing the victim, or making threats online. On the internet, people say things that they wouldn't say in person because they don't have to face the other person. Did you know that @PERCENT1 of all teenage suicides are a result of being bullied online? The bullies get into the victim's head and cause them to harm themselves. If fewer people went online, the youth would be more protected from online predators.  When you sit on the computer, playing games or chatting with friends, you're most likely sitting still. And when you eat while sitting in front of the computer, you're not exercising. More than @PERCENT2 of obese people say they don't exercise because they're either too tired or don't have enough time. Of course, you're going to be tired if you sit for hours, staring at a computer screen. When they say they don't have time, but they spend an hour a day on the computer, it doesn't make sense. Obesity has become a big concern as it is the main cause of heart problems. @CAPS2, get active!  The environment is a major concern these days, with the rise of toxic substances, the depletion of the @CAPS1 layer, and the increase in skin cancer. But how does the computer contribute to this? Well, computers use energy and release toxins into the environment. They are harming the @CAPS1 layer. The more powerful the computers are, the more damage they do to people. Yes, plants do help the @CAPS1 layer, but when you print, it's very hard to keep up with the demand. And what will the @CAPS3 eat without trees and plants? By the time our children's children are here, there @MONTH1 be hardly any wildlife left, barely any wilderness, and without the @CAPS1 layer, many people will die of skin cancer. All because we are @CAPS2 addicted to using computers.  People's lives, health, and the environment are all big issues, and the over - use of computers is contributing to their deterioration. How would you feel if you walked into your child's bedroom and found them dead because of online bullying? Or if you saw a loved one suffering from heart problems due to obesity because they couldn't get off the computer? Or in about @NUM1 years, if the @CAPS1 layer is completely destroyed due to computer use, with hardly any wildlife left?  Sure, computers are useful for a quick look - up, but there are books too. The computer has what a local library has, but @CAPS2 stop being lazy and get out. We need to put a stop to suicides, obesity, and environmental damage caused by the over - use of computers.
681	683	1	3	Do you ever have time to read a captivating novel with rich characters and immersive plots? Do you ever spend quality time with your family, sharing stories and creating memories? Or do you ever have time to go outside and breathe in the fresh air, feel the warmth of the sun on your skin? Well, if you don't, it's because you spend too much time on the computer, lost in a digital world. Computers are bad for society. And I will show you why. There are many great activities you can do such as reading a book. Instead of reading on the computer, pick up a well - crafted novel. You can ask your parents to drive you to the library, a haven filled with countless books waiting to be discovered. I understand that if you need to do research you can do it on the computer, but in the library there are all sorts of books such as thrilling fiction, informative non - fiction, and engaging science books. Every intelligent citizen would admit that computer sources often have wrong information. I remember when I was doing a project on a famous musician, the pioneer of a certain genre of music. I used the computer to research who killed her and it said that a man killed her. I went to the library and checked out a book on her and it said that a woman killed her actually. In addition, books help you get more accurate facts. Every caring, loving human cares about spending time with their family. How can you spend more time with your family? Well, you can visit some cousins on the weekends, having fun playing games and catching up. Your family can make parties, like a lively birthday party or a cozy family gathering. I recall having a party for my baby brother's baptism, everyone came. I got to see my aunts and cousins that I didn't see in years. I understand that if you have a far - away relative you would use the computer to chat with them or see them on webcam, but why not take a vacation where they live and go by car, that would bring the family even closer. I know what that is like. My family lives in a beautiful small town and I visit them every year. We have family reunions, maybe your family can do that too. As a result, family is important, so don't let the computer ruin yours. Do you ever go outside anymore? Is the computer getting in your way? You have to check your e - mail, reply, go on your virtual pet, it's hungry, you have to do your daily activities. What about your health? Getting fresh air can be good. There are many great things you can do outside. For example, you can jump rope with friends, go to the park and play on the swings, go swimming in a cool lake, play in the snow and build snowmen. I remember the time my cousin came over and we went to the park. We stayed there until the park closed. It was very entertaining. Every citizen in our community wants to be healthy. Going outside can help you, run through the woods exploring nature, or even jump roping is outside and exercising. In addition, just going outside can do more. Now is the time. Why wait another minute? You can either be all alone on the computer or be outside, or be with your family, even the library isn't lonely. Computers are a bad habit, even though we might need them, it's better safe than sorry to do it the old - fashioned way.
682	684	1	3	Dear Newspaper, it has come to my attention that there is an ongoing debate about the issue stating that not everyone agrees that computers benefit society. I can't understand why. Computers present many wonderful opportunities for people. They allow for people to communicate with each other in real - time, no matter the distance. They allow people to research topics in a simpler way, saving us a great deal of time. And they teach hand - eye coordination gradually. This is why I agree that computers do benefit society. In the modern world, nearly all businesses rely on communication. Many people in those businesses use not only phones to communicate, but computers as well. Online communication, such as video conferencing and instant messaging, is a fast, simple, and effective way for people to communicate whether they are at home or at work. This is one way computers benefit all of society. Nobody knows everything, we are always trying to find out about new things that we never knew. Sometimes we may use books, but the way most people use is online researching. This is because not only is it quicker, but simpler as well. When you research online, the information literally comes to you. All you do is type a subject into the search bar. This is another reason why computers do benefit society. The final reason is that computers teach hand - eye coordination. This shows because as time progresses while you are on the computer you realize that typing becomes easier. It might take a while, but over time people get the hang of it. It's as if the computer is letting you teach yourself. Some people would say that people spend too much time on computers. This isn't a problem though because people have to spend long periods of time on computers in order to do the beneficial things that computers have to offer. In conclusion, you can see that I have clearly stated the benefits of computers. They allow us to communicate, research, and improve our hand - eye coordination. This is why computers do benefit society.
683	685	1	3	In this modernized world, computers are key. They offer many benefits that include seamless communication, diverse entertainment, and a comprehensive education. These benefits have positive effects on people throughout the world and are why I support the advances in technology. Communication is a large benefit with computers. Whether you are keeping in touch with old friends from school or organizing important business meetings, computers offer a large amount of aid. With the modern technology that is provided with the computer, people can instantly send messages to co - workers or friends in a matter of seconds. In some cases, businesses completely rely on the computer to function; for example, to have in - depth conversations with people across the globe to discuss how they are going to expand internationally. Computers are greatly necessary for people to communicate and enable people to make plans simply and effectively. The computer also supplies an endless source of entertainment. With the internet, the computer provides the users with a plethora of websites that enable them to talk to friends on social media, watch interesting videos on video - sharing platforms, play exciting games, and more. The computer provides a relaxing way to enjoy yourself when it is late at night or on a rainy day. The computer enables people to stay entertained and relaxed when needed. The most important function of the computer is education. The computer supplies the user or student with a wide variety of information. The computer aids the user with vast information on every subject or topic that may be brought up in a classroom. It comes to be very useful for research projects, where students can gather data from multiple sources, or even learning another language through online courses. The computer is very beneficial when it comes to education. The computer is a technology that has come to make daily life simple. It has come to be incorporated with almost any daily task that may occur during the day. It would be unjust to stop advancing in this technological wonder. The computer is a technology that greatly benefits our communication, our entertainment, and even our education.
684	686	1	3	"Dear local newspaper, I would like to speak upon the topic of the effects that computers have on people. My opinion on this topic is that computers do have an effect on people. Most people while surfing the internet don't keep track of time. What I mean when I say most people lose track of time is that, they try to keep track of the time but while on the web something unexpected may pop up that catches their interest and at that same time their focus is on something else. Some of the other effects computers can have on people is keeping them in the house. When many people are on the web, they tend not to exercise as much. When in the house on the web, most people who usually exercise stop exercising. The reason why this occurs is because while people are sitting in the computer chair, they feel so relaxed and calm that they don't want to get up. This leads into eating unhealthy foods. Some such as salty chips, sweet donuts, and spongy twinkies. Some individuals do not believe that this is an issue. The reason I say this is because while watching television the other day I saw a commercial that said quote ""People that are more active are healthier than people that stay on the computer all day."" Most individuals do gain weight on the computer because they are not physically active. Not being physically active can lead to A) obesity, B) clogged arteries, or C) laziness. It can lead to all three because those are the effects of being on a computer every day. Most individuals should be enjoying nature instead of staying on the computer. There is a lot more to life than being on the web. Some such as playing sports like basketball or soccer. Not only is playing sports fun but at the same time it is also healthy. Would you rather live to a long and active age or live to a shorter and less - healthy age? And so local newspaper, that is why I am writing you this letter today. I mean would you rather have friends and an active social life or be lonely. There are weight surgeries but those can rack up to thousands of dollars. And yes, weight loss surgery does have effects such as the risk of death. So come on local community, it's your decision and remember the most important part of this letter which is between living healthy and young or dying unhealthy and suffering. It's your choice, make the right decision."
685	687	1	3	Computers are a good benefit to society as they allow you to talk to people and give you different perspectives and the latest updates. First, they allow you to chat with friends at any time you want, breaking the barriers of distance. You can talk to people who are far away, even if you rarely see them in person. For example, if your friend lives on the other side of the globe, you can use your computer and message them so you can still talk to them all the time, sharing your daily experiences and feelings. Also, when you're bored, it will give you something to do. You could see if anyone wants to make plans to hang out. And if you just want to stay home all day, you can still interact with people in a virtual way. Secondly, it gives you new ideas on things. It shares different opinions. Maybe someone bought the same item you're considering and it did not work well for them. You could see the comments and reviews. Would you want to spend your money on something that did not work? I wouldn't. You can also see if the majority of people like what they got. Also, they make you think of something you would not think about before. Say you had a negative mark about how something was horrible. Maybe if you read the page about it online, it shows what you did wrong and what you did not do. It gives you the chance to try something you might enjoy. Lastly, it gives you the latest updates. It can share if the school schedule is closed, delayed, or open. You wouldn't have to wait for the news to show it. It can tell you about crimes that are happening in your area. Also, it tells you about your town. Who doesn't want to know what's going on in their own town? It tells you new things that are in your town or what they're going to build or it tells you what it is getting rid of. Computers are great as they let us chat with friends and family. It gives us thoughts we might have never thought about before and they tell us the newest updates, making our lives more connected and informed.
686	688	1	3	"Suppose you have a family member that you have not seen in a long time and you don't have enough money to visit them because they live too far away. Or you are injured or sick and you have nothing to do, so you decide to just browse the internet and you actually learn some interesting things like what new organism scientists have found out or something in history you've never known before. Amazingly, the computer is filled with knowledge like this. You could talk to family members you haven't seen before or just haven't got the chance to see them in a long time. You could even know a lot of new interesting stuff about nature and history you would have never known about by just stepping outside. And just so you know more, I'll even tell you about these things. I have a half - sister who I only get to see like once a year or once every two years. But the only way I get to interact with her is on Facebook. There are also websites people use to talk to loved ones like Twitter, MySpace, Yearbook, AIM, Skype etc. Not only do you just talk to them, you could do a webcam chat, so you could also see them. A lot of people use webchat to talk with old friends. While on the computer you could also learn new things. Yesterday, when I was on the computer I got bored and did some random searching, and in that 15 min. I learned things I never heard about, like the ""Jonestown massacre"" and that time when a teacher, Christa McAuliffe, went into a spaceship for the first time and it blew up with the teacher in it. Man was that a tragedy! If you were interested in nature you could learn about all kinds of nature around the world. Also, if you are interested in ancient time with a few keystrokes you've got all kinds of fascinating things of ancient time like Pompeii, the city that was forgotten, then found. I'm pretty sure you couldn't learn that kind of stuff just stepping outside. The amazing things a computer could do! Talking with family and friends you haven't seen in what could be decades and learning fascinating things. Usually it's cool because you could learn things your teacher never knew. Would you want the teacher teaching you or you teaching the teacher? It's clear that the computer is a valuable tool for both connection and learning."
687	689	1	3	Dear newspaper editor, With all due respect to anyone that thinks the computer doesn't benefit society, I strongly disagree. Yes, there are many people that neglect other activities to be on the computer, and yes, the computer is an invention that a lot of people depend on, but the computer is also an invention that we can benefit from in many positive ways. For example, Eminem, a hip - hop artist with millions of fans, wasn't able to finish high school or go to college because of his career. He decided to get a college degree, so he started to attend a college. He had difficulty being in college, however, because he was constantly being harassed by his fans, so he started going to college online. That way, he was able to focus on his studies and get his degree without the harassment. The computer also has websites on the internet that are used in schools. They help teach students in a way that they will have fun and enjoy what they're doing, giving them a better learning experience. Aside from the positive uses of the internet, the computer also contains programs that can benefit us just as well. Microsoft Word, for example, is a program on the computer that is used to create Word documents such as poems, essays, song lyrics, and even letters. You can print out these Word documents to have a copy of your own to keep and show people wherever you go, but if you're not finished, it can be saved on your computer. People use the computer for many things, like reading e - books, watching movies and so on. Over the years that it's been in existence, it's benefited us all a lot. What do you think? It's evident that the computer's positive impacts far outweigh its potential drawbacks.
688	690	1	3	Dear @LOCATION1 @CAPS1, I believe that computers do benefit society. People are able to read, shop, and play online. This makes life easier for many people. Buying books that you would like to read can get expensive. With the internet, people are able to read almost any book right on their computer. In a recent survey, it was found that people who read books online save an additional $200 a year more than people who buy books. People can also read things like newspapers online. If there is snow on the ground, and people are unable to get their newspaper, they can read it online. This way they will know if a newspaper is still good, and continue buying it, including the @LOCATION1 @CAPS1. Additionally, people are able to shop online. Sometimes, someone in December has been in an accident injuring them, and they are stuck at home. If it is a child, their parents will be unable to go to the store because they will be caring for the child. They can simply go on the computer and have food and other necessities delivered to them. People can also do this if they have a busy lifestyle with work or school. Dr. Smith, a physician, told me that people who shop online have 30% less stress than people who go to the store for the same items. He said that it is because they do not need to worry about taking much time out of their schedule to shop. Moreover, the computer is a good way to quickly play games. Young children can be very loud and energetic. Parents can just let them play games and read on the computer. Little kids love just the fact of being on the computer, and letting them go on can keep them quiet and occupied for a while. Even just typing is interesting for younger kids. For older kids, there are many games that they can play. Action, strategy, puzzles, and many more. They can also play against people around the world. The computer is fun for everyone. So in conclusion, the computer is a very good place to go shopping, read books, and play games. Computers greatly help families of today, making daily life more convenient and enjoyable.
689	691	1	3	My opinion on the effects computers have on people. A good effect that computers have on people is that it teaches them how to have good hand - eye coordination. For example, if they work as a doctor on anything that requires it, that would help them do better in their jobs. Another reason why computers have good effects on people is that it lets them chat with their family members. Case in point, if your family went to a whole new country for a trip, then you'd be able to see how they're doing and what it's like there. Another one would be that you could learn about other states and countries around the world. It tells you how many people live there and what type of culture they have. For instance, when I want to learn about Texas I look up information on it and it tells me when it was founded, the capital, and how many people live there. Another good thing is that you could play games with your friends like all types: shooting games, racing games, sports games, arcade games, all types. In conclusion, computers offer multiple benefits in terms of skill - building, communication, and entertainment.
690	692	1	3	I don't think that computers have the most positive effect. Because most computers are not like that; the computers are not the smartest but it does help you when you need to do something like a project when you have to look for pictures and when you need help with math you can use the calculator on the computer. But the computer does not help you on all your subjects; the computer only helps you on a couple of your subjects. That is the main reason I use the computer. Sometimes when I'm doing homework I let the computer do it for me so it is easier for me to do and I look for websites on it. They give you really good websites. That is why mostly everyone uses the computer. They mainly use the computer to look for jobs, cars, or a house. That is what they mainly use the computer for. Most people do not like using the internet because they think it's cheating to use the computer. However, if used properly, computers can be a useful aid, but we should be cautious not to over - rely on them and lose our own problem - solving abilities.
691	693	1	3	@ORGANIZATION1, in one's opinion about computers and what they can do to benefit society these days, computers offer remarkable advantages. One's view on the effects that computers have on people is that they can benefit us in numerous ways. For example, they enable us to communicate with people around the world. Many people in @MONTH1 have friends or family that live in another state or country, and computers can help us easily communicate with them through video calls, emails, and instant messaging. Computers also allow us to learn what we couldn't learn from books. They can assist us in learning about various subjects, such as the population of different regions. One might think traditional communication methods are slow, but with computers, you can send emails and have the person on the other end reply instantly. Computers have benefited society in many ways. In one's opinion, they can benefit us in ways we wouldn't think possible. Before computers and printers, we used typewriters. If you made a mistake while using a typewriter, you would have to start again, and it could take hours of work to get the paper perfect. However, in the modern world, if we make a mistake while typing, we can just hit the back - space button on the keyboard. So, it won't take us hours to type one page; it takes at most half an hour. Computers have benefited us in more ways than we know. So, in one's opinion about computers and what they can do to benefit us, they allow us to do things we couldn't have done before the computer was invented. The computer was a great invention, and it has benefited mankind as we speak, and it is not that hard to set up. So, in one's opinion, computers can greatly benefit the society that we live in and also benefit mankind as well.
692	694	1	3	"Dear @LOCATION1, I believe that computers benefit society very much. I hold this belief for various reasons that I will state throughout this passage. Although sometimes people spend too much time on the computer, it doesn't mean computers are bad for society. It just means people need to learn to spend their time wisely. Overall, I think computers have a positive effect on society. One reason I am in favor of computers is because they are a huge advancement in technology. They are capable of making everyday life easier. They allow you to store large amounts of information, learn about many places, and communicate with friends and family in real - time. For one device to do all that is truly amazing! Also, if we can make something as remarkable as computers, imagine all the other possibilities of technology advancements. Computers are only the start of it all! Another reason why I believe computers greatly benefit society is because they provide a wide range of entertainment options. You can watch high - definition movies on your computer and download fun games of various genres. There is hardly anything you can't do on a computer. If it is cold outside or raining, you can still entertain yourself with just a computer. Computers are very great to have around. Now, anyone who thinks people spend too much time on their computer and that computers are bad for society is just wrong. I think those people are wrong because a computer can't force you to spend more time on it. It's your own fault if you choose to use your computer too much. You always have the choice to go outside and take a walk. Computers are only wrong if you choose to use them wrongly, just like the expression ""guns don't kill people, people do."" In conclusion, I believe computers are a great thing to have, especially in this modern society. Computers are one of the greatest advancements in technology, and they benefit society as well. So, if you are ever wondering whether or not to buy a computer, I suggest you get one!"
693	695	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, I think computers have a positive effect on people. The reasons for my answer are that there are many homework helper websites, the computer helps you learn about places you've never been to, and you can even interact with people all around the world. These are my three reasons on why I think computers have a positive effect on people. First, I think computers have a positive effect on people because there are many well - structured homework helper websites that struggling students can go on and get professional tutoring. I remember in @NUM1 grade when I had a math midterm. I was having a hard time understanding complex math concepts. Then, I went on a tutoring website, and they patiently taught me everything that I was having trouble with, step by step. I think that the computer can help many kids obtain good grades by providing accessible educational resources. This is my first reason why I think computers have a positive effect on people. Second, I think computers have a positive effect on people because it can help you learn in - depth about far away places that you have never been to before. This would be extremely useful for a school project on a country. Also, @PERCENT1 of students in my school say that the computer has helped them a lot on school projects by providing detailed information and high - quality images. The computer could also be useful for planning a vacation. Would you want to vacation to a place that you know nothing about? That is where the computer can help. All you have to do is search your destination, and pictures, detailed info, and even reviews will come up so you can make the right choice. This is my second reason why I think computers have a positive effect on people. Lastly, I think computers have a positive effect on people because you can interact with people around the world. I have a brother that lives in Florida, but I can talk to him every day on the computer through video calls. Also, I can keep in touch with my friends anytime I want, no matter the distance. I think computers help people develop better social skills by allowing them to communicate and connect with a diverse range of people. This is my last reason why I think computers have a positive effect on people. In conclusion, I think computers have a positive effect on people as they help students get better grades, learn different things, and stay connected with friends.
694	696	1	3	Dear editor of The @CAPS1, I believe that computers are good ideas for our community. If the library's closed and a student needs information, you can easily look it up on the internet. Also, you can talk with your friends if your phone is not working. Computers can help people learn about the latest news if the television is getting pixelated. First of all, computers can help with research a great deal. Let's say it's raining heavily, your car is out of gas, and you need to go to the library before it closes. It would just be easier to go on the computer and find a reliable research site about your topic. You don't have to waste gas, and you can stay dry, sitting in a robe sipping hot chocolate while doing your research on the computer. Next, you can talk to friends all the way in another country without having to pay extra for a long - distance call. And if you don't have unlimited minutes and you want to talk with someone for a long time, you'd be wasting valuable minutes and money! This is where computers come in. You can just open a chat window and talk away, just like that, with clear and stable communication. Finally, you can look up the latest news and information on a search program, like @ORGANIZATION1. If your television broke and it'd take a week to fix, what if something important happened that you needed to know about? You could just go on the internet and look it up in an instant. Thank you for reading my ideas, editor. I hope you'll choose my article to post in your newspaper when the time comes.
695	697	1	3	"Fairfield @CAPS1 @CAPS2 computers have a bad effect on people? Many people say ""yes"" and many say ""no."" As a matter of fact, computers @CAPS2 have a bad effect. People are very easily distracted on computers, it wastes time, and it causes stress. Many kids who @CAPS2 their homework on computers are very easily distracted. With computers come the internet, and with the internet comes a plethora of games and social networking sites. Many kids would rather chat on Facebook with a friend than @CAPS2 homework using an online book... including me. When I get home, I start using the online text - book for my math class. But when I wait for it to load, I get bored and go on an online game website. After that, I get too distracted on this addicting game called ""@CAPS6 @CAPS7 @NUM1."" After @NUM2 hours of playing online games, I realized I have wasted a lot of time. I realized I have been wasting a lot of my math homework time lately with those online distracting games. And since @PERCENT1 of my grade in math is based on homework, I've gone from a @CAPS4 to a @CAPS5+. And why waste time on the computer when the outdoors are just as fun as ""@CAPS6 @CAPS7 @NUM1."" I'd rather be playing football with my friends than that dumb game. My parents have also realized that I've been wasting so much time on the computer, so they've blocked the internet. But distracting games that waste time also cause stress, which could be fatal. Imagine being in the hospital because of playing on the computer. Once while I was watching the @ORGANIZATION1, a man said @NUM4 people died because of playing on the computer for over @NUM2 days with little food or water. My parents also notice that me and my brother are grumpy after playing on the computer for so long. And I've been stressed lately. Overall, computers have a bad effect on people. Distracting games are a waste of time and cause stress. Hopefully, people understand this message, and you shouldn't play on computers for too long, as it can have serious negative impacts on your life, including your grades, physical health, and mental well - being."
696	698	1	3	Dear Sir/Madam, I think that computers are very effective, but then again, they are not. For instance, would you rather have your kids on the computer or, say, some children who smoke and hang out in the streets too much? Indeed, computers do have a significant impact on them. In my view, computers are very addictive, but then again, it really isn't so for some. There are people who really don't like being on the computers for a long time because it gets boring and it starts to hurt your eyes. I can understand if kids don't want to get off when it passes their bedtime. Some kids do a lot of bad things out in the street and hang out there a lot, but when they go on the computer, it can stop some of them from doing those things. A lot of kids have MySpace, Facebook, and more, and it is the best way to stay in contact with your family and friends. That's one of the main reasons kids go online. There are also other electronic devices that stop kids from exercising, such as a PSP Go, Xbox 360, DS, DSi, PlayStation 4, and Wii. So, I think it is an addiction and it affects kids, but there are things you'd rather have your kids do that can keep them away from over - using it. In conclusion, while computers have their drawbacks, they also offer some benefits, and it's about finding the right balance for kids.
697	699	1	3	"Dear Technology Society: Computers are perhaps one of the greatest improvements to our society's advancement in knowledge in the past few decades. These gems of the future are like a human being; they have their own ""mind"" and can figure out answers to all sorts of problems. People all around the world use them, from bustling Tokyo to serene Paris, to vibrant Sydney to historic Rome. They are being used by people of all ages, from school - kids eager to learn to adults with highly - respected jobs like chemists. Do you wish to be that one standing on the sidelines, stuck in the past, not advancing with technology? From the creations of rockets that soar into space, engines that power our vehicles, and planes that connect distant lands; computers have never let us down. Still, the question is this: will computerized technology benefit our society or crash it down? Ever since the invention of the first modern computer in 1946, computers have been used as an ad for new information. The speed at which they are able to receive new information is just astonishing! Dr. John Smith, a well - known computer engineer, says ""With the technology that we receive from computers, we are able to be in the game."" Dr. Smith just comes to show one of the best benefits of computers: their ability to display the most current information. Now, I can see how books are an excellent resource in society, and how they provide amazing information. However, it takes years to publish books! With the use of a computer, information that occurred sometimes as close to 24 hours ago can appear on the internet! Not only will this allow you to get information faster, but it will also allow our society to ""be in the game."" You catch a football as it soars through the air, you track a baseball as it flies high in the sky, you grasp the face of a basketball all because you have ""hand - eye"" coordination. Hand - eye coordination is perhaps one of the most necessary aspects of life that a person can have. Face it, everybody needs it! So why not help your body to get that talent: buy a computer. Imagine, our society would advance in its sports and even just with life if they learn how to coordinate themselves. Did you know that 8 out of 10 people who owned a computer and typed daily were able to catch all three tennis - balls that were thrown at them! You could do that too! When typing on a computer, human development observers state that your eyes are freely tracked on the screen and you train your hands to maneuver about the keys all by themselves. Just as in basketball, when you train your hand to track the bounce of the ball without you needing to consciously catch it. I can remember when I started typing, my hands began to naturally find the keys without me having to look at them. And the next day at basketball practice I felt like legendary point - guard Magic Johnson, the ball just came straight to my hand! Get this need of life, invest in a computer! Money might be the most vital thing in our society right now. With profits as low as medium wage, our local area is not that ""rich."" I can see how it could be hard, having to purchase these computers at prices as high as $2000 each. But then just think, each book that we won't have to purchase would save us $50 each. Not only do computers stand to last 5 times longer than any paperback, their information is always new, changing, and up - to - date. In order for us to be purchasing new books because of recent information would end up costing more in the long - run. Our neighboring society of Newtown just invested in over 100 computers for their society. They stated that it took only 6 months to get the money back that they had spent on the computers with the amount they saved by not purchasing books! Now just imagine how much money our society would gain after 1 year! It is necessary for our society to have computers. With them, we not only learn hand - eye coordination but we also invest in more money - saving opportunities. And now with so many things happening in the world, it is important to receive information instantaneously from these computers. I can't stress enough that without them, we would be left behind. Dreams of incredible rockets, medicines, and cures for diseases just won't happen without the aid of computers. Computers are perhaps the only thing that can truly benefit our society in the long run. You must understand how important this technology is to our society! But, in the long - run, the decision is yours to make. Choose quickly, the fate of our society is in your hands."
698	700	1	3	"Dear Newspaper: I believe that computers are good for our society. There are many reasons as to why I hold this belief. One reason is that it makes life easier. For example, it simplifies daily tasks and streamlines communication. It also helps us understand what is going on in our lives today. If we didn't have computers, how would we talk with people without phones and spread news? Computers make life easier in many ways. For instance, if you needed a doctor's permission to play a sport, it would be a lot easier to send him/her an email, asking them to send you an email saying you can play. Then you can show it to the sports team, and they will allow you to participate. We can also learn things about our world today by using the computer. We can go on the internet and visit a news website to look at the weather so we can make plans for the day. We can find information about the newest technology like the ""iPhone"" or ""iPad"". There are some people in the world who don't have a computer. For example, my uncle is in the air force, and the only way we can get to talk to him is through the computer because they don't allow phones. Also, if there is a person with good news and they want to tell a lot of people, they can send an email and forward it to everyone. I hope you understand why I believe computers are a good thing to have in modern society. They make life easier, help us understand our life today, and assist us in talking to people around the world. I sincerely hope you agree with my view on this topic."
699	701	1	3	Tech Innovators Society, Technology has developed significantly in the past few decades. It has helped mankind a great deal, from constructing magnificent buildings to creating new and revolutionary inventions. However, there is a growing concern about whether it's beneficial or not. People tend to become lazier because of the many things they can do with it. I think that it benefits us all. We have learned many things from it. The computer shows what mankind is capable of achieving. We can learn about many different cultures with it. Students use it for studying and making their projects look more professional. I asked Dr. James Brown of Tech Solutions about the concern. He says that it can expand our knowledge. There is concern about how much paper we lose every year. With computers, it makes going green more feasible. You can create powerpoints on the computers instead of using so much paper for long essays. We could conduct tests on computers. I think the future will be based entirely on computers. You can send emails instead of using traditional letters. For example, my friend Lily said her school didn't use paper and used computers. They saved money and paper because of powerpoints and other digital resources. I miss my family over at London. I want to see them, not just by talking on the phone. I use the computer to talk to them, almost as if we were in the same room. I asked 50 people if they prefer using a computer to talk to their family or use a phone. 40 out of 50 said they prefer the computer. I know I'm trying to show they are great, but they do have their downside. The games are terrible for the computer in a sense. People will just play and play all day long. Online games make it even more enticing, thus making them lazier. There are so many games for the computer, it's overwhelming, says Mr. Tom Green of Game Critics Club. In conclusion, computers will be something that will help us for a long time and they benefit us. Except for the issue with games, I agree that there is this negative aspect. Overall, the advantages of computers far outweigh their disadvantages.
700	702	1	3	My opinion about the effects of computers is that computers do help you, but people should not use the computer too much. People should exercise, interact with family, and enjoy nature. Exercising is more important than using a computer because it will make you healthy, and you will not be sick as often. When you exercise, your body gets stronger, and your immune system is boosted. Interacting with family is more important than using a computer because family support is crucial. Friends you make online may not be as reliable as your family. Family will help you when you're in trouble, and maybe that friend you meet on the computer is not even real. That's why it is important to interact with family in person. And the last thing that is more important than using a computer is enjoying nature. It is fun because you won't be bored. When you're outside, you can breathe fresh air, see beautiful scenery, and feel the warmth of the sun. You won't think about the computer because you'll be enjoying yourself so much. My opinion is that computers should only be used to check your mail or to learn something you want to find out. In conclusion, while computers are useful tools, we should not let them replace the important aspects of real - life experiences like exercise, family interaction, and enjoying nature.
701	703	1	3	"Dear local Newspaper, I firmly believe that computers are an invaluable asset to society, and I'm eager to share my thoughts and insights with you. I sincerely hope you'll concur with me after reading this. To begin with, my first point pertains to communication. Computers enable us to interact with ordinary people or those across the globe! There are numerous communication modes, such as text, speech, and webcam. Moreover, there are hundreds of communication clients and servers online at @NUM1 usually, so you'll always be able to connect with someone! Secondly, computers offer remarkable creative capabilities. On a computer, you can program @CAPS3, design presentations, documents, drawings, maps, graphs—virtually anything you can conceive can be realized. You can gather information from servers, websites, @CAPS1, @CAPS2, @CAPS3. Thus, you can create and learn a great deal on your everyday computer. I'm not finished yet! There are @CAPS4, @CAPS5, @CAPS6, and reading and book sites all on the web! This provides the ""web searcher"" with a vast amount of information and allows them to learn much more in daily life. Finally, computers offer a wide range of entertainment options. There are numerous choices, like videos, movies, @CAPS18, @CAPS1, and games, suitable for the user or users of the computer. In a game, a user @MONTH1 can talk to friends while @CAPS14 a game, such as a (@CAPS8 @CAPS9); for example, @CAPS10 @CAPS11 @CAPS12 online, @CAPS13 @CAPS14 game. These types of games are a hit among entertainment enthusiasts due to the immense enjoyment they can experience while @CAPS14 a @CAPS8 @CAPS9. Another form of entertainment is videos. People can watch videos and movies on video and other websites that have a database of not just thousands but millions of videos and movies. Whatever the user desires is just a text and a click away! The last form of entertainment is @CAPS1 and @CAPS18, which allow the user to enhance daily life or communicate with friends, family, or relatives. To sum it all up, I'd like to tell you, Local newspaper, that you should agree that computers are a boon to society! Please reread and make the right @CAPS2 decision."
702	704	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1, I truly think this is a brilliant idea because you can engage in various activities on the computer, such as playing games, chatting with family or friends, and listening to music. My first reason is the vast array of games available. When you're bored and have nothing else to do, all you need to do is turn on the computer and play all sorts of games, including car racing, shooting, and arcade games. Whether you're simply bored or just want to spend some time on the computer, these games offer endless entertainment. My second reason is the convenience of communicating with friends and family. If your brother, sister, or any other family member lives in a different state and you wish to talk to or see them, all you have to do is ask them, ""@CAPS2, what is your email address?"" Then, if they have a MySpace or Facebook account, you can chat with them for as long as you like. You can also connect with your friends on these platforms. My third reason is the ability to listen to music. You can listen to music on your computer by visiting @CAPS3 or downloading software like FrostWire. You can enjoy all kinds of music, such as hip - hop, rap, rock, or heavy rock. To listen to a specific song, you'll need to know the song's name and, ideally, the artist's name too. This @CAPS2, I think they should implement it, and they should make the right choice."
703	705	1	3	What is more enjoyable, staring at a blank computer screen all day or spending the day in beautiful nature with your friends and family? Well, if you're unsure, I can tell you. I conducted a survey at my school with the exact same question, and @PERCENT2 of the kids stated that hanging out with friends and family is far more rewarding than spending all your time on the computer, and there are three key reasons for their stance. First, it's better to talk to people in person rather than solely relying on computer - based communication. Second, excessive computer use is unhealthy, and third, many negative things can occur on the internet. So, if you're interested in this topic, please keep reading, and I'll prove that the computer isn't the best way to spend your spare time. Do you know the original purpose of computers? Computers were designed to assist people, but have you ever considered that instead of interacting with virtual connections, you should interact with the people around you? Instead of logging onto Facebook or MySpace to talk to your friends, simply invite them over. If you do that, it's not only more fun but also healthier for you. So, the next time you're about to do anything else, just think about the other options. In my previous paragraph, didn't I mention that hanging out with friends is much healthier than being glued to the computer? Well, I was absolutely right! Did you know that when you waste your time on the computer, you're only harming yourself? When all you do is sit there, staring at a screen, you're getting absolutely no exercise. When you're not on the computer, you can at least take a short walk, but typing on the keyboard doesn't do anything for your physical well - being. That's why people shouldn't spend all their time on the computer. Have you ever heard of an internet predator? Well, if not, let me explain. An internet predator is someone who uses the computer to persuade people they don't know to engage in inappropriate activities. And yes, it's against the law. So, if you receive friend requests, be cautious and ignore them if necessary because if you don't, bad things can happen. And that's just one of the reasons why people shouldn't spend as much time on the computer. So, now you know why people shouldn't spend as much time on the computer as they usually do. First, talk to people in person instead of on the computer. Second, it's unhealthy, and third, there are internet predators. So, the next time you open your laptop, just think: is it more fun to stare at a blank computer screen or to spend the day in beautiful nature with friends and family? And always remember what the right choice is.
704	706	1	3	Computers have a profoundly positive impact on people. They serve as powerful tools that can help people explore the world, learn about different places and people, and stay informed about the latest news. Additionally, computers facilitate seamless communication and can even enhance hand - eye coordination. Those who support technological advancements firmly believe that computers are a boon to society. Without computers, people would find it extremely difficult to acquire new knowledge. On a computer, you can embark on a journey of discovery to learn about new places. You can precisely locate a place, visualize it through pictures, and delve into its rich history. I vividly remember when I was working on a project about @LOCATION2. I was completely at a loss about what to do, so I turned to the computer and searched for @LOCATION2. It not only informed me that @LOCATION2 was situated in @LOCATION1 but also showed me a captivating picture of @LOCATION2 and detailed historical information about the country. Without the computer, I would have missed out on learning about this fascinating country. Computers also offer a wealth of information about historic and famous people. You can read in - depth biographies of them or watch engaging videos that showcase their achievements and the reasons for their fame. In the past, people used to rely on newspapers to get their daily news. Now, with computers, you can access news for free without having to bear the cost of buying a newspaper. Moreover, computers can provide a live feed of what's happening around the world, keeping you updated in real - time. Without computers, the process of learning would be severely hampered. Computers also revolutionize the way people communicate. Scientists conducted a study on how people interact, and @PERCENT1 of @CAPS1 reported that they use a computer to communicate with others. People can utilize various tools such as webcams, AIM, or email to stay in touch. For instance, I use a webcam to communicate with my family in @LOCATION2, and I rely on email or AIM to chat with my friends. Writing letters is a time - consuming process, but on a computer, the person you're talking to can respond immediately. This makes communication faster and more efficient. A computer can also be a great teacher when it comes to hand - eye coordination. On a computer, you can see something on the monitor and click on it without having to look down at the mouse. This skill can be highly beneficial in sports as it gives you fast reflexes. In many sports, such as basketball, you need to maintain good hand - eye coordination. For example, when dribbling a basketball, you need to keep your eyes up; otherwise, you might lose your balance. Computers can help people develop these essential skills and perform better in sports. In conclusion, computers should be an integral part of society's everyday life. They have a positive effect on people by helping them learn new things about places, people, and the news of the world. Computers are truly beneficial to society.
705	707	1	3	"Dear Local Newspaper, I'm writing to express my concern that people in the @LOCATION1 are currently overusing computers. I believe that instead of sitting at home idly, playing games like FarmVille and taking care of virtual pets on Facebook, you should get out and engage in more real - life activities. You should head to the gym and work out. It's a great way to stay fit and healthy. Alternatively, you could go to the park or plan a family fun night with your kids (if you have any). Let's take a look at the situation. By the @DATE1, if all you've done is sit at home playing games on the @CAPS9 every day, you've probably noticed some negative changes. You've likely gained weight because you haven't burned any calories or fat. When you're constantly sitting on your chair while on the computer, and you keep eating, all you're doing is piling on the pounds. And I'm sure you don't want that. If you have a family, taking a family trip to the park would be a wonderful idea. You could also visit @ORGANIZATION1, which would be a fun and engaging way to spend time together. This way, you can get your hands off the keyboard and focus on interacting with your kids. Additionally, you should set aside a night as family fun night. On this night, you can play games like charades or a board game. Just make sure there's no computer distraction in the house. My favorite suggestion is ""Me"" Time. During ""Me"" Time, you can treat yourself to a shopping spree, go out for lunch or dinner, or even take a map and explore a new place. The whole point of ""Me"" Time is that you must stay away from the @CAPS9! You need to relax and take a break from the digital world. Well, these are my suggestions for you. Now, it's your turn to step out of the virtual world and reconnect with reality."
706	708	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, Computers are an amazing advantage to use in this modern day and age. They are quite easy to learn how to use, as most operating systems have intuitive interfaces. You can connect with old friends, and even learn by enrolling in an online school or college they offer. Computers are truly an amazing advancement and this is why you should use one. Who doesn't like computers? They are easy to learn how to use and are available in a variety of forms, such as desktops, laptops, and tablets. Almost every college student has a computer or laptop. They might have never used one before, but then they quickly learned how easy it was. Most computers come already installed with the necessary programs including: @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS2 @CAPS3, or some form of @CAPS2, a reliable virus protection software, and other simple software for daily tasks. Moving is very hard, you leave a place where you have so many friends to a place that is so new to you. Computers make this so much easier by letting you connect with them without having to wait for the mail by writing letters. There is email, facebook, and myspace that let you chat with old friends, new friends, or even parents. Some people say that these things are dangerous, that is only if you start talking to people you don't know. People keep coming up with even more ways to stay connected so don't miss out on the opportunity. These people are so smart, they figured out a way to have school online. This is very helpful to somebody who is injured or is trying to get another degree to get a better job. People get assignments to do and each class only takes about one or two months. People get to do their job or enjoy nature still because their day is open and not busy. Sure people don't get to enjoy the campus, but with the high price of gasoline these days, it's definitely worth it. So don't be the person sitting around doing nothing, buy a computer and stay in touch with technology. Remember computers are easy to use, you can stay connected to friends and you can go to school on them. This technology can help you more than it can hurt you.
707	709	1	3	"Dear Newspaper, @NUM1 percents of jobs these days use computers. The invention of computers has significantly changed our world in a positive way. Our society needs @CAPS1. @CAPS1 helps our world today by teaching about far - away places and their unique cultures, uniting our world with new techniques of communication and helping workers to have a better job. Let's go on. ""@CAPS1 is the best electronic tool created by the world,"" says @CAPS5 @PERSON4, a professor in @ORGANIZATION2. Today the world works with the aid of @CAPS1, as @CAPS1 continues to grow! Our culture was losing territory but as years passed, cultures and @CAPS1 started to work together. ""@CAPS2 you want to know about a culture just go to the internet,"" says @CAPS5 a teacher from @CAPS3. Culture is really important for our world because it is what we were before technology existed. @PERCENT1 of the world's culture can be found in the internet or on our computers. @PERCENT2 of people, when they need to do a research, don't go to the country to do their research. Instead, the first thing they think of is the @CAPS1 because they can find what they need at any time.

These days you can talk through the @CAPS1 with a person in @LOCATION2 without needing to go to @LOCATION2. ""The creation of @CAPS1 created a new revolution of the way of communicating,"" says @CAPS5 @PERSON1, a young student of @ORGANIZATION2. ""@CAPS4 of my international calls I do by using a computer, and there are so many ways of talking, also it is so easy,"" says @CAPS5 a mother of a student in @CAPS3. Computers are used @PERCENT4 more than cell phones because it is cheaper. ""@CAPS7 true you can see the change of our nation, is the best thing a human created,"" says @CAPS5 the professor at @ORGANIZATION1. Let's go farther on. Did you know that @PERCENT4 of our jobs in the @ORGANIZATION3 is mostly about using a computer. Even engineers use computers, an example is @LOCATION1 @CAPS8, the engineer, awarded by the president @PERSON3. He says that ""@PERCENT5 of his job is using a @CAPS1. Statistics prove that if you know how to use a @CAPS1, you have a higher opportunity of getting a wage higher than the average you would receive when you do not know anything about @CAPS1. Another statistic shows that if you know and use computers, you are likely to live longer and happier. @NUM2 @ORGANIZATION2 students agreed that his friends have better jobs if they know how to use computers. ""Computers helped young adults to have a better opportunity in life,"" says @CAPS5 the teacher of @ORGANIZATION4. ""These days it is essential to know how to use @CAPS1,"" says @CAPS5 @PERSON2 a teacher of @CAPS3. @CAPS1 helped the world to change in a better way. In conclusion, @CAPS1 is a tool that most of our nations use. @CAPS1 helps to learn about new cultures of other countries, also the new ways you talk to someone around the world in the convenience of your house just by using a computer. And it can be very handy to know how to use @CAPS1 when you are applying for a job. @CAPS1 has made our world a better place."
708	710	1	3	"Dear local newspaper, Are computers a bad thing? Certainly not! They can be distracting but in an enlightening way. How? Computers give you extra knowledge, you can connect with people and if you think they take away exercise, they do not, they can actually help you exercise! My first reason that computers are a positive device to have is that they can give you a vast amount of extra knowledge. That is great for the brain! When you are sitting at home with a ton of questions, think again, the computer is there for you. Ask or search anything and you should have a @PERCENT1 guarantee your answer will be found! If you feel like you do not know many interesting subjects like a particular culture of some sort or something that you heard about, your computer can tell you. Just one computer can enlighten you with so much information. Now when you go back to school you can brag and say ""@CAPS1 you know,?"" People will be amazed. Lately experts have been concerned that the computer device is a distracting item and it will keep you from exercising and enjoying nature. However, no need to worry, you can learn just about anything on nature when you surf the web! You can find out more of what is in your backyard than you already knew. Exercise! Are you worried you do not get enough exercise? Then, go onto youtube.com, type in exercise and work out. You will come up with millions of exercise routines you can do right in front of your computer. Another thing you can do is get online for how to stay healthy and exercise! Lastly, the experts have been concerned that we people are not having a social life and interacting with our family and pals. I would say we spend more time interacting with our buddies and close ones online than we do in public. With sites like facebook, @CAPS3, @CAPS4, @CAPS5, and more we are talking to those people instantly! We are setting up our weekend plans online and a lot of our social life is there. Sometimes we have family that lives long - distance, no one wants to pay for a call so we have the internet to connect! In a nutshell, knowledge, exercise, and connecting with buddies are all positives of the computer. You can multitask so simply with just one electronic device and that is the computer! Experts, you do not need to worry as the computer offers many benefits."
709	711	1	3	Dear editor, Have you ever stopped and asked yourself which was more important? Of course I can be talking about anything, but what about computers verses family, friends, nature, your own health etc. Well, I ask myself that quite often, and I feel that it's so much more worth it to be with family and friends than to be in front of a computer. There is so much more that I can tell you, and just after my very first reason how could there even be another side to it? Why is it that now these days kids can't simply run out to the bus stop without feeling totally winded? I feel it's because they are not getting enough well - needed exercise! For example, instead of sitting in front of the computer, kids, and even adults can enjoy going to the gym to work out and build strength. Also, children can get more involved with school sports so they can not only be participating in sports, but they can be involved with school too! Lastly, just by going for a short walk with your dog, you're not only walking and getting well - needed exercise, you're bonding with your loyal friend. Have you ever been gazing out the car window when you just found yourself being sucked into all the beauty that nature has to offer? Well, if you have I guess you could never have too much, but if you haven't, it's probably because your spending way too much time on the computer! There are so many different ways that people could learn to appreciate nature more, such as sitting on a park bench in the early morning, while absorbing the fresh air and warm sunlight. Or you could go for a slow, relaxing bike ride through a forest trail with a constant cool breeze, gently brushing your face with every turn of your wheels. Finally, you could pick a warm day to sit out on the beach, and listen to some music, next to the salty ocean. How could you resist those temptations? Lastly, I believe that family is the most important thing to be missing out on! Without family and friends you miss out on so many good ethics and valuable experiences. You lose out on having good lifetime relationships, and how could you turn down the offer to be with the people you love? In conclusion, I feel that computers are taking away most of the things that no one deserves to live without. I mean, how could anyone live without family, friends, the beauty of nature, and your own health? That is why everyone should make the right decision to take responsible charge of their life, and keep asking the same question, which is more important?
710	712	1	3	"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 you think computers have good or bad effects on people? It has been brought to @CAPS10 mind that people fight about @CAPS3 computers. To a doubt, I think that computers have a positive impact on people. @CAPS10 think the main arguments are that people find the ability to talk online with other people and it helps with school work. First of all, computers give you the ability to learn about far - away places. This is really helpful because if you want to learn about @CAPS4, you can go to the computer and google ""@CAPS4 @CAPS6"". By doing this you'll find a wealth of info on @CAPS4. I should say I tried it before. So, the fact that computers give you this ability to learn about far - away places is really beneficial to the human society. Second of all, computers allow people to talk to other people around the world. This is really helpful when you want to learn about people from around the world. This is different than googling facts about other people. This is free because when you google or when you're online chatting with someone, you have a direct connection. In @CAPS10 thoughts, that's the best way to make friends and keep in touch with family when they don't have easy access. Of all, computers can help with school work. This is helpful as students could learn about the world or about a different subject. This reminds me of the time I had to complete a project about the nine planets. I had to find a lot of info, so that also means a lot of books and a lot of reading. So, for me, the easiest and fastest way to complete @CAPS10 project was to go on the internet. I searched and got all the info that I needed. So then I completed @CAPS10 project and handed it in to @CAPS10 teacher. She gave me a @PERCENT1 for a project grade. I got a @PERCENT1 because I misspelled @CAPS10 name, but that doesn't matter. What I am trying to tell you is that computers help students with school work like projects. After thinking about it, I know that computers have a positive effect on @CAPS10. The three main arguments are that computers give you the ability to learn about far - away places, allow you to talk online with other people, and help you with school work. Please take @CAPS10 side and think that computers have a positive effect on human society."
711	713	1	3	"Dear, local news time editor. Using a @CAPS1 daily indeed has a very positive effect on people, wouldn't you agree? People should use a @CAPS1 more often. I firmly think everyone should have at least one or two computers in their house, as they were invented for a good reason. Computers allow you to interact closely with friends and family, assist you effectively with school work. And I guarantee that you will have a really good time using a @CAPS1 by playing interesting games and meeting new friendly people. If you have school work to finish, computers can surely help you work it out. If you need to do some research, you can just go to a website like google, and what you need to know will be right in front of your eyes in a matter of seconds. Computers can offer great help in this regard as well. There is an icon inside one of your documents. I read an article on @CAPS1 about @PERSON1 stated that ""@CAPS1 users are most likely to succeed in school."" Interacting with friends and family is always a wonderful thing. Maybe you don't understand something if you have been assigned in a certain class. You can add a friend, and they will tell you what has happened. Talking to family members can do good for you in many ways. You can be having some trouble in your social life, and you can always talk to a family member or friend secretly through the @CAPS1. I remember having some difficulties with a few friends, and one of my cousins gave me very good advice through an instant messaging program named ""@CAPS2"". I guarantee you will have a great time using a @CAPS1. There are many exciting games out there that you can enjoy. Playing these games will teach hand - eye coordination, says @PERSON2. You can meet new people who can also give you good advice. As you can see, computers have a lot of positive effects on people. You can interact with family and friends, receive a lot of help for school work and meet a lot of new people. Take my advice and buy a @CAPS1, and you'll surely benefit from it."
712	714	1	3	How much of your free time daily do you spend on the computer? It is well - proven that people from five to fifteen years old spend an average of @NUM1 - @NUM2 hours of their free time on a computer. People aged sixteen to forty - eight spend @NUM1 - @NUM4 hours of free time daily on their computer. Spending too much time on the computer can seriously interfere with physical activities, social time, and lead to various health issues. Computers do have some good advantages here and there, but mostly they result in a negative effect. In this past decade, the percentage of people doing exercise has gone down, and computer bills have gone up. Americans now spend most of their time web - surfing, playing online games, and interacting in online chat rooms. After school, kids go home and turn their computer on instead of going outside to run and play. More people across the country have gained weight due to unhealthy food and lack of physical exercise. Many local sports teams have lost teammates due to the lack of desire for physical activities because of computers. Many people have stopped going out with friends and family due to being glued to the computer. The thought that runs through @CAPS1 minds these days is 'why go out to talk to my friends, when I can talk to them online?' I think the opposite. Get out of the gloomy house and go out to see my friends. I don't even go online every day. I only check online for homework and do some online shopping for about twenty minutes. Computers have a major effect on social lives, like going out and being confident to meet new people. Lastly, health issues are rising rapidly! The reason we now have shows on @CAPS2 about people with weight and health problems can be very much related back to the negative effect of computers. Like @CAPS3 @CAPS4, and the obese have shown how people gain weight. I think at least @PERCENT1 of these people spend too much time on the computer and not enough time exercising. Eating @PERSON1's junk food and then going home to play online games will definitely increase health issues like weight gain, organs being unhealthy, muscles not functioning properly, and eye and brain damage from staring at a mouse and screen non - stop. People should stop spending so much time on the computer and get outside or get active because computer use does have a negative effect. It interferes with social time, health, and physical activities. Get up and take action to prevent the negative effects of computers, and you'll lead a healthier and more fulfilling life.
713	715	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I whole - heartedly support the advances in technology. I am going to tell you @NUM1 reasons why. One is on a rainy day. I don't think you are going to go out and play in the rain, so you could go on the computer and play some interesting games. You can also talk to your friends in a fun way. Or you could use the computer for school work or for your job - related tasks. Say that you have to look something up for school and you can't get to the library, but you have a computer at your house. You can use it to find useful information quickly. You can use the computer to learn how to do something like making a handicraft and a lot more practical skills. You can use the computer after school if you can't go out and hang with your friends. You can do something enjoyable with them online, like playing online games together or watching a movie simultaneously. Last but not least, you can ask your friends if there is homework so you don't miss it. So, as you can see, these are the reasons why I support the advances in technology, and it truly enriches our lives.
714	716	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, Everyone loves computers, right? Those amazing computers can help us with almost anything. They also give people detailed facts about faraway places. And not only that but if you have someone who lives far away, you can easily chat with them online! What would this world be like without computers? First of all, I would like to talk about how computers can help us with anything. Computers can give us vivid pictures of places, you can watch high - quality videos, and even see interesting movies for free! Also, you can check the weather accurately, and if you're going to an airport, you can check the flight time precisely or if it has been canceled or not. There are just so many useful things that the computer can help us with! Now, it can also give you in - depth facts, different opinions, clear pictures, engaging videos, and exciting movies about faraway places. Like one time I was going to @LOCATION1 to visit but there was a terrible storm over there so the flight was canceled. I went on the computer and checked, and it told me in detail that it was canceled. Also, if you're going somewhere faraway, you can watch informative videos about that place. They also have detailed maps to guide you through the way. And not only that but you can also check the highway for traffic so you wouldn't be stuck there for hours. Wow, imagine living without a computer! Third of all, you can chat online with your friends or family! If you miss someone or you just want to talk, there are reliable websites that let you do that. Like @CAPS2, @CAPS3, and @CAPS4! And you can also see the person if you attach a good - quality camera to your computer, it's called video - chatting. And you can do this with anyone, anywhere, at any time! In conclusion, all of this can only be done with a computer. Helping you with anything. Giving people facts about faraway places. And allowing you to talk online. There are many more benefits, but for you to know that, you'll need to go to the store and get yourself a computer, and start exploring its wonderful features.
715	717	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I understand that there have been some ongoing discussions about computers. Some people think they're good. Some people think they're bad. Other people just don't care. People just don't fully understand the present - day situation. Society is a whole lot different than when our parents were kids. People just don't grasp modern - day society. I'm going to tell you the advantages and disadvantages of computers. There are a lot of significant advantages to computers. You can find information extremely fast. Communication with people around the world is a huge and valuable advantage. Computers keep kids and teens entertained with a wide variety of games on websites. Computers are an essential part of our lives today. A lot of important things are done by computers. Computers also prevent you from wasting money on books because you could just search for information on google. There are also a lot of disadvantages to computers. They cost a lot of money initially. Computers can break down. There could also be some useless websites that have no real purpose, like facebook and myspace. Computers are quite complicated. If you don't grow up with them, it's really hard to learn how to use them proficiently. The government stores all their important information in computers. If they didn't, people would be able to steal information much more easily. Computers are the greatest thing we've invented so far. They help with a lot of tasks these days. There are an infinite number of information in the world, and computers help us find it efficiently. I hope that this letter has informed you more about computers. Both good and bad things come from this, but overall, it is mostly good. Kids and teens would be so bored that they would drive their parents insane if there were no computers. So, despite the drawbacks, computers have become an indispensable part of our lives.
716	718	1	3	### Expanded Item 1 Dear @ORGANIZATION1, A regular day for an average person, with a computer at their disposal, includes at least three hours using the computer per day. Today, people, especially impressionable teens, spend their precious hours mindlessly wasting time on sites like Facebook, MySpace @CAPS1 and more! Just think about it, just sitting idly in a chair with your eyes glued to the computer screen when you could be actively exercising, quality time with family and friends or simply enjoying the beauty of nature? After all, do we really need a computer for every waking moment? Obesity is one of the highest concerns in the country today. However, we can prevent it! We are certainly not helping this issue when we have children and adults sitting in a chair for a large part of their day doing absolutely nothing! We are so fortunate, our town has at least two well - equipped physical fitness buildings that anyone can attend instead of using the computer. And even if you can't attend a gym, you could easily take a brisk walk around your neighborhood. There are running programs held at our local beach, @LOCATION1, where you can not only exercise but even participate in a small running competition! Please, exercising is key to everybody's health and there are numerous ways to exercise, but using the computer is not one of them! Teachers, parents, children, writers - everyone, let's stay away from the computers and stay fit! Family and friends are those who make us truly happy but if we're constantly on the computer, how are we going to see them? More and more people are making less effort to see people in person. Instead, many people opt for video chats through cameras on the computer. We need to change this habit. Everybody needs to socialize face to face. If we socialize through computers, our socializing skills could worsen because you are not practicing essential socializing skills like eye contact. Instead of talking to people online, we could be enjoying the company of those same people at an amusement park, a cozy restaurant, at a serene park or simply in our backyard/house. The world is so beautiful with so many places to see but society is too busy to see it because we're on the computer for a long time. Our computers use up so much energy and are a threat to the world, @CAPS2 @CAPS3! Instead of entertaining ourselves on the computer, we could be taking hikes, going for walks on the beach or even on our street, or playing outside in our yard. On a computer, you can see majestic places like beaches but you can't interact with them. If we get off our computer, we could be swimming at a beach or a pool! Nature is so beautiful, why ignore it? @PERCENT1 of residents in @LOCATION1 own computers and spend a large part of their day on it. We could be improving obesity rates, spending more quality time with family and friends, and exploring nature! Let's make a change so we can do all of these things! By taking small steps away from our screens, we can lead healthier, more fulfilling lives.
717	719	1	3	### Expanded Item 2 Dear local newspaper, I believe that computers have a positive effect on people because they teach hand - eye coordination in a very practical way. When you use a computer, whether it's moving the mouse to click on an icon or typing on the keyboard, you are constantly coordinating the movement of your hands with what you see on the screen. This kind of hand - eye coordination is not only useful for computer use but also in many real - life situations. You can also learn about different people and places from all corners of the world. The vast amount of information available on the internet allows you to explore cultures, traditions, and landscapes that you might never have the chance to experience otherwise. But it also allows us to communicate with people online in an instant. Computers have a positive effect on people because it teaches hand - eye coordination. Because it's really important to have good hand - eye coordination. And when you're out in the world, you really need to be able to look at something and pick it up or, say, if you get into an altercation with someone, quick hand - eye coordination could be crucial. So it's really important to have hand - eye coordination. Another reason why I feel computers have a positive effect on people is because you could learn about different stuff over the internet. Like learning about far - away places and the unique people who live there. So the internet is giving you a great opportunity to learn more about our earth, other than just your back yard. It broadens your horizons and prepares you for life in a globalized world. My final reason why I think the computer has a positive effect on people is because it allows people to talk to other people who are online. Like say you don't have a phone but you have a computer and you need to tell something very important to someone; you could do it online in a matter of seconds. And people say it's one of the fastest pieces of technology known to mankind for those who need it. Those were my three reasons why I believe the computer has a positive effect on people. And if you don't believe me, go hop on a computer and see for yourself. You won't be disappointed as you discover all the wonderful things it can offer.
718	720	1	3	### Expanded Item 3 Dear Local Newspaper, I am writing to you about the use of computers and how they are bad for society. With people getting less exercise, not enjoying nature, and having less in - person interactions, they are doing the world more bad than good. Almost everyone has a computer these days, and it gets used more and more, and it is just taking away a great opportunity to go be active outside. First, exercise is a very important part of the day, and it is happening less and less because kids are sitting in front of their computers all day long. There is so much talk these days about how we are the fattest country. Well, here is one of the main causes: we have almost everyone staring blankly into a computer screen instead of being active. Computers are a big problem and they cause laziness to occur more often than not. Because now, if you miss your favorite @CAPS1.V. show, just look online and you will find it. Or if you are doing a project, just look online and you will find more than enough information and it is just a click away. Second, enjoying nature is a scarce thing now. All you have to do is search online and you could find a picture of your front yard. There are much fewer people outside. Because who needs to go outside when you could be chatting with a friend or just being on @ORGANIZATION1 looking up new technology. People who are always on the computer don't care about the environment as much because they are wasting electricity and they find more fun in the virtual world than in the real one. There are a lot fewer people going places now because who needs to go to @LOCATION1 when you can just look up pictures of @LOCATION1. It's taking away the thrills people used to have of going places, getting out of the house, seeing parts of the world far away firsthand instead of through a computer screen. Third, there are far fewer in - person interactions between well - everyone. Kids that text, @CAPS2, or Facebook chat more than talk in person with friends are losing the talking skills of actually having a proper conversation. Because online you have time to think, then when you talk in person, you have nothing to say because you can't think quickly and you're not at your full talking potential. People are seeing each other less and less now that they can text and talk over the computer. They think they have no need to see each other now and it is okay just to talk through the internet. Friends & family start to know who you are less because you can't see emotion through a computer. Also, they say that you can learn more about someone in @NUM1 minutes of playing with them than in @NUM1 minutes of talking with them. With this attitude toward outdoor activities, I am not surprised that students wasting time on computers do not have time for family or friends. Lastly, computers are doing more harm than good to everyone and they are making people more and more unhealthy. With people getting less exercise, not enjoying nature as much, and having less in - person interactions, people are just wasting their time in front of a computer screen getting fat rather than going outside with people and just passing a baseball. There are so many better ways people could spend their time than in front of a computer. Why don't they see that? We should all make a conscious effort to reduce our computer use and embrace a more active and social lifestyle.
719	721	1	3	"### Expanded Item 4 Dear local newspaper, it has come to @CAPS2's attention that many people do not agree if computers have a beneficial or bad effect on those who use them. In @CAPS2's opinion, they are not beneficial. First, when on the computer, people have less time to exercise. Also, computers don't always have appropriate sites. Finally, people have less time to interact with family and friends. I believe for these reasons that computers have bad effects on people. Without a doubt, people who spend hours on the computer every day have less time to exercise. @NUM1 in every @NUM2 young adults are obese. This is because most teens sit inside watching @CAPS1 or going on the internet instead of being physically active. Some students are so addicted to computers that they never go outside! I understand that computers can be helpful to do school work but, kids who never get off can have life - threatening weight problems in the future. As you know, many websites that are not appropriate for teenagers are accessible to them on the computer. Parents have to constantly worry about what their child/children are doing just to make sure it is not bad. If less teens used computers as often as they do, they would be lifting a load off their parents' shoulders. I remember reading a newspaper article about a girl named @PERSON1 on a website chatting with a ""@NUM3 year old guy who later came and found her and turned out to be @NUM4. If kids were not so addicted to the computer, then they wouldn't get into these dangerous websites. Many teens spend their whole day on the computer, leaving no time for their family and friends. For example, when a friend calls and asks @CAPS2's brother to go skateboarding, he says he is busy when he is just on Facebook. @CAPS2's friend once said to me ""sorry I can't go to the pool today I am going to play RollerCoaster Tycoon."" With this attitude toward outdoor activities, I am not surprised that students wasting time on computers do not have time for family or friends. As you can see, computers affect many people in a negative way. They prevent people from exercising, expose kids to inappropriate websites, and take away from valuable time with family and friends. I hope everyone agrees that computers aren't beneficial to people. We need to find a balance and limit our computer use to avoid these negative consequences."
720	722	1	3	### Expanded Item 5 Dear @CAPS1 in @CAPS2, Computers are one of the world's best discoveries today. For one, they help in our educational processes in a profound way. They also help connect people from all over the world in a short time and are a necessity in science research. Overall, computers are the best thing that has ever happened to mankind. First and foremost, our children today are already struggling in their educational systems. But with new, advanced computers, they strive to meet every goal. Teachers cannot tell them everything but computers can, as underneath that hard drive is a vast wealth of knowledge awaiting to be soaked up by eager young minds. Also, in today's fast - paced world, waiting is almost non - existent. Learning to type on a computer gives these children better opportunities for success in later life. Family, say your child is out for @NUM1 school day. Normally, they would miss their homework. But now, they can easily check it online and get back to their crucial studies when they are feeling better. Unless you want to risk tomorrow's future workforce, computers are an essential tool for us and our children. One of the best things about this world is that we're all different, and connecting with each other helps us learn how to deal with each other and move forward as a society. Connecting through the internet through programs like @ORGANIZATION1 is important for businesses as it helps them make decisions faster, which will ultimately affect us all. But don't be fooled. It can also be for pleasure. Say @CAPS3's son is on a business trip in @LOCATION1. No problem. Just go on webcam with him and you don't have to miss him anymore. In the government, problems evolve quickly and stealthily. To solve this, a president can quickly connect to his/her advisors while still being in his/her office. Connecting people through computers is miraculous and important to life as we know it. In addition, we wouldn't be where we are in science if it wasn't for computers. First of all, we are making great strides with cancer research today, thanks to the common computer. If it wasn't for that, we might not even have chemotherapy. Let's face it, computers are faster than us; way faster. But this is a good thing, because faster processing means faster research. While a simple machine @MONTH1 not tell us the cure through its processing speed, it certainly brings us a lot closer to unraveling the mysteries certain diseases hold beneath. Two minds are better than one. Even a scientist cannot know everything. But while connecting through a computer to scientists all over the world, they can analyze research and make very informed, responsible decisions. Certainly, this will extend our life expectancy. Some people say that people are too glued to their computer screens. But bear in mind, these are the people helping you stay alive and helping lower your healthcare bill you're talking about. So when you get ill and they find a cure, why complain that they only found it because they were attached to their keyboards and monitors! Trust them, they know what they are doing. So can we come to an agreement in life? Computers only do good things, like enhance our youth's
721	723	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I would like to notify your business that computers, these remarkable technological tools, greatly benefit society. Computers allow people to talk to friends and family in various convenient ways. They are important resources for many jobs as well as school work, and they enable people to learn and store a vast amount of information. Computers are one of the biggest advances we have in technology. First and foremost, computers allow people to talk to friends and family. I like to go on the computer, mostly because I'm able to speak with my friends in real - time. Computers are a good way to talk to friends that you @MONTH1 not see often or just to talk at the appropriate time. I have a facebook and I always talk to my friends about events happening in school or school work. For instance, last month I sprained my ankle and I stayed home from school for one day. So I went on facebook at around @TIME1, when everyone was home from school and my friend told me what was for homework that night. So, now because of our computers I could catch up on the work that I missed that day of school. Also, if you have family that lives far away or someone in college you can send them an email to keep in touch. My cousin is in college right now and I always talk to him on the computer to see how he is doing. For example, we always talk about sports we are involved with during that time of year. As you can see, computers are a great way to keep in touch with family and talk to friends. Secondly, computers are a big part of many peoples' lives because many jobs involve computers; as well as school. Computers are a very useful piece of technology because people use computers for paying bills, jobs and more. For example, my dad tests computer programs as a job. The programs are carefully constructed, then thoroughly corrected and revised, then finally sent out all over the world. If people weren't allowed to use computers then many people would lose their jobs and many families would be in huge debt. Also, children do a lot of school work on the computer. For example, I take spanish and I earn culture points for my class by answering a question on the computer. Studies show that over @PERCENT1 of children use computers for some sort of school work. Computers are a big part of the working society today. Finally, computers allow people to learn about different places around the world. The computer holds a lot of valuable information. There are detailed facts and fascinating pictures about different countries. It also shows people around the world the culture, style, language and many more facts about places around the world. For instance, my uncle was on the computer one day and he was looking at places in @LOCATION1 and after a long hard thinking process him and his family moved there and they still live there to this day. Computers inspire people to learn and see different places and @MONTH1 lead them to something important one day. In conclusion, I feel very strongly about how positive computers are to society today. I know that you will feel the same way because computers have so much to offer, making our lives more connected, productive, and informed.
722	724	1	3	@ORGANIZATION1, @PERCENT1 of people in the world use computers at least one time in their lives. Whether it's looking up information, sightseeing virtually, or chatting with friends, people are often on the computer. They use their computers for work and games, and @CAPS1 children use the computer to learn in engaging ways. Some scientists suggest computers improve your hand - eye coordination, while others think it makes people smarter because they are exposed to new things. You, @LOCATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 Newspaper staff, use a computer to type the news accurately and efficiently. You probably also use it for @CAPS3 of the things stated above. Most of the jobs in the world have one part that has to do with computers. Farmers @MONTH1 need to keep detailed reports on their money income. Mechanics @MONTH1 use the computer to create precise blueprints, @CAPS2 officers use a computer to keep track of all the license plates meticulously. Baby sitters @MONTH1 need to do their homework, perhaps using educational software on the computer. As you can see @CAPS3 jobs use the computer. How @CAPS3 people do you know that met someone or has a friend on the computer? I know I do, @CAPS3 people meet friends on the computer. Ever heard of @ORGANIZATION2? They match people together based on various interests. There is @CAPS4, @CAPS5, @CAPS6, and @CAPS3 more sites where you can chat with friends comfortably. All of these reasons come together and say the computer does benefit society. They help people in any number of ways. I agree we should spend more time outside but we should also spend some time inside, using the computer to enhance our knowledge and social connections.
723	725	1	3	I think that computers have great affects on people. Computers are a good way to @CAPS1 stay in touch with people easily, @CAPS2 shop online conveniently, @CAPS3 perform jobs efficiently, and @CAPS3 access information on @CAPS4 various facts. Computers might not be good exercise @CAPS5 you but it helps you in life and it also keeps you organized. @CAPS5 For example, it keeps files @CAPS5 for businesses neatly and @CAPS5 for people that are in the music industry, computers can create beats @CAPS5 for them and can also record @CAPS5 their music professionally. Computers help everyone in all ages. It helps the younger kids in school where they have to write a @ORGANIZATION1 essay or have to do a project, making their work more presentable. And it helps the elderly people @CAPS5 with their jobs, like managing their small - scale business records. Computers also helps you know what is going on in life, like on the news views to see who has been hurt or the weather conditions. Truly, the computers are really good @CAPS5 at everything they help you do so and it is really amazing how technology changes. If it weren't @CAPS5 for the progress of technology, I don't think some of us would be where we are today, enjoying the convenience and knowledge that computers bring.
724	726	1	3	Dear the @ORGANIZATION1, @PERSON1 studied that @PERCENT1 of people believe computers have a positive effect on people. You can stay in touch with relatives in a very intimate way. Also you can entertain yourself over long trips. Computers have positive effects on people. Computers let you stay in touch with relatives, keep up with friends and are a good source of entertainment. If you have distant relatives you can keep in touch. Video chatting lets you see someone and talk to them practically face to face from thousands of miles away, making you feel as if they are right beside you. If you are sad and need to talk to somebody you are a few clicks away from being cheered up. Also if you are in the army and have a @ORGANIZATION1 baby you can watch as they take their first steps or say their first words. Video chatting was not only the way to stay in touch but also you can just talk even without a computer. Aim and @CAPS1 let you see what's going on with your friends that you might see everyday or once a year at @DATE2 camp. @CAPS1 lets you keep in touch with everything that's going on with things like status updates, so you can always be in the loop. Aim lets you talk with just your keyboard where you type messages to people quickly. Maybe you want to go in to town with a friend, just send them a message by @CAPS1 or aim. Computers are not only for staying in touch though, you can stay entertained while you travel around. Computers let you do so much to stay entertained over long rides or even short rides. If you want to watch a movie just put in a disc or even rent one off itunes or netflicks. If you want to listen to a song download it in seconds and listen to your favorite tunes. Also you can even play video games on your computer. Just buy the game, install it and then play. Computers are a great thing during down time and have positive effects on people. Computers let you keep in touch with family, stay up to date with friends and are an excellent source of entertainment on long trips or downtime. Computers are the lightbulb of the @DATE1, illuminating our lives with connection and fun.
725	727	1	3	Dear Newspaper, I think that the effects are okay as long as we get off the computers and go outside and see some friends and get some exercise. Computers let us not just talk to each other but it also lets us challenge each other on games in a friendly and non - harmful way. It could even potentially stop all wars all at once because we could challenge other countries in war games without killing real living people. We can check our taxes and stocks accurately and in a timely manner. It also makes it easier to find health insurance, car insurance, and house insurance by comparing different policies. We can look up historical facts on the computer, reading detailed accounts and viewing related images. We can look up how to stop snake venom from getting to your heart and how to make a bow and some arrows to hunt with. You can find plumbers, technicians, oil companies, and lumber companies easily, reading reviews and comparing prices. You can find dates on the computer, too and find information about certain people too, learning about their interests and backgrounds. In conclusion, while we should balance our computer use with real - world activities, computers offer a wide range of benefits that make our lives more convenient, informed, and socially connected.
726	728	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I think that computers are truly a remarkable asset to possess. For instance, they offer a plethora of entertainment options, provide seamless communication capabilities, and are invaluable for creating designs.   My first reason is that computers are highly entertaining. I have never been fond of simply going out to look at nature. However, I absolutely adore playing video - games on my computer. I still manage to get my exercise, as I go out and play basketball and then enjoy some computer time. Even after a tiring game of basketball, when I'm done hanging out with friends, or when it's raining outside, I find great pleasure in playing some intense, gun - blasting computer games.   My second reason is the excellent communication features of computers. I love having the ability to talk to my friends on Facebook. You can effortlessly log in and start a conversation with anyone across the globe. Moreover, video chat is a fantastic addition, allowing you to actually see the person you're talking to, no matter how far away they are. Additionally, email is extremely useful for work purposes. You can quickly send information from one computer to another.   My last reason pertains to designs. Every modern car that you see on the road today was initially designed on a computer. People use these computers to create detailed blue - print designs for cars.   In conclusion, considering the entertainment, communication, and design capabilities that computers offer, it's clear that they are an essential and positive part of our lives.
727	729	1	3	Dear Newspaper, The invention of the computer has had a profound and far - reaching impact on society today. Although many people tend to view computers negatively, they actually enable us to carry out essential tasks that are integral to our daily lives.   Many people believe that the applications on a computer, such as @CAPS1, distract us from engaging in other productive activities. However, the applications a computer holds are indispensable for most tasks. For example, the calculator app saves a significant amount of time compared to doing all the math work on a piece of paper. It can handle simple arithmetic or complex mathematical problems in just less than @NUM1 seconds. It's extremely useful for calculating tips, managing finances, like determining how much to save, or even for doing basic math or science homework.   Another great application is note - taking. You can easily type your notes on the computer, eliminating the need to write with a pencil and paper. These typed notes are easy to read and can be used for studying to achieve good grades on upcoming tests or quizzes.   The most important and commonly used application on a computer is the internet. The internet hosts millions of websites for various purposes. If you're planning to go to the movies tonight, the internet can provide you with movie times, directions to the theater, and the duration of the movie. It's also an excellent tool for planning family trips, booking flights, and more. Clearly, these apps are highly useful.   The computer is also an outstanding device for learning. It allows you to explore new subjects, such as far - away places or people. What would our country be like if we weren't educated about the outside world? It's also a great way to conduct research. Teachers today assign numerous projects and assignments to help us learn new things, and there's no better way to research our topics than on the computer. For example, the fashion of the @NUM2 and @DATE1 was a project I did last month. The computer enabled me to find out the garments worn by both women and men, the materials they were made from, and how they managed to obtain the materials. The research I conducted on the computer gave me a comprehensive understanding of the topic and helped me learn the basics.   You might think that communication can be misused, but it's essential for keeping our world connected. The computer is one of the key devices for communication. Email on a computer allows you to send messages to one or multiple people without the need for a signal or service. Blogging is another form of communication on a computer, giving you the freedom to express your thoughts and share your knowledge on a particular topic. Instant messaging is very popular among teens. It's quick and allows you to have real - time conversations without long waiting times.   In conclusion, the computer is an indispensable part of our everyday lives. Without it, our society would struggle to function effectively as it plays a crucial role in various aspects, from work and learning to communication.
728	730	1	3	Dear Readers, I firmly believe that computers bring about a great deal of good in our country and have a positive impact on people. This is because they help save paper when sending emails, which in turn saves money. Additionally, they allow us to learn new things about different countries like @LOCATION1, and they enable us to interact with people we know.   First off, computers play a vital role in protecting the environment. Every day, a large number of trees, around @NUM1, are cut down. Not all of these trees are immediately taken to the mills to be turned into paper. Instead, they pile up at logging sites and start to rot, not being put to their proper use. I truly believe that trees have feelings, just like us, even though they can't express themselves. Cutting down a tree is like robbing it of its life. By using computers, we can save trees and prevent this wasteful process. This is one significant reason why I think computers have a positive impact on our lives and society.   Secondly, computers are excellent tools for learning. All you need to do is search for information, and you can learn a vast amount of knowledge. At school, I learn many new things every day with the help of computers. If we use computers effectively, our learning can be enhanced significantly. We can acquire a lot more knowledge in a much shorter time compared to having to search for a book on the subject we're interested in. Although computers can have both positive and negative impacts on children, overall, we gain a lot of new knowledge when we use them.   Finally, computers facilitate communication and interaction with friends. Technology has advanced so much that we often don't see the world in the right perspective. Take a cell phone, for example. At first glance, it looks like an ordinary phone. But if you open it up, you'll find a micro - computer that can surf the internet and play music, just in a smaller size. Computers have revolutionized the way we view the world and technology. We can talk and play games using this technology. Many of the things we see every day, like a game station or a car radio, are made possible by technology, which helps us interact with one another.   In conclusion, technology, especially computers, has both positive and negative impacts. However, the positive influence far outweighs the negative. Technology helps us in our daily lives, saves the environment by reducing paper usage, and allows us to communicate easily. It has transformed the way mankind lives and perceives society, and in the end, it is a force for good.
729	731	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, I firmly believe that not all people use the computer excessively. There are valid reasons for people to use computers, such as for work, school, and staying in touch with family and friends who are far away.   Firstly, most businesses rely heavily on computers to function smoothly. For example, where my mom works, the computer is essential for tasks like payroll management, inventory tracking, emailing employees about jobs, and looking up companies that supply concrete, stone, trucks, etc. Business people often have no choice but to use computers constantly. They also use computers to plan business trips efficiently.   Secondly, kids in school benefit greatly from computers. They use them to complete homework, do class work, conduct research for projects, and access educational resources. While some kids may misuse computers, there are also many educational and interesting things to learn. For instance, they can learn how cells divide, how body systems work, or the process of human development from embryo to birth.   In addition, most people use computers for communication. @CAPS2 people use @CAPS2 to communicate with others on the other side of the world, and AIM is also a popular option. I have a cell phone to call and text people who live far away, and I use AIM to chat with all my friends.   So, it's unfair to say that all people are on the computer too much and for the wrong reasons. In reality, most people use computers to talk to friends they haven't seen in a while, handle work - related issues, or complete school - related tasks.   In conclusion, in today's world, the computer has become an integral part of our lives. People use it to their advantage, and there are no significant negative effects as long as it is used appropriately. It is indeed the way of life now, and we should recognize its importance and positive contributions.
730	732	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, I do not think people use the computer to much. I think this because some use them for work, some use them for school, and some use it to talk to family or friends that are not so close to them. Firstly, most buinesses need computers to keep the buisnesses up and running. Like were my mom works she needs the computer for pay roll, inventory, e-mailing the works about jobs, and to look up companies to supply concrete, stone, tricks, etc. Buisness people have excuses to have to use computers all the time. Most buisness people also use computers to plan buisness trips. Secondly, kids in school use computers to do homework, class work, research for projects, or to go and study island and education. Some kids can choose to use the computers improperly but at the same time interesting. Like how cells divide into smaller cells how body systems work or how a girl or boy is made from embrio to birth. In addition, most people use computers. Like @CAPS2 people use @CAPS2 to talk to on the other side of the world or you can use aim. I have both cell phone to call and text people that live far away. I use aim to talk to all my friends, I use to face with. So, don't say all people are on the computer to much and for the wrong reasons, because that is not true at all. Finally, altho all people are always on the computer it is must likely to talk to friends you haven't seen in a while or for work issues, and for school related work. In my opinion all people will always use the computer because it is the way of life now a days. So, I don't think there are any affects on anyone because we all use it to our benifits.
731	733	1	3	Honestly, I totally and absolutely believe that child internet use should be cut down in the @LOCATION2, because of many compelling reasons. And here are just a few of them. First of all, the internet can make people very obese. For example, if your friend was going to take a walk to your house, but then decided to @CAPS1 you instead, he is probably not getting a lot of exercise. As a matter of fact, the leading @CAPS2 in @LOCATION1 is no longer cigarettes. It's obesity. Actually, @NUM1 @CAPS3 are obese, with that number still rising steadily. Another reason why internet use should be cut down is because of bullies, hackers, and terrorists. These online threats can cause a great deal of harm to children. And I firmly believe that children in the @LOCATION2 should have their internet use restricted to protect them from such dangers. In conclusion, reducing children's internet use in @LOCATION2 is essential for their physical health and safety.
732	734	1	3	Dear newspaper, This year, a police officer from the local precinct and a representative from my school came into our classrooms and told me and my peers about the numerous dangers of the online world. This eye - opening experience has made me firmly believe that computers are not beneficial. Computers are not beneficial because they enforce bad habits. Plus, websites and some applications are dangerous. Also, they are very addictive. Computers have a bad effect on people. To begin, computers enforce bad habits. For example, some websites are full of negativity, where people say mean things about others. Some kids @MONTH1 join in on the cyber - bullying because they give in to peer pressure. They so desperately want to be accepted by their peers that they lose their moral compass. Furthermore, someone @MONTH1 agrees to meet someone they don't know. That can be extremely scary because you do not know if this person is really who they claim to be. Recently, I read a magazine, and it had an article about people going to meet others they'd met online. Most people found out that it was not the person they thought they were. Finally, the computer enforces bad habits because people @MONTH1 send someone some questionable pictures. As the police officer who visited our school said, people were sending inappropriate pictures of themselves to others. Those other people would then spread these pictures around, and in the end, it was a horrible mess. I'm sure if computers didn't have such a huge influence on people, this would not be as big of a problem as it is. Computers do not only cause bad habits, but they are also dangerous. If you listen to the news, you'll often hear stories about child predators. I think that is one huge problem. If computers did not have such a strong hold on people, this would not be as prevalent. In addition, computers are dangerous because kids @MONTH1 make bad decisions due to lack of knowledge. For example, many kids on MySpace or Facebook have not talked to their parents or guardians about internet safety. Or maybe their parents aren't monitoring them to ensure they are safe online. In conclusion, the computer is dangerous because feelings can be hurt through social media platforms like MySpace, Facebook, blogs, or videos. One time on the news, I heard a story about a girl who was harassed online. She felt so bad that she committed suicide. It's truly horrible. A person should never take their own life, especially because someone else couldn't be nice. To sum up, computers are very dangerous and addictive. We should be more cautious about our computer use.
733	735	1	3	As you can see, technology these days is constantly evolving and getting more and more advanced. It seems as if there is a new and exciting invention that attracts many people to buy it all the time. One electronic device that has been extremely useful in so many ways to people is the computer. Many people think too much time is spent on it, but then I think about how much it's benefiting us. Computers can tell you pretty much anything you need to know, whether it's about a particular country or how to solve a complex problem. Moreover, computers are so advanced that you can talk to friends who are far away. Lastly, computers are helping us by giving very specific directions, rather than struggling to figure out a traditional map. Say you're doing a school project about a country. By typing in exactly what you need to know, you can find your information in a flash. Whether it's the country's population, density, languages, foods, or holidays, computers are the easiest and most straightforward way to get this information. Or maybe you're just genuinely interested in learning about this country because it fascinates you. Maybe you even plan on visiting this country; you're going to want to know all about the place you'll be spending your time. If you do plan on traveling to somewhere you've been researching, you can order your plane tickets right there online. You can figure out the routes you plan on taking, and this can help you organize your trip efficiently. Another reason computers are benefiting so many people is the feature of communicating with others, whether it's talking to a far - away friend or family member, or your best friend just a couple of streets over; you probably still want to keep in touch with them. Computers are so advanced now that they have webcams, allowing you to visually see the person you're contacting right on the computer screen. This is a more engaging way to talk to someone, especially if it's someone you don't see often and who @MONTH1 even lives in another country. Moreover, most teenagers like to keep in touch with their friends almost every day. Usually, kids enjoy chatting on instant message just for the fun of talking to their friends. Finally, computers are benefiting us by providing accurate directions and routes. As mentioned before, computers can give straightforward directions. This is much easier to handle than using a map while on the road. There are websites where all you have to do is type in your exact location and your exact destination, and it will tell you the specific roads and turns you need to take. In conclusion, those who are worried about people spending too much time on the computer should learn to balance their time. They should spend more time exercising, being outside, and enjoying nature, and shorten their time online. They should use the computer only when it's truly necessary.
734	736	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1, I understand that you're trying to decide whether or not computers are bad for people. I, for one, firmly believe that computers are turning our society anti - social, causing obesity, and facilitating a great deal of cyber - bullying. You can learn about all these issues and more if you read on. As I stated earlier, computers create many problems in @LOCATION1's social lives. You see, @PERCENT1 of our population spends at least @NUM1 hours a week on the computer. When doing this, they are typically watching videos or tweeting their friends. This might seem like a normal activity, but it is actually pulling us away from real - life social interactions. There are many social media sites that allow you to chat with your friends and leave messages on their ""wall,"" but is that really true communication? In a limited sense, it is, but it is taking away the social skills that we will need later in life. You can't get a job by instant - messaging a person; you have to talk face - to - face. But how will we be able to do that if we only rely on email and @CAPS3? Plus, while spending so much time on the computer, you are prone to making mistakes in your work, which will only result in a bad grade. Now, let's move on to the obesity problem that we see occurring all over. People tend to sit in front of the computer for long hours. This sedentary activity means they don't get enough exercise. For example, a child comes home from school and spends hours playing on the computer instead of going outside and getting some physical activity. Finally, we come to my last issue, cyber - bullying. Over @PERCENT2 of @CAPS4 teens will be faced with some sort of cyber - bullying in their life. When teens sign up for Facebook and Twitter, they are unknowingly signing up for potential depression. When a teen starts to get bullied, they usually become sad, which then leads to their grades going lower due to lack of concentration. This, in turn, makes them more depressed, and it could lead them to either commit suicide or join gangs and start making bad decisions. But we can prevent this if we limit the amount of time people, especially @NUM2, spend on computers. And I think society as a whole would benefit from this. In conclusion, I believe that computers are bad for society. By reducing the time people spend on them, we can improve our lives. If you look closely at the negative impacts I've described, you'll understand why we need to encourage a healthier @LOCATION1."
735	737	1	3	Dear (Newspaper), This is a very controversial topic that I am discussing. But on this one, I must say I whole - heartedly agree with the experts when they say computers have a negative effect on people. It ruins their social lives and causes other bad things. If you spend all your time on the computer, you get no exercise, no fresh air, and you will not get to experience the rest of the world. Not getting your daily exercise is a huge problem. Obesity has already been a major issue for millions of people in the @LOCATION1, and it is mostly because they munch on unhealthy snacks while sitting at the computer all day! If you want to live a long and healthy life, don't spend all your time with your eyes glued to a screen. In addition, everyone needs fresh air, right? Sitting inside a room and using the computer is not going to help at all. You need your daily intake of oxygen to stay healthy. Lastly, if you use the computer long enough, it will become an obsession. Computers already have a bad effect on people all around, and just think about the consequences of what has just been mentioned. Another problem computers have is that they keep you away from your family and friends. As mentioned before, the social life you once had will gradually fade away. People will constantly see you engrossed in the computer, and eventually, they will get tired of it. Computers bring no real adventures, just virtual images of them. Going out into the real world might be challenging, but it is something that should be done. A real life cannot be lived in a dark room with no human interaction or connection to nature. Haven't you always dreamed of traveling around the world, experiencing different cultures, and lifestyles? It gets to the point where computer use should be limited, and living your life to the fullest should take the place of your free time. Using a computer all day will not let you meet new people and see new places. You will go nowhere with a computer screen in your face, so put it away! In conclusion, using computers all the time restricts you from exercising, getting fresh air, meeting new people, and seeing different places all over the world. At the end of the day, life is short, so you can't afford to waste it. Computers have a negative effect on everybody, and hopefully, someday, we can find solutions to these problems and lead healthier, more fulfilling lives.
736	738	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I feel very strongly about my opinion of the effects computers have on people. Specifically, it helps others communicate with one another, provides people with information about different types of things, and makes people smarter. To me, that sounds like something with a positive effect. Would you say the same? First of all, some people claim it doesn't let you interact with family members. However, it truly does. You can interact with both friends and family members by going to chat rooms such as AIM, Meebo, or having webcam meetings like on Skype.com. So, you can throw that concern out the window; you don't have to worry about that. Secondly, you get to learn information about different types of things, such as learning about wild animals like a giraffe, cat, rat, or learning about different places like @LOCATION2, @LOCATION3, and @LOCATION1, etc. Also, you could find all of this information at home in one day. Most importantly, it would make people smarter as the computer teaches you hand - eye coordination for free. The computer can teach you about any career or regular job that you would need to learn about in just minutes, if needed. To conclude, computers have a positive effect on people. It lets people communicate with friends and family, you get to learn about different types of things, and it makes people smarter. Even after I was done writing this, I thanked the lord for computers as they help us so much.
737	739	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1, I'm writing to you today about computers. I firmly believe that computers can teach you things such as hand - eye coordination, and how that can open job doors for you. Also, you can socialize as well as study with this device. My first reason is socialization. I think that this is an excellent way to socialize due to the numerous options available. One prime example would be Facebook. This is a popular social website that is used to connect or reconnect with friends. In a recent poll, @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people say that computers had made them more social. Lastly, computers are a great way to socialize because of the wide range it can cover. You can talk to people without incurring the long - distance fees. You can communicate from the @CAPS2.S to Hungary in just seconds. My second reason is that computers are useful in studies. I would say this because even though books are good, they can be hard to find. With the computer, you can access multiple sites. You can go from Wikipedia all the way to the well - known Google in just a short time. Another reason I believe computers are good for studies is that you have endless resources. You will get a wealth of information. The lost time can be saved. My third and final reason is that computers give you exceptional hand - eye coordination. I know an accountant. I asked him, ""@CAPS3, did you take that accounting job?"" and he answered, ""They only took me because I have good hand - eye coordination."" That's one job example; another would be real estate. Due to the computer's multiple options, you can look up information for your client. With good hand - eye coordination, however, you can be more efficient with your work. This could help you outperform the competition, thus, making you more money. This then ends my essay. Starting with socialization, moving down to studies, and ending right on jobs. These are only @NUM3 of the many bountiful things that a computer can do. @CAPS1, I hope you read this with my sincere regards."
738	740	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I think that children are spending too much time on the computer for the wrong reasons. I say this because all young children and teenagers want to do is get on to @CAPS3 and @CAPS4 all day instead of researching and doing other productive things. I have three reasons why I think going on the computer for the wrong reasons instead of exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends is a problem. The first reason is because it is very dangerous, and there are sometimes kidnappers on the chat room. The second reason is because it's taking time away from trying to learn stuff off the internet. The final reason is because the internet influences violence. Here are the three reasons, and let's explore them further. The first reason why I say people are spending too much time on the internet is because it is dangerous. Young teenagers and children all enter a chat room online. Most of the time, that is bad because kidnappers lie about their information so that you can meet up with them and then they take you away. So instead of being on the chat room, you could be on the computer looking at the daily news or doing similar searches. This is why I say that the internet is not always good to be on all the time if you aren't learning or learning about the nation. The second reason why I think spending too much time on the computer isn't great is that it's taking away from your studies. Children come home and go straight to the computer instead of doing their homework or reading. Some kids like the computer sometimes more than they like learning, and that's not good because not knowing basic knowledge could be a problem. There are educational games on the computer, but they don't play them. This is another reason why I am concerned that people are using the computer a lot. The final reason why I am concerned about people using the computer too much is because the internet on the computer can influence young people to be violent in various ways. All the violent games and content they see affect them. In this generation, when they see violence, it gives an image in their minds, and they think it's cool to do it because it seems more exciting than a book. When young teens see violence on the computer, they think it's cool. This is the final reason why I am concerned that people are spending too much time on the computer. So, these are some of the main reasons why I say that the computer is not always a good thing because people spend a great deal of time on them.
739	741	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, Technology such as computers is proven to have a positive effect on people. Computers teach you hand - eye coordination, they give you the ability to learn about far - away places, and allow you to communicate with others online. Technology is continuing to grow rapidly, and it is becoming more and more impactful on our lives each day. One way that computers benefit society is that they teach you hand - eye coordination. For example, as a person becomes familiar with their computer, they are soon able to type on the keyboard without even looking down to see what letter or number they are touching with their fingers. Although the person isn't developing hand - eye coordination in the same way as playing a sport such as baseball, they have still developed this useful coordination. Computers also benefit our society because they give others the ability to learn about far - away places. Instead of walking or driving to the library to find a book about @LOCATION1, they can simply go online and type in @LOCATION1 under a search engine. Within seconds, thousands of sources appear right before your eyes, and you didn't even have to leave your chair! That is another reason why computers benefit our society. Lastly, computers and technology benefit our society because they allow you to communicate with others, reconnect with old friends or family, or simply share the latest gossip from your art class. I know whenever I'm at my computer, my instant messenger is always open. It is something I utilize every day in order to communicate with my friends and distant relatives. In conclusion, computers do benefit society, and they are proven to have a positive effect on people. Technology is like a sponge; it absorbs information and then continues to expand every time you add more. By doing this, I am able to maintain healthy and strong relationships with others.
740	742	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 are not bad for society. They actually can be quite beneficial for people. Computers allow us to talk with people online. They can assist us in school and provide the information we need to do things in life. People think they are bad, but all you have to do is look a little deeper and you will find the good in @CAPS7. @CAPS5 people use a @CAPS2, <@PERCENT2@NUM1> of the time @CAPS7 is to talk with people on the @CAPS3, whether @CAPS7 is using video chat or e - mail. People who don't like to use @CAPS2 and e - mail might say ""@CAPS4 not use a phone or even talk to them in person."" With e - mail, you can send a message to someone miles away. If you are sending someone a list, like a recipe for example, you don't want to read it to them over the phone. It would be easier to type it out and then send it to them over the e - mail. ""@CAPS5 my son said he was going to teach me how to use e - mail, I thought it was going to be a waste of time,"" said @CAPS6 @PERSON1, a senior citizen. ""It turns out, it wasn't. Now I use e - mail every day."" Many people think email is a waste of time, but it can help you in your everyday life. The @CAPS3 can help in many ways also. It can help us get information about various topics. If you are trying to cook a stir - fry but you don't know what to put in it. You try to call your mother but she isn't there. Your next choice is to look it up on the @CAPS2. It turns out there's a website that gives a recipe for a stir - fry and you follow it and make the best one ever. I know from personal experience that you can find maps to places online, since I have to go to some new place almost every week. Google Maps is the most used place on the @CAPS3, besides e - mail. Some newspapers have websites where you can read the paper without actually paying for the physical paper. This saves you money and it means less paper is used, so we can save trees. The vast world of the @CAPS3 can change our lives. @PERCENT1 of people that use the @CAPS2 almost everyday are students. Students use the @CAPS2 for numerous reasons. The biggest one is typing. Students use typing to type reports and e - mail. ""I have messy handwriting,"" said a student, @PERSON2. ""If it weren't for the @CAPS2, no one would be able to read my homework and reports. Not even me."" @PERSON2 is one of many people who are lucky to have the @CAPS2 for typing. Another reason students use @CAPS2 is to look up information for reports. If a student puts a bibliography in his report, you will see that he/she used the @CAPS3 @PERCENT2 of the time. There may not be a book in a local library for a student to use, but the @CAPS3 will have many websites and blogs for him/her to use. The third reason is for help. There are many websites that can help a student in any subject. The @CAPS3 can help a student pass school. A @CAPS2 can help anyone from talking to someone to helping a student with science. That is how computers are good."
741	743	1	3	"To use computers, or not to. That is the question. Hundreds of millions of people use computers in their daily life today, but some believe that using computers does not benefit society. It is my firm belief that they do. Computers provide entertainment, a way to interact with people, and a nearly endless expanse of knowledge. Without them, we would quickly find life to be much harder and less fun to navigate. Have you ever been in your house on a rainy day just sitting around bored because there is nothing on TV? Well, I have on many occasions. When that happens, all you have to do is turn on the computer and you have endless choices at your fingertips. You can go on game sites and play thousands of different games. (This can also help improve your hand - eye coordination.) You can also watch movies or TV shows that you missed or want to watch again. You can even go on sites such as fanfiction.net, and read or write your own stories! Another reason why computers benefit society is that they help you interact with people. You can keep in touch with far - away family members and friends using webcams, email, and chat sites without the bill that would come with talking on the phone. You can also meet new people from different countries and become their friends. That way you learn about different ways of life and cultures. You can also quickly contact people in an emergency, get updates on events, and communicate with your teacher if you have a question about your homework. Lastly, and maybe even most importantly, computers are an enormous source of knowledge. Say you wanted to learn how to start a campfire, you could just search, ""how to make fire"" on Google and countless matches would be found in seconds. Also, if you were assigned a project for school, you could do all of your research easily from your computer, then type the whole thing up on a word document. You can even get a college degree online if you wished. And if you want to find a restaurant that specializes in Italian cooking, you can find one close to you, get directions to it, look at the menu, see the prices, get the restaurant's history, and find reviews for it all on one magnificent little device: your computer. So you see, computers benefit society greatly. In fact, I don't think we could live without them. They provide us with entertainment, an easy way to interact with people, and a huge source of information. Now, to all of you people who still think computers are bad; I'd like to see you last a week without using one. It's clear that computers have become an indispensable part of our lives, enhancing our daily experiences in numerous ways."
742	744	1	3	Dear @LOCATION1, I truly believe that using computers has a benefit to the community. I believe this because using computers helps with research, jobs, and staying in touch with people. First and foremost, the use of computers will contribute to better research. Most students don't have textbooks about advanced science or rare historical events at home with them so they rely on the internet. When @PERSON2 gave the class an assignment, I didn't know what some of the words meant. So I logged into my laptop and went on Google. Within seconds, the definitions were popping onto my screen like pop rocks. After I found out what the words meant, I finished my homework in about five minutes. Without the internet, I don't know how long it would have taken. Equally important, using computers will allow a wider selection of jobs. A significant percentage (@PERCENT1) of today's jobs in @LOCATION1 require some kind of computer work. Some jobs require quick typers, and some people type as fast as a cheetah runs. Some jobs require people using graphic design software or programming languages - Computers are a necessity to get a well - paying job. Lastly, using computers will open a gateway for communication. @CAPS7, @CAPS8, @CAPS9, etc. are a few of the many ways to communicate online. If one of my friends doesn't have a phone, they most likely have a @CAPS7. @CAPS7 gives me a way to talk to, share photos with, and leave videos for my friends. One weekend, @PERSON3, @PERSON4, and I were all going to work on our @PERSON1 project. @PERSON3's phone was taken away so the only way I could talk to her was on @CAPS7. Did you know that a large percentage (@PERCENT2) of @LOCATION1 has a @CAPS7, @CAPS8, or @CAPS9? To conclude, I hope you enjoyed reading about how using computers helps with research, applying for a job, and communicating with family and friends. Please, @LOCATION1, publish this in the Newspaper so all residents of @LOCATION1 will agree with me. It's evident that computers play a vital role in our daily lives and community development.
743	745	1	3	Dear @STATE1's newspaper editors, I have recently read an article that was talking about how experts are concerned that people are spending way too much time on their computers. Well, I agree with them. I strongly believe that computers are taking time away from you exercising, enjoying nature, and even interacting with family and friends. Well, if you look at teens these days and how more and more are becoming overweight. Like back in the days when there wasn't a computer or internet, not as many people were overweight or even obese because they had time to go out and exercise or play sports with others. Exercising is important because especially when, as a teen, you are overweight or even obese, these problems just don't go away. This will cost you in the future because not only do you have the chance of getting diabetic, but you also have to pay for all the medications and treatments that come with it. Experts also believe that by spending time on the computer will take time away from enjoying the things that nature has to offer. When others might argue that it is a good thing for people to learn about the different types of places in the world. Well, I believe why do you have to just read about the places online and look at the pictures? Why can't you be the one taking the pictures for others to see? And why can't you be the one experiencing it instead of just reading about it. Experts also believe that by spending time on the computer it is taking away time from you being able to interact with family members and friends. Well, as a teen myself, I have learned that interacting with family and friends is very important to our health. I am not the only person that agrees with that because studies show that kids that can talk to their parents and have good conversations with their parents have the ability to do well in school and have more respect towards others versus the kids or teens that can't really have a conversation or talk to their parents. For example, if you are the type of person that talks to your family, you will have good grades such as A's and B's and will learn to have respect for others. And the person that can't talk to their parents has trouble concentrating or even makes trouble for themselves and gets C's and D's. Well, I know that as a @STATE1 newspaper editor you are a very busy person and have a lot of different things to do, but I hope you take this into consideration and remember the importance of exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with families and friends. It's crucial that we find a balance and not let computers consume our lives.
744	746	1	3	Dear @PERSON1, I'm sending you this letter on the behalf of the people that spend way too much time on computers. Some people say that you learn different cultures and interact with new people every day. The truth is that a computer doesn't help you; in fact, it hurts you. By spending all day on the computer you will get fat, lose great experiences on the outside, and miss out on life. As a whole, @LOCATION1 is known as an obese country. This is due to the fact that most people eat and then don't exercise. Most of these obese people don't exercise because they are glued to their computer. While interacting with others, they just keep on eating, and most don't even know why they're eating. If we want to erase @LOCATION1 as being an obese country, then we must get people away from their computer screens. It is actually our fault because we aren't making a stand. We must show people just how bad the computer really is. Also, while people are on the computer, they're missing out on the world. They won't go outside, they won't know what the real world is actually like. Imagine being an adult and having no clue about the outside world. Also, they could miss out on life - changing experiences, the kind of experiences that people cherish. They would miss out on life as a whole. We only have one life, so you better enjoy it. It would be so sad for someone to just pass through life being stuck on your computer screen. I truly feel bad for that person, then again it could be fixed. All that we have to do is take away the computer. If we do this, then all the problems will be solved. Finally, if we get rid of computers, we will be known as a new nation. Free from temptation and independent human beings. We will rewrite ourselves in history as the nation that made a change and got rid of computers. It's time for us to take action and reclaim our lives from the grip of computers.
745	747	1	3	Dear newspaper journalist, People shouldn't have computers. Computers have a negative effect on most people. The @LOCATION1 has the highest number of obese citizens in the world. A lot of people spend their day sitting in front of a computer at work. Then they go home and go on their own computers instead of going for a walk or a bike ride. Some people like to look at photos of nature or birds on the internet, even though there's a whole forest outside waiting for them to explore. Another problem with computers is how safe they are. There are a lot of people on computers that don't belong there, and are trying to hack onto your computer. Viruses can sneak into your computer without you knowing it, and can look up everything on your computer, even personal information. They can even monitor what you're typing, which could be passwords! A lot of people have been paying their taxes online, and if there is a virus on their computer, they could have their personal information stolen. Plus, most people who pay their taxes online have to use their online bank accounts, so now the hackers can get access to your bank account password too! Computers are bad for most people. They make people become unhealthy and can get their personal information hacked by a virus. In light of these issues, it's clear that we need to be more cautious about our computer usage and consider the negative impacts they bring to our health and privacy.
746	748	1	3	@ORGANIZATION1, I would like to tell you that computers are incredibly helpful in our society today. Have you ever found yourself in a situation where you needed to know something about a particular state or a place that was making big news, and you urgently needed to get that information? Where did you turn to? I'm certain it wasn't a book; instead, you turned to the computer. Without it, how on earth were you going to obtain your info? I firmly believe that computers are beneficial to our society because they can assist you in learning, and they can also inform you about when and where to sign up for various activities. People can interact with others from different countries, states, or continents. Next, let's explore how computers can benefit our society. Computers can aid us in learning by allowing us to search for research for a paper or even expand our general knowledge. For instance, today my class and I are going to the @ORGANIZATION2 @CAPS1 to look up information on seat belts on buses. Without computers, my class and I wouldn't have been able to get it done. If we had relied on books, there wouldn't have been enough to distribute to all of us, which would mean we would have had to share. With sharing, some kids in @MONTH1 might have hogged the books for a long time, not allowing the other kids to get the information needed to complete the paper, which could lead to a civil dispute in the classroom between those two. With computers, we have enough for each kid in the class. Moreover, computers can help us gain more general knowledge at a quicker pace. As we gain more general knowledge, we become smarter. Next, computers can help us set up activities. Computers can assist us in signing up for activities like baseball, football, basketball, or a gym. With the help of computers, you don't have to waste time going to the gym to sign up; you can do it conveniently at home. Maybe there's a waiting list to enter. You would've known that if you signed up online. For example, my little brother plays baseball, and my parents signed him up online. All they had to do was take him to the place to sign up and show the confirmation. I live in the town of @LOCATION1, while others had to sign up, register, and pay in person. All of that could've been done online, just like my parents did. By understanding why computers can be helpful to society in terms of gaining knowledge and signing up for activities, do you see why we need them for everyday life or just to get around? Computers are truly beneficial to our new and upcoming society!
747	749	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, Have you ever completely forgotten the book you needed for your homework? Did you ever miss the newest and most exciting episode of your favorite show? Well, all these things and many more can be easily solved by using the computer. The computer provides us with all the things we require. Whether it's useful information, entertaining games, or online friend - chatting websites, the computer is an absolute necessity for our society today. Countless times, I've been in a desperate need for information. For example, if I'm doing a school report on animals, I can simply go on the computer and search for whatever I want. There's no more need to drive all the way to the town library and then spend hours searching through countless books and encyclopedias. I genuinely think that that is a huge waste of time when you basically have everything you need just twenty feet away, right in your own house! There is no more need to search for hours through biographies. If you need to know state capitals, you can find that information in no time at all. To me, that's a real life - saver. Not only can computers help you with information, but they can also make school projects so much easier. In my own personal experiences, I've needed pictures for school projects. Instead of spending time drawing them, the internet can save a great deal of time and effort. All you need to do is print out the pictures! However, if you have an essay that's, let's say, supposed to be ten pages long, who in the world wants to write all that by hand? With a computer, you can type it out in half the time. Then, when you're done, you can print it, or even send it straight to your teacher. But, if it's not finished, you can save it on a thumbdrive and use it on any computer you want. All in all, that's an enormous help. My final reason why computers are good is that they offer instant pleasure. Computers have millions of games that a kid can play for free. Also, it has many websites, like @CAPS1 or @CAPS2, that allow you to interact with your friends. If you need to tell them something, there's no need for a phone. Plus, if you miss certain shows or want to watch music videos, there are dedicated websites for that. As a kid, I'm usually never home because of sports and school activities. If I miss something on @LOCATION1, it is almost definitely going to be available on the computer. You don't have to wait a week or so before they replay that episode. Who would want to do that? In the end, I firmly believe that computers benefit people around the world. No more driving to libraries or going out and buying games. The computer has everything you want for free. Basically, I think the computer is a huge time and effort saver that every household needs. It definitely benefits society.
748	750	1	3	Yes, I wholeheartedly agree with the concerns that experts have. I say this because it's absolutely true that people spend a long time on the computer and end up forgetting about their family. There is also a wide range of dangers online, and lastly, your brain isn't getting the sufficient workout it needs. Don't you think all of this is true? Well, then if you still don't believe me, I'll prove it to you. First, people can get so addicted to the computer that they forget about their family. Instead of being on the computer just aimlessly looking for things like myspace or facebook, they should spend quality time with their families playing games like @CAPS1, @CAPS2, or @CAPS3. I say this from a personal experience. It wasn't me, but it was my cousin @PERSON1. He got so addicted to the computer that every time his family tried to do something fun together, they would always end up fighting because he didn't want to go. Secondly, people can be facing major danger online. For example, when you go to those chat sessions where you're supposed to meet people your age, but it might not always be that way. Every time you turn on the news, you see stories where old people try to act like @NUM1 - year - olds, but they aren't. They just have bad intentions. So you can be exposed to a lot of dangers online. Lastly, by being on the computer, you're not letting your brain get the good workout or exercise it needs. Your brain is just sitting there idle, but instead, you could be reading a book or doing a word - search puzzle. These are all great ideas for making your brain exercise. On a recent research, experts say that people who spend time reading and exercising their brains do very well on tests, but people who spend most of their time on the computer tend to fail tests. So don't you think I'm right? Don't you think that if you spend too much time on a computer, you'll have less time with your family, you could be facing serious danger, and your brain won't get the exercise it needs. Have I convinced you yet? In conclusion, it's clear that excessive computer use can have detrimental effects on our lives, and we should be more mindful of how we use this technology.
749	751	1	3	I would like to state on my behalf that I do not agree that computers are good for society. There are three key reasons why I hold this view. Many people will end up not enjoying the outdoors. @CAPS1 people will spend a significant amount of their time on the computer. Moreover, a lot of people will gain weight due to inactivity. When you sit on a computer and don't get up for a while, it's because you're having so much fun. When you're having fun, you're less likely to stop what you're doing, and @CAPS2 might not pay attention to other things. Eventually, you'll get hooked and choose to play on the computer rather than go outside and have fun with your friends. @CAPS4 will simply take up all of your time. @CAPS2 when you're bored, you'll look for anything you can possibly do rather than just sitting there bored. Many people think this is a good time to go on the computer, but @CAPS3 if you're bored, you'll stay on the computer until you have something else to do. My mother always tells me when I'm bored not to stay home because @CAPS4 will only get worse. There's always something you can do; you just have to look a bit harder. My last reason is that when you sit at a computer and use only your fingers, you're likely to gain weight. I read that @NUM1 children every year will become obese, not because @CAPS4 runs in the family but because of inactivity. Inactivity means not being physically active. @CAPS3 if you consume calories without burning them, you will gain weight. @CAPS6 being overweight is unhealthy, and you can solve the problem by just finding something else to do instead of spending your whole life on the computer. In conclusion, you @MONTH1 might have mixed thoughts @CAPS3 if you ever want to go on the computer all the time. @CAPS4 it doesn't matter @CAPS3 how often you go on; just don't do it all the time. But remember my reasons why not to spend too much time on the computer. You won't enjoy the outdoors, you should find something else to do when you're bored, and you'll gain weight @CAPS3 if you spend all your time on the computer. We should be more aware of the negative impacts of excessive computer use and strive for a more balanced lifestyle.
750	752	1	3	In my opinion, I think that computers have nothing to do with people having a lack of exercise or sleep. I firmly believe that it is entirely the person's decision to be on the computer for as long as they want. The person on the computer obviously doesn't care whether they get enough sleep or not. When people are on the computer, I think they stop playing as much and start to gain weight, but that's their own choice. Also, when the time is right, they're going to realize that they need to spend less time on the computer and start exercising. However, they definitely need a time limit for being on the computer, as well as limited time for eating right and exercising. When @NUM1 people are on the computer, they don't get the opportunity to interact with their family and friends because they're being lazy and prefer to stay on the computer. The family and friends get angry and don't want to hang out with them anymore, and within a couple of months, they end up having no friends. Nature has a wonderful smell, looks beautiful, and computers make people stay inside all day! I strongly believe that we should have more time outside. Also, computers sometimes make kids not want to clean their room or do their chores because they're addicted to the computer. In conclusion, while computers have their uses, excessive use can lead to various negative consequences in our lives, such as social isolation, lack of physical activity, and neglect of responsibilities. We should find a healthy balance between using computers and engaging in other important aspects of life.
751	753	1	3	Dear, local newspaper, I whole - heartedly agree with @CAPS1 that computers are not good due to various reasons. For instance, excessive computer use puts a person's health at risk as they don't exercise much. People end up spending more time glued to the computer screen than interacting with their family and friends. Sadly, it also causes people to change their attitudes and ways of being. If you want to know more, you'll have to read on. There are numerous consequences for those who spend too much time on the computer. Many get addicted to watching certain things or become addicted to the computer itself. Nowadays, plenty of people have to wear glasses, and most likely, it's because of excessive computer use. Having to wear glasses for the rest of one's life must be truly inconvenient. Moreover, too much computer time is bad for a person's health as they're devoting more time to the computer instead of exercising. I firmly believe people should spend more time interacting with family and friends. Otherwise, they might lose their friends and family as they're not giving them the time they deserve. Friends and family are among the most important things in a person's life. Last but not least, too much computer use can change a person, altering their manners, the way they speak, and their attitudes. I've presented reasons why I think computers are not good, such as endangering health, changing a person's life, and causing them to lose family and friends. Now, the choice is yours.
752	754	1	3	You need to gather information for a project you're presenting in school, but how can you quickly and easily learn about your topic? Most people will turn to one of the most commonly used pieces of technology in the @LOCATION1, the computer. The computer is used for quick and easy research, interacting and communicating with friends, and for personal entertainment. Some people argue that the computer will take away from enjoying nature, spending time with family and friends, and exercising. But what if we didn't have the computer? The possibility of research and other tasks would be much more difficult. For example, computers help us learn about almost anything quickly and easily. This can make schoolwork or job - related tasks less stressful. Also, a computer can be accessed right at home, so no travel is required. The computer has programs that are used to prepare articles, essays, slide shows, and brochures for presentation. If we didn't have a computer, research would be a real struggle and might require travel. Computers are one of the most common ways to communicate with friends and family. Websites and e - mail help you keep in touch with anyone around the world. You can write e - mails, access live chat, or even use a webcam. E - mailing is just like mailing a letter, except it is delivered instantly and doesn't cost anything. There is also no risk of anyone reading your mail. Live chat is when you chat over text on the computer. Webcam is face - to - face interaction, which gives the effect of talking in person. A great benefit is that communicating over the computer doesn't cost a thing. Lastly, computers provide games for your personal entertainment, which helps kill boredom. The computer also helps improve hand - eye coordination. Along with staying organized, pictures, videos, and more can be placed in files and saved on the computer, making it easy for you to open them at any time. Computers may take away from some activities, but think of how much harder and more stressful things would be without it. I think that the computer has a good effect on people and is a very helpful piece of technology.
753	755	1	3	"Dear local newspaper, I strongly believe that computers have a great and beneficial effect on society. They have so many features, options, and abilities to use! Would you really try to prevent your child, friends, and families from using such an amazing invention that helps us every day? The computer can help others communicate, help educate you, and even prepare you for the future. One great option that computers have is the option to communicate with others. You can set up an email or a chatting account to talk with friends and family. Now some people might think, ""Why not use a phone to talk to others?"" Well, there are many reasons why talking online can be better than using a phone. I remember one time a few years ago. Me and my cousin @PERSON2 were alone at her house when the phone wasn't working. @PERSON2 went downstairs to get us some sodas when I heard a crashing sound. @PERSON2 had fallen down the stairs. Because the phones weren't operating, I quickly hopped to the computers in her room to ""chat"" with my dad and tell him what happened. After that, my dad called an ambulance and @PERSON2 was all right. So, not only are computers a great way to communicate, but they can also save someone's life! Another feature computers have is that they can actually educate. For example, if a student has to write a paper for school about the @CAPS3, then they would need to do some research. The internet explorer on your computer can open your eyes to a world of knowledge. All you have to do is go to a search engine such as @ORGANIZATION1 or @ORGANIZATION2 and type in the subject you wish to learn more about. Before you know it, there are millions upon millions of websites that can educate you on the subject you want to gain more knowledge on. @PERSON1, a high school teacher, states that ""@PERCENT1 of students in the school use the computer to help them with homework and research."" So, there you have it, the computer is a great resource for information. One last reason computers are extremely beneficial for our society is because they can actually help you prepare for future jobs. Perhaps some day your child will get a job working in an office where they must use computers all day long. The head of the company is not going to hire you if you are not experienced with computers. However, if you know how to use a computer well, then you have a great chance of getting a job that can support you and your family. Studies say now that ""@PERCENT2 of businesses involve using a computer."" Computers are becoming a bigger part of society by the second. It's important to start learning more about them as soon as possible. In conclusion, the computer's positive impact on society is undeniable, and it is an indispensable tool for modern life."
754	756	1	3	Dear local Newspaper, I am writing this to let you know that many people are spending too much time on computers rather than enjoying nature. People who advocate for advances in technology believe that computers have an effect on people. However, many also say that while we can use computers, we should remember to think about nature and the wonderful things it offers. I'm going to say that experts are right when they claim that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. I think that in some cases, many family members and friends notice that a relative spends so much time on the computer that it seems as if they don't care anymore. Caring about nature and your loved ones is such a great thing. @PERCENT1 of my friends agree with me when I say that people should be less on electronic devices because it can affect your brain or maybe your eyesight (eye vision). More and more people should cut down on computer use. @PERSON1 of Yale University has conducted extensive research and proven that continuous use of computers by people can cause damage. I strongly agree with him that there should be a time limit on computer use, allowing people later to have spare time to enjoy nature or do something different, such as listening to soft music. I know you will agree with me when I say that maybe people should spend less time harming themselves. I'm hoping you'll agree with my position so that we can break this habit of excessive computer use. Having no time for your family and friends is not a good way to start. In conclusion, it's high time we balanced our computer use with real - life experiences.
755	757	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 experts are concerned about today's population's computer usage. I agree with them, as many children and adults are counted and labeled as obese or overweight. Technology has advanced to the point where machines can do everyday tasks, showing how lazy some @CAPS3 are nowadays. People sit at home, staring at a computer screen, forgetting about spending time exercising, enjoying nature, or having fun with friends and family. Having a computer clearly interferes with one's social life in real life, not the ""social life"" of chatting with others over the internet. Having applications released that connect people over the computer makes it seem unnecessary to leave your house. Now with video, you can virtually meet the other person, but it also shows how lonely and isolated you can become from others. While your friends are having a party, you'll be absent, as I'm sure they won't have a webcam there. Another reason why a computer is not needed is that many people neglect pure nature. When surrounded by the new digital age, the beauty of the outdoors is forgotten. Sure, you can watch videos and look at pictures of nature, but is that really anything compared to the crisp, clean air against your hair or the once - in - a - lifetime animal behavior you might see? Plus, nature and being outside can inspire you to continue a diet or begin one, seeing how healthy and perfect the outdoors can be. It also serves as a great place to exercise. As we all know, obesity is a factor in the @LOCATION1 and around the world. But now, being overweight is at an all - time high, claiming lives and causing many to fall into depression. In my opinion, I believe this is highly related to computer usage, especially with fast food playing a role. People have not realized the need to exercise more often. In conclusion, you can see how computer usage has affected us as a nation, and in a negative way. Computer use can be ""ok"" when used in moderation, like sweets or oily foods. It does serve as a way to pass time for a while, but so does exercise. Which one do you think is the better solution? Obviously, we must stop relying on technology to help us and start engaging in activities ourselves again."
756	758	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1, I believe that people are spending too much time on computers. I believe this and I have @CAPS7 reasons why. The first reason is that people waste money on it. Also, everything they get from the computer, you can get from a book. And finally, the third reason is because of the ""@CAPS8 crises."" The first reason for saying that people spend too much time on the computer is that people waste too much money on it. I believe this because of your electric bill and your @CAPS3 bill. The people who have a computer, their electric bill is always very high, and for this reason, they are forced to pay @NUM1 or more dollars on electricity. This is also true because of the constant charging of laptops or running of computers. Also, they have to pay @NUM2 and odd dollars on the @CAPS3 bill to keep the @CAPS3 connection. So that becomes a total of @NUM3 and odd dollars going down the drain. The second reason for this is that anything and everything you can get on the @CAPS3 you can get from books. I believe this because where do you think the website makers get their info from? Reading books also increases your knowledge so that at any time you can quickly come up with an answer. Another reason is that some websites are not always accurate with their information. The third and final reason for this is that we are all dealing with this ""@CAPS8 crisis."" @CAPS7 people every day are getting less and less active because of computers. This causes less people to be physically active and less fit. And the @LOCATION1 is suffering because of it. Less and less people are joining the army because of this crisis, and computers are sadly contributing to the worldwide crisis. I eagerly hope that this letter has helped you see my point of view on this subject. To show that people spend too much time on their computers because it's a waste of money, anything you can get from a computer you can get from a book, and because of the ""@CAPS8 crisis."" In conclusion, it's clear that the excessive use of computers has multiple negative impacts, and we should be more mindful of our computer usage."
757	759	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I have heard the concern of many scientists about computers. Computers have brought us into the @DATE1 and have improved our society, but they are harming our children's health and education. Because of computers, children and adults around the world are spending less time with family and friends, they are not enjoying athletic activities, and they are having health problems. Due to an increase in technology, children and adults are not spending time with their families. The computers are ruining family connections. For example, a study at @ORGANIZATION1 showed that families with more computers in their houses communicated less. The children are talking to their friends online or are going on social networking sites instead of talking in person to their family members. Also, computers are making it very hard for families to have meals together. When the children are on the computer, they do not want to leave. This obsession with the technology is making it harder for families to grow close and for children to be more successful in school. The computers are preventing children from getting a better education. Athletic activities are also suffering because of computers. Children will be on websites all day instead of being on a sports team. The electricity that runs computers emits a certain amount of radiation. Being exposed to this could lead to brain damage or possible death. When my aunt bought a computer for the first time, she complained about massive headaches that kept returning. This was caused by the radiation emitted from the computer. Another health risk is obesity. When children sit in front of a computer for many hours, they have an increase in appetite. These children eat because they have nothing better to do. While on the computer, the users eat and will gain weight because of the loss of exercise. They could become obese and possibly get diabetes. Therefore, there is less communication in families, a loss of exercise, and health concerns caused by the computers. The consequences of misusing this technology are devastating and could be life - threatening. Thus, I urge you to do whatever is possible to use the computer less or face the consequences that come with it. In conclusion, the negative impacts of computer overuse on family, health, and education are significant, and we need to take action to limit our use.
758	760	1	3	Computers are great. They can help you with anything you need. You can shop on them, pay bills, even book a flight to go on vacation. But people are spending too much time on them. They should only spend a certain amount of time on them and not all day. Many people are spending more than enough time on the computer. People often stay on the computer for hours and not even realize it. They stay up all @TIME1 doing work or playing games. After a while, it will eventually take a toll on the body. Because if you are on the machine all day, then you are using little to no energy at all. So then you spend @CAPS1 nights in bed tossing and turning. Then that leads to feeling horrible in the @TIME2. If you do it often, it is going to have a bad effect on your body. I believe that people who spend all their time on the computer will eventually get overweight. If you are sitting in a chair all day, then you get no exercise whatsoever. Then when you eat, you don't burn off the calories, so that leads to people gaining weight and becoming overweight. From that, your body becomes very unhealthy and will most likely lead to health issues. When people are on the computer, they end up ignoring nature. They miss out on being in the wonderful warmth of the @CAPS3 @CAPS4, or going out and playing in the snow and making @CAPS5, forts, or having a @CAPS6 fight. They even miss out on just going outside and taking a walk. The reason is because they are cooped up inside their house with their face glued to the computer. Being on the computer takes a lot out on the body. It can cause health problems and even problems in general. So people should just spend a part of their day on the computer. The other part of the day, they should be outside, walking around, maybe playing with pets, children, or friends. As long as they're out of their chair and not on the computer and getting some exercise. In conclusion, we should balance our computer use with outdoor activities to maintain our physical and mental well - being.
759	761	1	3	"Dear local newspaper, Computers are a useful tool when doing a school report or something to that effect. But, do we really need those computers? When using a computer for a school project, it can be a hassle. One of many problems people are faced with while using a computer is freezing. When doing a project and your computer freezes, it can be very time - consuming. Another problem is pop - ups. Pop - ups can cause viruses, and when your computer gets a virus, it leads to becoming very slow. Which leads us to our next problem, slowness. When a computer becomes slow, it is very frustrating. There are several problems and risks that come with a computer. One health problem is that you can become a hermit and stay inside all day because you're too attached to the computer. Another problem is that you can become very obese because you're not getting any physical exercise. One risk of using a computer is that you could end up getting a Facebook, @CAPS1, or MySpace, and meeting someone who is pretending to be someone they're not and get abducted by a molester! There are other alternatives you could make instead of using a computer. One alternative is that you could go to the local library and check out books on your topic that you're wanting information on. Another alternative is to ask a teacher if she/he could lend you a class textbook. But the main alternative is to choose old - fashioned books over computers! So now it's your choice. ""Do we really need computers, or can we live without them?"" It's your decision. In conclusion, weighing the problems and alternatives, it's evident that we should carefully consider our reliance on computers."
760	762	1	3	Computers. They are an amazing marvel of science that greatly benefits mankind today. But computers can be good or bad depending on how you use them. Homework can be made easier, connecting with others is easier, and entertainment like @CAPS1 and video games are a click away. On the other hand, computers can be distracting, addicting, and tiring. It is important to know the pros and cons of computers. For example, the search engine, @ORGANIZATION1, is an easy - to - use website that can be very helpful. If there is a concept or problem that you are having trouble with, just type it into @ORGANIZATION1, and links to websites pop up that will help answer anything that you would like to know. There is also a website called @LOCATION1. This website is an all - purpose dictionary, @CAPS2, encyclopedia, and translator. I even have an application for it on my cellphone. But technology can also be distracting. Social networking websites, like Facebook, game websites like @CAPS3, and also websites like @CAPS4 can be very tempting and distracting when you should be doing homework. Procrastination is very easy to give into. But self - control is the only way to avoid this problem. Budgeting your time so that you can do both your homework and go on the computer is also very important. One thing that I find very useful on computers is an online textbook. We are lucky enough today that most large books can be formatted onto a computer. Instead of carrying a @NUM1 - pound textbook, you can just use a @NUM1 megabyte book on the internet. This makes travel to and from school much easier. That, and textbooks often use up a lot of desk space, but all you need is the space that a computer will consume anyway. Studying is also made easier this way. All of the things that a computer can do are great. But this can also keep us from going outside, exercising, and seeing real people in real life. This need for the computer can be bad. We are too connected as a society. Our status, feelings, friends, and position in life are always needing to be updated. Distractions are everywhere. Facebook, for instance, is very addicting. You are looking at a virtual landscape. Self - control really is the only way to get off the computer and step into the real world. Overall, computers are great, but you have to know when, and how long to use it. It has several benefits such as entertainment, communication, and information. But all of these things can be just as distracting as they can be helpful. Knowing this, I hope that society can think of the pros and cons of the computer. In conclusion, while computers offer numerous advantages, we must exercise self - control and make informed decisions about our computer usage to ensure a balanced and healthy lifestyle.
761	763	1	3	To the Local Newspaper, Computers have a heavy impact on today's society. People depend on them a great deal, yet some of the same people disagree. I firmly believe that computers have a positive effect on people. Computers are highly entertaining. They can assist in finding long - lost friends and help maintain regular contact with them. Moreover, they can be extremely useful for homework. Please continue reading to understand the reasons I've chosen. Firstly, computers can entertain. There are literally thousands of games to choose from, ranging from dress - up games to educational ones. These educational games are excellent for young children aged five through six, as the writing prompt states that they teach hand - eye coordination. In addition to my first reason, computers help in reconnecting with long - lost friends. There are numerous websites that facilitate finding people, for example, @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and Yahoo. These websites also enable us to stay in touch with family. When there's no phone available, the computer is always an option. Lastly, computers can be very helpful with homework. Sometimes, you don't even need the internet as there's a calculator built right in! A nationwide website that is widely used and helps children improve is edhelper.com. This website provides worksheets and tailors the content according to the child's level. In conclusion, I am convinced that computers do have a good impact on people. They are entertaining, help in keeping in touch, and are useful for homework. I sincerely hope you will take my reasons into consideration.
762	764	1	3	Dear local Newspaper, To my understanding, computers have been exerting a bad effect on people of all ages. In my opinion, spending all day on the computer can cause one to miss out on valuable outdoor activities. Think about it, if you sit on a chair all day, what will happen? You will become less active. From past experiences, I've learned that once you get interested in a computer game, it can become highly addicting. Computers have negative effects on people of all ages, and I think we should pause and reflect on our actions. Most likely, if you stay on the computer all day, you will indeed miss out on activities such as sports. For example, @PERCENT1 of Americans play soccer. During the beautiful fall when the leaves are changing so beautifully, you'll miss out on playing soccer and enjoying the beauty of the leaves because of the computer you can't take your eyes off. Another breathtaking adventure that you might miss out on is hiking. Hiking can be truly amazing when you reach the top and see houses with people (couch potatoes) sitting inside on the computer. Simple activities can be lost due to an addicting game you consider fun. The computer is a cause - and - effect situation. You might think you're just playing Farm Town or chatting on Facebook, but in the future, you'll be missing out on the beauty of nature and sports. To connect, missing out on sports because of the computer can cause you to become overweight. A recent study showed that @PERCENT2 of children are obese because of computer games. You might be wondering how, but I have a friend named @PERSON1. He used to love playing outside and sports until the computer came into the picture. Now he weighs @NUM1 pounds and he's only @NUM2. Honestly, sitting in a chair all day will make you less active and lead to weight gain. Do you want this to happen to you? Help me tell others how computers cause a negative effect on people. Lastly, playing on the computer or chatting with friends on @ORGANIZATION1 can cause you to procrastinate. For example, if you're talking to your girlfriend in Spain who's in college, I guarantee you'll put off school work, assignments and other tasks that need to be done. In the end, it will be time for bed and you'll have accomplished nothing, whether it was because you were trying to reach level @NUM3 or talking with your girlfriend. If you're not yet convinced, a recent scientific study reported that spending six hours on the computer per day for one week can damage your vision from @NUM4 @NUM4 to @NUM6 @NUM6. If you continue like this, it might not seem bad now, but @NUM8 hours looking at the computer can harm your eyes. Would you rather be blind or avoid using the computer to prevent such consequences? All in all, the computer, despite being a useful piece of technology, can cause you to miss out on events like sports, lead to weight gain as you're not active, and damage your eyesight and cause procrastination. Help me spread the word about how computers have a negative effect on others.
763	765	1	3	"Dear editor, I believe that people should have computers. The reasons are that it doesn't take @NUM1 days to send an email. You can learn about far - away places, and you can also talk to people around the world. After considering these details, most people are likely to agree. Firstly, emailing is extremely fast. You can send an email to someone, and it only takes five seconds to reach the other person. In contrast, regular mail takes @NUM1 day to a week to be delivered. When you email someone and they reply, it also saves the government money. Email is much faster than what I like to call ""snail mail"". Another reason is that you can learn about different countries, both far and near, from the comfort of your living room. Could you learn about @LOCATION1 without a computer? No, you couldn't. Without computers, would you be able to learn about the earthquake in Chile? No, you wouldn't. Computers are like a modern - day television for kids. Lastly, there are many ways to talk to people on the computer, such as on Facebook, MySpace, AIM, and through video chat. You don't have to call someone on the @CAPS1 when you can simply video - chat with them. In conclusion, computers are great. You can send emails quickly, learn about foreign countries in your living room, and chat with people online. I firmly believe that computers are beneficial. What's your opinion?"
764	766	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, Have you ever used a computer for something other than business? Well, if not, when you're not busy, you should give it a try. The effects computers have on people are that it's a lot of fun to use and play on, it's helpful for almost anything, and you can find just about anything on websites, from clothing to maps of store locations. There are three reasons why you should agree with me. Firstly, people have the right to choose what they want to do because the government can't make decisions for us as they're occupied with other more important matters. Moreover, the constitution states that the government can't choose for us while we have the power to think. Secondly, in this cold weather, it's not ideal to go out and enjoy nature. Nature is much more beautiful in the @DATE1 and the @DATE2 when it's neither too hot nor too cold, and the sun is just right. That's when people should enjoy the outdoors. With all the technology in today's world, it's wise to take advantage of it. For example, technology like generators is helping people, which was not available in old times. Lastly, people can interact with friends and family online on various websites. So, I hope this letter has changed your opinion, and thank you for taking the time to read it.
765	767	1	3	Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, In my opinion, computers are used constantly. People use them to communicate with friends and family online. They also use computers for homework. And the last reason I say computers are used is for fun games. I use the computer to check how @CAPS2 teams are performing. Now, let's delve deeper. Computers are good for society as people can talk to friends and family on @CAPS3, @CAPS4, and @CAPS5. This is a great reason because we all have family, and it's a good way to stay in touch with them. For friends, it's also useful, especially if they move away. However, the downside is that some older men can misuse the computer for child pornography and have inappropriate conversations with younger girls, which is completely wrong. Now, regarding using computers for homework. Computers are beneficial because people can utilize them for their schoolwork. If you need to research something in history, the computer has all the information you need. Everything you require is available on a computer. Now, more about how computers are good for society. Another reason is that computers are great for fun activities. They can have every game you can imagine, including kid games. My @NUM1 - year - old sister loves playing matching games on the computer. Teenagers can also play various games. For me, the computer is great as I can check how @CAPS2 football team is doing and how @CAPS2 @CAPS7 are faring. These are my opinions. Computers are used all the time. People use them to talk to friends and family online, for homework, and for fun games for kids. Also, I can keep track of how @CAPS2 teams are performing. In conclusion, despite the drawbacks, computers have multiple useful aspects that make them an important part of our lives.
766	768	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I strongly suggest that people should spend more time away from the computer. Instead, they should be engaging in more exercise, participating in more outdoor activities, and most importantly, spending more quality time with family and friends. I think the best way to get everyone to agree with me is to write a passage to explain why I believe that people should spend more time away from the computer. The most crucial reason why people should stop wasting time on the computer is so that they can get more exercise. Getting more exercise can benefit you greatly because the less exercise you get, the less healthy you become. More exercise can also be helpful as it can prevent you from getting diabetes, and a lot of people develop diabetes due to being out of shape. My last reason for saying that getting more exercise is good for you is that if you get more exercise, you won't have to worry about all the diseases and problems when you're in your elder ages. Another way you could spend your time instead of staying on the computer is by taking part in outdoor activities. Outdoor activities can be really beneficial for you because if you're not used to going outside and playing a nice game of football with your friends, it would be extremely enjoyable. I remember one time when I first started going outside; I had so much fun. My last reason for saying that more people should spend time doing more outdoor activities is because of nature. It would be really good for you to go for a walk on a nice @DATE1 day to feel the gentle breeze and smell all the lovely scents. My last reason for saying that you should spend more time off of the computer is so that you can spend more time with your family. Spending time with family is far more important than going on the computer with friends. I remember one time when my cousin and I were at his house, and we didn't really know each other well, but I got to spend more time with him, and now we know a great deal about each other. My last reason for saying that you should spend more time with your family is that you can learn a lot about your family. So now you know the three reasons why I say you could be doing more things instead of spending time on the computer, which are exercising, doing outdoor activities, and spending time with your family. In conclusion, by reducing computer time and focusing on these activities, we can lead healthier, more fulfilling lives.
767	769	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1 newspaper, I firmly believe that computers do have positive benefits on society. These advancements in technology can only enhance people's lives. One way computers help is that students can complete their schoolwork online and access their teachers' pages. Another great aspect of computers is that whenever people need information or details about any place or thing, they can rely on the internet to assist them. Most importantly, they are a vital source of communication. People depend on computers for their scheduling and for staying in touch with everyone they know. Without computers, students would face a lot more difficulties. When a student forgets their homework, they can simply go on their teacher's online page and check what the assignment was for that night. Another advantage for students is online textbooks. If a student can't manage to carry home @NUM1 pounds of books, they can just use their textbook online. Nowadays, the internet is filled with a plethora of great information and educational sites. Teachers can also allow students to conduct research for projects online and participate in online educational activities. Not only do computers help educationally, but they are probably the most well - known information centers. If people want to learn about a restaurant, store, or product, they can do so online. Also, many people want to go to destinations but don't know how to get there. The internet provides them with directions on how to reach their destination quickly and efficiently. An extremely important and useful aspect of the internet is the ability to purchase and order items online. Before someone decides to buy something, they can find out all sorts of information about the product and compare prices to get the lowest one. People can even order groceries to their new house if they're busy! I strongly think that the internet is the number one way of communication between people. For example, the team manager of my soccer team always emails me the times and locations of the next game or practice. I would be lost and confused without these emails that I depend on. Businesses also heavily rely on the internet to keep in touch with their clients, which is essential for their business. The use of web conferences saves a lot of travel and allows the company to do business all over the world. Above all, people depend heavily on social networking sites to stay in touch with friends, keep up - to - date on the news, and have fun chatting with others. Without the internet, probably half of the world's communications would be disrupted, and that would be a significant problem. Computers, without a doubt, have a positive effect on society. When it serves as an educational resource, it is very helpful. Also, it is the best information database known, and it is probably the most widely used. In conclusion, computers play an indispensable role in modern society, contributing to education, information access, and communication.
768	770	1	3	Dear Readers, I understand some people are concerned that people spend too much time on the computer and that it is bad. I disagree. Computers can help keep family members who live far away in touch. You can also view pictures of things that you can't see every day. Finally, it aids your schoolwork. I know a family that has a son fighting in the @LOCATION1. He brought his laptop with him so he was able to video - chat with his family. It seemed as though he never left. Without it, his family would constantly wonder how he was and be extremely worried. You don't have to have a family member at war to talk to them on the computer. Have you ever wanted to see what @LOCATION2 looks like? You don't have to travel there to find out. All you have to do is search it on your computer! If you live in a city with not much nature, you can see what it's like outside the city using the computer. Seeing those sights @MONTH1 might inspire you to travel, and traveling with your family brings you closer. A study shows @PERCENT1 of families that go on vacations have strong relationships. Having a computer is essential for school. It is the best tool for research. @PERCENT2 of students who are failing don't use a computer for homework. There are also websites that you can use for studying. There is a student in my school who failed most of his classes. He never used a computer. His friend suggested using one at home if he was having trouble, and he decided to try. He used a computer to help study for a test he had the next day. He ended up getting a @PERCENT1 on the test because he used a computer. Whether you're using a computer for homework, talking with friends and family, it is one of the most important inventions ever made. In conclusion, computers offer numerous benefits in maintaining relationships, providing access to information, and supporting education, making them a valuable part of our lives.
769	771	1	3	Computers are very important. I don't know anyone who doesn't need one. But some people say that it distracts you from exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. Do I agree? No, I disagree with this view because computers are a modern - day technology that people use. They say it distracts you from interacting with family and friends, but a computer is the number one way to talk to long - distance friends and family. @CAPS1, without a computer, how would those people who work for a business carry out their work? And lastly, we always need a computer for research. A computer attracts a lot of teenagers. Most of the sites we use are for interacting with family and friends. The two main sites people use are MySpace and Facebook. Everyone must know these two sites. Nine out of ten people use them to interact. Just think, if we didn't have a computer, we wouldn't be able to interact with our long - distance friends and family. My aunt has a Facebook account, and her friends live in @CAPS2. They @CAPS1 have phones, but computers have webcams so you can see the person too. Business people need computers a great deal. Of course, mobile computers, which is why they have laptops. But as I was saying, what would people do without a computer for work? They have your schedules, the notifications your boss sent out, and much more. During the weeks, most people work, and on the weekends, we can go visit our family members. There are mostly days in a week, and a job pays, of course. You need a computer. Google is the number one searching website we have. If you want to know what time a movie starts, most likely you will search on the computer. If you have a research paper due, of course, you will use the computer. We need the computer for everything. If I were to ask my dad what the square root of pi is, he would tell me to Google it. This is one of the main things people do when they use a computer to research. So, if you, yeah, I said you, think a computer is a waste of time, think again because it helps you to communicate with your friends. A lot of business people need it to work, and lastly, it is a good research engine. But here is a little advice: don't spend all day on the computer. Pick up your walking shoes to get some fresh air. You've spent all day on the computer; just go out and enjoy yourself in any way possible. In conclusion, while computers are highly useful, we should also find a balance and not let them completely take over our lives.
770	772	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 computers hold exclusive information, but I do not believe they have a good effect on people. The majority of students today crowd around a computer when they could be taking care of their bodies, such as exercising or simply going outside. People need to enjoy the wonders of nature instead of sitting on a computer. Not only will computers impact individuals, but they @MONTH1 will also impact family and friends. There will be less interaction time at risk by going on a computer. Different websites can expose the wrong things and get you into trouble. I firmly believe that computers have harmful effects on people. In @LOCATION1 today, we already have a large number of obese people. @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people are not physically healthy, and a majority of obese people today state that they do own a computer. Computers attract people, and the same people @MONTH1 sit at the computer for hours at a time. What about exercising or enjoying the outdoors? Computers damage our bodies by luring us in while we could go out and enjoy nature. I definitely will argue this fact that computers have a bad effect on humans. Computers change not only the body but also the mind. My sister has a computer in her bedroom, and I barely see her at all. She stays up there all the time, and when my mom calls for dinner, it takes more than five @CAPS2 to get her away from her computer. Computers affect people because they keep humans away from civilization. Friends and family are impacted by the lack of interaction from one person. It's disrespectful to take time away from your friends to play on computers. This ruins many people's social health because the more they ignore their family or friends, these people will stop trying to interact with them. When these computer enthusiasts come around, there won't be anyone there for them. Computers definitely have an unhealthy effect on people who use them. How would you feel if tons of your personal info got out into the public? Nowadays, computers have a major chance to do that to you. Websites like @CAPS4, MySpace, or Twitter have your information, and with a click of a button, it can be exposed to the world. Computers have a history of doing this kind of effect on people. Some don't understand what they are doing, and if bad info or a picture gets sent out, it can fully negatively impact your career or education. Computers lead people to make wrong choices, and there is no doubt that people should reduce the time they spend on the internet. Many agree that computers disadvantage many people in their own way. Whether it is by taking their health away because it keeps many indoors, or if it costs you your friends and family, computers are not good for your physical and social health. In conclusion, it's clear that the negative impacts of excessive computer use on our health and relationships should prompt us to be more mindful of our computer habits.
771	773	1	3	The effects of computers on people are that adults and kids are getting far more attention from them than they need to. The first reason for this is that most individuals spend a significant amount of their time on social networking platforms. Others are either engaged in online shopping or playing various games. Some of the people glued to their computers are wasting an excessive amount of time being overly tech - savvy. There are other productive ways people can spend their time, such as going for a bike ride or taking a brisk walk. Another solution is to enhance one's learning skills or look for a job in the local town. Computers drain and waste people's minds on a daily basis. I think it is essential for those who can't get off the computer to seek both physical fitness and mental health. However, there could be legitimate reasons for spending as much time as one wants on the computer. The people who abuse the access to their computers too much should think about it and find something else to do. I think it'll be a good idea to have a specific time when the computers should be shut off, either for a day or a week. By that, I mean the cable/internet company should turn off the internet and the cable for a week dedicated to pure exercise. That'll make lazy people become more active. It'll also serve as a good motivator for those who spend too much time on the computer or watching TV. Then it would make everybody fit and healthy if they give it a try. I understand that the elderly or senior citizens who need their computers for health - related assistance. That's understandable, but everyone else should not be exempt. Computers and laptops should be network - disconnected to make people get up and do something helpful or brain - building. Every day, people are being digitally sucked in. Some people in this world just can't get enough of it, and this situation needs to end soon. The government should make a legal law that requires people to do something that will actively benefit them. It should be a person from the state or a local townsperson who visits every house. Another way that could be done is by having one person from each street in the state go door - to - door to ensure the procedure is being followed. A lot of people are not going to like it, and they will not obey the new law. There should be a penalty for anyone that fails to abide by it. The second option could be a loss of internet services. That'll make them really angry, and in exchange, they should still exercise. Sometimes it takes strict laws to make somebody change, and implementing such regulations regarding computer usage could lead to a healthier and more productive society.
772	774	1	3	Did you know that computers are the number @NUM1 selling electronic device in the world? I firmly believe that computers are only making our society a smarter and more intelligent place. Also, computers play a crucial role in helping old - time friends and family members keep in touch. Finally, I think they are benefiting our society because computers teach excellent hand - eye coordination. Studies have shown that @PERCENT1 of the people growing up with computers at home have a high - paying job! Computers are very intelligent pieces of equipment, and if you know how to use a computer, you will most likely have a high - paying career. In fact, mostly every job, from a doctor to a police officer to a cashier at a store, all involve computers, and to pursue those jobs, you must know how to work a computer. This is just one of the many reasons I think computers will benefit our society. Secondly, I think that this price of technology benefits society because it keeps family, friends, and workers in touch. Have you ever had a moment where you look back and wish you could see your old high - school friends or even family members living far away? Well, computers are one of the most popular ways to do so. With all the new websites like @CAPS2, Twitter, or even your old email website, people are keeping in touch all over the world. Another way computers help old - time friends keep in touch is through the new video camera in the computer. Family, friends, and workers can actually see each other from different parts of the world. A simple message through one of these websites can make someone's day and could even brighten yours. Finally, I think that computers benefit our society because they teach hand - eye coordination and other life skills. How do you think people can shoot a gun so accurately and quickly, or how do you think a baseball player can swing at such a perfect time? All these things revolve around hand - eye coordination, which is best learned by using computers. Also, people can save lives by simply typing about a hurricane, tornado, or anything else. But if they do not know how to work a computer, many people can get injured or die. These are only three of the many reasons I think computers benefit our society. So, think twice about the negative comments people say about computers, as their positive impacts on our lives and society are undeniable.
773	775	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, the fact that @CAPS1 use computers is a good thing. I state this because the web offers a plethora of activities. For example, Facebook, Twitter, and MySpace are all well - known social sites. Also, there are popular video sites such as YouTube. Plus, @CAPS1 can learn to type fast. Social network sites are extremely beneficial for @CAPS1. Teens can talk to each other, make new friends, and post whatever they want. For instance, on Twitter, you can post short tweets, on Facebook, you can join groups and become a fan of something or someone, and on MySpace, you can send private messages. Teens can relieve a lot of stress on the web. When you're bored, video sites are great. Just type in YouTube and you're likely to get a good laugh or two. Teens who use YouTube become more social. For example, they can learn the latest dance trends. Additionally, there is a lot of comedy content on video sites. Comedy has a positive impact on daily life. @CAPS2 is very useful if you work in an office or in a trademark - related field. Teens learn to type to make their lives easier. For example, typing fast is similar to texting. @CAPS2 is like writing a letter electronically, but much quicker and more convenient. So, encourage @CAPS1 to get to @CAPS2. Ok, so computers definitely help during the teen years. Basically, it is @CAPS3 to some extent. All people should have a computer. Just remember that social sites, video sites, and @CAPS2 contribute to making life better, and by leveraging these digital resources, teens can enhance their social skills, knowledge, and overall well - being.
774	776	1	3	Yes, I do think that we should continue using computers because it helps us stay in contact with other countries around the world, it forms a balance, and it also makes life simpler. First of all, computers are indispensable in helping us stay in contact with other countries around the world. Without computers, we would not be able to @CAPS1 or even video - message other countries about important events. In today's globalized world, timely communication with other nations is crucial for various aspects such as business, diplomacy, and cultural exchange. Second, we have to strike a balance between using computers and engaging in physical exercise and face - to - face interaction. While we shouldn't just sit on the computer all day, computers can help us interact with family and friends. By emailing or video - chatting, we can stay in close contact even when we're far apart. This form of communication is especially important for maintaining relationships. Last, using computers makes life simpler. For example, it's so much easier to write an @CAPS1 rather than a traditional letter, and it's more convenient to instant - message someone than to make a phone call. Also, for school projects, you can make your project look much better by adding pictures and different fonts, which is far more appealing than just hand - writing it. That's why computers aren't a waste of time because they help us stay in contact with other countries, they help us form a balance in our lives, and they also make life simpler. By continuing to use computers in a balanced way, we can fully enjoy the numerous benefits they offer and contribute to a more connected and efficient world.
775	777	1	3	Dear @LOCATION1, Computers are an absolute necessity in life. They benefit not only the local community but the whole world! They provide education for anyone who has access to the internet. Secondly, they serve as a powerful form of communication. Also, computers can be a great source of fun and entertainment. As you know, education is one of the most important aspects of anyone's life. Where would we be without a computer to assist us? Think about how many times you've used @ORGANIZATION2 or @CAPS1 to search for information on something you didn't know the answer to. It's a significant number, right? I conduct research every time a random question pops into my head. Imagine how difficult it would be without a computer to rely on when you're completely clueless about how to answer something. Another aspect is that there are now online courses available for students. Some college students have to look up their assignments and learn how to complete them on their professors' web pages. Also, how would students around the world know what their homework is if they can't check the @PERSON1 homepage? I check it almost every day when I come home from school. It's great that the teachers take the time to post the homework. Without computers, we'd have a higher percentage of students not doing their homework. @NUM1 out of every @NUM2 people in @LOCATION2 has some form of online communication program. Whether it's @ORGANIZATION3 @CAPS2 or @CAPS3, maybe even YouTube, or just a simple e - mail, practically everyone has one. How else are you supposed to talk to your friends after school? Do you expect us to call them? Then we would be on the phone for hours! Anybody with a teen at home is well - aware of this. Also, computers are a boon for deaf people to communicate. They simply type in what they want to say, and the message is conveyed. I remember when a lady who was blind and deaf came to our school and demonstrated how to use that special program. Another reason is that teachers and parents use e - mail to discuss academics and the progress of their children. Clearly, communication is an essential part of life, and computers play a vital role in facilitating it. Therefore, computers are a great benefit to society. There is no way that anybody over the age of @NUM3 has never played a computer game at some point in their life, except, of course, if they don't have internet access. I used to play computer games, but they started to slow down my computer, so my dad told me I had to stop, or I couldn't use the computer anymore. Oops! Still, you can use the computer to look up cheats on video games. Oh, come on, like you haven't done that! Or at least your children have. Also, you can use specific programs like @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS4 or @CAPS5 @CAPS6 to create an eye - catching cover page for a project or a professional presentation for your corporate business. In other words, computers are a source of pleasure. As you can see, computers are extremely educational, providing search engines to find answers to any question we may have, whether it's about foreign places or movies. They also enable seamless communication, allowing us to stay in touch with friends, family, and colleagues around the world. Finally, they offer entertainment and useful tools for various tasks. In conclusion, computers are an integral part of modern society, and their benefits far outweigh any minor drawbacks, making them an indispensable asset for people of all ages and backgrounds.
776	778	1	3	"Dear Local Newspaper, I don't know if I am understanding correctly, but are you honestly thinking about not advancing technology? Quickly rethink that because that @MONTH1 just be the worst mistake you could ever make. Computers can teach hand - eye coordination, and they can also give you very useful knowledge. Lastly, computers help us stay close to our family and friends. First off, about @PERCENT1 of people say that they use the computer every day so that they can increase their knowledge. This could be as simple as going on @ORGANIZATION1! and discovering the latest news. This is ten times easier than going on the @CAPS1 and waiting for the news story you want details on. I took a survey, and @NUM1 students say that they use their computer every night so that they can read more into their social studies or science unit. @CAPS2 computer advances away is like @CAPS2 learning advances away. Now, is that what you want? Second, @PERSON1, a children's doctor, states, ""Computers give children that hand - eye coordination they need to enhance in sports."" I wholeheartedly agree! Sports such as baseball, soccer, and basketball all need a great deal of hand - eye coordination. Without the hand - eye coordination, students will not do well and may end up quitting. I know that if I was having trouble with sports for a long time, I would give up! If the teens gave up sports, then they wouldn't have anything to keep them fit. That would lead to hundreds of kids with an obesity problem. Lastly, @CAPS2 away the advancing in computers means that you are @CAPS2 away family and friends connections. Computers offer many sites such as Facebook or MySpace to connect with loved ones. You can also go on @CAPS3 or Skype to chat or video - chat with them. Yes, maybe computers are @CAPS2 away time with family, but what about @CAPS4 or @CAPS5 in @LOCATION1 that you haven't seen in over a year? Don't you want some time with them too? You can make time limits for yourself so that you don't spend your whole time on the computer. This way, you can talk to all of your loved ones. Would you want to be the one crushing the hopes of a child that wants to talk/see his grandparents? In conclusion, I remember talking and laughing with my friends over the computer when I was sick so that they could cheer me up. Don't take that away from me! Keep enhancing computers so that I can advance my knowledge, increase my hand - eye coordination, and get to see my far - away friends and family."
777	779	1	3	Dear local newspaper, Too much technology! Computers have a negative effect on people. First, our country needs to exercise more, and not just sit around. Second, we aren't spending enough time caring for our environment. And third, we are losing the ability to communicate with the people around us. Our country has problems with being overweight. Most people blame it on fast food, but it's also because people sit around using computers, and don't think about staying in proper shape. Before computers were made, people were much more fit and healthy. We need to help our country get back in shape, and take our attention away from the computer, for even just a short while, and we need to exercise regularly. For instance, going for a brisk walk in the park or cycling around the neighborhood can make a big difference. The next reason is that computers don't just have a bad effect on people, but our environment too. We spend too much time indoors with technology, and we don't even care about the world around us. Before much technology, people used to plant gardens, and trees, but now that thought hardly crosses our minds. All the electronics these days are making people forget about nature, and that needs to change. We could start by organizing community clean - up events or tree - planting initiatives. The last reason computers have a negative effect is that people don't communicate as well anymore with the people around them. If we communicate so much with people through technology, we are losing the ability to speak and communicate in person, and it ruins relationships and connections between people, like family and friends. So we need to start caring about the people around us, and not always rely on technology. We can have family dinners without any electronic devices or meet up with friends for a coffee. In conclusion, you can see the negative effect computers have on people. We need to exercise more. Also, we need to help our environment. And lastly, we need to communicate better with friends and family. We shouldn't get rid of computers, but just step away and care about the world around you.
778	780	1	3	More and more people are using computers on a daily basis, but I do not agree that this benefits our society. People are spending too much time on computers and less time exercising and staying healthy. Also, people using computers are spending less time with family and friends. As people use computers more, they are spending less time exercising and staying healthy. Professor @PERSON1 has done a study showing that people who are on the computer for more than @NUM1 hrs a day are overweight and do not exercise regularly. He goes on to state that if these habits continue throughout their lives, they will become obese and are more likely to die from a heart attack before age @NUM2. I have experienced changes in my community's health due to computers as well. Last year, I had a friend who weighed @NUM3 lbs and exercised regularly. But when he got a computer that following year, he stopped exercising and gained over @NUM4 lbs. He now is much slower and can not do more than a few push - ups. I do not agree that computers are benefiting our society because as people use computers more, they exercise less, causing them to be unhealthy. Not only do computers lead to an unhealthy lifestyle, it also causes people to spend less time with family and friends. Studies show that @PERCENT1 of children who own a computer spend less time with their family and more time on the computer. This @MONTH1 not seem like a big thing at first, but this study also shows that @PERCENT2 of children who spend less time with their families grow up to become lonely and may even kill themselves due to depression. I remember when a new student came to our school. He wasn't that popular and didn't have many friends, but he was still having fun. When he came back the next year, he started using the computer a lot. I found out he had isolated himself at the end of the school year and didn't keep in touch with any of his friends and hardly talked to his parents. So far that week, he was apart from the rest of the students and didn't interact much. Then, when we got back on @DATE1, he wasn't at school, and for the rest of the week, he didn't show up either. Finally, on @DATE2, the teachers told us he ran away from home and has still not been found. So people that use computers are spending less time with their family and friends, which can cause them to become depressed and lonely. More and more people are using computers on a daily basis, but I do not agree that this is benefiting our society. People are spending too much time on their computers and are spending less time exercising and staying healthy. Also, people using computers are spending less time with their family and friends. I know that the more people use computers, it is not better for our society; it is worse. We need to find a balance to ensure our well - being.
779	781	1	3	"Dear @PERSON1, the editor of the @LOCATION1 citizen, @CAPS1 has been brought to my attention from some people around @LOCATION1 that computers and technology are bad for us. I have also heard that some people believe in the technology. So, the reason why I'm writing today about this issue is to put my beliefs out there. I believe that this new technology is affecting our daily exercising, playing outside to enjoy nature, and interacting with friends and family. Now that we have new technology with computers and such, people are easily distracted and do not want to exercise. This will have a detrimental effect on our youth because we will be fat, unhealthy, and sluggish all the time. @PERSON1, we don't want this to happen to our youth because we are the future, and if this keeps up, the state and country will suffer. Another reason is that it's good to exercise and not be on the computer or watching @CAPS2 all the time. @CAPS1 has been proven that people have more energy and will feel happier most of the time when they exercise. Computers do not do that for us at all. A poll even says that @PERCENT1 of people get headaches and feel tired after being on the computer for a while. Exercise won't do that at all. Since all of our new technology with @CAPS2 and other gadgets, people really don't go outside to play around and enjoy nature anymore. I was asking my mother about this topic, and she said, ""@CAPS4 these days just don't go outside anymore. I remember when I was your age, and my mother would kick me outside at @NUM1 am, and I wouldn't be back home until around @NUM2 pm."" I believe that this should still happen. Maybe parents should still do this with their @CAPS4 and have them run around the neighborhood with other @CAPS4. If we did this more often, maybe @CAPS4 and adults too will just do this naturally and will not have to rely on computers or @CAPS5 for entertainment. Don't you think this is a good idea, @PERSON1? My last topic is about computers and cellphones and how we really don't interact with friends and family anymore. Nowadays, friends AIM, video - chat, or text each other instead of going out and doing something with them. This isn't really healthy for us because we might not know how to talk to people in real life. Also, if someone AIMs or texts you, you really don't know how their tone is because you are not talking to them face - to - face. Lastly, I know families that get hurt by technology because that is all they do. They don't put down their devices, get off their emails, and they feel like they don't see each other. This is also not a healthy relationship with family members. @PERSON1, I really hope I have persuaded you that technology is only okay to use sometimes and not every day. Remember, technology is bad because we don't exercise, play outside and enjoy nature, and really don't interact with friends and family members. Thank you for your time. We should strive to find a balance between technology use and a healthy, social lifestyle."
780	782	1	3	Dear, I think computers greatly benefit society and advance technology. They provide knowledge in a click and entertainment after a long day at work or school. Not only that, but people have found long - lasting careers because of the invention of the computer. So obviously, computers are a great influence on society. Do you want to find out when Major League Baseball first came to be? Or maybe you have a history report due the next day, and your parents can't @CAPS3 drive you to the library? This isn't a problem anymore. Computers have evolved a long way since they were invented in the @NUM1's. You can check up on your local news by having @NUM2's of electronic newspapers right at your fingertips. Or maybe you want to venture outside your neighborhood and check out what's happening in @LOCATION2 or @LOCATION1. News isn't the only thing the internet is useful for though. You can also go onto one of the @DATE1's of websites for school help, or check how the stock market is doing. Or, you can just use the handy calculator found right on your desktop. What could be better? Of course, not all users have a computer for information. Many have it for entertainment purposes. In fact, @PERCENT1 of people use the computer for entertainment every day. What, with all the fun stuff you can do, who can blame them? Social networking is placed at the top of the list. A whopping @PERCENT2 of internet users use sites like @CAPS1 or @CAPS2. These sites are useful for catching up with friends you might not have seen in years or continuing a conversation from @NUM3 minutes ago. You can also use computers to watch live - streaming @CAPS3.V or that new @CAPS4 you got yesterday. That's right, @CAPS3.V's might not be needed soon! And what would a computer be without games? There are @NUM2's of @DATE1's of them scattered all across the web. How great is that? And finally, many people have found their careers through the internet. Did you know that @PERSON1, @NUM5, was discovered through YouTube when his mom posted videos for the family to see when they couldn't @CAPS3 attend performances? Of course, YouTube isn't the only way to make money. Tons of jobs are listed by employers only for the curious person to find. No more wandering city streets; now you can just submit an application or have an interview without ever leaving your home. Artists have also discovered talents by playing around with @CAPS6 or @CAPS7. Not to mention the career paths involving computers directly, such as computer repair or movie special effects. So no matter what you use a computer for, whether it be job - hunting, entertainment, or information, they are a good idea to have in your home. There's a reason that @PERCENT3 of @CAPS8 use them, and it's not just an excuse to sit around all day. Computers truly enhance our lives in numerous ways and will continue to play a vital role in our future.
781	783	1	3	Lies! The computers we use in society do not harm us in any way! They are a huge step forward for mankind and only benefit our lives. They benefit us greatly for the following reasons: computers are a vast source of knowledge, computers can effectively aid the advertisement and business operations of many workplaces, and they are an extremely helpful and convenient way to communicate with someone just across the street or even across the ocean. Without a doubt, computers do nothing but benefit the people of our society. First of all, computers are a big source of knowledge. Many people these days want answers to a question they have encountered recently but cannot find the answers in a book or newspaper, so they turn to a computer, and immediately their problem is solved. Computers today hold every bit of information on every topic imaginable, from ancient history to modern - day politics. All one has to do is find a well - known site such as @ORGANIZATION1, type their question, and millions of answers pop up, assuring a solution to the problem. Computers can also provide a reliable place to research for a school project or gather statistics of the economy if needed by school, business, or just for personal recreation. Times are changing fast, and the sources of the world's history and school subjects can easily be found in the vast corners of the internet. What you used to have to painstakingly look for in books and papers can be easily found on the internet at the click of a button. Clearly, computers are a huge source of knowledge for our society. Second of all, computers and the internet support many businesses in advertising and making profit. Every single time a visit to the internet occurs, many different businesses are able to advertise their products and overall businesses with eye - catching pop - ups, prominent side bars, and well - designed websites. It clearly helps the workplace get the much - needed attention. Along with advertising products, businesses can even sell their products online without much hassle. This can also aid the consumer because they would not have to drive all the way down to the store and pick up what they need. All they need to do is select the items they wish to purchase and await for its arrival a few days later. Clearly, the computer and internet can help support the welfare of businesses. Finally, the computers we use today are a huge and easy way of communication. Contact with people from another street, town, state, or country can be established by the use of popular social networking sites such as, @CAPS1, @CAPS2, @CAPS3. You could send a letter - like message with the touch of a button without having to make a trip down to the post office and await a reply. An instant message, which can be used on any of the sites mentioned, can also be achieved. This is where you could write something down in the computer, send it to anyone, and receive a reply within seconds. Obviously, computers play a big role in the communication of one to another without a problem. In conclusion, it is clear computers benefit the society greatly without a side effect at all. Computers are a good source of knowledge, an aid to business, and a great way of communication. Everyone has agreed to this without hesitation, so you should too. Computers are the best things that have ever happened to our society today.
782	784	1	3	Dear local newspaper, @PERCENT1 of @CAPS1 own a computer. This clearly illustrates that computers must have a positive effect on people if most people own them. I believe computers do have a positive effect on people because it gives you the convenient ability to talk to other people online, learn about new and interesting things, and improves your hand - eye coordination. My first reason why I believe computers have a positive effect on people is because it gives you the ability to talk to other people online. Some people don't have phones but do have computers. If you needed to contact somebody urgently, you could do it using a computer. Also, some people have family and friends who live across the world. Computers are excellent for keeping in touch, and it also won't cost you a fortune for long - distance communication, like phones would. Because computers give you the ability to talk to friends, family, and other people, it is a positive thing because maintaining social connections is important. My second reason why I believe computers have a positive effect on people is because it gives you the ability to learn about new things. Learning about new things using a computer has a positive effect on people because you don't have to travel and go to libraries or other places to get information to learn about things. You can do it with a simple click of a button. People could use the computer to learn about anything or everything, from ancient civilizations to modern scientific breakthroughs. Being able to not have to leave your home to gather information about new things gives a positive effect on people because now more people will be able to learn more as they have more time than they would if they were traveling places to get information. This is a positive effect on people because the more you know, the better equipped you are for life. Having a lot of knowledge is a good thing and will open up opportunities for you in the future. My third reason why I believe computers have a positive effect on people is because it teaches people hand and eye coordination. Having good hand - eye coordination gives a positive effect on people because you're going to need it throughout life. If you don't have good hand - eye coordination, it can be a hindrance as you use it for just about everything, such as driving a car, writing neatly, and exercising properly. Computers give you the ability to learn eye and hand coordination throughout life, which is why it is a positive thing for people. I believe computers have a positive effect on people because it gives you the ability to talk online to people, learn about new things, and teaches you hand and eye coordination. I hope this letter persuades you to believe that computers do have a positive effect on people.
783	785	1	3	Can you imagine how difficult life would be without a computer? I can. I firmly believe computers are incredibly helpful. Computers help us conduct efficient research, they keep us closely connected with friends and family, and they are often required to be used at some @CAPS1. The internet is an easy and efficient way to do research. All you have to do is search what you want information on, and millions of relevant articles will be available at the click of a mouse. Using the internet on a computer is much easier than laboriously going through numerous books looking for something. That could waste a significant amount of time. The internet can quickly and directly answer your questions, saving you both time and effort. Computers are a great way to keep connected. Almost everyone has an email now. All you have to do is type a few kind words and you'll be reacquainted with an old friend. When you call someone, you can't be sure if they are busy or not. When using email, the person receiving the email can reply when they have free time. Computers are used at many @CAPS1. Sometimes you're even required to use it. Computers organize data by keeping documents in different well - structured files. Computers also have valuable programs that could help you in your career. Such as @ORGANIZATION1 word, which can assist you in writing professional - looking documents. Using a computer would aid you financially as it can help you find better job opportunities or manage your finances more effectively. Some of you might think computers have misleading information. The internet isn't always a completely honest place. However, by spending a few minutes double - checking your information on other reliable websites, you're still spending less time than it would take to find the fact in a book. The computer is one of the greatest inventions created. It makes research, connecting with friends, and your @CAPS3 incredibly easy! Use a computer @DATE1 and your life will be changed for the better. With all these benefits, it's clear that computers are an indispensable part of modern life.
784	786	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, In my opinion, spending too much time online has a negative effect on society. People aren't getting a full - fledged social experience when they talk on email, Facebook, and Twitter. Being on such sites has taken up precious time that could be spent in other important areas, such as bonding with family, having fun with friends, and focusing on school. They aren't being able to enjoy the beautiful outdoors and engage in physical exercise. Though online activity can be helpful, spending too much time can be extremely harmful. Interacting online can be a great experience for those who have friends and family who live far away. But spending too much time online can severely damage your social activity levels. In - person interaction is better than online, because you can clearly see how the person you're talking to is reacting to everything you say. Having a good, positive social environment is beneficial to you and your friends. Spending too much time on the computer can also damage your social relationship with your family. For family who live far away, and online is the only way to socialize, online interaction is a great thing to have. But for your close family members living under the same roof, you could be missing out on their daily lives and how they are truly doing. Your relationship with your family could be in jeopardy because you insist on using your computer constantly. When you use the computer, you're probably munching on some junk food too. And spending time online is taking away your time from exercising those extra calories off. The obesity level in @LOCATION1 is increasing, the probable cause being the over - usage of computers. Being outside is another thing missing from our lives because of computers. We aren't experiencing the beautiful nature life our @ORGANIZATION1 has to offer. Online activity is hurting our health, and making us not enjoy our outdoor life. In conclusion, being online too often is abusing our social, health, and taking up too much of our lives. Using the internet is good for adults so they can pay taxes, work at home, and do many other beneficial things for them and their families. But for other, less useful sites that are mainly used for casual interaction, why not just call or meet up with a person instead of using the computers? We should strive for a balanced life where we make the most of both the online and offline world.
785	787	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, First of all, I would like to say that I love your interesting stories and engaging puzzles in your paper, and I think I have a story you guys can use. It's about people who are addicted to computers. I guess you guys are wondering about what I mean by addiction to computers. Well, I'm going to give you three reasons about this. My first reason is that people aren't spending a lot of quality time with their family. I say this because most of the time, couples get into heated arguments because the person who is addicted to the internet isn't doing what he or she is supposed to do. For example, say you have a delicious turkey in the oven, and you're so engrossed in the computer that you forget all about it until the shrill fire alarm goes off. Another reason why people can be addicted to the computer is because of all the alluring online chat rooms they have. I know people who are addicted to online chat rooms, and I sometimes get really worried about them because half of the time, they don't know who they're talking to! It could be anybody, even a dangerous pedophile. My final reason is that some people just don't seem to care. Some people can be on the computer all day and night doing nothing besides mindless online chatting when they could be doing a meaningful essay or something helpful and caring. You know, I used to be addicted to the computer myself, and because of that, I almost failed all my classes. And because of that bad experience, I don't use the computer to talk aimlessly or do anything such as that. Now I just use it to read my important emails or write my academic essays. And that concludes my, or should I say, your next top story. It's high time people recognized the perils of computer addiction and took steps to break free from it.
786	788	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I firmly disagree with the perceived negative affects that computers have on kids. Computers offer kids the freedom to do what they desire, and they don't have to travel great distances to see certain things. For instance, if you wanted to see the @LOCATION1's @CAPS1, you're not going to simply book a plane and fly there when you can obtain pictures and information right on the computer within a couple of minutes. It's wonderful if you wish to see it in person, but you won't want to shell out money for plane tickets or travel really far when you can just view it from the comfort of your home. Computers are loaded with a lot of fun stuff like MySpace, @CAPS2, and games. Also, it has almost everything you can possibly think of. So, why bother traveling when you can see all of it on your computer? I think that computers can sometimes be a little addictive, but you've got to learn to stay off of them most of the time. However, it is very easy to learn new things on a computer. Computers are used by billions of people, and they are a great way to learn about our whole world and the things that exist on it. It has information websites like Google or Bing to look up anything you want. Computers are almost everywhere, in phones, i - pods, and even some are installed in cars like police cars. Computers are extremely useful to people around the world @DATE1. I bet that the people who manufacture them will create new ones that can be used on almost everything. They have computers in almost every building such as hospitals, fire stations, police stations, and electronic stores like RadioShack. You're going to learn a lot more on computers than having to travel places or relying solely on school. In my mind, we should all have computers because they're fun and you can learn about everything you could ever imagine. So, I firmly believe that computers are very useful and can teach you a great deal about the things that go on in our world today. Hence, I disagree with what scientists or people say about computers and the effects it has on certain people of @DATE1.
787	789	1	3	"Dear local newspaper, My @CAPS1 stand on this whole computers thing is that it is becoming a big issue because people are spending all their time with books instead of communicating with friends and family, exercising, or enjoying nature. Just like the expert, then - tinker, said in his book called @CAPS2 about computers, ""Too much time on the computers and not the recommended seven hours outside can make you gain weight."" @CAPS3 One of the main reasons @CAPS4 why people should get out more is that @CAPS5 they can have meaningful communication with friends and family. I bet you did not know that @PERCENT1 of kids from @NUM1 to @NUM2 are sitting on their couches or playing video games as we speak. Another @CAPS4 is that people need more exercise. More than @NUM3 of the population in the leading countries will be obese due to little exercise, and that is mostly because of computers. And the last @CAPS4, and the most important as well, is that @CAPS5 people can enjoy nature at its fullest. Believe it or not, but Jack Cup thinks @CAPS5 too. He said, '@PERCENT2 of people who enjoy nature will live @NUM4 years longer, and people now are not likely to have a heart attack in their @NUM5's"". This is why I think computers are bad for people. But it is not just me; it is @PERSON1, Jackup @CAPS6, scientists, and many others as well. In conclusion, the negative impacts of excessive computer use on people's health and social lives are evident, and we should encourage more outdoor and social activities."
788	790	1	3	Wouldn't you say that having a computer in your house is incredibly helpful? It provides a wealth of useful information to everyone. It can be used for personal use, such as having long - lasting conversations with friends. If there is a child in the house, they might have to search something up on the internet for school assignments. If you need directions to a place or you want to find out more about a specific person, a computer can be your best ally. If you have a child who likes to run up the phone bill because they like to talk to their friends, just tell them to use a computer! There are so many ways communication can be made through a computer such as @CAPS1, @CAPS2, @CAPS3, @CAPS4, @CAPS5, @CAPS6, and even email! If you need to make quick plans, maybe for a movie with a couple of friends, just send them an email or a message on @CAPS2. Now, with an @CAPS1, you can text people right from your computer! If you're afraid someone might not get the email in time, just enter their cell phone number on @CAPS1 and send a text. It's free too! Now that our world has become more technologically advanced, schools often tend to tell students to look something up on a computer or maybe to do a homework assignment posted on their webpage. If a child does not have a computer at home, this will make it extremely hard for them to do their homework. Also, if a parent decides to start a business from home, a computer would be required to calculate profits and to talk with customers. A computer can also make signs for a business or business cards. Need directions to a restaurant? Or maybe a local gym? A computer can help you find directions to almost any @CAPS10 place on earth. @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS11 is a reliable website to get directions. You can also learn about specific people if you type in their name in @ORGANIZATION1. If you need someone's phone number but don't have a phone book, you can use @CAPS12 pages to help you. So, now I hope you can clearly see that computers affect people in a positive way. They help you keep in touch with friends and save you money. They help students learn more and could possibly help you start your own business from your home. If you need directions or help finding a phone number, a computer can assist you in multiple ways. Having a computer could broaden your perspective of everything. In conclusion, computers are an indispensable part of modern life with numerous benefits.
789	791	1	3	@ORGANIZATION1, my name is @PERSON1 and I just want to tell you that we should stop over - relying on computers because we get no exercise, we barely go outside, and we don't even talk to our friends or family anymore. Local newspaper, I think that we should have computers, but many people are misusing them and not doing anything productive. Many people aren't exercising because they are constantly on Facebook or playing games. Many children aren't even going outside to see nature and play. Many families are all glued to their computers and are not spending any quality family time together, like going out to fly kites. What I'm saying is that yeah, people like computers and use them to talk to their friends and play games, but it's destroying family bonds and even the well - being of individuals. I don't think having excessive computer use is a good idea. Also, local newspaper, we need to go out and enjoy the @DATE1, but that doesn't happen because many children are on the computer. Many parents used to go hiking, camping, swimming, and do lots of other stuff, but they don't do that anymore. These people need to make a change. What I'm telling you guys is to either take the computer away or limit its use. One last thing, local newspaper, is that many kids, children, and parents need to have more real - life time. Maybe if kids and parents weren't all on the computer, they would notice someone in the family who might be sick or ill. Maybe they might go out somewhere to have a good time together, like to a lake or Six Flags. Many parents think they get on the computer because it's so fun, so they keep using it. Many people around the world would complain about this excessive computer use. So, I think everybody should be off computers for a reasonable amount of time. I think we shouldn't have a computer - dominated society because you get no exercise, you barely go outside and see nature, and you don't hang out or talk with friends and family. So, I think computers should be used in moderation, and in many cases, we should limit their use. In conclusion, we need to strike a balance between computer use and real - life activities.
790	792	1	3	Computers are good for school uses, skill development, and just for fun. Computers are a great source to have, and that is just my opinion. But, I think computers are mostly beneficial for pre - teens and teenagers. Adults mostly use them for business purposes. The fun uses that the computer provides are @CAPS1, @CAPS2, @CAPS3, etc. @CAPS1 is one of the most popular chat groups on the internet. @CAPS2 is another popular chat group. They both have some of the same characteristics, like chatting to your friends, updating your status every now and then, and uploading pictures, songs, etc. There are websites that could be used for free time, like music websites where you are allowed to watch music videos or download music onto your iPod. @CAPS3 is a website that teenagers or kids go on to watch some of their favorite music videos. iTunes is the program where you can download any song, music video, TV show, or movie onto an iPod. Computers also provide Microsoft @CAPS5, Publisher, PowerPoint, etc. All these can be used for school purposes. @CAPS5 allows you to type up anything you want for school. You can type up a @NUM1 - page essay if you wish. You can cut and paste pictures for a project you might have due. You can change the colors, font size, and font style on @CAPS5. That use could be for a design on the front of a cover page for an essay or project. Publisher can be used for projects as well. In school, if you need to make a newspaper, flyers, business cards, etc., Publisher allows you to make them. PowerPoint is a program where you can make different slides on any topic. Computers can be put to good use for many different things. If people don't agree with that, then they don't understand that computers help children and adults with everyday things. Some kids who have special needs, especially during @MONTH1, need the computer to communicate with others. Computers, I think, are a big help in the world. In conclusion, computers offer a wide range of functions that are valuable for both education and entertainment, and they play an important role in modern life.
791	793	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, I believe that computers have a very positive impact on people. In today's era, as technology continuously progresses, there are numerous educational opportunities available online. You can now interact with others without being physically present with them, and you can play games that will enhance your lives. Firstly, computers offer a wide range of educational options. Just on the internet, you can access your school textbook. Moreover, there are additional practice materials that come with the online textbook. Without having to carry your textbook home, you can view it online. There are plenty of extra practice exercises and practice quizzes in the online textbook, which are ideal for studying. Also, when you browse the internet, you can get real - time updates of major events around the world. For example, the other day I logged onto the internet and saw an in - depth article about the earthquake in @LOCATION1. I found nothing about this in the newspaper, but the internet was so up - to - date that you can stay informed about something that occurred just a few minutes ago. But if you choose not to rely on the internet, there are many programs that are extremely helpful for learning. These programs are specifically designed to develop your children's math and reading skills. They can give anyone a head - start in education. Another useful aspect on a computer is the ability to interact with other people. Video chatting, @CAPS2, and using social @CAPS3 sites are excellent ways to interact. When you video chat, you can have a face - to - face conversation with someone in your class! Even if they are not physically with you. Instant messaging is a less direct, yet still valuable way to talk to someone far away. You can share the latest news or simply have a friendly conversation with anyone you know. Lastly, social @CAPS3 sites such as Facebook and Twitter are a valuable means of communication. You can post messages, play games, or simply chat with someone on these websites. They combine the best features of online interaction. Finally, there are many online games that are very beneficial. If you've always wanted to go bowling but never had the time, you can play a bowling game online. Or if you've ever dreamt of driving a stock car, you can play a related game online. These online games provide you with the opportunity to do things you don't usually get to do. Also, many games help improve your reflexes and quick - thinking skills. These skills could potentially carry over into real - life situations where you need good reflexes and fast thinking. Games can be very useful when you need to prepare yourself for certain scenarios. Also, online games are fun and enjoyable. Overall, I believe the computer is a valuable resource in education, interacting with other people, and playing useful games. After all, who would pass up the opportunity to better prepare themselves for life?
792	794	1	3	"Do you love technology? More and more people in this world are making extensive use of technology, especially computers. But not everyone agrees that this benefits society. However, I do. Because computers can give people the ability to learn about anything they desire. They also provide a better way to communicate with others who live far away from you. My last reason is that this technology can be an effective means of protecting this country. Now, I firmly believe that computers are a useful man - made resource. When I was about @NUM1 years old, I loved playing on the computer. I initially thought it was just a game. But my dad told me not to abuse the computer and to use it for educational purposes. I then discovered that with just a click of a button, there are so many things to learn. Now you can use this technology as a practical tool rather than just a game. For instance, if you don't want to go to the library to find a book, you can simply look it up on the computer. People love to talk to others, meet new people, or just communicate with those who live in other countries. One of the best ways to do this is on the computer. I am @NUM2 years old, and I have a lot of friends who chat on the computer, and I'm one of them. My family members live in @LOCATION1, and I can't catch a plane every day to go visit them. So I just go on the computer and talk to them. It's one of the fastest and most enjoyable ways to stay in touch. The @ORGANIZATION1 has one of the strongest @ORGANIZATION2 and @ORGANIZATION3 in the world. You would be amazed at the technology they possess and how they utilize it. One of the most remarkable things they have is the ""@PERSON1."" It's a plane driven by a remote control. It's just like a fighter plane but without a pilot! The person controlling it can relax at the base while the @PERSON1 does all the work. Now come and join me in saying that computers are useful in this world! From the reasons above, I firmly state that computers are useful because they give people the ability to learn about anything they want. They offer a way to communicate effectively. And last but not least, they are a good way to protect this country. Technology is growing at an ever - increasing pace and becoming more powerful. So take my word ""don't abuse it, use it."
793	795	1	3	To whom it @MONTH1 concern: I think computers have a great impact on people. Computers are highly useful for homework. They allow you to keep in touch with out - of - state family members. You can also look up directions and information about a place. Computers are particularly handy in last - minute situations. Computers are very useful for homework because when you type a report, it looks more professional. While typing a report, you can simultaneously research for your project. In some cases, there are people who write very sloppily to the point where they cannot read their own writing, nor can a teacher. A sloppy writer can use the computer to make their paper neat and presentable. If a child or parent cannot go to the library for some reason, they can use their computer at home. If you are a parent at home, busy taking care of kids and need to do work, there's no need to go anywhere. Just stay home and use your computer. If a child is absent from school, you can go to the school's website and easily find out the homework. Do you have out - of - state family you wish to talk to? If so, wouldn't you want to be able to talk to them without incurring an expensive phone bill? A majority of people would say yes. Using the computer to keep in touch with family is not expensive at all! Some examples are AIM, emails, and other networks, and they don't cost any money; they're free. When there's a day you have nothing to do, don't you just want to go somewhere for fun? Don't you want to do something just to get out of the house? Well, if there's a last - minute decision or situation, the computer is there to help. Before you go somewhere and you want to know a little more about it, go on the computer. Not only will you get detailed information on the place, but you can also get accurate directions. Now you can go somewhere instead of staying home bored. In conclusion, computers do have a great effect on people. They can be useful to both adults and children. Teachers can calculate students' averages more easily and quickly, and children can do their homework more efficiently. You can also keep in touch with friends. Overall, computers are truly useful.
794	796	1	3	Isn't it great to get a refreshing experience when you're outside? Wouldn't you prefer to experience the rush of jumping into the crashing waves of the @LOCATION1 instead of sitting inside, merely gazing at pictures of the @LOCATION1? You might think that computers are helping society today, but you are wrong. The human race has survived for hundreds of years without computers and can continue to do so for hundreds more. Computers are making society more and more lazy. We can obtain just as much information from books if we make an effort. Hand - eye coordination is important, and we can develop it through various activities, such as football and tennis. We can also enhance it through other activities! Drawing, reading, and even playing an instrument can all improve hand - eye coordination while allowing you to explore your creative side. Some people believe that computers can teach hand - eye coordination, and they can, but there are better ways to achieve it. It would take longer to develop hand - eye coordination from a computer than through an activity. Many people like to travel to different places around the world, but going to a foreign area without any knowledge is not a smart move. So what do you do? You turn to the most convenient source, the internet. But what if I told you that any person can put anything on the internet? You could be getting information on @LOCATION3 when you think you're getting information on @LOCATION2. The most reliable source would be a well - researched book. Reading is a powerful activity, especially if you're reading from a good source. Kids lately have been creating virtual lives on the internet. The only way they communicate is through online chat. Chatting online can never replace in - person time with friends. Relationships formed online are never truly real. We're losing our ability to communicate effectively with others in person. The internet isn't worth the price we're paying. So, as you can clearly see, computers are not beneficial. Thank you.
795	797	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 post, Computers are an excellent advancement in technology. They greatly benefit our society. They are a way for family members to keep in close touch, they make your life easier when it comes to booking and managing flights, and lastly, they assist kids with their schoolwork. They can bring people closer together. Firstly, they are a wonderful way to stay connected. In my own experience, I have a brother at college. When I miss him or need to talk to him, I can always send him an email or have a video chat with him. Do you have someone you don't get to see every day? Using a computer can really strengthen your family bonds because you can talk more frequently with your relatives and friends. Friends may move away, but you can always chat with them when you need them. In a time of distress, all you want is a friend. When the friend is far away, a computer can probably come to your aid, just by providing that connection. Booking flights without a computer would be a hassle. You'd be waiting on the phone for hours. In contrast, with computers, you can complete the entire process in about five minutes. I've had an experience where my plane was canceled, but I didn't know until I went on the computer and checked. So I just switched our flight, and we were on our way. But could you imagine going to the airport the next day to find out that your flight was canceled and then spending the whole day trying to get on another flight, and maybe not even succeeding? With computers, you can check the flight status every hour if you like. It will even tell you if the flight is delayed, so you don't have to wait in the airport for five hours. When it comes to traveling, computers are a necessity. Has that ever happened to you? Most likely, yes. And once you were surely glad you had a computer. On the other hand, computers also help with your education. When class is over and your teacher is in a rush to assign the homework, most students aren't really listening. All they want to do is leave. About nine out of ten kids won't know the assignment when they get home that night. I know that's happened to me. As an eighth - grader, you might just forget all about it and take the consequences. But you could use your computer. Most schools use some kind of system. Here at @CAPS2, all our teachers post grades, upcoming tests/quizzes, and homework. It's just one click away from everything we need. It's all right there in one place. Most @CAPS3 parents will be a lot happier if their kids come home with their homework done rather than without it. Wouldn't you be? From school fund - raisers to the lunch menu, it's all available on the computer. In conclusion, computers are helpful in our daily lives as well as in special situations. They help us strengthen our family ties, ensure smooth travel, and assist us in getting our schoolwork done. Computers are a great and convenient asset to society.
796	798	1	3	"I walked into my living room one night and saw my mom engrossed on the computer. I thought to myself ""she is always on that computer, doesn't she have any work to do?"". I said to my mom ""I think we should have an hour or two of the computer each night, or not have one at all."" I told her that I think computers are a bad choice because you don't know who is on the internet and is trying to talk to you. Also, it gets in the way of exercising and spending quality time with family and friends. The internet/computers are very dangerous nowadays. You never know if someone is a friend or a predator trying to get you. Say if you were talking to someone and you thought it was your friend, well you don't know for sure if it is them or not. It could be an older man or woman trying to get a hold of you so they can probably kidnap you, steal from you and do worse. Now I watch the news and see many kidnappings because kids are talking to people on the internet and don't know who they are or what they look like. Like, when a girl was talking to a man and she thought it was her friend, turns out it wasn't and she got in a whole lot of trouble. Maybe if she met him she would have gotten very hurt and be scared of that memory for the rest of her life. Family is very important to most families nowadays. I have heard that spending time with family would bring your grades up in school because as you talk to them, you learn new things. Sadly this is not happening because people are so isolated with their computers they don't spend one minute with family or friends. I have a friend who is always on the computer. She never spends time with her family or friends. She is so focused on the computer screen than what is going on around her. Recently she has been getting off the computer and making more time with family and friends. Even her grades started going up because she is spending more time studying with her mom and dad, rather than being on sites like @CAPS1 or myspace and not getting any work done for school. In other words, she is very happy in life now and has changed from this experience she has gone through. Most people think you can use your brain for knowledge and call it exercise. That is one way to put it but it is not exercise for your body. People have spent more time having their eyes glued to the computer screen that they don't go out and play or maybe go to a gym. The rate of obesity in our country is increasing for many reasons and lack of exercise is one of them because people spend too much time watching tv and being on the computer. I have a little cousin who is overweight and should be out playing sports and exercising. But does she, ""no""... She spends her free time on the computer in a stuffy room, instead of getting fresh air from outside. She keeps asking me how did I get fit and at what age, and I keep telling her, I exercise and play sports so I can't tell you when. I keep saying that to her but she never listens. To this day she is still the same because she didn't take my advice to get off the computer and go outside to play. I strongly agree that we should have only two hours of the computer each night or have no computers at all. For kids' safety from bad people out there in the world, spending time with family and friends and finally for exercise and to stay fit with our bodies. I hope people understand what I say and take action to pursue these changes in their own life and convince others too."
797	799	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 or @ORGANIZATION2, the editor of the local @CAPS4 paper. I'm writing a letter to tell you about the effect of computers on people in a society. I think that computers help society learn and helps people to talk to others around the world. Computers help society learn about far - away areas of the world, to learn about the history of an area, and to study animals and habitats that are unable to be reached without travel. Computers make it easier to learn about areas that are hard to research like @PERSON1 and the cliffs of the @CAPS5 in @LOCATION1, and also to learn about the history of an area or cities of ancient @CAPS7 like @ORGANIZATION1 in @LOCATION2 of @CAPS5. They help study animal species and the habitats they could inhabit like the @CAPS9 @CAPS10 or the hasin in @CAPS9 or the species called the @CAPS12 @CAPS13. Computers help society learn about all this. Computers also help people talk to others around the world. For example, you can hold a conference on your computer when you are at home. It is easier to talk and ask questions with others as you are on vacation, and you don't have to pay to travel to a place to have a conference with others. You can hold a conference on your computer from home when you can't make it to a particular place. It's easier to talk and ask questions about something important to your business. You can go on your computer and talk with other people without spending money to travel there. This is how computers help people talk with others around the world. This is how computers help society learn and talk to others around the world. As the editor of the local newspaper, I hope you can spread this awareness.
798	800	1	3	Dear Newspaper, People use computers in their everyday lives, and having computers has become customary to many people throughout the @LOCATION1. We go on computers for research, writing papers, or just for pure entertainment. In all these ways, computers are very helpful. But, like all good things, too much computer time can be harmful. Sure they provide our lives with knowledge, info on the outside world, and connections with people from just about anywhere. But some of us become too attached to this virtual life instead of living our own real lives. This happens to many people, and some don't even notice what computers are doing to them. For most people, life can be challenging and the real world can be stressful, so they retire to the computer for a while, and to me this is fine. But when someone were to keep doing this it would become an addiction. Instead of relaxing by taking a walk or reading a book, they go to the computer. This would not be good for their social life or their minds. In my opinion, minds need to think; they need exercise by puzzling over something or figuring out a problem. Sure you think your brain is thinking by playing a challenging computer game, and sure, in some ways, it is. But it could reach its full potential by doing something else that's not straining your eyes so much. Computers can be good, but not for everything in your life. Now what about your social life? Computers can be a helpful resource in many ways, but not if you let them become a distraction. This can happen by letting the computer be your constant companion. Nowadays people have come up with online games where you can interact with other people. This isn't necessarily bad unless your whole social life is only with these online people that you really don't know, instead of with real people that you see at school or meet on the everyday streets. So what I'm saying is that talking with people online isn't bad as long as you put them as secondary friends and have real people come first. Like I said in the beginning, computers are part of our everyday life, and it's not a bad thing; they can be very helpful. But you must control what you do on them and how much you use them. If you do that, you will most likely have a much more balanced lifestyle, making you, your friends, and family a whole lot happier.
799	801	1	3	"Dear Newspaper people, @CAPS1 you might have heard on the @ORGANIZATION1 news that more and more people think computers are a benefit to society. I personally disagree with them. I think that they are making people miss out on new things, miss out on meeting new people, and overlook exercise. Time flies by fast. Things can fly over your head and you might not notice them. Have you ever been on a computer for an hour? It might have felt like you were on for @NUM1 minutes. Many people are on it for a whole day. You could have missed a year of stuff. New things like the new ipod nano with a camera could be invented and you would have not known. Also, with the ipod, you can download books and read them on there. There are also new things to try like jumping out of a plane or bungee jumping. You could be going to new places around the world, traveling to @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2 or even underwater. Even going to @LOCATION2 and having a melting, warm, right - out - of - the - oven, tasty cheese pizza. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. How many people do you know? What about on facebook or myspace? Instead, you should go to the park and meet some people. Just going to a family house, you can be interacting. Everyone should be interacting with someone. Even two - year - olds need to interact with other two - year - olds. That's how they learn how to share. @CAPS2, you're not two anymore but it's good to know someone and learn how others think too. You might think your way is good and the other person's way is not. That's called interacting and talking about it. @CAPS1 you might see on the news how many families have someone in the family having weight problems. Many shows like ""Biggest Losers"" on certain channels are trying to help these people lose weight. But what causes this? It could be not eating right, or not exercising right. But the problem could be related to computers. Many people are spending @NUM2 minutes on the computer, rather than @NUM3 minutes exercising. Just a quick walk around the block can make you lose at least @NUM4 calories. Others might rather stay on the computer and gain @NUM4 calories. And some deaths are caused by a heart attack. This can be caused by plaque building up or weight gain. Instead of reaching for an apple, many Americans reach for junk foods. I think we should still use computers but cut down the times we use it, exercise more, and eat healthier. You might think after reading this letter that people won't listen about exercising and meeting new people or going to new places. But the one thing we can do is to at least inspire one person. That person can inspire another person. This can go on and on. Little by little we can help people realize what they can do without over - relying on a computer."
800	802	1	3	Dear local newspaper, The question that everyone is asking is do computers benefit our society. I used to think they didn't benefit our society but now I think they do. I think this because, first, they are a good place to get information; second, we live in a technologically advanced society; and third, you can keep in touch with people that are at the other side of the world. So do computers really benefit our society? Computers are a valuable resource for me when I need to get information. For example, in my recent project in social studies class, I needed to go on the computer to get information on the subject. Also, if you need facts on something and you can't go to the library, the computer has the same information. Also, the computer is helpful when trying to find maps to a certain place or a phone number to a store. The computer is and always will be a great source of information. In the @DATE1, technology is a huge part of society. For example, the first computer that came out was this huge block that when you did something on it you would put in a cardboard card. Now we have thin and small portable computers. So knowing how to use a computer is vital to keep up with the @DATE1. So are you going to let technology pass you by? Computers are one of the best ways to keep in touch. For example, if you call someone across the world, your phone bill will skyrocket. But if you go on a website like facebook, you can talk for free. Also, another way to chat with people is by A.I.M., another free way to talk to people. What sane person wouldn't want to talk to their friends and family across the world for free? The reasons I have given you are valid reasons with details. Technology is like a train. Are you going to let it leave without you? In conclusion, computers clearly offer numerous benefits to our society, and we should embrace and make the most of this technological advancement.
801	803	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I firmly think that computers do not bring real benefits to society. In my opinion, they cause more harm than good. People are not using the computer to conduct in - depth research on various subjects; instead, they are on it to check @CAPS3, @CAPS4, @CAPS5 constantly. They really need to step outside their rooms and experience the beauty of the outside world. People should actively interact with their family and friends. There are many humans who have a lot of free time on their hands. Out of boredom, they might create a @CAPS3 account. If they already have one, they'll likely start playing one of the games available there. Eventually, they get so addicted to @CAPS3 that they never seem to log off. Our society should encourage people to go outdoors and only use the computer for essential tasks like checking emails, adding music to their iPods, and maybe seeing if there are any notifications on @CAPS3. If you truly want to have a fulfilling life, sitting in front of the computer all day won't allow you to experience that kind of joy. You need to live each day as if it's your last. Get outside, watch the big game with all your buddies. Go on a vacation and have a great time away with your family. Travel the world and cherish every moment of it. Wouldn't you rather be doing these things than sitting in front of your computer? We must inform our state about this concerning problem. There's a reason why our country is facing certain issues. People are staying indoors and not getting enough physical activity. If people reduce their computer usage, we could potentially become one of the fittest countries in the world.
802	804	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, the effects that computers have on people are far from good. They can trigger numerous problems in your daily life. When you're sitting in front of a computer, are you engaging in physical activities like running? No, you're just sitting still; using the computer involves hardly any body movement at all. You should be actively jumping around, dancing to your favorite tunes, or taking a nice walk with your friends. Spending all day sitting and using the computer can lead to significant weight gain. Another major problem that computers bring is the issue of social isolation. You can easily get addicted to a game or social media platforms like facebook/@CAPS1 and spend all your time on them. As a result, you won't talk to your friends as often at school or hang out with them because all you can think about is getting back on the computer. Your mind becomes so focused on the virtual world that you neglect other important aspects of life. Moreover, computers can be extremely dangerous. If you're chatting with strangers on the internet, they can gather personal information about you and potentially cause harm. It's highly risky to talk to people you don't know online. These are just some of the many problems that computers cause. Trust me, I've personally experienced getting addicted to a game before, and I know how it can disrupt your life. So, we need to be more cautious about our computer usage.
803	805	1	3	"School, family, and sports are what @CAPS5 my parents always tell me. Nowadays, kids seem to be glued to the computer. Approximately @PERCENT1 of students finish school and head straight to the computer. Students should allocate more time to be with their families, engage in more physical exercise, and most importantly, focus more on improving their grades in school. My primary reason for agreeing with this view is that most kids rarely spend quality time with their families. All they want to do is come home and sit in front of the computer all day long. This is a real pity because kids miss out on the chance to bond with their family and fail to show appreciation for all the efforts @CAPS5 their parents put in for them. For instance, I really want to ask young kids if they thank their parents every single day. They should be doing that to express their gratitude. In addition, my second reason for agreement is that students need to invest more time and energy into their schoolwork. Kids should stop spending hours on social media platforms like facebook, @CAPS1, and @CAPS2. Instead of wasting time on those sites, they should visit educational websites such as @ORGANIZATION1 to conduct research. Around @PERCENT2 of students in school have accounts on facebook, @CAPS1, or @CAPS2. Every day when I walk through the school halls, I often overhear students talking about what happened on the computer @TIME1. It's truly absurd how many students don't complete their homework on time and hand it in late. Lastly, my third and final reason for agreement is that students hardly exercise at all. A well - known baseball player once said, ""You don't have to be strong, but you have to be fit and athletic."" What @CAPS5 this statement meant was that one needs to be in good physical shape. About @PERCENT3 of students are not at their ideal weight because they are overweight and don't exercise regularly. The only physical activity students get these days is during their @CAPS6.E. class. Even then, they get tired quickly and out of breath because they are so used to being lazy and sitting in front of the computer. They need to get off the computer and do some simple exercises like push - ups, sit - ups. For example, I make it a habit to do my homework after school and then go for a one - mile run. Also, students need to make sure they pass their @CAPS6.E. class. In conclusion, students should cut down on their computer time, spend more time with their families, focus on their school grades, and get more exercise to stay healthy."
804	806	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2's opinion about computers is quite valid. I firmly believe that computers can be extremely helpful to people in meeting their various needs. They also provide a convenient way for people to contact each other. In fact, all computers have their positive aspects and are not always associated with something negative when being used. Computers play a crucial role in the lives of teachers, students, employees, and parents. They are not only useful for work - related purposes but can also be a source of amusement. There are countless games, music, and videos available on the internet. Contacting others is another great advantage of having a computer. Myspace, @CAPS3, and @CAPS4 are all popular websites that enable people to connect with others. Owning a computer is not always a bad thing. When you write a story for the newspaper, do you hand - write it? Of course not; you use the computer to do your work efficiently. Computers are not always the culprit. People just need to learn how to limit their usage time. They can have a positive impact on people when there's a real need. You can find information on almost anything on the internet. Computers have been an integral part of our lives for decades, and I'm certain they will continue to be used for many more years to come. In the past, people mainly used computers for work. Now, people of all ages can utilize them for a wide variety of things, making our lives more convenient and interesting. So, we should make good use of computers while keeping our usage in check.
805	807	1	3	"Computers. An outstanding achievement of @MONEY1 technology and science that has seemingly improved all @MONEY1 aspects of our lives. They allow you to explore the vast world with just one click and chat with your friends from afar. What could possibly be wrong with that? Well, I'll tell you. I firmly believe that computers are actually ruining our society. Now, don't misunderstand me; I do appreciate the convenience they bring, but they can also be quite harmful. People often get on the computer and seem unable to get off. You never really know who you're chatting with online, and they can cause an enormous amount of stress. Let me elaborate on why computers can have such a negative impact on lives. When the computer was first invented, I'm sure this excessive and unproductive usage wasn't its intended purpose. Instead of using it for meaningful tasks, people are spending hours playing mindless games or randomly browsing the web. Some scientists have conducted studies and found that @PERCENT1 of the time, the more time you spend online, the higher the likelihood of becoming obese. This is definitely not what @LOCATION1 needs. You might tell yourself you'll only be on for a short while, but you may end up playing ""@CAPS1"" or ""@CAPS2"" for days continuously. People who have important @CAPS3 work to do might not even get a chance to use the computer. Moreover, it's simply a huge waste of time when you could be outside playing a real - life @CAPS3 game. My second reason is about the online chatting risks. When you're ""chatting"" or ""@CAPS4'ing"" someone, you can never be sure who they really are. A study has shown that when you think you're talking to a friend, it could actually be some perverted @NUM1 - year - old looking for inappropriate ""fun."" Shocking, isn't it? Also, while chatting, someone could be embedding a virus in your system, which would cost @MONEY1 to fix. Your parents would be extremely angry if that happened. It could be happening with every single letter you type. Finally, whether it's a stranger or not, some of these people leave links to disgusting websites that you hope your parents never discover. My final point is that computers are scientifically proven to cause more stress. When you're on @CAPS6 or @CAPS7, nasty feuds between friends can break out, which will affect your school performance and damage your grades. For every @NUM2 people who join a social page, @NUM1 of them experience a decline in grades due to this issue. Also, when your parents spend a long time online, they'll be tired the next morning and rush to get ready for work, which will affect the quality of their work. In this tough economic situation, we definitely don't need more job losses. Even simple problems like a virus or a slow upload can and will cause stress. In fact, @PERCENT2 of @LOCATION1's population has a stress problem related to computers. I've explained today why computers can be so bad. People can get trapped, stressed out, and even stalked. However, computers aren't completely bad; we just need to use them in a proper way. These are the reasons I firmly believe that computers can have a negative impact on our lives."
806	808	1	3	"Hello @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3, do you think computers are having a great effect on people? Well, I sure @CAPS3 think using a computer has a great effect on people. I say this because, people are probably wasting a full day on those Facebook, MySpace, Google websites, looking up definitions for words, directions to places etc. If you think about it, this effect on people can ruin their eyesight, and social skills. These people are spending like @NUM1 hours tops on the computer. Staring at that @NUM2 - inch little screen for long periods can damage your eyesight. This can lead you to getting glasses or possibly going blind. How would your life be without talking to a girl/guy or even your own family? If you waste your time on those websites, for example: Facebook, all you @CAPS3 do is instant message the person. Maybe you should go out and @CAPS3 do something fun with that person. What's this I hear about MapIt.com? Don't be lazy and waste @NUM3 minutes of your day just getting directions. Use a real map! Also, free @LOCATION1? Come on! Use a real dictionary. So, I come to my conclusion by saying that these computers @CAPS3 only seem to have a so - called ""great effect"" on people. In reality, it just gives them short - cuts through life, which aren't always beneficial."
807	809	1	3	Dear The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, Computers do not benefit society. They make people antisocial, unhealthy, and lead them to do bad things. The internet is very addictive. I used to spend three hours online every day. I did not get any exercise at all. Also, I was encouraged to eat unhealthy snacks while online. This made me very unhealthy. I gained nine pounds in one week. Now, I have dietary difficulties. I can't enjoy things like sweets or running. I will probably have arthritis in my hands when I'm older because I spent hours typing away. I used the computer in the dark so now I need contacts. Using the computer is one of the most unhealthy choices ever. I spent so much time on the computer that I wasn't able to socialize. I missed out on a lot of activities with my friends and family because I was so busy online. I barely talked to anyone unless it was through email. I lost a lot of friends and close family members. My pets died because I didn't take care of them. I didn't really want to do anything but go on the net. I messed up on college and job interviews. To this day I have no social life and no job because I spent more time socializing with the computer than with people. Computers ruined my life. Computers encourage very bad things. Not just unhealthy choices and antisocial behavior, they encourage things against the law. A lot of drugs and weapons are bought online. People kill others or themselves because people gossiped about them online. People don't care for nature and destroy it. People steal so they can buy extra technology. A lot of car robberies happen because someone left technology in their car. People gamble through online poker. People hack bank accounts through the computer. Prostitution happens because of online chats. There are sex offenders that go online posing as people that want a date when they are actually rapists. Terrorists can communicate via the internet. Computers are a menace to society. They turn people into low - life scums and criminals. Computers should be disposed of before they cause the end of the world, as their negative impacts are only likely to grow.
808	810	1	3	Dear @LOCATION1 Newspaper, I believe that computers have a very positive effect on people. Computers can help kids with homework. Computers also let people learn new things. You can even communicate with friends. There are many great uses for a computer. Kids have lots of homework and without computers it would be nearly impossible to finish it all. At @ORGANIZATION1, students receive a project almost every month. We need pictures, information, and it must be neat. Computers are about the only way to find pictures, information, and make it neat. For instance, when creating a presentation on history, we can easily search for relevant historical images and detailed facts. Kids also get a ton of homework and computers are very important for it. In science class we get a packet for homework for every new unit and without a computer it would be really hard to get done. You can also learn many things you never knew from using a computer. There are a lot of uses for a computer and one of them is learning. There are many educational websites on computers. If you were traveling somewhere and wanted to find out more about that place you could search it on the internet. Even if you're reading a book and come across a word you don't know you could look it up and you will find it. Communicating with friends is also important and computers offer many different ways of doing it. There are Facebook, @CAPS1, and video - chat. You could use Facebook if you want to talk to friends or video - chat also to talk to friends. Those things are great if you want to show pictures from a vacation or talk to a friend in a different country. These are all great ways to use computers. I definitely think computers have a positive effect on people. They help with projects and homework, learning new things and communicating with friends. Computers are truly great tools that enhance our daily lives.
809	811	1	3	Dear, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 computers are useful but they have a negative affect on people. Due to the advance in computers many people do not go outside as much anymore. People are so busy with computers that they don't even spend quality time with their friends and family anymore. Obesity is also a big issue. Computers are ruining people's experience with the great outdoors. Many people, mostly kids stay inside all day playing video games on computers. Outside there are great things to do like go to the park or play sports. For example, kids could play soccer or have a picnic in the park. Computers are just taking away from kids and now they don't get to experience the fresh outside fun and nowadays kids in the @DATE1 stay inside all day, instead of going to fun outside camps. Families nowadays are being broken up due to computers. The parents or even kids are not spending lots of time with each other due to the computers. As a result the family starts to lose the bond between each other. Families can also develop these ways, youth most likely get attracted to computers, so it's either the son or daughter who are not emotionally or physically contacting with the family which is a problem. Health is a big issue when it comes to computers. What's happening is teenagers or even adults are sitting at the computer playing these games or surfing the web then eating dinner then continuing to surf the web or play the games. After time their health starts to become worse and worse and the kids gain weight and keep gaining weight then become obese and unhealthy. This is a problem all over America. As technology keeps advancing and advancing the youth will become very unhealthy. In conclusion, computers have a very negative affect on people. People are not going outside as much anymore. Families' relationships are being ruined and people's health is at stake! If this does not change America's future will be at risk as the younger generation may face long - term health and social problems.
810	812	1	3	"Some people learn about far - away places, get the latest updates on important news, and make sloppy work and handwriting seem nice and neat. All those things are some positive benefits people have from computers. People all over use computers to research other places and computers provide photographs of the place he/she is researching. For example: I remember when I had a social studies project on the @PERSON1, and I had to explain why it's a great place to visit for its history. Mind you, I never even heard of a place called the @PERSON1 @PERSON1, but thanks to computers I googled ""@PERSON1 @PERSON1 @PERSON1"", then the computer gave me all of the info and photos about the mountain @CAPS1. Now I @CAPS2 know where and what the @PERSON1 @PERSON1 mountains look like. Secondly, the computer has all the latest news happening all over the world. I remember when the earthquake in Haiti first happened, my grandmother didn't know about it until she got online to check @ORGANIZATION1 and found out when, where and how strong the earthquake was on the Richter scale. Another great thing about computers was that I wasn't the best hand - writer in class, and when I had an assignment where I could write it out or do it on the computer, plus we were getting graded on neatness, elaboration, and fluency. I chose to do it on the computer and it came out nice and neat with pictures. Computers have a very positive benefit on people worldwide. No matter if it's for info, news, or to make things neater, computers truly enhance our ability to learn and present information."
811	813	1	3	Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1, can you think of any child or teen between the ages of eight and seventeen who doesn't love going on the computer? Well, MySpace, Facebook, and AIM are like online hangouts. Kids everywhere log on and don't log out unless their parents make them. I firmly believe that computers have a major effect on people. My three reasons are that people don't get enough exercise, they don't interact with others, and kids can be sneaky. They'll sneak on the computer even when they're supposed to be doing research. Online websites and games are like hypnotizing people and making them stay on for hours. Most parents believe that having their child on a computer doing research for an hour is good. However, kids will sneak to play online games or go to websites they're not allowed to visit. Sometimes, the best thing to @CAPS1 is to get some fresh air and interact with others. But with websites that keep people connected for more than two hours, they don't get fresh air and they don't interact with others. Most of the time, people forget and don't know what the world is like outside the computer because they play on it so much. People grow up fast when you think about it, and they start to eat, drink, and sometimes even sleep at the computer. They stay at the computer and eat there, they won't get enough exercise, they'll start to get fat, and soon they'll only stay at the computers because they didn't exercise to burn the fat off. You can see how computers have a major effect on people by preventing them from interacting with others, not allowing them to get enough exercise, and kids being sneaky and going on websites they're not allowed to. In conclusion, it's clear that the overuse of computers is causing various problems in people's lives, and we should encourage a more balanced lifestyle.
812	814	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, I don't think that computers are something that people should be using @NUM1. Computers have a certain allure that makes them addictive. There are people who are gaining weight every day because they sit on the computer and chat all day. Then there are those terrible people on the internet who disguise themselves. They might look like a @NUM2 - year - old boy when they're really a middle - aged man. Lastly, people nowadays are using the computer as a source of reading instead of books. I just think that computers are ruining the lives of many people. For starters, most people today are becoming overweight because they either watch too much @CAPS2 or they sit on the computer and eat all day. Once you start using the computer, you'll never stop, especially if you're multi - tasking by eating and using the computer at the same time. The big problem is that people think it's better to be sitting at home than going out and enjoying nature while exercising! It really isn't good that people don't get off the computer and start enjoying life. Next, not everyone online is who they say they are. There are those who make false accounts on platforms like @CAPS3 or @CAPS4. There can be men who claim to be something else and really be @NUM3. With all the posting of pictures, someone could misuse it. Just remember to be careful! Lastly, people in today's day and age use the computer to read books instead of going to the library or @CAPS5 and @CAPS6 (or any book store). I think that all those bookstores are going to run out of business because of the technology nowadays. When I was younger and I said that I was going to read a book, I was really holding a physical book. I wasn't reading it on the computer. People need to cut down on the electronics. In the end, I think that computers are a real waste of time. There is no reason why people should be on the computer instead of exercising. Everyone needs to stay away from the bad people online. Also, can we please start using normal books instead of online ones. In conclusion, computers are taking over our lives in a negative way, and we need to regain control and focus on more healthy and beneficial activities.
813	815	1	3	Dear Newspaper, Computers today have a negative effect on people. The valuable time that could be spent on getting daily exercise is reduced. You will not see your family enough, and some of the costs associated with computers are outrageous! Owning a computer is surely not a good idea. Is sitting around all day your idea of a workout? Having a computer would be very bad for your physical lifestyle. Clicking a mouse and typing away are only moving your hands, not your whole body. An individual who doesn't use the computer daily, or for large amounts of time, would be healthier than someone who always uses the computer. I remember seeing a commercial about @NUM1 children and how their lives ended up later on in life just because of their computer usage as “tweens.” Not only will you be unhealthy, but anti - socialism is probable too. Many kids, or even adults, spend precious family time playing The Sims @NUM2 and creating their own ideal family. This, however, is not acceptable. Spending time with your family is something precious. When asked about computer usage, @PERSON1 said, “You could easily become addicted with just @NUM2 turns!” Once you are addicted, both your family and you suffer. They will stop inviting you places. You wouldn't want to lose the people who are going to be there for you. “@CAPS2!” shouts your computer. You have another virus. Uh - oh, it's deleting your hardware: all your scholastic essays, important book - marked websites, and sentimental photographs. Do you have any idea how much it would cost to even try to retrieve this data? Well, it'd be a lot. I know you're probably thinking, “This couldn't happen to me,” but in reality, yes, it can. Storing things on a computer is much riskier than having a hard copy. It will also save you more money. Furthermore, appliances use electricity as long as they're even plugged into an outlet! So when you get your electric bill, don't be surprised. Computers can be very costly, which is why it's not worth it to have one. Computers are just another unnecessary thing in life. It will take away from your overall health, reduce family time, and cost you some big bucks. It is a fact that you can survive without a computer. But without health? Well, you'd be in a very bad state. I urge you to consider my ideas. In conclusion, the drawbacks of computer use clearly outweigh any potential benefits, and we should limit our reliance on them for a better life.
814	816	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I am a student at @ORGANIZATION3 middle school in @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6. Recently, you produced an article about whether computers are good or bad for people. I write today to say that computers are beneficial to people everywhere. This is true because computers help people with things like hand - eye coordination, they aid in learning new things, and they are a great way to communicate. @CAPS7, please consider the following. First of all, computers help hand - eye coordination greatly in the long run. This is true because people who play games on the computers become more skillful at using their hands and eyes together. @ORGANIZATION1, according to a quote from an expert in @ORGANIZATION4 @LOCATION1, “Computers help hand - eye coordination @PERCENT1 more than putting your son or daughter on the football team.” This shows that computer games could help kids get more accurate with their skills, similar to those required in any sport. @CAPS7, now you know why computers help people develop better hand - eye coordination. Secondly, computers help people learn new things. Although some people might think this is false, it is indeed true. According to a recent study at @ORGANIZATION2, @PERCENT2 of schools in @CAPS6 use computers for research. Finally, recently I had a paper about @PERSON2, and the only source I thought of was Wikipedia on the internet because it is faster than searching for a book about him. @CAPS7, now you understand that the computer is a helpful learning tool. Finally, the computer is a great way to communicate online. It is better than @CAPS10 because it is faster and more convenient than calling someone up and talking for a long time. Moreover, it is a lot cheaper than @CAPS10 because you just have @NUM1 payment a month, unlike the phone bill which starts to add up. According to @PERSON1 or the @ORGANIZATION2 of @LOCATION1 in a recent study, “@CAPS10 are obsolete now. With the internet, people can chat at lightning speed.” Finally, using e - mail or Facebook is much better than phone tag. On Facebook, you know exactly where you can chat with others. @CAPS7, that's my reason why the computer is good for communicating. In conclusion, computers are essential as they improve hand - eye coordination, assist in learning, and offer an excellent means of communication.
815	817	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, A recent concern has built up among experts that computers @MONTH1 have negative affects on the society. I do not agree with this. Computers ease life, teach you about faraway places and people, and finally, you can chat with others. I believe computers can only benefit a society. As previously mentioned, computers ease the hassles of life. With computers, you are able to plan your life with @CAPS1 output. This program allows you to enter data on places you have to go and reminds you when it's time for that event. With this program, you will never forget where you have to go. Also, with the computer, you are able to gather information at extremely high speeds. Suppose you are doing a research project in school on types of cars. You just enter “cars” on @ORGANIZATION3 and get millions of results. This saves much more time than going to the library and finding a book, which can take a long time depending on the availability. Finally, with a computer handy, there are programs for special - needs people to write. New programs such as @ORGANIZATION2 Word have a special function called voice commands. This lets a person who cannot write because of blindness or a disability speak to the computer what he or she wants to write. In an instant, it will pop up on the screen. Computers ease people's lives drastically. Besides easing life, computers teach you about far - away places and people. Pictures on a computer give one a first - hand account of how a far - away place is like. Instead of just reading about it, you can see it. According to Time magazine, if a person sees a place, they will learn more by @PERCENT1 than reading an encyclopedia. As well as pictures, blogs give people an idea of how a person lives in a regular day in that place and how they feel about it. This is another first - hand account of the place. Finally, e - books on the internet give you a large amount of information. E - books are books but in an internet format. These books include encyclopedias that give statistics, facts, and events that are in the far - off place. For example, if you are planning a trip, you can learn where to eat and where to get entertained. You can learn about far - off places and the people in them with computers. Lastly, with computers, you can talk to people around the world. You can talk to friends. Have you ever moved and wanted to talk to a friend from where you previously lived? Now you can easily do so with video chat. Not only can you talk to someone, but you can see them. I remember @NUM1 years ago when I moved to @LOCATION1, I missed my friends in @LOCATION2, so I video - chatted with them. As well as talking to friends, one can have a business meeting around the world without having to travel out of your town. For example, if a company wanted to make a trading agreement with another company in @LOCATION3, they could do so with a click of a mouse. This will save time and money on traveling. Also, you can talk to others online to get a feel of what happened. For example, @CAPS2 a few weeks ago, I video - chatted with many people in @LOCATION4 to understand how bad the conditions were after the earthquake. In conclusion, I firmly believe that computers are beneficial to a society. They simplify life, educate us about distant places and their inhabitants, and enable easy communication. They truly open up new opportunities and enhance our lives in many ways.
816	818	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2, I noticed that you think computers are bad for society. It has come to my attention that many people share this concern. However, in my opinion, computers are extremely beneficial. They help enhance typing skills. Moreover, computers are very useful for cropping and editing pictures, and they make it easy to find information. First of all, computers are highly helpful with typing skills. People who don't use computers often take six years to achieve a certain level of typing proficiency. In contrast, younger people with good typing skills can type very quickly. Actually, @PERCENT1 of teens can type a significant amount of text in a minute, while others might take @NUM1 minutes. Computers have a great impact on many people's typing skills. Computers also make it so convenient to deal with pictures. Instead of using an expensive digital @CAPS2 for picture - editing, you can do it for free on your computer. Additionally, a computer helps you navigate through a vast amount of information. Instead of facing a lack of information, you can simply use your computer and find what you need faster. For example, if you have to do a project on @CAPS4, instead of going to the library and spending money on a book about @CAPS4, you can go on google.com and type in @CAPS4. You'll get so much information in a much shorter time. In conclusion, I firmly believe that computers are a great invention. They make it easier to find information and improve typing skills. Also, they make it so much easier to crop and edit photos. Please take my suggestions seriously.
817	819	1	3	Some experts are worried that people are spending excessive time on their computers and less time on activities like exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. However, I hold the opposite view. I think this way because there will come a day, perhaps @MONTH1, when you have to look up something on the computer. Some jobs even require you to apply via computer. Moreover, a computer allows you to communicate online with others. The first reason I think using a computer is beneficial for people is that there will be a time, maybe @MONTH1, when you need to look up something. You might be searching for a job, planning a vacation, or need to pay a bill. The computer provides a quick and easy way to handle these tasks. The second reason is that some jobs, such as those at Stop and Shop, Price Right, and Save - A - Lot, require online applications. This is also good for our society as using paper for applications means cutting down more trees. The third reason is that a computer enables you to talk online with others. There may be times, say @MONTH1, when you need to contact a family member, an old friend, or meet new people. Some people may not like talking on the phone, so they prefer communicating via computer. I've now shared all the reasons why I think using a computer is good. There will be a time when you need to look up something, some jobs require computer - based applications, and it allows online communication. These are all significant advantages. So, I hope you will take my opinion into consideration.
818	820	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, my name is @CAPS2 @CAPS3, and I want to explain why I'm a bit against over - reliance on computers. There are numerous things to do in the world, places to visit, and opportunities to go on cruise ships. First, let me tell you about the activities you can engage in. You can play sports like basketball and handball, or simply hang out with your friends. You can also take your car for a morning drive and feel the refreshing breeze on your face. Next, consider the places you can visit. You can go to your friends' houses, visit your girlfriend or boyfriend, or spend time with your family. It's time to stop being lazy and realize that computers aren't helping you live a fulfilling life. Finally, let's talk about cruise ships. You can travel to far - off locations like @LOCATION2, @LOCATION3, @LOCATION1, and many other wonderful places. Being on a cruise ship is a lot of fun. You can enjoy a captain's dinner, meet interesting @ORGANIZATION1 people, and see amazing @ORGANIZATION1 sights. In conclusion, I firmly believe that people should stop being overly dependent on computers and start having fun in the real world while they still can.
819	821	1	3	"Dear Local Newspaper, I believe that computers are extremely important to our society in this day and age. Computers facilitate communication among people. They allow us to stay in touch with family and friends online. Secondly, computers are crucial for learning, including online schooling. Lastly, they serve as a source of entertainment for people. Computers are one of the most widely used tools on the planet. Almost every family owns one, and some people even have more than @NUM1. In today's world, many people travel far and wide to earn a living for their families. Computers help them maintain contact, whether through email or video chat. This not only makes people happy but also keeps them informed about what their loved ones are doing. For some, it can even lead to family reunions, like when someone searches for their long - lost brother. Computers have the power to bring families closer together, and you might get a pleasant surprise every now and then. Computers are also a great source of entertainment. If you're looking for funny videos, just search for ""funny videos"" and you'll be entertained for a while. I enjoy downloading music, and I'm sure others do too. If a song is stuck in your head, simply look it up and you'll likely find it. You might be cooking and need a recipe; your computer will readily provide the information. In conclusion, computers are one of the most important tools in the world we live in today. We rely on them for various things, such as keeping in touch with family, facilitating learning, and providing entertainment. They can assist with countless aspects of our lives."
820	822	1	3	I firmly believe that you can never spend enough time on the computer. I feel that there are no negative effects that computers can have on you; instead, they only enhance your life. For one thing, if you need to find out an important fact, date, or time, you can simply look it up on the computer. The internet is an endless source of knowledge. You can learn just about anything you need to know by searching on the computer. Another useful aspect of the computer is the ability to communicate with people. You can use either @CAPS1 - mail, @CAPS2, or chat rooms. You can meet new people, talk to distant friends or relatives. You can even connect a webcam and actually see them as they talk, something a phone cannot offer. The computer is also an excellent source of entertainment. You can play a variety of games from the internet. You can even download console games onto your computer. Additionally, you can watch full episodes of @CAPS3 shows and movies. If you're following a television series and miss an episode, you can easily look it up. YouTube is a favorite of mine. Whether you watch random videos, follow famous YouTube stars, or post your own videos, there's always fun to be had. Finally, there are countless programs on the computer. You can download an endless number of them. Some are for fun, like paint and flash, while others are important, such as Word or Notepad. Every program the computer offers is useful and enjoyable to use, and you can apply most of these programs in real - life situations. Now that I've mentioned some of the many reasons why you can never spend enough time on the computer, sure, exercise and nature are healthy, but you can still do those things while also enjoying the benefits of the computer. For example, you can take a nature walk and then come back and use your computer. So, don't you agree that computers improve our lives more than they are unhealthy?
821	823	1	3	Some experts are concerned about people using computers and not enjoying nature and going outside. In my opinion, people should use the computers but not excessively. It's beneficial to use the computer to chat with friends, search for some stuff you've never seen before. I say this because some people get addicted to computer games or spend the whole day talking to their friends online. Another reason is that when you go outside, you can enjoy more activities like playing sports, tag, and other outdoor games. Instead of talking to a friend on the computer, you can go to the park and have a face - to - face conversation or invite them over to your house.   Another reason why I think the experts are right about people and computers is that it's important to learn about nature and practical skills. For instance, you can learn how to build things or take care of the environment. I hope you have found my introduction good and will continue reading. My first reason is people getting addicted to computer games and other computer features. The reason I say this is because some people do get addicted to the computer. It's okay to go on it sometimes, but not too much. It is better to go outside where you can breathe fresh air which is nice and cold. If you have a dog, you should take it for a walk or walk with your friends.   My next reason is going outside to play sports or run around playing tag. Instead of using the computer, you could go to the park to play basketball or baseball. There are so many fun things you can do outside. You should go to your school and try out for any sport that you're good at. That way, when you get bored, there is always something to do, instead of being home all day glued to the computer. The last reason why I prefer nature over computers is learning how to do things in real life. It's better to learn practical skills in real life than on the computer. Your dad can teach you how to stack bricks together to make a chimney, or how to use a lawn mower to cut other people's yards to make money. In conclusion, while computers have their uses, we should limit our usage and spend more time outdoors to enjoy nature, stay healthy, and learn practical skills.
822	824	1	3	"Dear editor, I hear you are looking for your citizens' opinion on whether computers are bad or good. My opinion is that computers are bad. I think computers are bad in three ways and I want to express them to you and hopefully persuade you to side with me. The air smells nice today. I can smell the fragrant flowers, the fresh grass, and many other pleasant scents. My first reason why computers are bad is that if you use the computer too much, you don't get to enjoy enough of nature. Nature is truly beautiful. It has colorful flowers, green grass, and sometimes even rainbows. You can take a walk under the moonlight and just be yourself, enjoying your own company. In other words, nature is very calming and you should set aside time to enjoy it.   If you don't enjoy nature now, it might be too late. Soon, the pleasant weather will change. After the colorful fall season, winter comes. Winter is not pleasant; it is cold. You have to do a lot of work, like shoveling the driveway and clearing the snow off your car, which can be very tiring. The good thing is that you can get these chores done while enjoying the fresh air outside instead of being stuck inside on the computer.   My next reason why I think computers are bad is that people spend all their time working on the computer and have no time for exercise. Exercise is a very fun and important thing to do. You feel great when you go outside, hang out with friends, and get some physical activity. Exercise is a main way of staying healthy. If you don't exercise, you can really become unhealthy, get sick, and even face serious health issues. I have a friend who only uses the computer. His body has become weaker and weaker. So, exercise is a crucial part of staying healthy. There are many ways to exercise, like biking, running, walking, rowing, climbing a mountain, etc. The possibilities are endless. While exercising in the park, you might meet new people. For example, your friend might say, ""Yo, sup man?"" and you can reply, ""Not much, just looking around for some exercise."" ""Same here, same here."" You never know who you can meet in the park. I wouldn't have met my friend if I was inside on the computer. Since I come to the park every day, I might meet a new friend every day.   My last reason why I think the computer is bad is that you don't get enough interacting time with friends and family. I love my family, but if I'm on the computer all the time, I can't interact with them properly. If they are out exercising and I'm here on the computer, I miss out on those precious moments. In conclusion, I think the computers are bad because you can't get enough time for exercising, enjoying nature, and spending quality time with family and friends."
823	825	1	3	Dear local officials, I think that computers are good for people to have. My first reason is that kids might have to write an essay for school. Teachers mostly prefer to have the kids type their essays. When kids write essays, they need to gather information on the topic. Using a computer makes it easier to search for relevant information from various sources on the internet.   My second reason is that kids might have to look up important things. For example, they may have to fill out an application online. When kids get older, they want to look up schools they might want to attend. Kids in high school look up colleges to get into when they are in their junior or senior grade. The computer provides a vast amount of information about different colleges, their courses, and admission requirements.   My third reason is that kids might have emails. When kids check their emails, they are probably trying to see if their parents wrote to them. Also, some kids don't live near their family members, so they use emails to stay in touch. Emails allow them to communicate easily and quickly with their relatives who are far away.   My first reason is that kids might have to write an essay for school. My second reason is that kids might have to look up important things. My third reason is that kids might have an email. Now I hope you like the reasons I've written on why computers are good to have. In conclusion, computers offer numerous benefits to kids, such as facilitating essay - writing, providing access to important information, and enabling communication with family and friends. Therefore, they are a valuable and useful tool for people.
824	826	1	3	"Dear officials, as a student of the local middle school, I've noticed that technology is utilized to the fullest. Computers have helped us write essays more efficiently and complete research assignments. However, personally, I feel that this constant usage of computers has a negative impact on people. Firstly, computers hinder interpersonal connections. Although social media helps keep in touch with old college buddies, no computer can replace face - to - face communication. From hard, cold text on a screen, one cannot decipher subtle connotations or the wit in a conversation. Moreover, people are beginning to replace in - person meetings with online networking.   With the technological revolution, games like World of Warcraft emerged. These games are extremely addicting. Although our society mocks ""nerds"" for spending too much time playing these trivial games, it really is a serious issue. For example, in a recent study done by Harvard University students, ""7 out of 10 teenagers who play computer games do not get the recommended amount of daily exercise."" This is because these games are so absorbing. The amount of time put into gaming ultimately consumes all free time. This is dangerous because a gaming addiction can lead to delusion, social inadequacy, and obesity.   As a people, we are quickly learning that what was once considered so genius is actually dangerous. If one was to stare at a backlit screen for hours on end, their eyesight would definitely start to deteriorate. Loss of eyesight is just one of the negative impacts computers have on our health. As aforementioned, obesity is also a major issue. Now, couple this with bad eyesight, vitamin D deficiency, and a negative outlook, and you've got yourself a serious problem.   All of the diseases brought on by computers can be mitigated by spending less time on the computer and engaging in exercises. Naturally, as a species, we were not meant to spend so much time in a fixed position. This static state is a new phenomenon that is causing major health problems. The over - usage of computers practically robs us of our time, destroys our health, and hinders our social interactions. In conclusion, computers, despite their initial appeal, have a significant negative influence on people and their health, and we should take steps to limit our usage."
825	827	1	3	I think computers have a positive affect on people. Computers are very important to society. You can still interact with your family and friends either in a video chat or through online messaging platforms. Computers are also helpful for applying for jobs. You can look for jobs that you're interested in on various job - search websites.   You can do online exercises and it's useful for writing essays. For example, there are many writing tools available on the computer that can help you improve your grammar and vocabulary. If you have a laptop, you can bring it anywhere you want. It can connect wirelessly to the internet, allowing you to stay connected and access information no matter where you are. You can look up stuff on the internet for your homework and other projects. You can also buy things online without having to go to the store, which saves you time and effort.   These are the reasons why I believe computers have a positive affect on people. In conclusion, computers offer a wide range of benefits, including facilitating communication, providing educational resources, and enabling convenient shopping. They have become an indispensable part of our lives and have a positive impact on our daily activities and overall well - being.
826	828	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1, Computers have been an incredible help to many people as they advance in knowledge. They serve as powerful tools that open up a world of information. But, many people do not think about the negative affects of computers. Computers make research easier to find, as vast databases are just a click away, and they organize data well and quickly, streamlining work processes. Computers make communication easy, but there are many negative affects as well as positive. Chat rooms on computers are a great way to communicate quickly, allowing people to connect instantly across the globe, but they can also be dangerous. More and more kids are spending time on computers, rather than outside exercising and communicating with friends and family in person. Chat rooms are commonly used by kids as well as adults. Kids use them to talk with friends, make plans, and catch up with relatives. But kids aren't the only people that use chat rooms. Adults use them too. Some for good, others for bad. Adults sometimes have chats for their work to talk with their fellow workers. They can communicate easily what has been done and what needs to be done at the office such as what bills have been paid. This is a good way for workers to know what's going on outside of the office. There are many other useful advantages of computers. Some other advantages of computers are the computers functions. Computers are good for finding information quickly. Computers are useful to find information for school projects, providing access to a wealth of resources. Computers can also take that information, and organize it on graphs, and computer programs such as Microsoft PowerPoint. Other pluses about computers, are that they can teach hand - eye coordination. Typing can help most people with this. Typing is also another advantage. If people don't have great penmanship, they can use a computer to type essays, homework, and school projects. This makes reading the assignment easier for the student as well as the teacher. There are many advantages to computer, but there are also disadvantages. More and more kids are spending their free time on the computer, instead of outside exercising. This is causing kids to become less active. Being in a chat room all day is also a disadvantage. Kids today are using a new language in chat rooms as well as texting. They are using abbreviations for words and phrases, such as ""idk"" for ""i don't know"". This language is damaging how kids read and write. Although chat rooms on computer can be useful, they can also be dangerous. Kids as well as adults go into chatrooms and talk to other people, saying invalid information about themselves. Such as age. Some adults go into chat rooms and pretend to be a teenager. They talk to kids until they find out something like an address, phone number, school, and district. Once they got information like that, they can find out many other things about kids. This is extremely dangerous and unfortunately, it does, and has happened. As you can see there are many advantages as well as disadvantages. I believe, if people can find a balance between them, people will agree more about computers. In my opinion computers are handy, but dangerous. If kids are more careful online, and spend more time outside than on the computer, there would be less controversy. Parents would be less concerned about their child's safety and health if kids only used computers for homework, and were safe about who they talk to online. Also, what kids say in profiles. If all of this happened, there would be a balance, and I think people would be less divided over time, and people would be more comfortable with the use of computers."
827	829	1	3	Computers are an amazing technology to life. It's amazing because the computer helps lots of people and jobs. The people it helps are kids in school to look up an area they need to find for a question on a worksheet. They can quickly access various educational resources to get accurate answers. Also the jobs it helps are the police, SWAT and the military. It helps the police and SWAT to find where people are and where they'll be, using advanced tracking and surveillance software. The military uses computers to locate where they will attack or defend, analyzing geographical data and intelligence. If it wasn't for computers we wouldn't have found certain criminals or solved complex cases. The bad thing about computers are hackers and people that won't get off their computers. They are obsessed with the computer and they are so obsessed they sleep with the computer. That's the parents' fault. Those are the only bad things about computers. They get people fat and lazy because they only want to be on the computer. The computer also has good ways to reconnect with family and friends over the years you haven't seen them. Through social media and video - chat platforms, people can stay in touch easily. The computer controls lots of things like the nuclear bomb, security, secret - files, satellites, all of aerospace and more. They control life in the major part. People shouldn't be concerned about kids that sit there next to a computer all day because it's the person's fault, they ruined their lives and the parent's fault mainly for not controlling their kid with staying away from the computer or the parents not signing them up for any sport. It ruins their life by having no friends at school and all they do is go straight for the computer. It's a shame to the father that used to be the cool kid, make fun of the nerds and get into fights every month. Then the father looks at his son and realizes his son is a nerd and lives by a computer, then the father tries to help the son and somewhat works out. Then the father keeps trying, that's good parenting to try to step it right when the child starts to go straight to the computer. Not the other parents that let their son/daughter only use the computer. Those are my opinions on computers of the good and bad ideas. In conclusion, while computers offer numerous benefits, proper usage and parental guidance are crucial to avoid the negative impacts.
828	830	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, Computers have a positive impact on people. Although people aren't outside being active, computers still benefit in a good way. Computers teach hand - eye coordination. There are many websites on the internet that teach kids to type. These websites often use interactive games and exercises to make typing practice engaging. Typing helps kids learn the alphabet, learn what the letters look like and shows them where the keys are. Also, there are other sites where the computer interacts with you, providing real - time feedback on your typing speed and accuracy. Last, there are many kids even adults who have dyslexia and get their letters jumbled, but there are softwares where when you type it will say what letter you have typed. Therefore computer teach hand - eye coordination. Have you ever been one of those students who write their papers, but get bad grades because their handwriting was messy? Using a computer is more convenient and will make your due assignment as neat as ever. First, computer are convenient because you have the answer to any question just at the click of a button. You can access a vast amount of information from multiple sources instantly. Next, there's no need to spend money and go buy a book to look up research just research online for free. There are numerous free databases and educational websites available. Finally, it is convenient for teachers and your employees, because if you need to send in a paper do it via - email. Getting a paper by email is much easier than getting it in pen with samples. Computer are convenient in many ways. Computers allow people to video chat and talk online. First, there are many families who have at least one member who lives in a different place. Computer allow families to see each other online. Without ever leaving their state. They can have face - to - face conversations and share important moments. Next, there are other families who have a mom, dad, husband or wife in the army and haven't seen each other in person in years, but see each other online. This helps maintain emotional connections. Lastly, there are many students and teachers who teach and learn online. This is easy for most people who have busy lives. Therefore you can interact online. As you can see computers have a positive effect. They teach hand - eye coordination. They supply online chat, and are very convenient. So next time you go to the library to research a book, stay at home do the same online. In conclusion, computers are a valuable tool that offers multiple benefits and should be utilized effectively in our daily lives.
829	831	1	3	I believe having computers in a household is a good idea. They can play games, learn, talk and many more. Here are my three reasons having a computer is a good thing. Having a computer is great to play games! There are so many varieties to choose from. There are card games, board games, even action games! You can play solo, but it might be more fun and easier to bring some friends along for the ride. You can play multiplayer games with friends from different locations, enhancing the social aspect of gaming. As you can see having a computer can be fun, but it's not the only thing to do on a computer. Using a computer to learn is wonderful too. The computer can take you to places you have never seen, heard, or been to before, or maybe a place you couldn't afford to go. Through virtual tours and online documentaries, you can explore different cultures and landscapes. You can learn that in one place it's sunny all the time and in other places it's not. Another thing the computer can teach you is about animals. Animals have been here way before us. There is still much we don't know about them. Many scientists have spent their lives studying animals and have put it on the internet for you to better educate yourself. You can watch animal behavior videos and read in - depth research. The computer can also teach you hand - eye coordination. Hand - eye coordination is great to have if you're trying out for a sport like football, baseball, and basketball. Also you never know when you'll need to catch something. My final reason is also very helpful. Being able to talk on the computer is good. Using voice chat or instant messenger is your choice. While talking on the computer you might make some new friends that share the same interests and hobbies you do. And you can chat with them as long as they're online. Also while you're talking you can express your ideas and feelings. Sometimes you might just need to blow off some steam. Or maybe post an idea that can one day be famous. As you can see games, learning and talking are easier to do on the computer. This is why I think having a computer in a household is a great asset that can enrich our lives in multiple ways.
830	832	1	3	Dear editor, computers are good for people because it really helps with their work and homework and other stuff. For work, computers can automate repetitive tasks, increasing efficiency and productivity. They allow employees to create detailed reports, presentations, and analyze data quickly. In terms of homework, students can easily access educational resources, conduct research, and type up their assignments neatly. Moreover, computers can also be used for various other activities such as managing personal finances, shopping online, and staying in touch with friends and family through social media and messaging apps. They have become an essential part of modern life, making many aspects of our daily routines more convenient and accessible. In conclusion, the benefits of computers are numerous, and they play a significant role in enhancing our lives and helping us achieve our goals.
831	833	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, Are you spending all your precious time sitting in front of a computer? On the computer, you're probably wasting every second aimlessly searching or mindlessly playing games. You shouldn't spend a lot of time on the computer as it will just dull your mind. You shouldn't be on computers for a long time because instead, you should be actively exercising, leisurely enjoying nature, and meaningfully interacting with people.   First of all, spending too much time on the computer is not good for you because you should be out getting some exercise. On computers, you can't jog off the fat you gain by indulging in delicious food. By jogging instead of sitting in front of the computer, you can lose weight and experience the real world rather than the virtual world behind the computer screen. Nevertheless, computers are fun to use, like when playing addicting games. But isn't it better to play a real sport like soccer? In soccer, you have to use your mind a great deal, so it is much better than sitting or lying around, dazed at a computer screen for a long period of time. Don't you love playing outdoor games! Like playing tag or hide - and - seek, isn't that more fun than playing an addicting game on the computer screen? For me, I definitely think it is. That is my reason why I think you should exercise instead of staring at the computer screen.  Secondly, you shouldn't be on the computer for a long amount of time because you should instead be enjoying nature. Nature is beautiful and refreshing, unlike a computer. Yeah, I know computers offer a lot, but do they offer the fresh air outside, the gentle warm breeze, and the living animals of the earth? I don't think so, and neither should you. Instead of going on your computer when it's raining, you should play with your pets. And if you don't have any, put on a raincoat and grab an umbrella and go outside. Especially in the @DATE1, you should be outside enjoying nature, like going for a swim or taking your annoying little siblings to the park. There is so much more to do than sitting in front of a computer.  More importantly, you shouldn't go on the computer because you are better off interacting with living people in person. On the computer, when talking to people, you're going nowhere. Chatting with people on the computer, it is impossible to read someone's expression. So get off the computer and hang out with your family and friends. Engage in a fun conversation or a lively debate. Make new friends when you're at the mall or exploring a new trail in a park. Do anything but interact on the computer when all you see is typed words being written back to you. Get yourself out in the world, don't just interact with people but also with the world, not just the computer screen.  In conclusion, you shouldn't spend most of your precious time on the computer. It isn't necessary for you to spend all your time on the computer when you could be exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with people. I strongly believe people should be outside rather than on a computer. So what are you waiting for? Get off that computer and take a hike!
832	834	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4, The average teenager spends @NUM1 hours on a computer daily! People spend an excessive amount of time on their computers. As a result, they don't exercise as much as they should nowadays. Also, they don't take the time to enjoy all the wonderful aspects of nature that the world has to offer. Most importantly, people who spend too much time on the computer don't have enough quality time with their family and friends. These are the reasons why people shouldn't spend so much of their time on a computer.  Since people spend too much time on the computer, they exercise less and less. A recent poll shows that @NUM2 in every @NUM3 @CAPS5 is overweight. If our modern society didn't have so many distractions like computers, then maybe people would be more active and go outside. Back in @DATE5, only @PERCENT2 of the @CAPS6 population was obese. So, why in @DATE6 has this number skyrocketed to @PERCENT1? Back then, electronics weren't as popular, so for fun, kids played games with each other outside on a regular basis. Now it's rare for a kid to be motivated to put down the mouse and go play kickball with neighborhood friends. The kids would rather sit inside an air - conditioned house than go outside and have some good, healthy fun and work up a sweat. Computers keep people from exercising, so their impact on people is negative.  With computers being so popular, people are less involved with nature. Our society doesn't take the time to notice the cool breeze on an @DATE4 @TIME1, or the waves crashing on a hot @DATE3 @TIME1. They don't take the time to appreciate how beautiful the foliage is in @DATE2, or how it feels to be showered with snow on a chilly @DATE1 @TIME1. People would rather sit at a computer for @NUM4 hours, missing out on the wonders of our world. People don't respect the natural beauties that nature has to offer. Computers take away from people enjoying nature's joys.  Computers also ruin people's relationships with family and friends. @NUM5 - year - old @CAPS7 would rather talk to his girlfriend on the computer than spend time with his @CAPS8. Kids don't organize their priorities well enough. As it is, adding a computer into the mix just makes it worse. People have accounts on social networking sites like Facebook, and sometimes they are very drama - filled and cause problems. Friendships are easily ruined, and usually, the cause of this is some kind of misunderstanding. It is very sad but true that kids would rather watch goofy videos than visit a grandparent. Computers are negative to people since they ruin their relationships with friends and family.  People should spend less time on the computer. Computers are a main factor in the vast increase in obesity rates. Kids need to regain their health before it's too late! Also, people of all ages should realize the natural beauty of nature, but computers get in the way of that. Most importantly, computers ruin many relationships with friends and family, causing stress and unnecessary drama. As you can see, computers have a negative effect on people. We should all make an effort to reduce our computer time and embrace a more active and natural lifestyle.
833	835	1	3	When you were a kid, did your parents let you play all day on the computer? Well, my parents don't let me, and I think that's not fair. I think it's not fair because being on the computer has a lot of great benefits, like teaching you hand - eye coordination. Another advantage is that when you're on the computer, you can have real - time chats with people through webcams. Also, with a computer, you can do homework assignments, especially those that require you to do in - depth research. And of course, when you're on a computer, you can watch your favorite movie or TV show, like @CAPS1 @CAPS2 or @CAPS3 @CAPS4. Now aren't these some great advantages?  As an adult, @CAPS5, I'm pretty sure that you like to do a lot of things from the comfort of your own home. Well, when you have a computer, you can. One way you can keep in touch is by online chatting, like through the webcam or my favorite @CAPS6, which stands for AOL Instant Messaging. Surprisingly, another thing you can do is work online. You can set it up at work or teach your boss how to do it. By the way, if you're an adult who didn't go to college when you were @NUM1 because you had to work, well, if you have a computer or laptop, you can go to school online. And the best thing is that you'll be in your bed, nice and warm without any worries. Now don't you think that is a nice way to spend your @DATE1 @TIME1?  When you're a kid my age, when you have a computer, all you want to do is play games online with friends. Well, that is what most of us kids do nowadays, but our parents don't let us play too much. The only time they let us stay on for a long time is when we're maybe doing a project for school. But when you're a kid, besides playing games all day, we also want to learn about things like @LOCATION1 or the @CAPS7 @CAPS8. That's what we're interested in.  Most people would agree that when you have a computer, you can just book a hotel online instead of going all the way to the hotel. Of course, that's what my parents do. Every time we go on vacation, they look up everything online, like the hotel, the flights, and the activities. Yes, having a computer is very helpful. Another thing you can do is watch movies online when you are on a plane going to your vacation, because that's what I do with my laptop. But the thing I like the most is watching shows. Every time I watch different episodes of @CAPS9 @PERSON1, the time goes by so quickly that a @NUM2 - hour flight only seems like @NUM3 hours.  Finally, I have explained to you why having a computer is a good thing. One reason is because you can do a lot of things on the computer itself. A second reason is that you can do a lot of school - related work with it, like doing a research paper or going to school online. And my final reason was that you can book things online without going anywhere and wasting gas. So now it's your turn to decide whether having a computer is a good thing or a bad thing. We should all recognize the numerous advantages that computers bring to our lives and make good use of them.
834	836	1	3	Dear local newspaper @CAPS1, I think that kids should be allowed to go on their computers. So they can talk to their relatives across the @CAPS5 @CAPS2 whenever they want to. I have family members in @LOCATION1. I talk to them every day because I have a laptop, and they've shared a lot with me. They told me about my mother living in @LOCATION2. I believed them because I have their email. So I asked my mother, and she said yes, that is true. Then I looked up where my mom lived. Thanks to the computer, I also learned that @LOCATION3 has one of the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 in The @CAPS5. So I asked my mom if I can go to @LOCATION3, and she said yes. So I went with my sister, and we even visited our family members. And the @CAPS6 point I can tell you, it looked exactly how I pictured it. It was very tall, covered with trees. Birds were chirping, squirrels were climbing trees. The thing that surprised me the most was that there was a house on top of the mountain for sale. I wished that my mom was there because she would love it. So every time we go down there, we rent that house, all thanks to the computers.  Lastly, you can even look up people on the internet. I heard that Criss Rock almost died. So when I got home, I went on my laptop and looked it up. It said nothing about that, but it did say one thing that surprised me the most. It said that he was getting a divorce from his wife. I think the person who said that he almost died probably misread it. So now I look up all my favorite people. Thanks to computers, the time is now to accept that people should have computers to use to learn about the @CAPS5 or just to verify what everyone says. So I hope you make a good choice. But before you choose, think about all the wonderful things that computers can offer, like connecting with family, learning new things, and discovering new places.
835	837	1	3	Dear, @ORGANIZATION1, the big rectangular - shaped black or white box with lights and beeps, the computer was a smart idea! But why do you ask? I'll show you. This device can teach you a new language. Skype can let you talk to @CAPS1 on the web or on the phone! (But you still have to pay @MONEY1.) You can surf the web or have a good laugh on YouTube. Who needs to go out and buy stuff when on eBay or Amazon you can just order and you're done! (But you still have to wait.) Why go to Blockbuster to rent movies when you can go on Netflix and order a movie and keep it for as long as you like? No late fees, no driving all the way to the movie store. No more of that hassle, please!  Next, let's go back to the web. If you own a @CAPS3 or a built - in camera on your laptop or netbook, you can video - chat with @CAPS1 and family across the globe! If you're the kind of person that likes video games, then boy, you will love this! @CAPS5 ~~@CAPS6's can download games such as The Sims, Spore, etc. Then you will love the @CAPS6. MACs also share good features such as the Finder, Safari, Dashboard, etc. So that's all I have to say about @CAPS8.  And now you are probably asking which computer should I get? @CAPS9 @CAPS12 friend's at @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1, you have the ability to choose either @CAPS8 or @CAPS6. But it's not @CAPS12 decision to pick out your computer; it's yours. So go out and create an investment for a computer today! But I'm not finished yet. You can also pick a laptop, a desktop, or a netbook.
836	838	1	3	Dear Newspaper writers, I believe that different websites have different effects on people. For example, pull @ORGANIZATION1 has news about what is going on in the world. This kind of news - related website keeps people informed about global events. Other websites with all different types of games on them could be bad for some people because some of the games are not very appropriate. These inappropriate games might have violent or vulgar content. Most educational websites are meant to help people learn. They offer a wide range of courses and materials. One person can learn so much with a computer. You can buy and sell an item that you own and get many services all on one website. A computer can be used for many different purposes. In conclusion, the diversity of websites means that people should choose wisely according to their needs and values.
837	839	1	3	Computers are one of the best advances in technology ever made. Not only are computers fun but they're also very beneficial to society. First off, computers are a great way to communicate with other people whether it's instant - messaging, email, video - messaging, or services like @ORGANIZATION1. On @DATE1, we witnessed how important this communication aspect is. Computers offer many learning opportunities. There are thousands of websites with information about your search whether it be about simple things like how to bake cookies or even more complex searches like how many stars are in the sky. Last but not least, computers just simply make life easier by helping you with everyday needs. To begin, computers are a great source of communication. I remember a time when my father traveled to @LOCATION1 on business. Because it costs so much money to pay for international cellphone service, my dad could not call using his cell phone. Instead, my father called using @ORGANIZATION1. It was great because it was right on the computer. Besides making live communication easier, computers also help to communicate news, weather. A few weeks ago, the power at home was out. It was during @DATE1, so my family had no way to get information through the usual channels. Since computers are more reliable than our cable provider, we were able to look up the school situation on our computer. School was indeed closed. Through our computer, we connected with the world. Plus, computers offer more learning opportunities. Aside from being a great source of communication, computers are fantastic for searching and research. For almost all of my school assignments that required research, I've used a computer. Sometimes, you can even find articles from library books online. Some people say that the library is always the best place to find information but I disagree. More than half the time, the internet has beyond enough information for what I need. Studies show that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people say that computers answered their question better than any library book did. Also, computers make life a whole lot easier. Computers make life so much easier. From typing to research to communicating and even to making travel arrangements, computers help to make everyday chores a lot easier. When my cousin was in high school, she was assigned a @NUM3 - word essay for homework. First off, it's a pain having to count every word and also, most importantly it's no fun having to write that much so my cousin decided to just type it. It saves time and is way neater. She finished her typed essay in @NUM4 hour while her friend finished in @NUM4 + @NUM4/2 hours because she hand - wrote it. It's clear that things are easier on computers. To conclude, computers are beneficial because they're a great source of communication, they offer many learning opportunities, and they make life so much easier. Thank you for reading, and I hope I've persuaded you to agree with my position that computers are one of the best advances in technology ever accomplished and why they are so beneficial to society.
838	840	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I agree that computers do have a positive effect on people. I agree, because being on the computer teaches you hand - eye coordination, helps people learn about faraway places and people, and allows people to talk to other people. By being on the computer it helps teach people hand - eye coordination. So the computer helps with hand - eye coordination by using the mouse and keyboard. For example, when you use a computer you don't need to look at your hands while you use the mouse. That helps with hand - eye coordination, because you can see where your hand is without looking. Another example is the keyboard. While learning where all the keys are, you memorize them. Then soon you can type without looking. This skill is quite useful in daily work and study. The computer also helps you to learn. When you go on the computer, the thing people often go on is the internet. On the internet, people can find information about faraway places or people. So, because the computer has different links and websites, it helps kids and adults everywhere to get information fast. Without the computer, everyone would have to go to a library, but what if they didn't have the right information? Then you would need to search around everywhere to find a book. That's why a computer is handy. Also, the computer allows people to stay in touch with others farther away. One example of this is that there are chat rooms or groups people can join. So, if a relative or friend is farther away or if they are down the street, with chat rooms it makes talking easier. Also, by these chat rooms and groups it makes a lot of people happy knowing that they can still talk with an old friend or relative instead of losing them from never seeing or talking to them. That is just another example why the computer has a positive effect. So, with the examples of the computer helping teach hand - eye coordination, making obtaining information easier, and the many other reasons, it's evident that the computer has a positive effect on people.
839	841	1	3	Dear local Newspaper, Computers don't take exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with friends and family away from you. Your family can set time limits on the computer if they think you're spending too much time on it. If you have time limits, then people will have a certain time they go on and off of the computer. For example, if a child is on the computer @NUM1 and you can't get them off, time limits will stop that. The child is on a game and if the time limits are on, when their time is done the computer logs off automatically. That way your child can't get back on till their next allotted time. The computer can do many things. You can play online games and chat with friends. Chatting will let you talk to friends over the computer and you won't need to call them. Online games will still let you talk to your friends but you can have an avatar you can dress up and be creative with. For example, an online game can let you chat, make friends, and have a lot of fun. In conclusion, with proper time management, computers can be a great addition to our lives without taking away from important aspects.
840	842	1	3	"@CAPS1. The computer is a wonderful thing! However, the effects it has on people can be bad. Think of it this way, it has magnetic forces that pull people to it and keep them @CAPS3 for hours. These magnetic forces keep people from exercising, stops them from spending time with family and friends, and most importantly, if they aren't being careful they can get into some cyber danger. I spoke with the @CAPS2 of @PERSON2 and he said, ""There are so many people on their computers, people aren't getting enough exercise!"" When people don't get enough exercise, their bodies expand and become obese. This happens a lot to average people. The @CAPS2 and I thought up some great ideas while I was @CAPS3 and we think for one week in @DATE1 we are going to live without any electricity! Computers are very useful. They help spread important information around fast and make it easy to talk to friends and family. Even though you are talking to them, you are not learning any new social skills. Typing on the computer is a lot different from talking in person. Usually, you would type ""u"" instead of ""you"" or ""r"" instead of ""are"". Talking over the computer is great!"" says @PERSON1, ""But actually seeing my family and talking to them is way better."" @CAPS6, @CAPS7, @CAPS8, and many more websites can put you in cyber danger! Cyber danger is when you get in trouble on the computer. This can happen when you put up bad pictures of yourself or other people, when you talk to someone you have never met before, or you say something really mean to that girl you don't like. Those situations can all put you in a really tough place. Even if you have a webpage and you put it on private, there is always a way to get in. There is also something called cyberbullying. Cyberbullying is when you get bullied or are bullying another person over the computer. Don't think that no one will know. There are ways to track down conversations between people. I really hope you all take this into account when you think about sitting at your computer! Go outside, spend time with your family and friends, and be careful from cyber danger! ""@NUM1"" bye!"
841	843	1	3	A lot of people would disagree that computers are benefiting people. But I think that computers are extremely helpful because they are an excellent way to learn, they are a source of great fun to use, and it's also a wonderful way to talk to old friends. I know there are some people who are on computers a lot more than they should, but still, computers are very helpful. Computers are a very good way to learn because on a computer, you could easily find out who the president of the United States is. But if you didn't use a computer and you went to a library, it could take hours to find the right book and find where in the book the information is. You could also learn about news faster without waiting for it to come on the news channel. Computers are a lot better than having to drive to a library because with just a couple of clicks, you could find what you want and be done. Computers are also fun because you can play little games on the internet that could easily take up an extra 15 minutes that you might have on a work break or before school. And even some games exercise your mind, like solitaire; it's fun but challenging. But there are some games that people tend to overdo because they get addicted. But most people haven't ever played a game like that or only play once in a while. Lastly, computers are a good way to stay in touch with old friends because there are a lot of ways to talk to people online. Like, say if when you were in high school, your best friends moved away, you could still talk to them in a chat room where you can text or in a video chat where you actually see them face to face. In conclusion, I think computers are helpful because you can learn, play, and talk to people. Computers are truly all - around helpful.
842	844	1	3	"Dear esteemed local community, I think that computers have a positive effect on people. Do you think that they are positive on people? Well, I'll give you three reasons why you should say ""Yes"". Firstly, computers teach hand - eye coordination. Secondly, they offer the ability to learn and get your diploma online. Thirdly, you can talk to people all over the world. These are the three reasons. The first reason is hand - eye coordination. If you have good hand - eye coordination, you can achieve anything. This can help you get a job and even assist with a sport you like. Having hand - eye coordination is important because in today's world, everything revolves around computers and cell phones. This is the first reason. The second reason is how the computer can teach people things. The internet has a plethora of websites about how to get your diploma online. And you can take online classes. There is a 20% drop - out rate and 30% of those kids don't have their diploma, so they go online to take their classes. The computer can really help you. This is the second reason. Finally, people go online to chat rooms to talk and meet new people. Meeting new people is a good thing to experience. You can learn about where and how the person lives. Chat rooms are cool too. You can go online and talk to your friends without wasting your phone minutes. The computer can help in many ways. This is the last reason. OK, I'm done but do you remember that question I asked you? (Do you think the computers are a positive effect on people?) What do you think? I hope you say ""Yes, they are a positive effect"". But anyway, those are the three reasons why. P.S. I hope you go out and buy a computer after reading this!!"
843	845	1	3	Dear @LOCATION1, As everybody realizes, technology is getting more advanced every single day. That is a good thing and could help people with everyday problems like shopping, getting an answer to a problem, and completing office work. The more advanced computers become, the more advanced people are. To start, computers can help people communicate. Just imagine someone on the other side of the world. You can use websites like Skype and e - mail to quickly communicate by typing. I mean, apps like Zoom can quickly send live videos of yourself all the way across the world. Without these technologies, we would never see each other's faces and we would only be using telephones. With a social media book, you can also share memories like never before. Have you ever been in the situation when you can't share your memories? Well, I have. Memories can be easily uploaded in a matter of minutes. It used to be that news traveled very slowly. However, we can know about it only a few minutes after it happened, thanks to computers. Computers can relay information at practically the speed of light. It is also a lot easier to find the news. You only need to move the mouse a few times and you find the biggest reservoir of news ever. There is international news, local news, and much more in the palm of your hand. News also travels faster on the internet than on news radio or TV. There are also online news sources like the New York Times and magazines like Time. Have you ever felt sick and you didn't want to leave your house? Well, you can do all your shopping online. There is no more going to a store to buy furniture or clothes; you can just log on to a computer and have almost every store at your fingertips. Buy a whole set of bedroom furniture, a comfortable couch, and even your groceries in only ten minutes. You can even shop for houses or cars online. Shopping on the internet has truly changed the world in more ways than anyone could have believed fifteen years ago. To conclude, computers have made life easier for almost every person who has one. As computers get smarter, maybe they can also do incredible things like work for us and automatically buy something for us if we are running out of essentials. The possibilities are endless.
844	846	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I have heard about this issue concerning people spending too much time on their computers. In my opinion, I think that people should not spend so much time on the computer for several reasons. There are reasons why I think that people should spend less time on the internet and more time outdoors. One reason why I think that people should spend less time on the computer and more time outdoors is so that they can get more exercise. When you get exercise, you can lose weight. You can also feel lighter and better about yourself, and you will be more active. For example, going for a jog in the park can make you feel energized. Another reason why you should spend more time outdoors than on the computer is because if you don't, you will get very, very lazy. If you don't get out and play or exercise, you will become tired. Also, you will become cranky and not want to do what your parents tell you to do because your mind will be so focused on your computer screen. My last but not least reason why we should spend more time outdoors than indoors on the computer is because we can miss out on family fun that goes on. Since people are on the computer so much, they miss out on parties and social events. They may also miss out on family dinners and movie nights. If you do not want to miss out on the fun, I suggest that you go out more and stop being a lazy couch potato. As you can see, there are many reasons why we should spend more time outdoors doing activities such as going on a bike ride, going out to eat, or even taking a nice stroll along the beach while walking the dog. I really hope that my opinions mean something to you. And I also hope you agree with me. Thank you for your time.
845	847	1	3	"@ORGANIZATION1, ""Why not advance in technology?"" asks four - year - old @PERSON2. There are countless reasons. People are spending way too much time on the technology we already have, such as the computer. Instead of wasting time on this device, people aren't exercising, enjoying nature, and spending quality time with their friends and family. When you are on the computer for one hour, how many calories do you think you're burning? According to a study done at @ORGANIZATION2, one of the best colleges in the world, you're only burning 50 calories. To maintain a healthy weight, you must burn at least 1,000 calories a day! The average citizen in @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1 spends 4 hours on the computer, so that's 200 calories. Even if they did aerobic exercise for the rest of the day, they couldn't burn enough calories because you can only burn 300 calories an hour at the average aerobics class. If people can't maintain a healthy weight, they become obese. If they are obese, they can get heart attacks, and if they have a heart attack, they could die! 20% of the obese population in the country die from a heart attack. Without a doubt, computers are like poison. If you use it, you'll get sick - but if you use too much, you'll die. Imagine - birds chirping up in the trees, deer sipping water out of a nice cold pond. In the distance, a fox playfully chases a butterfly. If you are in 20% of the people who have actually seen something like this with your own eyes, you're lucky. ""Dear fellow citizens, I painfully state this fact. The rainforest in @LOCATION3 is being cut down as we speak. This is because people never go out and smell fresh air and see how beautiful the rainforest really is. We must stop them!"" pleads former leader @PERSON3 in an internationally televised speech. Too bad only 10 out of every 100 citizens could relate to this message. 30% of citizens have never gone out into nature. Because of this, people are saying who cares about nature and the rain forest? ""Because of this, the rainforest is mercilessly being destroyed and animals are losing their homes. When a poll was given to the 30% of people who don't ever go outside to enjoy nature, 70% of them responded that it was because they are too busy spending time on the computer. The computer is a monster - it's killing our planet."" ""I love my mommy. I hug her every day before dinner,"" sadly states eight - year - old @PERSON1. Using computers kills time that could be spent with your loved ones, even if you are communicating with them on the computer. A 10 - year - old cancer patient, @ORGANIZATION3, was on his deathbed. When asked what he wished that he could change about his life, he answered, ""I wish that I didn't use the computers as much so I could get to know my family and friends better!"" @ORGANIZATION3 died later that day. Do you want to carry around that heavy of a burden with you until your death? No, you don't. In a drug rehab, the @ORGANIZATION4 asked the patients why they started drugs in the first place. 40% answered that it was because they didn't feel loved by their families. After they answered, they were asked why they didn't feel loved. 50% of them answered because the people that they love were too busy on the computers. Unless you want to put one of your loved ones in the hospital, do not use the computers so much. Obviously, computers are awful technological devices. Yes, they do help with coordination, but would you rather be fast, not enjoy family and nature, but be able to catch a ball or be healthy, loved, and loving?"
846	848	1	3	Computers are very helpful in many ways. I believe that computers can have a very great and much - needed impact on you. @CAPS5 can cause you to @CAPS1, @CAPS2 and get cheap @CAPS3. The computer can @CAPS1 you in many interesting ways. The fastest way @CAPS5 can @CAPS1 is by helping others plan @CAPS4 vacations by sending money to them. Also, @CAPS5 can @CAPS1 by knowing how to do different things like finding directions if you get lost or showing you how to get there. The second way it helps is to give @CAPS2. The computer can give you plenty of useful @CAPS2. I use the computer @CAPS4 to get @CAPS2 @CAPS7 of information. @CAPS5 also gives me @CAPS2 about a @CAPS8 college that I would @CAPS9 and like to attend. The last way the computer helps is with shopping. If you @CAPS10 online, you can do it right from the comfort of your computer. I @CAPS9 this machine because you don't have to buy something that just came out @CAPS4 at the real expensive @CAPS12 price. You can just @CAPS10 online and @CAPS11 @CAPS5 @CAPS4 at a cheaper @CAPS12 price. Also, when @CAPS13 mom wanted to @CAPS11 new @CAPS15 at the dealer, but @CAPS5 was expensive, so she went online and bought @CAPS5 cheaper than they would sell @CAPS5 to us. This is how the computer can come in handy when you need @CAPS5. This is why I believe that computers are truly beneficial to you.
847	849	1	3	Dear, Local @ORGANIZATION1 paper, I do think that computers benefit society. For instance, if a student needs to write a report about Europe, they are going to rely well on a computer. A computer can provide quick and accessible information so that students can do their projects at home. Computers are great ways to meet people online so that you can stay social and not feel isolated. They also teach hand - eye coordination, making your eyes better at seeing and reacting. I also think computers benefit society because they can get students motivated in passing their tests or getting through the school year and getting to use it. Computers are also a great source of knowledge and can get kids to be better in a subject like history or science. You should agree with me because local @ORGANIZATION1 papers often get their information off the internet. Without computers, @ORGANIZATION1 would be slow and inefficient. Computers also have positive effects on people because they teach them the dangers of things and make them more cautious. And computers give your fingers a stronger grip and make you type a lot faster. Computers are the fastest way to know about the @ORGANIZATION1 or about the weather. For example, if there is going to be a snow storm, you can check if you have school. In conclusion, computers play a vital role in our society and bring numerous benefits.
848	850	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, Have you ever thought about how computers affect human beings? The impacts? The results? The education? I believe that computers have a positive effect on people. Computers allow people to talk with others online, have the ability to educate in certain areas, and teach hand - eye coordination. Who says the only way to contact or communicate with someone is through letters or the phone? The technology brought upon using computers allows people to talk online with others in a fast, easy, and enjoyable way. Have a question that you have to ask a friend, but someone else is using the phone? Writing a letter takes time, and if your question is urgent, the computer is an easy alternative for communication. Say you're an amazing singer with a beautiful voice and you want to find an agent more than anything. Computers are so advanced in technology that they can find you an agent in no time. E - mail, websites, @CAPS1, and more, are all ways you can contact that agent. Computers are a great way to communicate. The mind is an extraordinary thing. It can be filled with knowledge and still have the ability to learn and understand more. Reading books is a fantastic way to learn, but the internet has so much more to offer. You are not only reading from one great author but tons of great authors. The computer allows you to learn about far - away places and important people without making that trip to the library. Have you ever heard of online colleges? They are advertised on @CAPS2.V. all the time. Some people @MONTH1 think that learning from home, laying in bed with a laptop placed in front of them is a distractive way to learn. But what about being comfortable and not intimidated by anyone else around you? Computers can help you get your college degree in a comfortable environment. Hand - eye coordination is an excellent and wonderful thing to have. Along with video games, computer games teach you exactly that. Parents @MONTH1 think we kids are wasting our time playing games on the computer, but we are actually challenging our minds and our hand - eye coordination ability. Computers are key when it comes to psychological learning. Hand - eye coordination is taught to us through games and such that we play without us even knowing it. Hand - eye coordination allows us to catch a ball or play sports, and computers help us achieve that. In conclusion, computers bring a lot of positive aspects to our lives in terms of communication, education, and skill - building.
849	851	1	3	"@ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 studies have been conducted over the past few years, and they show that people of all ages spend @PERCENT1 of their free time on the computers. This is becoming a problem all over our state and country. Computers are consuming the lives of everyone. An anonymous source claims that they use their computer to contact old friends. A study shows that phone usage has gone down because adults and teens would prefer to email or instant message a friend. This results in sitting in front of a computer screen waiting for a response. @PERSON1, a student at @ORGANIZATION2 says, ""I go on the computer once or twice a week. I don't use it all that much because I'd rather be out having fun with all my friends rather than be holed up in a room by myself."" Some people believe it is a way to be more social, but it really isn't. It's just sitting in front of a screen talking to people you @MONTH1 not even know too well. When you sit down in your computer chair and start e - mailing away, you aren't doing any physical exercise. The only movement people will normally do is get up and go to the bathroom. Then they are right back in a chair, making minimal movements. @PERCENT2 of people who sit in front of a computer end up obese because they don't burn any calories. Since they don't release many endorphins, they aren't very happy. If they got up and went outdoors to do physical exercise, they would be fit and happy. Often, teenagers feel more powerful when they are using a computer. They find it easier to disobey rules their parents set for them. Teens also find it easier to bully other children via the internet or social networks. @NUM1 out of @NUM2 students at @ORGANIZATION2 middle @ORGANIZATION2 confess to being the target of malicious bullying online. @NUM3 out of @NUM2 confess to being bullied, and they definitely don't want to be bullied on Facebook or MySpace where everything is out on your profile for your peers to see. Teens should have limited time on the computer, so they don't do anything they will regret in their future. Therefore, adults and teens should be aware that using a computer is fine, but they shouldn't over - use the luxury of a way to find information quickly or contact a friend in a foreign country. This generation needs to be reminded that their whole life shouldn't be spent on the computer. Probably less than @NUM5 minutes a day should be spent checking your e - mail or instant messaging a friend. Then you should go outdoors and spend time with your friends and family. In conclusion, we need to control our computer usage to avoid the negative impacts it brings."
850	852	1	3	@ORGANIZATION1, With the recent development of technology in today's society, I know that there is a lot of controversy with computers. Many people believe that computers are positive towards our society, while others disagree. I feel that technology can be both good and bad. Technology provides great advancements in our world. Look at modern medicine; it would be nothing without today's technology in computers. We can also look at today's military. Computers practically run today's armed forces. But who knows where technology can take us. Our society could continue to greatly advance with the help of computers. But then again, we could all wonder where would we be today without computers. So @ORGANIZATION1, as you can see, computers have helped our society greatly with improvement and progression. But with all of this technology, we still need to find a balance. It is reported that today's @CAPS1 spend over @NUM1 hours per week on computers. People are not experiencing the world outside of their computers. Our state does put in a significant amount of money each year for our parks just so we can ignore them. Also, with increased computer time, people are not getting outside. They aren't getting proper exercise. You @MONTH1 even notice that if you use the computer too much, you will miss more interactions with your family. So although computers can be very useful, you need to be able to turn off the computer and realize the true important things in your life, besides the computers. Computers can be both good and bad. But I think that we need to find a balance between the two. Computers are useful to our daily life, but at the same time, we also need to realize that we need to sometimes take a break from our computers. Let's face it, without computers today, we would not be able to function. Entire companies revolve around computers, and if computers just ended, a large number of people would lose their jobs. But also, regular people, for example, teens, do not need to be on the computer for four hours a day. Those four hours could be spent with their families. We need to find a balance. For example, you could say for every hour you're on the computer, you need to spend that same hour to go outside, spend time with your family, etc. Computers are useful, but we cannot over - use them. So, to the @ORGANIZATION1, computers help our society thrive. But at the same time, we need to learn when we have had enough time on the computer. So I believe that we can all find a healthy balance in computer use.
851	853	1	3	Dear local newspaper, Computers are incredibly powerful machines in our modern world. Most people seem to almost “eat, sleep, and drink” computer-related activities. That often applies to those who are forty and still live with their mom. For the most part, computers are widely used by teenagers and business workers. Computers are an essential tool that should be used in everyday life. We all vividly remember when we pretended to be “sick” just so we could go to the office with mom or dad to draw pictures and spin in the office chairs. Well, while we were busy having fun, mom and dad were also hard at work. They talked to their boss, made copies, had meetings, drank coffee, and most importantly, they spent half of the day doing work on the computer. It could have been making a spreadsheet, designing logos, editing someone's work, or getting new clients. About ninety percent of the workers use the computer to do their jobs. They need to send work to other companies overseas or just down one floor. Computers need to be used to do most jobs in @LOCATION1. Also, the computers in today's time are truly beautiful because they have the internet. The internet allows us to talk to people around the world and look things up like the news, the closest bridal shop, the biggest shopping mall, the biggest race car track near you, and pizza places near you. The internet can let you do many amazing things. I know that here in Granby you have to buy the newspaper, but instead of buying the paper, you can just go on your computer and check the news. Look up the weather, the celebrity gossip, and where the plane crashed that your mom told you about. The computer can give you great information but only if you know how to use it properly. One thing that I find really great is that you can watch TV and movies right from your computer. Then you don't need to buy all those high - priced channels to watch movies. You can see your favorite shows and movies. A big thing is that teenagers spend a majority of their time on Facebook, Twitter, or MySpace. Some of the advantages you get from these online sites is that you can chat with an old friend and show them a picture of you and your family. You can let people know what you are doing or tell them you're sad because your dog died. You can just use the internet for just about anything. Lastly, something you can do is buy music on the computers. You don't need to go out and spend @MONEY1 on an album; you can now just buy a single song for a dollar. You can buy many things on the internet, like clothes and food. That's why the computer is such a remarkable invention.
852	854	1	3	My opinion is that the more time we spend on the computer, the lazier we become. One reason that I say this is because, in reality, a computer is like a very handy “person”. It can perform a vast array of tasks. Second reason is, people often stay in the house sitting down in front of the computer instead of exercising. The third reason is, people just sit in the house and don't get to enjoy the fresh air with their loved ones. First, the reason why I say a computer is a big handy “person” is because it does most of the things a human can do. That can lead a person to being extremely lazy. Just sitting in the house and browsing websites has a huge effect on a human's life. The computer technology has control over a huge population of people. It really makes them miss out on half of their day. Second, people stay in the house on the computer rather than getting exercise. It's extremely unhealthy for a person to sit down at a computer all day. The person has to eat, so basically they eat and then sit back down at the computer. It can get out of hand because the computer allows people to order food online. So that right there is a clear example of people not getting exercise and being lazy. You need to get your exercise daily. So people who don't get their exercise need to start. Instead of sitting down on the computer all day. Third, many people all over the world have a lot of loved ones that they care about and love deeply. “But” they don't get time to be with them because they are always on the computer. The computer shouldn't take you away from your outdoor life. Okay, so you can talk to your friends and family over the computer. It's never the same as seeing them in person. Go outside and create fun and happy memories with your family. Because the computer is just words being texted. It's nothing like having a real - life conversation. I guarantee you that. If you spend time with your family then you will want to do it again. While you're going out, exercise and be interacting. In conclusion, if you are always on the computer, that's not good. Just take a few hours out of the day to exercise. Go out and have a wonderful day. Because the computer doesn't do anything but make you lazier (@CAPS1 YOU). If you're always on the computer, just be sure that you get your exercise and your time with your family. It will make you a better person!
853	855	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Computers have both negative and positive impacts on people. Many people before us managed to go through everyday life without them. Although there are many good effects that computers have on people, the negative effects outnumber them by a significant margin. For example, generations have lived and died without computers and it didn't have a detrimental impact on their lives. Not only that, but many children and adults in this century are obese due to the growing prevalence of technology. Many people become obese because they were born into a world with this technology and after years, or even days, of sitting in front of their computer, they become lazy. They view a computer as a necessity rather than a form of entertainment. Even though computers keep people in contact and keep them updated in their lives, that is the only truly important reason for a computer. As a student, I use my computer for my schoolwork. Everything I do on my computer involves either typing a paper or printing research. I could do these things with paper and pencil and ask people what I'm trying to find out. This is important because it shows that people don't need to be dependent on computers when they can do everything they need to without them. Lastly, computers aren't needed when we have the availability of cell phones that keep everyone in contact without the distractions of computer games, chats, or profiles. Also, phones are relatively safe so they can't get viruses and strangers can't look at your personal information and find out where you live. In conclusion, computers aren't healthy, they keep you sitting without exercise, and they aren't necessary. We should be more mindful of our computer usage and find a better balance in our lives.
854	856	1	3	When you are using technology, usually it is work - related. A computer is used for work to write essays, make power points, and conduct research. When people use them for Facebook, MySpace, @CAPS1, and other chat platforms like live Oovoo and various websites, it is more for their personal pleasure. I only go on Facebook when I am checking my schedule for hockey. Most kids use it just to talk. Then there is Oovoo and online video chat used for talking with friends, but why not just call them up? When I think of Facebook, Oovoo, or even MySpace, it makes me think of the inappropriate pictures that kids and adults post. I think that is very unethical and extremely dangerous to post because once it's out there, you'll never get it back. For instance, I am always outside hanging around when it's warm out. During winter, I can understand going on Facebook, but during the @DATE1, there is absolutely no need. Just go outside and have fun. Kids wonder why they gain weight. Well, if you'd get off your computer and quit eating Twinkies, then you'll notice that you just have to be active. Some kids' parents don't really care what their kids do all day. They don't care if their kid is @NUM1 lbs. at the age of @NUM2. They don't care if their kids are sitting on the computer eating all day. If I could tell you what it must feel like to be a couch potato, I would, but I never go on the computer unless it is for homework. I used the computer just @TIME1. I typed up all of my homework except for my math. I didn't play one game, I didn't check email, go on the internet, or do anything else. I just worked my hardest and got it done. I conclude this with the fact that using a computer is not a bad thing. Using it repeatedly and not exercising is. A computer shouldn't need to be used for pleasure. It's not created to do so; it's created to keep your life simpler. People pay a lot of money to buy an expensive computer, monitor, and all those expensive technological accessories to make their lives much simpler. Nowhere in this essay did I say to play games because it's not what a computer is for. Playing games can be done outside; it doesn't have to be inside, and definitely doesn't have to be on a computer. To make everyone's life easier, kids, get off your lazy butts, get off the Twinkies, and stop playing on the computer. By doing so, you'll lead a healthier and more fulfilling life.
855	857	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 Newspaper, Have you ever wanted to see your @CAPS3 who lives across the country? Well, computers can make that possible. They have positive effects on people in numerous ways, such as letting people communicate with family or friends from across the world. They also make it incredibly easy to find whatever they @CAPS4. Many people worry that computers isolate people and keep them from talking to family or friends, but in fact, it is helping them by allowing them to chat or type to them. People can now talk to relatives in the comfort of their own home without having to worry about how they look. Computers also save on phone bills. For example, instead of calling your mom in @LOCATION1, you can just go on an online chat and chat with her. It's just as good, and in some cases, you can even see each other. Some people also think computers give people too much access to information, but in reality, it gives people the ability to know what they want. This is extremely good for school as well, as students can look for educational resources. In my experience, in fall @NUM1, or for people @CAPS6, you can see that computers let you find the information you need. The time has come to recognize that computers are not a bad thing that isolates or keeps people away from family. On the contrary, when used properly, they can enhance our connections and knowledge.
856	858	1	3	@ORGANIZATION1, I believe that we should tell the people of @LOCATION1 about the dangers of using computers too much. For instance, people who use the computer constantly spend significantly less time engaging in other activities in general. Also, the longer you stay on and use it, this habit gradually forms an addiction, which might be extremely hard to break. Finally, people who always play video games on computers begin to lose touch with reality. Computers are turning this nation into a bunch of mindless sloths. If you have children, what do you think they do most of their lives? Maybe they're supposed to be going outside and getting exercise, but instead, their brains could be getting sucked into a computer screen. Most kids by the age of @NUM1 have already used a computer for over @NUM2 hour. This clearly shows that kids spend more time using the computer than anything else. I had a friend named @CAPS1 who used the computer @NUM3 non - stop, and eventually, he was so weak and scrawny from lack of exercise that you could snap his arm like a twig. Please, if you don't want your kids to be like @CAPS1, tell them to get up and go play outside. You probably think that using your computer everyday couldn't form an addiction, but computers can be as addictive as drugs. Scientists have found that using the computer everyday for one hour can be enough to form an addiction. In fact, if we could scan people to find addiction, @PERCENT1 of the @LOCATION2 population would be addicted to computers. This means that @NUM4 years from now, the world's addiction to computers could be at @PERCENT2 or greater. Do you want to live in a world where almost everyone uses their computers @NUM3? I don't. Video games are one of the greatest advances in computer technology but also one of the deadliest. If you have a computer, you will have video games. Small dosages can be fine, but non - stop playing can lead to serious problems. Because of the fantasy content, people might start to lose sight of reality. For example, scientists tested a video game on kids, and now @PERCENT1 believe in zombies. Now they cannot ever play the game for it might cause serious brain damage. Just to make sure you get my point, let us recap. More computer use means lack of exercise and social interaction, you can easily be addicted, and you can lose your sense of realness. I hope that you don't want to see you or your kids' brilliant brains turned to mush by computers.
857	859	1	3	"The innovation of computers was a great leap into discovery. Unfortunately, the negative aspects of this magnificent invention detract from the novelty. With the computer came a plague of not exercising and a disinterest in, perhaps even an inability to enjoy nature. On top of this destruction of the mind, this ""monster"" is the cruel cause of many declining relationships. After all, who has time for friends and family while in the middle of an internet game? As unique and intriguing as the computer might be, it is slowly destroying the mind. Increasing interest in a monitor tends to result in decreasing care for exercise as well as a decline in the amount of exercise gotten each day. While playing on the computer, the mind @MONTH1 might be racing but the body sits unmoving, with little to no @CAPS1 physical activity being done. Indeed, for some, the addiction is so awful that the person only moves to get food, use a restroom, go to bed or when a parent demands it. All of the day's food settles into the stomach and little to none of it is burned off. Meanwhile, in some of the more severe cases, the person is so entranced that bedtimes are pushed later. Sleep is essential to the body and mind and going without can be damaging. Nowadays, the computer detracts from the sleep and exercise that the body requires. Even nature suffered from the advent of computers. Fewer people went out to admire its beauty. Nature is a wonderful teacher about the circle of life and the natural way of the world. Oftentimes, parallels can be drawn between the wild and the tamed. Attached as people are to computers, they cannot experience the world to the fullest. Some argue that flora and fauna can be found online, but seeing a picture is different, almost cheating, compared to being beside the plant, able to study it from all angles rather than in an unmoving form. The experience is not the same. Also, computers are usually indoors, so the true world is shielded from view. Even nowadays with laptops, if one was to be brought outside, the user would be focusing on the screen, not what is around them. Computers have severely cut down on the admiration of nature. Even family and friends suffer when computers are around. Many people barely pay attention to conversation while focusing on the screen. They tend to only pretend to listen half the time. Even when chatting with friends online, the conversation is disjointed because attention is probably focused on another part of the internet. Frequently, during conversations without a computer nearby, the mind is focused on something from earlier that day. In conclusion, computers have had a detrimental impact on our physical health, our appreciation of nature, and our relationships. We should be more aware of these negative effects and try to find a balance."
858	860	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, More and more people do use computers, but it is not a bad thing. Student come home from school tired, bored, and don't want to go outside and exercise. Students would rather go on the computer. When students go on the computer, they can chat with their friends, listen to music, or learn about distant places. Firstly, students can chat with their friends on the computer. When it is winter, it's cold outside and students can't go outside and exercise easily. Students can grab their laptop, and go on their warm and comfortable table - bed to chat with friends. Maybe a friend can help with homework. Going outside in the winter can make students sick and miss days of school. Secondly, students like to listen to music. Music is an important part for a student because music lyrics can express themselves. Students @MONTH1 might be dancing to their favorite song. Dancing is a form of exercise and adults do say we need more exercise. Also, students can play very soft music while doing homework instead of not doing it at all. Thirdly, students can learn about distant places. When I am on the computer, I type in www.google.com and want to learn about a place where I want to visit. Other students might want to learn about places they've never visited. Italy, France, @LOCATION1, and many more places people would want to visit. They would want to learn about these places before ever going there. In conclusion @CAPS1, more and more people go on the computer, but it does not have to be a bad thing. Yes, students should go exercise but not all the time. When students go on the computer, they can chat with friends, listen to music, and learn about distant places. @CAPS1, it is not a bad thing that students go on the computer as long as they use it in a balanced way.
859	861	1	3	Dear Newspaper, I know the debate on whether computers benefit society is greatly debated but to me the answer is obvious. The internet is an extremely useful invention, used in all schools and is only inconvenient when misused. I'm not saying that it's @PERCENT1 necessary for every house to contain one, but that it's a luxury most people have. The computer and internet combination is probably one of the most genius ideas ever thought up. It is basically any information at a click. Websites such as MySpace and Facebook allow you to connect and reconnect with friends old and new. Also, the ability to create your own web page is greatly useful when trying to promote a business or company. Not only that, but the internet also makes it possible to purchase clothes online without having to go to the store. I know that's useful for those parents, like many, who hate driving to the mall. Second, I can guarantee you that almost every school in the country has a working computer with accessible internet. The computer was just one huge leap forward for education. There are many websites with an educational purpose only. These websites are available for children and adults of any age. Many teachers nowadays are assigning homework where the internet is necessary. Also, tests such as the blue - ribbon test are taken online. I can tell you right now that many teachers would be at a loss without the computer. Lastly, one of the most important issues is the downsides of the internet. Even though MySpace and Facebook are meant for good, they also have a dark side. For example, there are privacy issues and the spread of false information. However, overall, the benefits of the computer and internet far outweigh these negatives, and we should continue to embrace this technology while being aware of its potential pitfalls.
860	862	1	3	Dear @PERSON1 editor, I think that the computers have both positive and negative effects, but more positive. For example, when people get home from work or school, they immediately go on the computer, to check email, do work, or to play games. I think that it's good to connect with friends and learn about the far - away nature and people that we can't see, but too much of it will be bad. I know it will be bad because it can cause a lack of exercise and the computer can cut you off from your family and friends if you're on it too much. I think it's good to go on the computer for a limited amount of time each day, but also spend time outside with family and friends. The computer is good because of all the extraordinary things it offers and the things you can learn. I myself like to play video games on it like bubble spinner but at the same time I'll be on Facebook. Facebook lets me connect with friends and family while bubble spinner helps with hand - eye coordination. When projects came along, I usually do all my research there, carefully picking up information on each site. I also do all the writing on it too so it won't look messy but instead, clean and neat. The computer also offers videos of pretty much anything on TV and otherwise, like YouTube or Google videos. The computer lets me see nature, talk to friends and family, and lets me see things, like videos, that I'll never ever see in books. These show that the computer has a bigger positive impact than negative and we should take advantage of the new technology that we have and not let it go to waste. The computer is a nice outlet to come home and let yourself unwind to. People say that you don't get enough exercise but we have gym and recess at school and we become exhausted at work, which is enough exercise for the day. Computers are a nice device to have and are by far, used daily by almost everyone. So it can't be all that bad by depriving you from nature and family because it lets you see it anyway. The effects it has on people are good because of the knowledge and communication it brings. I hope you see my point of view and recognize that with proper use, the computer can be a valuable asset to our lives.
861	863	1	3	"Dear Readers, it has come to my attention that there is a heated debate on whether or not computers truly benefit society. This issue is highly debatable, but in all honesty, I firmly believe that computers are not helping the overall situation. I don't think that they are beneficial for our health or social interactions because computers keep us cooped up inside when we could be out enjoying the fresh air. Every day when I come home from school, I find myself going straight inside and heading to the computer. From there, I log into social media platforms and various apps. And my exercise in the next few hours or so is only limited to the movement of my fingers. My point is that there is a whole wonderful world outside if we only got off our computers and went out to play. Statistics show that a large number of kids spend more time inside year - round than outside these days. ""It is ridiculous how much things have changed in just a few years,"" says Dr. Smith, a pediatrician in New York City, ""they all need their exercise."" It is outrageous how much people are on computers now. It starts to affect their attitude and take control of their lives. Sometimes checking notifications on social media can be more important to someone than spending quality time with their family or friends. A mom of three teens says ""They all go to their rooms, shut their doors and go on social media and gaming platforms until dinner and after, they go right back."" In this case, they just plug into their computers and forget about everyone else. I think it has gotten out of hand how much people, and teens especially, are addicted to computers. One mom says she sees her kid growing apart from the family because of a computer. You might say that when on your computer there is a person you are talking to, and while pen - pals are great, you should really go out and do something! You are talking to your friends, but it's not the same as being physically with them. On my recent trip to the Alps to go skiing, I found that some of my friends' jokes were funnier when you're with them in person and not just sitting on a computer. We had a blast! Now I regret not getting together with her to hang out more often. Also, many arguments now have something to do with a misunderstanding through the computer. People might get the wrong message when you send something to them or they take it the wrong way. The truth is, computers are starting to have a negative effect on our society and even ruin relationships. If we just get off our computers and get out, we can turn that around and bring back the warmth of real - life interactions."
862	864	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, I am writing this letter to you to clearly explain why I think computers are not a good addition to our lives. My three main supporting reasons are that if you are glued to the computer all the time, there's a high chance that you might gain weight and become obese. You would rather be engrossed in your computer activities than to hang out with your dear family, and lastly, you won't have any real - life friends to talk to. Please read on to hear my personal story. First of all, if you're always on the computer, you're not going to get up and go outside for a bit because the virtual world on the computer seems more important to you. Also, when you're sitting in front of the computer, you're likely to munch on snacks. And when you get excited while using the computer, you're going to want to eat even more. Then you'll start piling on the pounds because you don't want to exercise. Secondly, you would spend significantly less time with your family. You might think that you're going to hang out with them later. So then you keep playing on the computer and get addicted. As a result, you and your family would grow further apart. And you would end up feeling lonely because you gave up precious family time just so you can play a game on the computer. For my last reason on this matter is that you won't have real friends. I think you won't have friends because if you're on the computer all the time, you won't even bother to go to the park to play or go to the gym to try to get into sports. Then you won't meet anyone in real life. The only friends that you would most likely have are friends on the computer, whom you will never meet in real life and won't be able to socialize with about their real - life experiences and hang out with. In conclusion, I firmly think it is not a good idea to have a computer because you can become obese, you will spend less time with your family, and you won't have any real - life friends to talk to. I hope you enjoyed this letter and take it into serious consideration as we all strive for a more balanced life.
863	865	1	3	Dear, Local Newspaper, In my opinion, computers are truly everything. They offer us an abundance of things to do, like playing chess, listening to a vast library of music, and even downloading your favorite movies with just a few clicks. First of all, computers are an excellent source of communication. Because if you have a long - distance relative that lives in Australia, then you can easily talk to them online. You can do this through various means such as via email, instant message, and video calls. Secondly, Computers allow you to explore the web. So if you need to find out some directions to your destination or want to get detailed information on some far - away places like the Amazon Rainforest, the Sahara Desert, the Great Wall of China, or my favorite, the Northern Lights in Iceland, you can because the web provides a wealth of knowledge. Thirdly, they are a wonderful source of entertainment. Well, because you can watch episodes of your favorite TV shows or you can enjoy music videos. Also, you can comfortably enjoy listening to music from your computer as your personal entertainment. I think that computers are truly great. I use them myself as an example. I love to download high - quality music into my iPod from my computer. Then I get to enjoy the music from my iPod wherever I go. Last, but not least, modern computers have a profound and positive effect on a majority of people. I believe that if we didn't have computers, then our world wouldn't be the same vibrant and connected place. So I say keep computers here to stay. They complete us all and make our lives more convenient, entertaining, and informed.
864	866	1	3	I think that computers have a bad effect on people. I think that because of numerous reasons and I will share some of these reasons with you. One reason is that if you don't get exercise and spend all day on the computer, your physical condition will only deteriorate. Say if you were 20 years old and when computers came out you bought one and went on it every day instead of staying fit. Then, without any exercise, you will gradually get bigger and bigger, putting your health at risk. Another reason is that you should only use computers for research. There is no valid reason to be on your computer all day. A good reason to go on the computer would be if you have some kind of project for school or a job, instead of just using your computer for social media like Facebook or MySpace. Then there is a repetitive strain injury that can occur if you do the same thing on the computer too many times. You don't want that to happen because if you develop such an injury in your hand and need some kind of surgery on it, that will cause you to be unable to do almost everything with that one hand. My last reason is that when you go on the computer, you are exposed to viruses. If you don't take proper precautions, then maybe your computer will lose everything on it. Then you have to buy a new computer and start all over again. If you bought a new computer, there is also a risk that somebody can hack your computer and get all of the information from it. You don't know who that person is and what they can do with your information. So I hope you don't buy something that has a really bad virus or anything like that. Those would be all the reasons on why you shouldn't go on the computer too much and why it does not really help other than when you are doing research or any other kind of work - related task. We should use computers in a more balanced way to avoid these negative impacts.
865	867	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2, such as computers, are very dangerous to modern - day society and how we interact with the world around us. So I believe that these atrocious things should very well be disposed of. There are good reasons for thinking such a thought. In this time of environmental breakdown, we need to get close to nature while it's still intact. Nowadays, our real - life interaction is extremely low, especially when it comes to actually talking to a person face - to - face. Because of computers, it makes people all the more lazy while sitting around doing nothing but staring at a screen. Lastly, the @CAPS2 is not only harmful but also expensive. Not to mention the fact that the environment is already on the verge of collapse. The way nature is heading, we will all end up suffering no thanks to computers. First, it's quite alarming that a large percentage of people own computers. In America, there is only a small percentage of land that is still covered with nice forests, but as the population reproduces, more of these natural areas will be gone forever due to expansion. So be one of the few out of the many that instead of staying inside, goes out to view the great things the earth has to offer. Next, these computers are like little robots that are really taking over the world, and it's getting very dangerous as it's destroying the ability for humans to have real - life experiences. This happens because there seems to be an almost hypnotic pull in all computers, making us stay close to them, suffocating us like a deadly drug. It's a horrible addiction. Lastly, a significant percentage of deaths are due to @CAPS2 overloads. Imagine all the lives that could be saved if people just went out to breathe fresh air every few minutes. I mean, on average, people spend several hours a day looking at a @CAPS2. Take some time off, make a goal for say an hour. This addiction will kill us, and yet no one knows how to talk about it properly. Secondly, millions upon millions of people in the big cities keep on their computers for hours on end. You would think that they are in their own little world. In every group of people, many are being killed by the virtual world, letting their real lives flow right out of the window. Now interaction through the internet is harmful as you already know, but you might forget that a number of people a day do illegal things on the internet, like downloading music which they shouldn't be doing. They could be put away for up to several years for this. Talk about an interaction with the police! Lastly, web interactions like on MySpace have satisfied sexual offenders who could come to your house at any time and take you away. Would you like that to happen? You could never see your family again. In every group of people, a certain percentage are kidnapped due to MySpace alone. Stand up and get out of this danger. That's how harmful it is. Finally, the dangers of a world like this are compounded by how the government sometimes wants to control and mess with our lives. These people are considered mad and dangerous, along with lawyers who might want to get you in trouble. One in every so many people can't keep up with the payments related to their computer usage. Next, did you forget about those other people who don't have computers? They are living a more natural life, walking with a sense of wonder on the edge of what seems like a lost myth. Lastly and unfortunately, those people with computers are likely to die within the next few years due to a kind of deadly poison that the computer seems to deliver to your brain. In conclusion, this world can be one of the most dangerous if we don't change our ways. So come together, get a friend, go for a run now and then. If you have no friends, go talk to your family instead of having one of those virtual meetings. Just keep in mind the dangers of the @CAPS2 world and how it wants to take your money and your life. Now what we need to do is fight back against these digital invaders. People should go for a run, cut down on the obesity caused by sitting down all day and lose some pounds or more. Remember the world would be better off if you trash that zombie - like @CAPS2 room. Get outside, go for a road trip, and save humanity, your fellow neighbor, and your family.
866	868	1	3	"@ORGANIZATION1, more and more people use computers @DATE1, but this is not necessarily a good thing. Spending too much time on computers affects your activity level. Also, kids are now staying up later on the computer, in turn lowering grades. Finally, spending too much time on the computer decreases the amount of time spent with friends and family. Firstly, spending too much time on the computer affects your activity level. The more time a person spends on a computer, the less time they have to do something active, like exercising. @PERCENT1 of people spend more than @NUM1 @NUM2 hours on the computer per day. If @NUM3 or so hours were used to exercise or play a sport, that number would decrease to @PERCENT2 according to a recent study. Doctors have said that at least @PERCENT3 of overweight parents spend most of their time on the computer, thus limiting their time for exercising. The amount of time spent on the computer has been shown to decrease activity level and affect the number of overweight and obese people everywhere. If we want to become a healthier country, we should start limiting the time spent on computers. Also, kids now stay up later on computers and lower their grades by doing so. More time spent on @CAPS1 or anywhere on the @CAPS2 means less time studying, which means lower grades. Kids in general spend an average of @NUM3 @NUM2 hours on the computer each day, while they should spend @NUM6 @NUM2 hours studying. A student in @PERSON2 saw their grades improve from a @CAPS3+ to a @CAPS4+ just by spending less time on the computer and more time studying. That student also felt more energetic because they got more rest. This shows in their tests and quizzes. Computers clearly have a negative effect on grades and school work. Finally, computers limit the amount of time spent with family and friends. A student, @PERSON1, said that she spends more time going out with friends now that the computer isn't taking up all her time. ""By doing this, I have a better friendship with all my friends than before."" A kid that uses the computer during all of their free time spends @PERCENT4 less time with friends than someone who uses it in moderation. Families also suffer from this as well. If a family member spends all their time on the computer, the other family members will have less of a relationship with them because they don't talk or do anything together and will likely not know what is going on in their life or if something is wrong. As you can tell, computers also have a negative effect on relationships with family and friends. The overuse of computers does not benefit society. They affect a person's activity level, students' grades, and most importantly, a person's relationships with family and friends. In order to make our country a better and healthier place, we must limit the time spent on computers."
867	869	1	3	In my opinion, computers are beneficial to society. Here are my reasons. I can talk with my friends, I can do my homework, or I can do other things on the computer too. First, I can talk with my friends or my family on Facebook, MySpace, or on MSN. I can even see my family through the MSN camera. The camera is a great help to me because my family is in @LOCATION1. I chat with them every @DATE1 instead of sending pictures and videos or going to visit @LOCATION1. This way, I can keep in touch with them more easily and feel closer to them. Second, I can do my homework on the computer. I can write a big letter or do a lot of work on it. It is very easy. I can type quickly and make corrections easily. I can also use various software and tools to make my work more professional. Third, I can do a lot of things like find answers to questions or do projects on the computer. There is a vast amount of information available on the Internet, which can help me learn and grow. In conclusion, computers have brought many benefits to our lives. They have made communication easier, learning more efficient, and provided us with a wealth of resources. We should make good use of them to improve our lives and contribute to society.
868	870	1	3	Computers are a nice item to have but they are bad if you don't know how to control your time. Many people these days don't get enough exercise and the lack of healthy people is costing the @CAPS1 taxpayers millions. Also, people aren't enjoying life as much as they would if they didn't use a computer all of the time, and there are many people who have completely cut themselves off from their families and friends. I am positive that when you are done reading this you will be, one hundred percent persuaded that the effects computers have on people are bad. To begin with, many people spend too much time on a computer instead of being outside or exercising. This effect on people is something we need to start controlling because many people are very overweight and do not exercise enough to be healthy. Because so many people are at an unhealthy weight, it is costing taxpayers millions. For example, @CAPS2 @PERSON1 was talking about healthcare, and an easy solution to cut the cost down is to have people exercise more often in order to stay healthy. As technology continues to affect our lives, we need to remember that being healthy is more important than sitting on a computer all day. In addition, people don't enjoy life as much. You only live once and life is special, so why spend all day sitting? There are so many things to do in life that will bring you enjoyment rather than just playing on a computer. You need to be active and I can tell you that your life will not be enjoyable if you don't. Lastly, computers have made a lot of people isolated when it comes to family and friends. Although computers are an easy way to communicate with people, they should not be the only thing you use to talk to friends and family. You need to have face - to - face interactions. So as you can see, computers are causing us to lead unhealthy lives because our priorities on health are way too low. They also keep you from enjoying life to the fullest and can separate you from friends and family when not controlled. I am positive that I have persuaded you not to spend so much time on a computer. So next time you are using a computer, think of all the things you are missing out on in life!
869	871	1	3	"Dear, Newspaper. In my mind, the computer benefits us in many different ways. Computers are entertaining, computers help us with education, and the health/safety purposes are fantastic. People love entertainment. Computers are very fun. At electronic stores, a wide variety of computer games are sold. These games are usually good. Instead of having games that are bad for the brain, most computer games are not. My friend @PERSON2 bought a computer game last week. @CAPS4 says @CAPS3 is very entertaining but is not brain - damaging. It has interesting storylines and challenges that stimulate thinking. Everyone loves watching @CAPS1.V. On computers, people can now watch @CAPS1.V. Not only is that entertaining but it will save money because you don't need a separate @CAPS1.v. Now people can instead download @CAPS1.v. shows and movies on their computer. @PERSON1 just got a new computer for his birthday last week. ""@CAPS3 is so fun watching @CAPS1.v. on my computer and @CAPS3 is so easy."" @CAPS4 explained. The interface is user - friendly and there are many streaming platforms available. Learning from @PERSON1, I hope you can learn how entertaining computers are. At school, we use computers all the time. If we did not have computers, we would not learn the same. On his new computer, @PERSON1 can do all his projects and homework on @CAPS3. Before @CAPS4 had his computer, @CAPS4 had to write out all his papers by hand. And when @CAPS4 finished, @CAPS4 spent too long writing that @CAPS4 could not do the rest of his homework. Now @CAPS4 can type @CAPS3 out quickly, and still do all his other homework. If you think that's amazing, then read this. Research done by @ORGANIZATION1 found out that @PERCENT1 of kids with computers are smarter than before they had their computers. ""I was getting all @CAPS5's when I did not have my computer. Now I get honors on my report card because of my computer."" @PERSON1 says. I hope people can now be like @PERSON1 and buy computers. Do you want to have a smarter world? Computers open up an all - new health and safety field. You can @MONTH1 learn a little about genetics. It would have taken about @NUM1 years longer to crack the code of the genes if we did not have computers. All the information scientists have learned from the human genome project can cure cancer and other diseases. Computers are also safe to make sure your kids are safe. New technology can track kids. If an unfortunate event happens and your kid is missing, then a computer can help to find him. A new mother lost her kid last @DATE1 while eating lunch at a park. She knew she had a chip in the child's body. She opened her laptop and found where her kid was. Amazing right. I hope everyone can have a computer for health and safety reasons. I hope you can now see that computers benefit the society from health and safety to education in school. Without computers, we could not be where we are today."
870	872	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 or @CAPS2. The purpose of this letter is about how computers have changed our lives for the better. They have improved our society, changed our way of life, and have made things easier. I am a firm believer that computers were one of the greatest inventions of all time. Computers have had a very vital and positive impact on society. For example, education has vastly expanded since the computer. Both teachers and students have benefited. Students can now search the Internet and learn about different places, things in history, how to read and write better, etc. They can access a wealth of educational resources such as online courses, e - books, and educational videos. Also, computers have been a major part in entertainment. From reading online news to watching movies and listening to music, computers entertain all of us. There are countless entertainment platforms available on the computer, providing a wide range of choices. And computers help us connect with friends and even meet new people. Social media platforms allow us to stay in touch with friends from all over the world and make new friends with similar interests. Aside from that, computers make life easier. People can get degrees from learning online. They can learn another language more conveniently. Research is also easier because of computers. You can find just about anything on the computer. Some people say computers stop people interacting with family, but in fact, through platforms like Facebook, you can still have meaningful interactions. Computers have also enhanced our lives. From helping small businesses thrive by making it easier to make and receive orders to helping spread information globally, computers make this all possible. Small businesses can reach a wider customer base and manage their operations more efficiently. As I have shown, computers have benefited society and have had a positive effect on human beings from educating individuals to staying in touch with relatives. Computers have made their mark on improving the way we live. I hope this letter will help show you that computers are a necessary part of the twenty - first century.
871	873	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I firmly think that having a computer is a very positive thing. I'm well - aware that teenagers are on the computer quite a lot. But if it truly bothers the parents, one might wonder why they have computers in their houses. @CAPS3, I can tell you one clear reason why. Computers are excellent sources of information. They're also a great way to talk with your friends, and they can give you detailed information about places that you might not know about. Primarily, I would like to emphasize that computers are a fantastic source of information. They can provide you with answers to anything! This is extremely helpful because if you are working on a project, and your mom can't take you to get books at the library, then a computer is the perfect solution. It's just a simpler way to look up information. Did you know that a high percentage, @PERCENT1, of parents who got their family a computer do not regret their decision? That's almost all the parents in @LOCATION2! As you can see, computers would greatly help kids with whatever they are studying. Secondly, we teenagers today use computers to talk with our friends via @ORGANIZATION1 email. @CAPS3, I think this is a lot better than sending letters. Why would you wait for a letter from your cousin in @LOCATION1 when you can talk to them in seconds! And it saves paper if you just choose to communicate digitally. I recall one time when I was on a trip, we were looking for a hotel to stay in. Thanks to the computer, we ended up finding a great hotel at a cheap price. You can also use map apps if you plan to visit someone. For all the people out there who don't think computers are important, I ask you to reconsider. In conclusion, I think that having a computer is a very important thing for one main reason. They are very good information sources, they help us communicate with friends, and they offer information on a wide range of topics. I'm leaving this opinion with you. Hopefully, you will learn something better and make the right choice.
872	874	1	3	Almost every family has easy access to a computer. They have seamlessly become an integral part of daily life and a wonderful way to be connected to the world outside your house, even if you have to stay at home due to various reasons. Computers are a vast source of knowledge, drawing from millions of different sources. They have already spurred exponential advancement in numerous fields. Overall, computers have a highly positive effect. On a rainy day, a significant number, @NUM1, of students will naturally spend time on their computers. Out of those students, @PERCENT1 will be on popular sites such as A.I.M. (@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3), @CAPS4, @CAPS5, or @ORGANIZATION2. Even if they can't use their phone or venture out of the house, they can effortlessly communicate with friends, both old and new. Teens and adults use the @CAPS6 to have in - depth conversations with friends they haven't seen for up to @NUM2 years. People will interact with each other more frequently, building more meaningful relationships and enhancing their conversational skills. Over @NUM3 of the sites used by teens are centered around @CAPS8 networking. To be able to easily have a real - time conversation with someone miles away is a remarkable sign of technological advancement. @ORGANIZATION1 is a multi - million - dollar company. @PERSON1, an expert for @ORGANIZATION1, says that sites like @ORGANIZATION1 have seen a huge surge in popularity over the @DATE1. More and more people are putting down their @PERSON2 dictionary and instead typing the word into @LOCATION1, where they can get not only the meaning but also the pronunciation easily. Students use computers for gathering information on school reports in various subjects like @CAPS7, @CAPS8 @CAPS9, @CAPS10, or @CAPS11. Information can be found on any subject imaginable. There was a survey taken to compare which is used more often: books with a specific subject or computers for information on various subjects. Computers are used overwhelmingly more often. They're quicker than books and it's easier to search for a particular resource on the @CAPS6. And any site of particular interest or exceptional usefulness can be added to your favorites for quick access. Computers are more practical than books. Pictures of scientific laboratories where space shuttles are sent to the moon clearly show that @NUM4 main component is computers. Ads from @ORGANIZATION3 show that computers are getting smaller and smaller. There's a laptop that is so compact it will fit in an envelope and a handheld touch - screen computer that can almost fit in your pocket. You can type papers and assignments on computers so they're more legible. Computers can even score tests accurately. Advancement in modern society is centered around computers. Before computers, so many things we do now would have seemed like pure fantasy. But computers open up a whole new realm of possibilities. Typing is faster than hand - writing in some cases and papers can be saved electronically for easy retrieval. If our country keeps advancing at this rate, it is entirely possible to have computers that can perform mundane chores such as taking out the trash or washing the dishes. There can be computers that can engage in real - like conversations with you. People can learn more and more information and personally advance in intelligence. I look at a computer and immediately think of progress. There are some minor drawbacks of computers, but overall, computers are highly beneficial to society. In a computer, you have access to friends old and new and a vast amount of information from millions of sources. Most of all, computers represent progress and advancement, and I see no direct harm from them.
873	875	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, The use of computers brings significant benefits to society due to the positive impact it has on people. It helps develop good hand - eye coordination, enables people to learn about far - away places and people, and allows them to communicate online with family and friends. Did you know that teenagers who use computers often have higher test scores compared to those who don't? This is because they can quickly look up definitions, conduct research, and learn about anything they need right at their fingertips. Furthermore, families and friends who live across the country can now easily keep in touch through email, video chats, and Facebook. It might seem hard to believe, but the use of the computer can actually increase your hand - eye coordination. You are probably wondering how this is possible and thinking that I'm crazy, but there are valid reasons. Since I'm an active player in basketball, volleyball, and softball, hand - eye coordination is extremely crucial for me. One cold, wintery @DATE1 @TIME1, I was working on a long history paper and a @CAPS1 essay, which meant spending countless hours on the computer typing. At five o'clock, I went to my basketball game, and I played the best game of my life. Then, a week later, we had another game, but this time I went straight from church without using the computer beforehand. Consequently, I did not play as well; I missed a lot of passes and shots. This clearly proved to me that through the use of computers, my hand - eye coordination improved. Can you imagine being able to learn about people in far - away places, their unique cultures, diverse ethnicities, and different religions? Well, now this is more than possible through the amazing advances in technology. In history class, we were doing research on the world hunger crisis in our allied countries. Through the knowledge I gained about this hunger issue, I was able to start a fundraiser at my church. @PERSON1; @CAPS2 teenagers like myself do not eat for @NUM1 hours. Research has shown that @NUM2 children in African countries die every day from malnourishment. Now that this has been brought to my attention, I am determined to work four hours a day to give these innocent children even a small portion of what I consume. Thus, through the use of computers, I was able to learn about the pain those children suffer, and now it's my responsibility to help. Do you have family members who live across the country that you rarely get to see? My aunt and uncle live in @LOCATION3, and they were just blessed with a beautiful baby boy, @LOCATION4. Since we only get to see them about once a year, we really miss them. But now, through Skype, email, and Facebook, we are able to stay updated on the growth and development of @LOCATION4, as well as the places they have recently traveled to. Also, @PERCENT1 of the teenage population in the @CAPS3.S spend at least four hours a day chatting, tweeting, or using Facebook to stay in touch with their friends. Recently, I have moved from @LOCATION2 to @LOCATION1, and staying in contact with my friends there is extremely important to me. Those are the people that I grew up with and have known since birth. The use of computers has allowed me to maintain a close connection with my distant friends and relatives. To conclude, due to the improved hand - eye coordination, the ability to learn about far - away places and people, and the ease of communicating online with others, the use of computers greatly benefits society. Through the internet, people can discover @LOCATION2 places to travel, bike, and exercise while enjoying nature. Furthermore, when family and friends want to spend time together, they need to plan the logistics, and without email and being online, this becomes nearly impossible. I appreciate you taking the time to read this, and hopefully, you will take my opinion into account when discussing the topic of computers.
874	876	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I think you're completely wrong! I totally disagree with the view presented in that letter. People definitely need computers to conduct research. Moreover, computers help us keep in close contact with others. Another great aspect is that you can get almost anything you need through them. First of all, people need computers. Instead of laboriously picking up a heavy book, you can simply go online. It's not only faster but also much easier. You can look up information on any place or any project, and the internet will provide you with relevant details. That's the great thing about the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4; it has an endless amount of information. Next, the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 web is also widely used for keeping in contact with others. For example, instant messaging is a very popular way. You can also chat on @CAPS5 or @CAPS6. There are even chat rooms where you can have group conversations. But just keep in mind that you should always know who you're talking to because it might be a stranger. Anyways, you can use the internet as an easy way to talk to people and stay connected. Lastly, you might know that the internet is used for research and communication, but it's also a great platform for getting anything you want. You can go online and find pictures, play games, watch videos, listen to music, or even get directions to a place. The internet is also used just for having fun. I use it mostly for YouTube, @CAPS5, and for googling pictures. You can look up basically anything online, and it will most likely be there for you. In conclusion, the web is used for researching various topics, chatting with others, and getting almost anything you desire. That is why people should have internet access because you can enjoy the benefits of going online while also having fun outside. But maybe people should cut back a little on watching @CAPS8.V. Now do you see why I firmly chose this side? Maybe in the future, there will be a way to use the computer while still being physically active.
875	877	1	3	"Dear editor, I firmly believe that computers are an essential part of modern life and have proven their worth every single day. Many times, we don't even consciously think about using computers; they just become a natural part of our daily routine. We use computers every day in numerous ways. Sometimes, we use them to stay in touch with a far - away friend, learn about and experience far - away places, or even improve our hand - eye coordination. Computers are so beneficial to our lives that we might find it difficult to live without them. Most people have experienced the situation where a friend or relative moves away. When this happens, it's not all bad news because with the use of computers, you can still stay connected. Many computers nowadays come with built - in webcams, which allow you to get more than just an email. With these systems, you can actually see an image of your friend or relative. Even Oprah Winfrey uses the webcam feature on computers to have people ""Skype"" on to her show. In addition to this, there are many other ways to stay in touch, even if your computer is older. These relatively new ""social networking series"" include Facebook, Twitter, and many more. Every morning when I wake up and watch Sportscenter, I always hear about what famous people are posting on their Twitter pages. This is just another great use of computers. In this tough economy, not many people are willing to spend thousands of dollars to go to a beach paradise in a far - off location. But with the use of computers, you can go there virtually. Computers are great in this aspect because they allow you to learn and experience many expensive things for free. For example, if you wanted to learn something about India, you wouldn't have to go to the local library and check out a book. You could just type in the relevant keywords. There are many such examples that give you access to all the information that you could ever need. This also proves to be valuable if you are studying far - away places while writing a paper. The computer is just an excellent way to get information without ever having to leave your home. Hand - eye coordination is an important skill that many people lack. It allows you to throw a baseball accurately, play video games smoothly, or even drive a car safely. Many computer skeptics believe that you don't benefit from using computers, but a recent study done by @LOCATION1 news and report reveals that people who use computers had @PER"
876	878	1	3	I think using the computer is truly great. You should definitely heed my advice as people should be using computers. Computers are an excellent way to communicate. People can easily connect with others from all over the world. My dad moved to Brazil, so we have been communicating via e - mail, video calls, and even Facebook. It’s the easiest and cheapest way to communicate. If I call someone from a different country, it would cost me way more, but if I send them an e - mail, it’s much cheaper. Studies from the University of [LOCATION1] show that [PERCENT1] of people think it’s easier to use a computer to communicate. Moreover, you can do it instantly, so it gets the information anywhere in milliseconds. Computers are indeed the best way to communicate. Another thing computers are used for is learning. Many people from around the world have learned different languages from websites or programs that have great instruction and lessons. I learned to play guitar with many programs and online lessons. Many people depend on computers to get information and learn about things. My mom is a secretary at an insurance broker company. Without computers, the customers couldn’t learn about the different policies that there are and they might be spending more money than needed on insurance. Without computers, scientists couldn’t do much research or learn about plants or rocks. Computers make it easier for them to study and learn about [LOCATION2] and everything. Doctors wouldn’t be able to do half of the things they can without a computer. They learn about different sicknesses and broken bones by using computers. [PERSON2] said she couldn’t be able to help out as many people without the use and help of a computer. She states that she learned [PERCENT2] of what she knows from websites that have information about the human body. Even teachers say that they set better teaching skills from websites. Builder and modern designer [PERSON1] says he learned about different building designs that are sturdier and stronger shapes, and he used this in his building today. I hope that you can now see how great computers are and how much they help our present - day citizens. They are an indispensable part of our lives, making communication, learning, and work so much more efficient.
877	879	1	3	Dear [CAPS1], do you think [CAPS2] is the best technology made so far? It's definitely the computer! They are the best technology because you can do virtually anything on the computer. My friends say computers are one of the best technologies because the internet can help a lot with things like if you have a research paper. Research has clearly proven that computers have a positive effect on people. My mom says computers are one of the most hard - working tools in the world. [PERCENT1] of my friends say that computers are one of the best because you can get help from the internet on homework assignments. They also say that it's great for people to talk online with other people. They said that they can interact with family members who live far away. They also mentioned that being on the computer has taken more teens off the streets and into their homes. Dr. [ORGANIZATION1] has done extensive research and has proven that being on the computer teaches you hand - eye coordination. Another thing he has proven is that since computers have been invented, the violence rate has gone down because more people spend time at home on their computers rather than out on the streets. He also proven that since people have started using computers in schools, the success in school grades has gone way up. He thinks they have gone up because, instead of students reading long boring articles on someone or something, they can just search it on the internet. He said using the internet also saves more time. My mother says when she was younger, the computer gave her the ability to learn about far - away places. My mother said that the internet would also let you learn about people's customs rather than reading books because some books have not yet been upgraded and you would want to learn about their newest customs also. My mom thinks that using a computer is a positive effect on the world. [CAPS1], you are doing a fine job at writing at your job. My friends say computers are helpful, research has proven that computers have dropped the percentage of violence down, and my mom also thinks that the computer is a positive effect on us. I know you will agree with me when I say that having computers has put a powerful effect on people; it gives people an easier time in life, making various aspects of our daily lives more convenient and efficient.
878	880	1	3	Dear, Local Newspaper, [CAPS1], [PERCENT2] of the people would surely agree that computers are useful and by having them, they help with the ability to learn about far - away places. They also allow people to talk to other people online. Lastly, computers are important for people that work with them. There are many reasons why I believe that computers benefit our society. Do you know that computers give people the ability to learn about far - away places? Sometimes people don't know when they want to leave the country. With a computer, you can organize it all. Some people, like my family, like to go visit their families in other places. For example, once my mom told me we were going on a trip to [LOCATION1] to go visit our family. She told me she already got the tickets on the computer. I was very happy when we went and I saw how beautiful [LOCATION1] is. Some people like to see new and beautiful places, such as [LOCATION3], [LOCATION2], and even [LOCATION4]. Let me tell you about how computers allow people to talk to other people online. Most people have MySpace, and that allows kids my age to keep in touch. Also, Facebook allows you to connect with people that you probably haven't seen in a long time. For example, one time I was looking around Facebook and found my old best - friend [PERSON1]. I was so happy because when she moved, I thought I would never talk to her again. I am [PERCENT1] positive that everyone in this world has a Yahoo account, and you could find people really quickly and talk to them. Would you believe that there are so many jobs and responsibilities that require you to have a computer? Such as scientists, they all have to have computers or else they wouldn't be able to invent all the great things they make. Also, secretaries have to assign dates for their bosses. For example, a secretary for a doctor has to be able to give and to change appointments. Lastly, students that go to school and most importantly college. Without computers, they won't be able to do their homework. Most people would agree that computers have a positive affect on people. Due to the reasons that they give the ability to learn about far - away places, allow people to talk to other people online, and are very important to people who work with them, computers are truly an asset to our society, enhancing our lives in multiple ways.
879	881	1	3	"Dear Newspaper, [CAPS1], it's amazing being able to find the information of anything with only one hand. Computers benefit people because they can talk online with others easily. Also, people have the advantage of learning about far - away places. Lastly, you are able to find lots of information quickly and easily. Computers do benefit society. Furthermore, with computers, people can talk online with others easily. All [ORGANIZATION1] students use the computer daily to video - chat with friends or instant - message parents! [ORGANIZATION2] discovered that computers keep families closer because they are able to see each other virtually when someone is away. [PERCENT1] of [CAPS2] use their computers to talk with others online. One could see why some might think computers are bad, but in fact, they benefit a lot of people everyday. [CAPS1], walking into a room where people of all ages are learning about computers, it's clear that they are helpful to each individual because they can learn about places. A quote says ""Computers are information in a compact form"". [CAPS3] out of [CAPS4] people use the computer to learn about far - away places. The [LOCATION1] lives had found that using the computer to learn about far - away places is better than using multiple books. Some might say why books are better, but in fact, computers are. Lastly, computers are great because they teach [CAPS6] to have better hand - eye coordination. [PERCENT2] of people found their coordination improved after using the computer for one hour. [PERSON2], [PERSON1], says ""The computer can help to develop stronger reflexes."" [CAPS6] could see why some might think computers slow reflexes, but actually, they make them better. Computers benefit society greatly. They help people talk online with others, allow people to learn about far - away places, and strengthen hand - eye coordination, making our lives more connected, informed, and coordinated."
880	882	1	3	Dear [CAPS1], do people use computers more? No, they should not use computers more. Computers have many benefits to society but they also have many negative effects on people who use them. People are spending more time on computers and less time on exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. First, people spend less time exercising. Most athletes have to stay fit and healthy to play in their sport. I am a wrestler and a baseball player, and if I don't spend some time a day working out or staying active, I will be out of shape and weaker once my match or next game comes along. I'm sure Olympic athletes work out and stay active daily so they can be stronger and faster than anybody else out there. So, I really don't know why people sit at home on the computer all day. Second, people don't take the time to enjoy nature. Nature is one of the most beautiful things on this planet. Whether you're hiking a mountain or by a lake, nature is all around you. I personally love to hunt and fish. I take the time every summer, around [DATE1], fall, and sometimes winter to go out, enjoy nature, and have fun, and so do many other people in the world. Everyone who sits at home on the computer can't enjoy this wonderful gift that we have been given. Third, people won't take the time to be with family or friends. If you're on the computer all day, then you can't go out and be active with your friends, or go for a bike ride with your brother. If you are on the computer, you're wasting family and friend time that could be used for a fishing trip or a walk in the woods. If you don't spend time with your family because of something you're doing on the computer, then you're missing out on a valuable thing that you have in life - your family. You should always be able to make time for them. Finally, should people use computers more? No, they should not use computers more. Computers take time away from exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. There are good things about computers, but the less time you spend on them, the better it is for everyone. We should strike a balance and not let computers overtake our real - life experiences.
881	883	1	3	@ORGANIZATION1, In @DATE1, more and more of the newest technology is being introduced to the public. Computers, @CAPS1 - bars, telephones, and numerous other devices are being equipped with the most high - tech softwares and machinery to make some of the most miraculous things happen. There is a cell - phone that allows you to turn off your lights in your house from thousands of miles away today. This technology can be the best thing that has ever happened to the world. Some might argue that though. But I am here to counter the @CAPS2 - sayers. With the new computers, people are able to talk with people all over the world in real - time. Also, dreams can come true for people that never had the chance to follow them. Also, questions that have been asked for ages can now be answered promptly. I have a number of cousins in @LOCATION3 who I only talk to if I go to visit them, which is very rare. Because of some of the programs like @CAPS4, or @CAPS5 @CAPS6, I am able to converse with my cousins regularly. Some people say that The @ORGANIZATION2 can make kids like me want to miss out on some quality - time with my family. Well, my brother is going to @CAPS10 in six months and I am going to want to talk with him. With phone companies burdening their customers with scary prices, my family is not going to want to sit on The phone with him for @NUM1 hours and have to cut into their savings. On my @ORGANIZATION2, there is an application called i - chat which allows me to talk with my brother and see him as if he were home with me. My dad found out about @CAPS4 and he decided to try it out. As of now, he has reconnected with tons of his high - school friends and got back in the game. Maybe you can find a special friend that you almost forgot about. Or you can find out what is happening with your sister who lives in @LOCATION1. The @ORGANIZATION2 also allows those less fortunate who can never afford a plane ride to discover a place they've always wanted to go. The internet offers virtual tours of places like the @LOCATION2 or even @LOCATION4 - amazing places can be explored without stepping foot out of your house. Also @CAPS15, a website that offers millions of videos, includes tutorials for dances, sports, tricks, and more so you don't have to break into the bank for charged lessons. Another good thing about the @ORGANIZATION2 is it offers mostly reliable information. In conclusion, the technological advancements brought by these devices and the @ORGANIZATION2 are truly beneficial and should be embraced.
882	884	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I've heard that you were taking a survey to see if people believe in computers or not. Well, I'm someone who whole - heartedly does because they enable us to talk to our family and friends on popular sites like facebook, myspace, & aim. They can also be a great tool for exercise. If you go to youtube, you can find different types of workout positions that you can do at home. Today, over @NUM1 people use computers, and it is estimated that @PERCENT1 adults and @PERCENT2 children use computers, which means that more kids today are getting involved in athletic sports through online guidance. The adults use computers for their work efficiency and in schools. At newspaper places, they need to have a computer just to type the daily papers. If there's no computer, then how will they type their work? As people get home from wherever and they didn't get the daily paper, they can go online and look at it conveniently. For students, computers are so important to us because we get to talk to our friends and when we need to look up something, we just go to the internet. In some schools, they have really big books for different classes that they need to bring home, and that's bad for your back. So, schools came out with the books online, making it easier for students. For those people who love sports, you can look up your favorite team and see if they won that week's game. There are also virtual sport games that you can play on the computer. When you first move somewhere out of town, you can go to google and see where is a good town to live in and a good school system that you would want your child to go to. There are so many things that you can do online and on computers. So, thanks for letting me help you with your decision. In conclusion, computers have become an indispensable part of our lives and their value cannot be overstated.
883	885	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, I just heard that people are spending too much time on computers than with their families and friends. No, that is not true. Just listen to the reasons why. In a computer, you can find people that you're looking for. Also, it can always help you on something that you need help on and you can do different kinds of activities. If you keep on reading, you are going to see all the typical reasons why I think that people are not spending much time on computers than with their families. Firstly, one reason why I think that people are not spending much time on computers is because the computer can help you look for a family member that you're looking for or a friend. Maybe you've lost touch with them over the years. My second reason why I think this is because maybe you never met that family member and you want to get to know them. It's a great way to expand your family circle. My last reason why I think this is because it's really a person that you really love and need in your personal life. These are the reasons why I think that they are not spending too much time on the computers. Secondly, another reason why I think that people are not spending too much time on computers is because it can help you in many things that you need help on. For example, you can do your homeworks there and it can assist you with it. If you find something really difficult that you don't know, it helps you find the answers. My last reason is that it can provide step - by - step guidance when you're stuck. Thirdly, I think that people are not spending too much time on the computers because you can do different kinds of activities there. When you're having a @CAPS5 party and you need invitations, the computer can help you design beautiful ones. If you want to move to @CAPS3 state or country, you can see the place on the website and then you can go and visit it in person. These are the reasons why I think that the computer is very helpful. In conclusion, computers are valuable tools that enhance our lives in many ways and the claim that people spend too much time on them is unfounded.
884	886	1	3	Debates have come up on whether or not computers are benefiting or destroying society. Computers are only helping in aid in the growth of society. Computers allow people to interact with other people, see and discover other places and people, and teach hand - eye coordination. Computers are helping people more than they are hurting them. First of all, computers allow people to meet and interact with other people. There are many popular websites that allow people to chat and communicate at any time of the day. Before computers were invented, in order to talk to someone you would have to meet with them face - to - face, or send them a letter and wait for an awfully long time to get a response. Now people can simply type up an email and hit send. Just like that, their message is sent to another computer for others to read and enjoy. Another advancement computer technology has developed is picture sharing. All one has to do to display and show their pictures to everyone is done by simply hooking up a camera, uploading your pictures onto your computer, and posting them on a site like @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 bucket. Any intelligent person would realize that computers are very useful. Secondly, computers are important because they give people the ability to learn about and discover people & places that are new to them. In the old days, if you did not know about something or someone, like a movie, you might never find any info about them. Computers have internet websites and search engines like @ORGANIZATION1, that allow you to type anything and instantly find all the relevant information and pictures of that subject. These technological advances have given many people the general knowledge that they very well might need in any given situation. If you missed the best part of a movie, you could easily go on a computer, look it up and understand the importance of computers in every day society. Last of all, computers improve hand - eye coordination that is vital to every day life. Typing on a computer in leisure time is a skill that will be looked for everywhere. In fact, many employers might hire you based on your keyboarding skills. Once one is skilled enough, they might even teach themselves to type without looking at the keyboard. Although computers are not meant to replace your friends, family, and fresh air, they are very important tools that give you skills you will use for the rest of your life. Any individual that is highly educated would see the pluses in computer usage. In conclusion, computers are essential for modern - day living, offering communication, knowledge, and skill - building opportunities.
885	887	1	3	Computers effect a lot of people. I fully support the advances in technology. I support this because computers can let you talk to people that are faraway from you. Computers also teach hand - eye coordination. In addition, computers let you learn about countries all over the world. Rapping it all up, electronics should keep advancing. Say your bestfriend moved to @LOCATION4. You won't see her in person but you can talk to her on the computer. Nowadays, there are a lot of websites that you can chat on or you can also do a webcam chat like ovoo. For example, in seventh grade I moved from @LOCATION1 to @LOCATION2. I was so upset about leaving my old friends. Turns out I was fine. I just made more friends when I moved. I would make plans with my friends over facebook chatting. Consequently, computers help a lot in keeping you in touch with friends all over the world. Computers build up your skills for everything. Hand - eye coordination is the biggest skill that computers teach anyone. When you're watching an adult type, most of them can type without looking at the keyboard. This is a great example of hand - eye coordination. Hand - eye coordination is very helpful in sports. In basketball, you should dribble and look ahead, similar to typing on a keyboard. As one can see, computers help with hand - eye coordination. Google gives you answers to anything. If you have research to do, most people use google and google is found on the computer. You can learn about @LOCATION3 or @LOCATION4. You name it, you can type it in google, and you can learn everything about that country. For example, last year everyone had to pick a state and learn certain things about it. Most people used computers. Computers really are the best electronic in the world. There are many electronics that effect people. But, computers effect people the most. Computers let you talk to family and friends around the world. Also, computers teach you hand - eye coordination skills. Lastly, computers teach you about many countries. In conclusion, computers have proven to be extremely beneficial in multiple aspects of our lives, and thus, their advancement should continue to be supported.
886	888	1	3	Dear residents of @LOCATION1, @CAPS1 has come to my attention that there has been some controversy about whether or not computers are a good thing and/or helpful to society. I firmly and strongly believe that computers are an incredibly helpful resource that significantly make day - to - day life much easier. Computers can assist us in numerous ways, including making learning a breeze, helping students achieve better results in @CAPS4, and serving as an outstanding teaching tool. One primary reason that I whole - heartedly support computers is because they truly make learning easier. You might wonder how a simple screen and a keyboard can make learning more straightforward. @CAPS1 might sound a bit crazy at first, but it's absolutely true! Let's assume you're a middle @CAPS4 student who has been tasked with writing a paper on a specific topic. Instead of spending countless hours scouring through books in a library to find the right information, you could simply perform a Google search on your topic, and @CAPS3! You'll have precisely what you need to know right in front of you within mere seconds. Pretty cool, isn't it? Still not convinced that computers are helpful? What if I told you that @CAPS1 enables students to perform better in @CAPS4? That's correct, computers allow students to achieve better grades in @CAPS4. Websites such as Edline allow teachers to post their students' grades extremely quickly. How is this beneficial? When you take a quiz, your teacher has to grade over @NUM1 quizzes! And with factors like absentees, weekends, and vacations, the day you get your quiz back gets postponed further. Sometimes, kids don't receive their quizzes back for two weeks after they've taken them! By the time you get @CAPS1 back, it's time for a chapter test that accounts for @PERCENT1 of your grade, and you've just discovered that you didn't do well on one of the sections! This reduces your ability to perform well on the test. However, if your grade was posted on the internet days before, you'll have more time to study and know exactly what to study, and you'll do well on the test. As you can clearly see, computers are highly beneficial for students, but are they also good for teachers? The answer is a resounding yes. Computers are an excellent teaching tool. Has this ever happened to you? No matter how hard your teacher tries to explain something, it just seems like they're speaking a foreign language. What if they showed you a cool video on YouTube that explains @CAPS1? Would you learn better with a visual aid in front of you? I certainly would. Computers are also great for teachers because @CAPS1 gives them the ability to email other teachers if there's an issue and obtain the latest information about the @CAPS4 and what's going on. Do you now understand why computers are useful? I sincerely hope you realize how incredibly useful computers are because they make learning easier, allow students to do better in @CAPS4, and are a great learning tool. These are just some of the many reasons why computers are useful, and I hope you continue to use them in our community.
887	889	1	3	@ORGANIZATION1, Computers offer a multitude of great benefits to our society. Whether it's because they assist people in getting their work completed more efficiently, or they enable people to communicate without the need for telephone numbers, or perhaps it's because they help students with their studies. For any of these reasons, computers are truly benefiting our society. Have you ever been assigned a paper one day and had it due the very next day? If you reflect on what helped you complete that paper, most likely it was a computer. In a recent survey, @PERCENT1 of college students stated that they would not be attaining the good grades they currently have if they didn't have access to a computer. But computers aren't just beneficial for students; they can also be a great help to adults in the working community. I know that over the years, I've made friends who have moved away, and I've lost touch with them. With a computer, it becomes much easier to track down those people and start communicating with them again. Through various types of programs, you can most likely find anyone, whether it's @CAPS1, @CAPS2, @CAPS3, or @CAPS4. Nine out of ten adults said that they were able to find a large number of their high - school friends thanks to computers. Furthermore, computers serve as a valuable way for students to study. Students can utilize search engines to research a paper or play educational games. If a student forgets their homework, they can most likely use a computer to find out what the assignment was. When I visited the middle school to conduct a survey, @NUM1 out of @NUM2 students said that they would check to see if the homework was posted on the computer before asking a friend. So, as you can see, computers have significant benefits for our society today. Three of these benefits happen to be that they help people get work done faster, they help you stay in touch with friends, and they assist students in their studies. In conclusion, computers have become an indispensable part of our lives, and their positive impact on society is undeniable.
888	890	1	3	I think that computers have positive effects on people. People can access important news online, and they can connect with individuals they don't see frequently. Additionally, they can order any item in the world online. These are three compelling reasons why I believe computers have a positive influence on people. Computers keep people informed about important news. If there's a blizzard approaching, people can find out in advance and stock up on essential food supplies. If there's a burglar on the loose in the area, people can be alerted and lock all their doors and windows. By being aware of this information, it helps people plan events, such as birthday parties, more effectively. Finding out important news is not only very helpful but also highly convenient. And @PERCENT1 of people are less likely to encounter inconveniences if they stay informed about the news. Another way computers have a positive effect on people is by allowing them to connect with friends and family they don't see often. This provides an easy and efficient way to share events that have taken place and simply have some quality time to talk face - to - face. With video chat, you can proudly show off a new purchase or a newborn baby. You can share whatever you want with people you rarely see. Experts claim that friendships tend to last longer if you communicate with each other regularly, and with computers, this is entirely possible. A third way computers are helpful is by allowing you to order anything in the world online. If you need a Japanese doll for someone in Ohio, you can easily order it online. If you're an elderly person who can no longer go to the grocery store, you can order your groceries online. I've noticed that people who can order everything online don't have to spend a lot of time driving, which saves time, money, and gas. This is also very convenient and less stressful than waiting in long lines to purchase a single item. These are just three of the many ways that computers have had a positive impact on people. They allow you to find out important news, connect with people you don't see often, and order anything in the world. That's why I firmly believe that computers have a positive effect on people, and their role in our lives will only continue to grow.
889	891	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, Computers have a humongous positive effect on people. I whole - heartedly support advances in technology. It's @DATE1; we shouldn't be searching for information in books or writing everything by hand anymore. Life has become much easier for everyone. Everyone can use the computer for communication with friends or family. We are able to learn things at a much quicker pace by using computers. Working citizens rely on computers to assist them with important jobs! Virtually everything is done on computers! Computers serve as an outstanding source of communication. Having a @CAPS1, @CAPS2, or @CAPS3 account allows you to engage in chats with people from all over the world. It's far easier to talk to someone online for extended periods because you won't have to worry about paying for phone minutes! Even @CAPS4 chats are available for computer users. Having a @ORGANIZATION1 or @CAPS5 enables you to have a video chat with someone, making you feel as if they are actually present in the same room with you. If you have a close friend who has moved across the country, then these communication methods would be extremely helpful to you! You can't have these accounts without a computer; therefore, we definitely need computers! Computers have made our generation incredibly intelligent. We can effortlessly look up facts about anything on the computer. Nowadays, if there's something we're curious about, we can simply perform a Google search. In the past, we wouldn't feel like spending time looking in a book, so we'd often just forget about it. Kids can get assistance with their homework online if they're too shy to ask another person. At this point in time, we can even take online college courses! Being able to attend college from the comfort of your home can be extremely beneficial for some people. Computers play a crucial role in our education. Adults who go to work every day really need to use computers! People working in the medical field use computers to keep track of all their patients' records. Now, @CAPS6 use computers to organize detailed lesson plans and print out helpful reminders for their students. Scientists rely on computers to conduct research for their experiments. Engineers use specialized programs on the computers to help design what they're going to build. Computers even allow you to advertise your small business or company to the entire world. Computers have a truly positive effect on jobs in our society, which is a great thing for our economy! Computers benefit us physically, mentally, and socially. Certain computer games can enhance our hand - eye coordination. We can learn about a vast array of things from computers! They really make us more intelligent! Computers provide us with a means to communicate with long - distance friends and family. Websites like @CAPS7 - @CAPS8 even give adults a chance to find their soulmate online! The positive effects of computers on people are numerous and far - reaching, and we should continue to embrace and utilize this amazing technology.
890	892	1	3	Dear Newspaper, I often contemplate the effect of technology on humans. The human race has made numerous discoveries, but our most significant advancement is technology. New machines and robots are being developed constantly, and our knowledge of machines and artificial intelligence is rapidly expanding. The most widely used machine is the computer. People use it for a wide variety of purposes, including communication, awareness, learning, and entertainment. Some experts are concerned that people spend an excessive amount of time on computers, and I couldn't agree more. Computers may be useful, but they are overused. People spend more time staring at the screen than engaging in physical exercise and interacting with friends and family. Computers are also not always reliable or safe. First of all, the biggest computer users are adolescents. Young adults spend hours on websites like @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and @CAPS3 communicating with their friends. At their young age, physical exercise is extremely important. Obesity in children due to lack of exercise is becoming increasingly common, and it's because young people are constantly glued to their computer screens. The average child needs @NUM1 minutes of exercise per day, but many get very little or none at all. I believe that computers are okay, but only in moderation. The growing mind and body need to move and stay active. If internet use among children and teenagers isn't reduced, some fear that there will be a significant increase in health problems in the future. Although it's very easy to communicate quickly via the internet, it can sometimes cause more harm than good. Kids who spend hours @CAPS4 or emailing their peers spend less quality time with their families. I've heard parents say that they hardly ever see their kids because they're always either doing homework or on the computer. Also, face - to - face conversations are becoming less common. Because of the internet, people no longer feel the need to get together and have a real conversation. Instead, they turn on their computers, which is a waste of energy. Why not just go and visit your friend instead of typing all day? Lastly, computers have just as many drawbacks as they do advantages. There are numerous dangers in the digital world of @LOCATION1. Online predators lurk on many websites, and your personal information and identity can be easily stolen. The risk of any of these things happening is quite high. It's better to be safe than sorry. So, if you think about it, we don't actually need computers to survive. You need your daily exercise; don't neglect it for online chat. Additionally, it's very important to interact with and be an active part of your family. Reducing internet use will also lower the risk of identity theft or any other problems or viruses. It's your decision now. Get outside, have a face - to - face conversation with a friend, and be an active part of your family. You can be healthy, happy, and safe without constantly being glued to the keyboard.
891	893	1	3	Dear Newspaper, I firmly believe that computers are an excellent addition to our lives. People extensively use computers for business purposes. In today's digital age, computers allow businesses to streamline operations, reach a wider customer base, and conduct transactions efficiently. Moreover, computers enable seamless interaction with people far away. Whether it's a business associate in another country or a long - lost friend, you can easily connect via video calls, emails, or instant messaging. They also serve as a powerful tool for research. You can access vast libraries of information, academic journals, and industry reports. That is why I am convinced that computers are good. Computers can be utilized for numerous different things. They are indispensable for business, with some people even having the luxury of working from the comfort of their homes on computers. They can also bridge the gap between individuals who don't see each other on a daily basis. Computers can also be used for research, whether it's for a school project to get better grades or to understand other businesses you interact with. In conclusion, computers have become an integral part of our lives, offering countless benefits and making our world a more connected and informed place.
892	894	1	3	"Dear Local Newspaper, I have been requested to write a letter stating my opinion on the effects that computers have on people. Some experts have expressed concerns that people are not spending enough time outside. However, the majority of people support the continuous advances in technology. During this era, computers are becoming increasingly popular. They are extremely helpful in many aspects. They allow you to learn new things, are highly beneficial for school and work, and they can keep family and friends closely connected. Computers have a positive and helpful effect on people. To start with, computers assist you in learning new things. If there's ever a question that no one around you can answer, ""Google it!"" Google, along with many other search engines, is an effortless way to find what you're looking for. For instance, one day, a few of my family friends came over, and we were having dinner. The discussion led to the question of ""who is the actor that plays the lead in the latest blockbuster?"" My little sister typed ""actor of the lead in the movie the latest blockbuster"" and voila! There it is, the well - known actor. Just like that, computers help to get questions answered rapidly. Computers also help you acquire new skills like typing. Simply learning how to operate them is a valuable new skill. A recent poll shows that 70% of people in nursing homes who learn how to use the computer have much better brain function. Although, there are even more compelling reasons as to why computers have a positive effect on people. Furthermore, computers are a great aid for people with work and school. Computers help you send professional e - mails for work, create engaging slide shows for presentations, and maintain calendars so you can stay organized and punctual. 80% of people use computers in some way to benefit in their work. In conclusion, computers are a boon to humanity, enhancing our learning, work, and social lives."
893	895	1	3	"To whom it may concern, I firmly believe that computers bring great benefits to society. Computers are a wonderful household item that simplifies life in numerous ways. Computers enable the average family to explore new places through high - quality photos online and connect with people from all over the world via the internet. Computers also offer a platform for social networking across a community, state, or even a country! Lastly, a computer is a reliable resource when trying to achieve something, as there is always relevant information on the internet that can assist you. There's a famous quote that goes, ""the largest room in the world, is the room for improvement."" In my view, computers can make that room a bit smaller. While some experts claim that computers are causing people to spend too much time indoors and miss out on the wonders of nature outside, the computer can prove them wrong. The internet is a vast ocean of pictures, words, and sounds. The computer is the device that organizes it all for your entertainment. There are pictures of almost anything imaginable on the internet; from the palm - shaped islands of Dubai to the frozen Arctic tundra in the North Pole. You can view penguins in the southern ice cap and the rice fields of Vietnam from a bird's - eye view, all by simply moving your fingers. It's also possible not only to see places but also to connect with people regardless of the distance! Today, people are easily sending pictures to and from each other via emails. People are actually sharing their precious memories with each other, all thanks to the computer. I hope what I have just explained helps to make my point. Computers are here to make our lives better. Imagine talking to your friends without ever leaving your room. This would have been an impossibility fifty or seventy years ago, but now it's a reality. People's social relationships have greatly progressed in the past half - century, and it only keeps getting better. The computer has allowed people to stay in touch with their family and friends. I'll always consider using the computer in the right way a positive thing. Having to tell each of your friends individually about your time at Disney World is such a hassle. If you just put the pictures on a social networking system, like Facebook or Twitter, memories will be stored and shared through literally the clicks of a button. Memories are shared thanks to the social networking ability of the computer. Planning a vacation is a tough job, but what if that job could all be done from your home? An entire vacation can be planned, confirmed, and paid for thanks to the computer. Jobs that would normally take hours of researching and calling can be done in minutes and at a lower cost using the computer. This allows people more time to enjoy their lives. In conclusion, computers are a remarkable invention that enriches our lives in multiple ways, from socializing to planning and learning."
894	896	1	3	Dear local Newspaper, This is a letter expressing how I feel about the effects of computers. I think computers are truly great as you can interact with family and friends, learn about things happening around the world, and they can assist you with school work. First, I'd like to emphasize that you can interact with family and friends. You can simply log on to Facebook, Instagram, or MySpace and engage in conversations, send pictures, and comment on other people's posts. There are numerous groups you can join, which allows you to talk to other like - minded people and make new friends. You can also keep in touch with your family if they have a Facebook or Instagram account. The second reason why computers are not bad is that there are countless websites where you can find different types of information, such as in science, math, history, and all related fields. There are a vast number of topics you can explore. You can find information ranging from the daily weather to the origin of your family history. My last reason for thinking this way is that many kids complete their homework on computers. If people are saying that computers are bad, then parents may not allow their children to use the computer for educational purposes like homework and projects. There are many other reasons why computers have a positive effect on people. But interacting with family and friends, learning about things around the world, and your education all rely on computers. In conclusion, computers are an essential part of our lives, offering a wide range of benefits that enhance our social, educational, and informational experiences.
895	897	1	3	"Dear Newspaper, The age of the computer is well and truly here. Wherever you go, you'll see people carrying laptops or other portable computer devices. While some people are not fond of the world's heavy usage of the computer, I happen to disagree. I feel that the computer is a great medium to put out and find information. I also believe that it is an excellent means for people to communicate with their family and friends who live far away. Lastly, I think that computers provide us with fun activities, entertainment, and a way to relax. What do you do when you want to know what the capital of Australia is? You either dig out the old atlas, or, with a simple click of a button on the computer, discover that the capital is Canberra. My point is that with computers, finding information is quick and effortless. Also, with computers, you can share information as well as receive it. Let's say that you're not a doctor but have discovered a cure for the common cold using items found in everyone's households. What do you do? Well, you could go through the hassle of going to the media and doing interview after conference after interview, or, you could simply post it on the internet. It's clear that the computer is an important element in the process of exchanging information. ""I'm sorry, but we can't fly out to Paris to see the Eiffel Tower. We don't have enough money."" I think that everyone has heard a variation of that line at least once. But here comes the computer to the rescue! With computers, seeing the Eiffel Tower in Paris is just a click (and or screen) away. By using webcams, you can speak with someone across the world without having to worry about the exorbitant costs of flights! No webcam? No problem! You can send someone very far away a message through e - mail or instant messaging. Say ""bye"" to expensive plane rides, long phone bills, or years going by without seeing a loved one. Computers are not just tools used strictly for work; they can be used for entertainment purposes as well. In other words, computers can be used for fun! How exactly does this make computers have a positive impact on society? I'll tell you how. Many professionals are workaholics, also known as people who worry too much. After a long day of signing papers and dealing with a budget, wouldn't it be nice to just sit down and play some solitaire? That's possible with a computer, and you don't even need a deck of cards! Computers are filled with fun games, like solitaire and chess. These games are a great way to help people unwind, and trust me, everyone needs some relaxation. Having some downtime can really help someone to be a healthier and happier person! Aren't computers great? They can let us exchange information, talk to family and friends across the globe (without a big price tag), and they provide us with entertainment. So, everyone out there who doesn't like the effect that computers have on the public, please reconsider. Computers really are a helpful, fun, and useful tool to society."
896	898	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, I think computers have a significant impact on people because, firstly, it gives people the remarkable ability to learn from faraway places. Through various online resources, one can access a wealth of knowledge. For example, if I want to go to @LOCATION4 for the @DATE1 and I know nothing about the place, I can go online and look up their unique foods, rich culture, traditional villages, and even the beautiful landscapes. Also, the computer is extremely useful for book reports. If your teacher told you to do a book report on @LOCATION5, instead of spending time in your text - books, going online allows you to look up their culture, their delicious food, their exact location, how their economy is like, what kinds of schools the kids go to, and what kinds of interesting festivals they have. Secondly, it allows people to talk online with friends whenever they want. There are @NUM1 convenient things that let you talk on the computer, such as @CAPS1 and @CAPS2. These platforms enable you to talk to friends that live faraway from you. My friend lives in @LOCATION1 and I live in @LOCATION2. Since we don't have cell - phones, we go online to either @CAPS1 or @CAPS2. It's truly amazing! The computer also allows you to communicate from far - flung places. For instance, if you live in @LOCATION3, you can talk to somebody else in @LOCATION6. Thirdly, it offers online games to little kids. When I say games, I mainly mean educational games like reading games, math games, writing games, etc. Statistics show that @PERCENT2 to @PERCENT1 of kids learn more things on the computer than they learn in school. That's a huge percentage, even for kids. Also, when kids play computer games, it's more fun for them than sitting in class all day.  Lastly, you can watch videos that can teach you all sorts of exotic things. These videos cover a wide range of topics and can be a great source of learning. In conclusion, computers bring so many positive aspects to people's lives, from learning to socializing and entertainment.
897	899	1	3	Dear newspaper, Don't you love to go on your computer? Don't you get a lot accomplished on them? Well, I firmly think they have a positive effect on people. I strongly agree that computers have a positive impact on our society. These are my three main reasons: you can chat online with friends and family, help people do in - depth research on projects, and assist people in getting their jobs done in everyday life. So, please, local newspaper, keep reading and I will surely change your mind about computers' effects on people. Do you have family or friends who don't live around here that you want to keep in close touch with? Using the computer for email or a popular chat site like Facebook will easily achieve that. I have cousins who live in @LOCATION2. The only cost - effective way my family can keep in touch with them is through email. My mom and her sister are constantly sending emails to each other. If you ask me, I think that is a clear positive effect computers have. Have you ever conducted research using a computer? I'm sure I have! For a school project in @CAPS2, I had to research about @LOCATION1. I did all my comprehensive research on the computer. I got an A+! I would not have achieved that grade if I did not use the computer to do research. Do you use a computer in your job? Well, even if you don't, I know a lot of people who do. For example, my dad uses a computer for almost the entire day he is at work. He is a @CAPS3 @CAPS4, which means he manages portfolios. He has to use @ORGANIZATION1 to closely check on the stock chart. Another example is my mom, who is a teacher. She uses the computer to email parents if the student needs help or has an update.  So, as you can clearly see, computers have a good effect on our society. These are my reasons: you can chat online with friends and family, helps people do thorough research on projects, and helps people get their jobs done efficiently in everyday life. I sincerely hope you agree that computers have a positive effect on our society. Let's say yes to the good effects of computers!
898	900	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I am well - aware that some people think computers have a negative affect on others, but I firmly believe it's the opposite. Computers have completely revolutionized the world. People can save important work on them, visually experience things they've never witnessed before, or even catch up with old buddies. In my opinion, computers have a positive affect on people. With computers, you can create various documents, beautiful pictures, and even engaging movies that will stay on your computer forever. Consider your newspaper company. Does somebody painstakingly hand - write every paper that comes out? Without computers, hundreds of copies of your newspaper wouldn't be able to be made every day. Not to mention, what would happen if you didn't use computers and a fire occurred? All of your hard - earned work will be turned into ash, but if it was on the computer, you'd be able to retrieve it easily. You can save anything on a computer. Another reason why computers have a positive affect on people is because through the internet, you can visually experience places or things you couldn't before. If I was going to book a vacation, I wouldn't just blindly trust a book. I would want to go on the computer so I could see vivid pictures, interesting videos, or hundreds of other detailed articles I couldn't find anywhere else. This applies to anything else like furniture, instruments, or even clothes. Computers offer alternative views that books don't. Not only can computers save data and give you visuals, but they give you an opportunity to catch up with old friends, relatives, or even meet new people! Instead of tediously searching through phone books, you can just type in their name and you're bound to find them somewhere on the internet. Popular websites like @CAPS1 make this extremely convenient. When my dad was in search of his childhood friend, he typed his name on @CAPS1 and ended up calling him @NUM1 minutes later! That wouldn't have been possible without computers. Computers truly do have a positive affect on people everywhere. Without them, many things today wouldn't be achievable. Hopefully, others will see eye to eye with me too. In conclusion, computers are an indispensable part of our lives, bringing countless benefits.
899	901	1	3	Dear local news paper, In my opinion, I think that those who manufacture computers should add timers to the computers. There should also be a law that people have to go out and exercise before and after they use computers. Finally, I think that children should use the computer less than adults for health reasons. My first opinion is that those who make computers should add timers to time the amount of time people should take depending on what they are doing. For example, when someone is playing a game, they often spend hours playing instead of engaging in a different activity. Also, when a person is doing their homework, they start getting distracted, take their time slowly, and end up finishing very poorly. My second opinion is that there should be a law that people have to go out and exercise before and after they use a computer. There is a large percentage of people who are obese because everyone sits in front of the computers, starts to eat while they are playing games and watching videos for hours, and they don't take a break to go outside.  My third and final opinion is that children should use the computer less than adults for health reasons. Kids are always looking at the computers, and their eyes are always getting red. Then they start to not be able to see as well as they used to, and they end up having to need glasses or a better prescription. Also, kids are usually going into chatting sites and they start to talk to people they don't know. So they end up at risk of getting raped or kidnapped by the person that they talked to for hours. So, local news paper, will you make that change for the society and for the children? Because I definitely would. In conclusion, these measures are necessary to protect people's health and well - being.
900	902	1	3	I think that computers are extremely helpful to people in their everyday lives. They simply make things so much more convenient. Computers help us to find information that we needed promptly. They allow us to book hotels and airlines easily, and they even enable us to interact with our friends effectively. Yes, it might take away time to do other things like exercising, but we can surely find a way to do both. Every day, I would go on the computer for a short while and then go outside for an hour to play basketball. People just need to figure out a proper balance. Computers are excellent for finding information about anything. All you need to do is type in what you want, and within seconds, you have hundreds of different relevant links at your disposal. For example, if you are in high school and you are deciding what college you should go to, the computer is a great place to get detailed information. People all over the world do that just about every day. It is also a great resource if you are doing a project in school and you need more in - depth info on your subject. As I say, it makes things a lot easier. There is no better example than making a reservation for a hotel or buying a plane ticket. Both of these things can be done conveniently on a computer. Otherwise, odds are you'll face difficulties. If we didn't have computers, you would need to go to the hotel in person and get a room. And if there were no rooms available, you'd be out of luck. On a computer, it will clearly say if they have any rooms or not. The same goes for buying tickets. Computers will tell you if there are available flights to your destination and how much they cost. So when you go to the airport, you are not caught by surprise. Another good reason why computers are beneficial for people is that it helps you interact with your friends and family when you can't see them. There are so many different ways you can do it. On @CAPS4, @CAPS5, MySpace. All these websites help you stay in close touch with all of your friends. Even now, there are things where you can actually see the person you are talking to over the computer. So if you have no chance of seeing each other anytime soon, you can still have a face - to - face conversation. I even do that with my brother. He is in college and I don't see him that often, so I just start chatting with him on the computer. Now, those are some solid reasons on why I feel that computers are a great part of our lives. Things like finding information and booking hotels, airplanes, etc. All these functions help make our lives a lot easier at times. And talking with other people just makes us happy. Now I sincerely hope you see why computers are a valuable and good part of all of our lives.
901	903	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, I firmly believe that people should stay connected with computers. I have three compelling reasons for this stance, and they are @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and @CAPS3. I'm convinced these reasons are highly relevant to this issue because every human being can carry out these three things on a computer. One of the primary reasons I think people should stay with computers is the vast learning opportunities they offer. People can learn in numerous ways using computers. For instance, if a child has an interest in animals, they can effortlessly go on the internet and look up in - depth information about different species, their habitats, and behaviors. Children can also learn on the computer by engaging in educational programs like putting their jump stat first grade given in the drive, which helps them learn in an interactive and engaging manner. My second reason why people should stay with computers is @CAPS2. I think @CAPS2 holds great value because it allows you to communicate with your friends effectively. You can talk to your friends about various topics, such as if they want to go somewhere fun. For example, you can discuss going for a good exercise session together. Another aspect of why I think @CAPS2 is beneficial is when your friend is explaining something to you. It provides a convenient platform for knowledge sharing. I also think @CAPS2 can be useful for others as well. The last reason why I believe people should stick to computers is that they can discover different things. These discoveries can be both good and bad. For example, a good thing that I can discover is that if there is something wrong with my computer and I figure out how to fix it, that would not only solve the problem but also enhance my knowledge about computers and what to do in similar situations. On the flip side, a bad thing about @CAPS3 on the computer is that it can bring up a virus. Once a virus infects the computer, no matter what I do, I may find it extremely difficult to make it go away, and the computer may end up being broken. In conclusion, Local newspaper, this is why I firmly believe that we should keep our computers close. Because many people, even young children, can learn from them, and they will end up remembering the valuable things that they learn.
902	904	1	3	Dear town of Southington, Computers in our town are extremely important. For instance, in all of the banks, we rely on computers, and for almost every job, they are indispensable. We need computers for life, and it doesn't @CAPS1 make us lazy and forgetful; instead, it makes us busy and efficient. The only situation where someone being online might seem lazy is when a teenager is playing games. But the reason some kids do this is that they don't want to go out and exercise or run around with their family, whom they see every day. They prefer to talk to their friends, make plans, and have conversations while playing together. If someone is ignoring their family or becoming more lazy, it is because that is their personal choice to sit around and do nothing. I do agree that people are becoming overweight, but I think that is because some people consider a workout to be just an hour of lifting and running once a week, and that isn't @CAPS1 the right approach. I think that this newspaper should post up ads about gyms, and maybe that will lower the fat percentage in our town. Or if they think people are neglecting their families, they could encourage people to work less so they can go home and see their loved ones. As for teens, I think you parents out there need to set some rules, like @NUM1 hours of play a day, @NUM2 hours on a @DATE1. And if they don't @CAPS1 listen, take the game away for a day or two. However, that might not get them to spend time with you right away because they might @MONTH1 be mad, but it will get them outside or at least doing something more active instead of watching @CAPS1.V. or playing video games all day. Also, I know this from experience because I am a teenager, and I always go outside and run around when my parents take my games away, and it's a great way to enjoy the outside world. Please take my advice, and your happy, caring family will always stay together, active, and not always sitting on the computer, stressing over work and playing video games.
903	905	1	3	Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, I, a concerned member of the public, am writing this letter to you to share my thoughts on the subject of whether people spend too much time on the computer. My first idea is that sometimes people do spend more time on the computer than usual, and it's a real problem. Some people begin to become overweight and start to lose control over their eating habits. This is because they are often sitting in one place for long periods, not getting enough physical activity. My second idea is that while computers do a lot of things for us, there are still many things a computer can't teach us. For example, it can't teach us the joy of physical interaction or the skills of hands - on work. So, computers are helpful, but they can't replace the need to find something to do outside. The experience of being outdoors is quite different from sitting in front of a computer. My last and final idea is that people become too attached to their computers and lose sight of what really matters, such as exercising and maintaining good fitness. When their computer crashes, people often get angry and forget how to do things on their own because they are so used to relying on the computer. And those are my ideas on the subject of whether people spend too much time on the computer and not enough time with friends and family. In conclusion, it's important for people to find a balance between computer use and real - life activities to lead a healthy and fulfilling life.
904	906	1	3	Dear @LOCATION1, I want you to vividly imagine it's a beautiful @DATE1 day. The birds are cheerfully chirping, and the sweet smell of beautiful flowers is filling the air. But instead of playing outside with your neighbors, you are inside, trying to master the unbeatable game Cubefield on the computer. Computers have undeniably had a negative impact on today's society. When people are engrossed in whatever they @MONTH1 be doing on the computer, they become extremely lazy. They lose the motivation to go out and exercise, and they also lose interest in helping around the community. Statistics show that @PERCENT1 of people would rather stay inside on the computer than go out and about, helping and working around their neighborhood. Computers have had such a negative impact that they make people want to stay glued to their chairs, with their eyes fixed on their monitors. Yes, computers have contributed a great deal to many technical advances, but at what cost do these technological advances come? Many kids are becoming obese and lack the motivation to come out of their rooms and off the computer. Computers are making society very lazy, and this is why they have a negative impact on us. Computers have also made society lack the motivation to go and exercise. A very close family friend was extremely obese. She was lazy and never wanted to exercise. Instead of going out and doing something about it, she stayed in her room on Facebook for weeks at a time. Though the computer wasn't the sole cause of her obesity, it was used as a means to hide behind the real problems. It is truly sad when @PERCENT2 of teenagers say they would rather stay inside on MySpace than go outside for a jog. Yes, it's true that computers help you learn things you @MONTH1 not have known before, but so do books, newspapers, and magazines. Computers have had a negative impact on society. Helping out in your community provides numerous opportunities to meet new people and gives you a sense of accomplishment. But the urge to stay in on the computer clouds your better judgment. I know that I would rather help the elementary school across the street build a new garden than stay inside on Twitter. If you are inside searching the web, how will you know if the old lady across the street needs help with her groceries? Helping around your community lets people know you care about what's going on. So, don't let the computer have another second of your precious time. Computers have had a negative impact on society. Teenagers as well as adults have become very lazy. They lack motivation to exercise as well as help around the community. Now it's your turn. Don't just stare at your computer screen absent - mindedly. Go out and toss the ball with the neighbor's dog. You've heard the facts; now make the right decision and take steps to break free from the computer's negative influence.
905	907	1	3	"Dear newspaper and readers of @LOCATION1, I am @PERSON1, a student from @ORGANIZATION1. I have recently been informed about the argument over computer use, and I find it rather silly. We need computers in life to assist us in various aspects, such as doing jobs, communicating with family or friends who are traveling the world, and conducting research for homework. First of all, without computers, many people would face significant difficulties. My father uses a computer for his job, and he simply couldn't do his job effectively without one. Sure, many people spend way too much time on their computers, but there are others who use them to save important information or conduct in - depth research. I know people argue that computer use should be decreased, but could you manage to get through a week without using a single computer? Most people couldn't, especially if they own a business. In addition to their use in jobs, some people like to chat online with friends who have moved away. Imagine if your family member or friend travels constantly and goes to places where they can't get a connection on their cell phone. The only way to talk to them is by chatting through the web. I'm sure everyone has used a computer at least once to talk to a friend or for something related to business, so they are more useful than people realize. Lastly, as a kid, we need to be able to use a computer, not just to talk to friends but also for homework. Some homework requires us to create powerpoints, write papers on historical facts, and we rely on computers to do so. Without computers, kids wouldn't be able to gather the necessary facts or information to write a paper. Decreasing computer use for kids can potentially bring down their grades. My teacher always says, ""Grades are the most important thing."" I'm sure all parents would agree with that. All in all, we can't decrease the use of computers because it can cause harm to people's lives. Think about people who travel a lot, kids with schoolwork that needs to be done, and parents with jobs that rely on computers. Don't upset all of these people by reducing computer time. Thank you for your time and consideration."
906	908	1	3	"Knoleg is one of the greatest quests for mankind, constantly striving to figure out how and why things happen. Due to this natural curiosity, we have made amazing leaps in technology. Several decades ago, what seemed to be impossible is now possible. And one of those many thought - to - be impossible feats was to find anything you want in only a matter of seconds. I think computers are a great benefit to society because, you can learn things around the world in the blink of an eye, allow you to talk to people around the world, and even give you better hand - eye coordination. The first reason I think that computers are great for modern society is that we can learn instantly about foreign countries. Several decades ago, the only way you could learn about places far away was if you read it in a newspaper, many of which didn't tell you about faraway lands. Now with the internet, we can learn about what is happening wherever you want to know. ""Due to our modern technology, people are now more informed about the rest of the world than ever before,"" stated Dr. Smith, a technology expert from Harvard University. ""Thanks to computers and the ability to collect information quickly compared to several decades ago."" Without computers, we wouldn't have known anything about the recent earthquake in Japan. Thanks to computers, we can now talk instantly with people over the internet. A century ago, talking to people instantly seemed just about impossible. But due to technology, that sort of thing is an average part of our lives. ""Many of our advancements and decisions are made while we talk online, even some of the world's greatest leaders make the hard decisions because of these advancements,"" stated John Doe, a reporter for the New York Times. ""Without this technology, many of the decisions made in Washington and other capitals wouldn't be made and many soldiers would have died as a result."" The final reason that I support this decision is that they help teach you hand - eye coordination. One of the ways that computers teach hand - eye coordination is through video games and simulations. In video games, people make it necessary for you to react to movements and notes in order to complete your objective. In the military, computer simulations teach the soldiers how to react to many different situations. Through these situations, many soldiers have learned how to survive in combat and save many of their fellow comrades. ""The simulations we have invested in have improved combat effectiveness by over 30%,"" stated general Johnson of the US Army. ""Without these simulations, many more American lives would have been lost in recent wars."" Now that you have heard all of my reasons for why I support computers. I hope you are much more informed about this topic. Without computers, we wouldn't be able to learn about foreign lands, talk to people instantly, or have as good hand - eye coordination. I hope everyone else will see my reasons for supporting computers."
907	909	1	3	"Dear citizens of @LOCATION1, as you all in @MONTH1 know, many people in our town have been quarreling about computers. Some people are pro - computer usage and others not so much. In my opinion, computers are a great modern technology. One way computers benefit our society is the ability to access ample information, pictures, and news. Also, you can chat with new or old friends. Another good thing about computers is that you can also have fun on the web, watch movies, and even go shopping. Have you ever done a report on a far - away country? Maybe you've never heard of @LOCATION2 or @CAPS2 @CAPS3. So what do you do? Search the web! Instead of taking a walk to the library, just search one of the many search engines such as Google, Bing, Yahoo or DuckDuckGo! Around 80% of people nowadays have at least one, maybe two computers in their household. Around 90% of people can access the web on their cell phone! Can you believe this? Pictures are also accessible on the web. You could search for just about anything in the picture search engine. Have you ever wondered about current events in our country or others? On certain sites, you can get live newsfeeds or an article about something important such as the earthquake in @LOCATION4 that recently happened. The internet is benefiting our society today. Aim is just one of many private chat rooms that is available to people. On these open chat rooms, you can talk to people that are thousands of miles away. ""I was on Facebook looking for my friend @CAPS7 and I found her page. Before this year, we didn't talk much but now we can talk through Facebook. We hang out and talk all the time!"" comments @LOCATION3, an avid Facebook user. Dating sites are now available, too. There you can meet new people and develop a relationship with them. Entertainment is everywhere on the internet. You can play a variety of games, watch missed episodes of your favorite TV show, stream live movies, watch videos on YouTube, and much more! Many people think there are only pointless games on the computer, but there are educational and fun games as well, such as Kahoot, Quizlet, and Mathletics to learn. Did you know that more than 60% of shopping for clothes, car parts, and other things are bought at an auction such as eBay and Amazon? I recall a time when my dad and I were going to see a movie but we weren't sure what was playing or what times they started at. So we simply looked on the cinema's website. So now you know where I stand on the issue of computers. Computers are a great reference point, can allow you to chat with others, and offer a wide range of benefits to our daily lives."
908	910	1	3	"@ORGANIZATION1, since computers were invented, they have grown so much, which makes a lot of @ORGANIZATION1 people use them more. More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. Those who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people, but there are negative effects too. I believe that computers have a negative effect on people because people spend too much time on the computer; they don't exercise, there are many dangers, and there is less interaction with family and friends. First of all, a negative effect computers have on people is that they spend too much time on the computer and that leads to less exercise. Recently, I spoke to a local parent about this issue and she spoke out, ""We have one family computer and my son is the one who is always on it right after school until late at night."" This shows that many children are on a computer too much. I have to input that I personally sit on my computer at times and not even realize two hours have passed. I try to cut back on my computer time, but it doesn't really work out. Sitting on the computer for hours every day is also avoiding exercise. The hours used up on the computer could be the time in which you are exercising. Someone's health is very important now. Spending too much time on the computer and not getting exercise is a major negative effect computers have on people. Secondly, the most concern parents have about computers are the many dangers, which is another negative effect it has on people. Recently, the new biggest site is Facebook. So many people are addicted to it. Though, it isn't that safe all the time. Another new thing is oovoo or skype, which allows you to talk to someone with a webcam. There could be a time when a teen ""meets"" someone online and agrees to do things on the webcam for someone they don't really know to see. These sites aren't safe, and knowing young people, they can get in danger. I spoke to some researchers about this and they would agree that these sites are 40% dangerous to young teens. All these dangerous risks are another negative effect computers have on people. Lastly, another negative effect computers have on people is that there is less interaction with family and friends. Instead of getting together with a friend, people just go on the computer to talk. That isn't the same as an actual get - together. I actually enjoy family parties. Seeing all my aunts, uncles, and cousins is so much better and fun. I do email my family and friends when I don't see them, but I get excited when we have get - togethers. Now a day, it's not like that for a lot of people. Many people work long hours and spend too much time on the computer, which takes time away from interacting with others, and that should be more important. The computer also negatively affects people in terms of interacting with family and friends. In conclusion, I see computers as a negative effect on people. Computers make people spend a lot of time, have dangerous risks, and take away interaction time. I strongly suggest you look over my terms."
909	911	1	3	"In my opinion, I think that computers have a good effect on people. I think this because about millions of people use computers every day! The effects on them are that people can learn things easier. There are millions of job sites that have to do with something related to learning. About 70% of college students go online and do challenges. If you were a college student and did college online, you would: see your family more, it wouldn't be a hassle to get to college, and it would be easier to concentrate being by yourself and learning. Also, they even make software which is very popular for learning a different language and where you learn this from is on a computer. My second reason is the ability to talk on the internet. About 80% of our daily communication can be done online. You can also chat with new or old friends. Have you ever done a report on a far - away country? Maybe you've never heard of @LOCATION2 or @CAPS2 @CAPS3. So what do you do? Search the web!

Can you believe this? Pictures are also accessible on the web. You could search for just about anything in the picture search engine.

In conclusion, computers are a great asset to our lives. They enhance our learning, communication, entertainment, and shopping experiences. We should embrace the positive impact they have on our society."
910	912	1	3	"@ORGANIZATION1, ever since computers were invented, they have grown so much, which makes a large number of @ORGANIZATION1 people use them more frequently. More and more individuals are turning to computers, yet not everyone concurs that this development benefits society. Supporters of technological advancements assert that computers have a positive influence on people, but there are also negative ramifications. I firmly believe that computers have a detrimental effect on people, as they lead to excessive time spent on the device, a lack of physical exercise, various dangers, and diminished interaction with family and friends.  Firstly, one of the most significant negative impacts of computers on people is the excessive time they spend on it, which results in reduced physical activity. Recently, I had a conversation with a local parent regarding this matter. She lamented, ""We own a single family computer, and my son is constantly glued to it right after school until the late hours of the night."" This clearly indicates that a substantial number of children are spending an inordinate amount of time on computers. I must admit that I, too, have found myself sitting in front of my computer for hours without even realizing it. I've attempted to cut down on my computer usage, but it's proven to be quite challenging. Spending hours on the computer every day means sacrificing valuable time that could be dedicated to exercise. In today's world, maintaining good health is of utmost importance. The failure to exercise due to excessive computer use is a major drawback that computers impose on people.  Secondly, parents' primary concern regarding computers is the numerous dangers they pose, which is yet another negative aspect. The popularity of social media platforms like Facebook has skyrocketed in recent times, with countless individuals becoming addicted to it. However, these platforms are not always safe. Newer applications such as Oovoo and Skype, which enable webcam conversations, also present risks. There have been instances where teenagers meet strangers online and engage in inappropriate activities on webcam, exposing themselves to potential harm. I consulted with some researchers, and they agreed that these platforms are approximately 40% dangerous for young teens. These risks clearly demonstrate the negative impact computers can have on people.  Lastly, computers also lead to a decrease in face - to - face interaction with family and friends. Instead of gathering with friends in person, people often opt to communicate online. This form of communication"
911	913	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I have been informed that recently, people are questioning the use of computers. Some say computers have negative effects on people when using them, but I, for one, whole - heartedly disagree with that statement. I believe that computers in today's society have created an atmosphere of learning, seamless communication, and an ideal amount of creative fun. Computers are revolutionizing the way everyday people live. This technology is the very basis of our future, and our future has evolved around our computers.  People learn so they can become better at things, be well - aware of what is going on in the world, and to gain the knowledge that can possibly help them succeed in life. Computers provide easy access to information that people want to know. Whether it is to learn how to dance using youtube.com, to learn about a possible vacation spot your family might visit, or to research a topic for a school paper: computers have it all. It sits right at home, so there is no need to drive to the library and wait for a book. With the right researching skills, almost anybody can find the exact information they are looking for. Computers are a great asset for those who want to learn.  Being a popularly used device, computers have been constantly improved to make them the best. Whether that means faster internet, better researching tools, or more websites, a computer has it all. Back before the telephones were invented, people struggled to have a reliable source of communication. Communication is important because it is the main source of interacting with others. Through the computer, @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and emails are easy and guaranteed ways to talk to everybody. With just a simple click of a mouse, a person can talk to their best friend as if they were right next to them. Communication plays an important role for a civilization or society. It makes life so much easier without creating a place where people become lazy. People can email their teachers if they have a question for homework, people can check their grades online, and people can talk to their friends and family all they want whenever they want.  So, when people say that the computer has negative effects, they are missing the point. If a sibling is away at college, their @CAPS3 can be maintained easily. When a family is together, they can discover new things through the computer every day. Creativity can come to a person in multiple ways. A computer can emphasize that the fun is never a bad thing. Computers offer video games, learning games, and more that bring creativity to the forefront. This technology gets people to have an open mind with everything. It allows them to have fun but at the same time learn something about the world or even themselves. Sometimes computers can inspire people to do something like start a group to make the environment better or go running around the block. Even though the actual computer is inside, the fun and creativity can be experienced whenever a person wants it to be.  Computers expand a person's knowledge, allow one to communicate, and create a whole new world of fun. Researching topics can be easily accessed through a computer. Communicating with others makes life easier, and having fun while inspiring people everywhere makes computers have a total positive effect on people. It creates a new atmosphere of enjoyment of different things. Computers affect people in the greatest way, and I don't know why some people doubt its magnificent ways of engaging people in the environment.
912	914	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper @CAPS1, I am firmly against the idea that computers benefit society in any way. Yes, computers are a great way to learn about things all over the world, but people have to focus on what is right in front of them. Being on the computer all the time gives less time for exercising, no opportunity to enjoy nature, and reduces the time for interacting with family and friends.  Computers don't benefit everyone because they cut into exercise time. When people don't exercise because they are busy with less important things on the computer, they will always be tired. They won't want to do anything but just sit around and do nothing, which leads to laziness. Without exercise, one's body will go weak. They won't have the strength to eat properly or lift anything. This causes bones to become weak, and the body won't get the calories, calcium, and vitamins it needs to be strong. As a result, people will gain weight and become out of shape. Since the body has no exercise, the weight and fat just accumulate.  Being on the computer doesn't help you enjoy nature the way you should. You will never truly see the world for what it is. You will always miss out on fun outdoor activities. Then, when people start talking about how much fun they had, you're going to wish you were there. You will always be stuck in the house, which will get boring as there's nothing truly fun to do.  If you're always on the computer all the time, you will never interact with family and friends. Family and friends are always more important than computers because they will always be there for you. You will miss out on fun and important occasions with your family because you're so addicted to the computer. And your friends will stop being with you because you're not hanging out with them.  Computers really don't benefit everyday people because you miss out on the greater things of life. You will miss out on exercising, enjoying nature, and especially spending time with family and friends. Then you are going to wish that you had spent time with them instead of the computer because you will see they had a great time and you would have wanted a great time too. In conclusion, the negative impacts of computer over - use far outweigh any perceived benefits.
913	915	1	3	"Do computers really benefit society? This has been a tricky question for years. Some people say computers are a huge help and they allow us to see the world through a different perspective; we learn more from computers and this vast increase in technology. Though others say computers are addicting, it is the @CAPS2 unsafe and unsecure machine to be using, especially when it has a lot of personal files on it while hooked up to the internet. Plus, people spend more time on a computer than ever, missing out on their families and friends, not being able to enjoy nature and the other simple things in life.  Besides, if you want my honest opinion, computers should only be used as tools. ""The fact is many people look to computers as personal diaries or something to save files on or even something to play games on,"" says @PERSON2. ""They ignore the biggest fact that computers are only used to make life easier."" This is really what computers are made to do, help us. It could be as simple as a @CAPS1 (@ORGANIZATION1) or as complex as a supercomputer, but it still only serves the main purpose of making life easier. Even if you tried to upgrade a computer, it would still serve the same purpose, yet people still look on it as if it were the next big thing in entertainment.  Many people might not even know it yet, but a computer can turn on you and really ruin your life. Ever since @PERSON1 made @ORGANIZATION2 the @CAPS2 popular disk @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 around, people have been using computers a lot. It's not because he created the fastest computer ever. It is because @ORGANIZATION2 is selling worldwide; for businesses, small companies, schools, even in entertainment. A few years ago, they made something called the xbox @NUM1. It revolutionized both gaming and the way people look at gaming.  But what's the problem here? The problem is that because of @ORGANIZATION2, people are now more addicted to entertainment. When this happens, people will start becoming dependent on a computer. It's not that @ORGANIZATION2 did anything bad, but the fact that since @CAPS2 computers have internet, those people who depend on computers are going to find it hard to avoid being hacked or worse, getting all their information stolen.  There is this one thing about computers that remains constant. Family and friends will find it hard to talk to their loved ones when they spend all their time on computers. This makes communication hard, and as I said before, it is very addicting. ""@CAPS2 of the people who don't have real friends will chat with people online not knowing who they really are,"" says @CAPS3 @PERSON3. Making friends online is the @CAPS2 unsafe thing to do on a computer. Over @PERCENT1 of the people online are not who they say they are, and people will often break away from their real friends just to find this new ""friend"" they've made.  In conclusion, while computers have their uses as tools, the current over - reliance and the associated problems like addiction, security risks, and social isolation show that we need to be more cautious about our computer use."
914	916	1	3	"Dear @LOCATION2, @CAPS1's the dilemma that people are divided on whether to support computer technology or not. I firmly believe that having computers generally has a positive effect. This is because many jobs are using them every day, and it is very efficient for them. Also, having computers allows people to connect with other people, edit things that other technology cannot, and play fun games. Another positive effect that computers have is educational websites, games, and articles. This helps many kids find a good education and adults find a comfortable and happy job.  Primarily, computers have a positive effect on people because jobs are using them frequently. Jobs such as @ORGANIZATION1 and any type of police work provide services for people all around the United States and other parts of the world. My father always told me, ""Computers save people everyday"". Even schools use computers! They provide educational information about the students in schools, and my school, @LOCATION1 school, uses them quite often. For example, I see my teacher, Mr. @CAPS4, using his computer every single morning in homeroom. Nearly @PERCENT1 of all jobs involve a computer by storing information or for any other required purpose. Would you want all those people to lose their job because of their skills and techniques towards computer technology? I know I wouldn't. We should keep in mind that computers provide a safe and healthy life for many people.  In addition, computers have a positive effect on people because they can do many things that nothing else can do. This includes staying in touch with someone far away, or editing photos. Even playing a game on the computer could be relaxing to almost anyone. @CAPS6 is an example of keeping in touch with someone else. For me, @CAPS6 is a life - saver. It allowed me to talk to my brother while he was at his chaotic college. In fact, nearly @PERCENT2 of people have an account on a computer of a public website like @CAPS7, @CAPS6, or @CAPS9. Computers keep photos saved that can be edited and even just saved to be admired. I don't want my pictures and my @CAPS6 memories deleted because nothing else competes with the mighty computer since it allows me to have an enjoyable time and entertains me well.  Thirdly, computers have a positive effect on people because they give adults and kids free access to education. I remember my old elementary school used to play many amusing math games. These games helped my education grow greatly. Games like these are used frequently throughout the world. In addition, jobs have been lost due to this bad economy. However, jobs are being found more and more every day as adults try to find a decent job online. Computers saved people from losing their house because of the money they made with the help of computers.  To conclude, I implore you that computer technology has a strong positive effect on people. Computers are like a pencil to a student, for they are very important. Jobs use them every day, connections are made by people, and education grows because of them. That's why the technology of computers affects people in a good way, and we should continue to embrace and develop it."
915	917	1	3	@ORGANIZATION1, In my opinion, the effects computers have on people are good. I believe this because people can learn hand - eye coordination, they give the people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and they even allow people to talk with people from around the world.  Firstly, the effects computers have on people are good because people can learn hand - eye coordination. Hand - eye coordination is beneficial in many situations, such as when playing certain computer games or using computer - based tools. It helps in improving motor skills and reaction times, which can be useful in various real - life scenarios.  Secondly, computers' effects on people are good because they give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people. This is important because people can learn about history and important figures in life. They can explore different cultures, traditions, and geographical locations without leaving their homes. It broadens their horizons and enriches their knowledge.  Lastly, the effects people have from computers are good because computers allow people to talk with people from all around the world. This is useful because people can learn about each other, their customs, religious beliefs, and also their cultures and heritage. It promotes cross - cultural understanding and can build bridges between different communities.  All - in - all, I believe that computers have good effects on people because they can learn hand - eye coordination. Computers give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and computers even allow people to talk with people online from all parts of the world. In today's globalized world, computers are a valuable asset that enhances our learning, social, and skill - development experiences.
916	918	1	3	"To who this @MONTH1 concern, In my honest opinion, computers have significantly and positively improved our lives in numerous ways. Therefore, I firmly believe that owning and using a computer is for the greater good of all. Three key reasons that support my decision are that computers have given us the remarkable ability to find information quickly and easily, they allow us to connect seamlessly with people in far - away places, and they help us to learn more comprehensively about life and the planet we live on. Please carefully consider my reasons when making your decision. My first reason is that computers have given us the ability to find information quickly and easily. This in turn allows us to get more done in less time. For example, let's say that you're doing a detailed report on @CAPS1 @CAPS2. You could run out to the library and spend hours looking through hundreds of books and newspapers, or you could just sit down comfortably at your computer, open up a reliable web browser, and type ""@CAPS1 @CAPS2"" into the search box. Within a few seconds, you will have searched hundreds more libraries, newspapers, and even other computers to find in - depth information on your topic. You can also look for information on videos. Old newscasts, interviews, documentaries, you name it. It's all there right at your fingertips. My second reason is that it allows people in far - away places to connect. If I said that to my mom, she would probably tell me to go use the phone, but computers can do everything a phone can do and much more. You can share photos, videos, games, just about anything. Recently, I joined Facebook and I now can talk to people I haven't seen in years who moved away when I was born. Over the @DATE1, I had gone to my @CAPS3. My dad introduced me to his uncle who shared the same name as me. Then about a month later, I got a friend request from a @CAPS4 who grew up in @LOCATION1, @LOCATION4, which is far from where I live and now reside. After talking to him for a while, I learned that he was the son of my dad's uncle. If it weren't for my computer, I would have never met him. Also, I recently learned how to do something and am getting pretty good at it. So one day, my friends looked me up through a platform which has all the necessary features. We began video - taping and posting. So the computer has also allowed us to do things without them having to be physically there. My third and final reason is that the computer allows us to learn how to improve our lives and the planet we live on. Many people say that if you're on the computer all the time, you'll become fat and lazy, but that isn't always the case. I have actually been able to improve my exercise routine by using the computer. Whenever I go out for a run, I can come home and find out exactly how far I ran, how many calories I burned, and anything else I want to know. I have also been able to find new, more effective exercises that allow me to target different muscles. Now let's talk about what we can learn about our planet. We can use a computer to find weather patterns which allows us to plan our days accordingly. We can also use it to learn about news happening around the world. For example, the day of the earthquake in @LOCATION2, I opened up my homepage and there it was, and I was able to learn about what had happened. Finally, a computer allows us to learn about different cultures around the world. We can learn about how ancient Egyptians lived, how the people in @LOCATION3 or @CAPS5 make money or how they construct their houses. All the things we would never know if we didn't have a computer. In conclusion, computers have improved the lives of the human race by a great deal. They have allowed us to access information, connect with others, and learn how to improve our lives. I hope that this letter has helped you come to a decision about the effects a computer has on people's lives."
917	919	1	3	Dear @LOCATION1, I fully understand this focused situation. The effect of computers on our society and people's reactions to them are quite diverse, and my question is, who is really considering these impacts? Computers have a very positive effect on our town specifically. Computers aid in tracking hand - eye coordination. They give people the opportunity to look at things and talk to those who might have traveled here, and in some cases, they might even make wallets empty faster than expected. @CAPS2 also have the ability to help people do things that are better than a pig sty. Let me explain these reasons in more detail. Computers are very good for our society because they are useful for kids and adults in tracking hand - eye coordination. Just to help you understand why they are so effective in teaching hand - eye coordination, @CAPS2 offer so many activities that not only help you learn but also enhance your skills. In football, catching a ball helps to teach the skill, but it might make you end up on the ground after being tackled by someone, potentially getting yourself hurt. In baseball, swinging at a pitch is a way to teach this skill, but if the pitch is very close to you, it could hit you hard, and if you miss the ball, it could hit someone else and hurt them. Computers are a great way to practice this skill in a safe environment. Even @CAPS1 @PERSON1 here in town says that he has seen an improvement in kids with better hand - eye coordination, due to the use of computers. Do computers have a good impact on our town? Well, computers let people connect with others. You can talk to relatives in far - away places without having to travel. I'm sure that you're wondering if I have another reason. Computers can do certain things electronically so fast and easily. You can make a search on computer's hard drives, and @CAPS2 offer so much more that can be stored on a computer, which can make a room full of physical items seem empty. Before my family had a computer, we had a complete room dedicated to papers and files that were so important and that we could not lose. When we got a computer, we could save pictures, type up papers, and our room was empty! I hope that this letter has proven to you the positive effect of computers on our society. Computers help in the process of hand - eye coordination. They help things happen that, if done in real life, could take longer. They also help to do things electronically more efficiently than in a traditional way. So now, after this letter, you can go out and publish this, telling everyone about the good effects of computers. Again, I thank you for reading this letter.
918	920	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 Newspaper, @CAPS2, do you know what computers are doing to the people of the @LOCATION1? Well, I do. People are on the @NUM1, and it's becoming a concerning issue. We need to @CAPS2 something about these computers. They are preventing people from exercising, going outside, and are just making them stay in their houses all day. One reason I think we should get rid of computers is because people aren't getting their proper exercise. The computer, next to the @LOCATION2, is probably the number one thing that makes people fat. Kids are sometimes on the computer all day, mindlessly eating snacks and junk food when they should be eating healthy fruits and vegetables. You could easily see the negative impact. Almost @CAPS2 anything on the computer that you @CAPS2 in your everyday life, that's how good technology is. The computer is the thing that gets people addicted to something. The computer has games, the internet, and ways to talk to people that get them attached. A second reason is that computers just keep taking money out of your pocket. When you buy a computer, most people just buy the most expensive one because the salesman talks them into it. Most people don't know what kind of computer they are supposed to buy, so they buy the most expensive one because they think the more expensive, the better. Also, just buying the computer isn't all of it. When you download softwares, games, and mobile things, that all cost money. Downloading one thing can cost up to one hundred dollars. Plus, most people can't afford these downloads after buying themselves a pricy computer. My third opinion is that the computer is just a complete waste of time. People spend hours on the computer doing stupid stuff, like playing games and chatting aimlessly, when they should all be outside enjoying the fresh air. Going outside is very important to your health. Next time you're on the computer doing something that doesn't need to be done, go outside. Think about it, how often @CAPS2 you go outside? My guess, not much. Now @CAPS2 you know what computers are doing to the people of the @LOCATION1? They are making people fat, not getting their exercise, eating junk food and playing games all day long on this stupid piece of technology. Instead of being on the computer all day, why don't you think about going outside and getting the air you need. Also, you don't want to be wasting all of your hard - earned money on a stupid piece of technology. Plus, you don't want to deal with softwares and their viruses. My advice, computers are terrible. In conclusion, the negative impacts of computers on the people of @LOCATION1 are evident, and we should take steps to reduce their over - use.
919	921	1	3	I believe that computers benefit society and help people understand things more clearly. Computers help people study, learn, and even talk to other people. Here are some good reasons on why computers help people out with problems. First of all, computers give you access to information on things that you cannot find in books. People can look up places for vacations, check what their child's grade in school is, and find healthy food recipes. Without the computers, people would be lost not knowing what to do. For instance, if you're planning a vacation, you can find detailed reviews and pictures of different destinations. When it comes to your child's grades, you can get real - time updates. And for healthy recipes, you can find step - by - step guides. Next, computers let you talk to friends. You can discuss things like the weather, share ideas you have, and even plan exercise days. What if something important happens? The person does not have his or her phone. What could they do? They could go on the computer and tell their friend. It would be a lot easier than driving over to the person's house and then driving all the way back. For example, if your friend has an urgent matter to discuss, you can quickly chat with them on the computer. Finally, computers can give you a good sense of hand - eye coordination. Computers can teach you how to type without even looking at the keyboard. This skill could be used to pursue a good career in the typing - related or even the carpentry field. In carpentry, precise hand - eye coordination is crucial for tasks like measuring and cutting. Computers can also help you study for a new job and what the requirements are. You can find online courses and resources to prepare yourself. In conclusion, I believe that computers make people's lives a little bit easier knowing that they have vital information right at the tips of their fingers. It can also help them in anything they want to do, like talk to friends, look up info, and teach skills. They are truly a valuable asset to society.
920	922	1	3	To whom it @MONTH1 concern, @CAPS1, more and more people are getting involved with using the computer. While I think that is great, others don't. I believe that using a computer is a good thing because technology is going to progress and computers will be the base. Also, computers are safer now because of privacy options and virus blockers. Finally, computers help you gather knowledge that no single book could tell you. Although technology is progressing, computers are only the basics. Sooner or later, everything will be based on computers, like jobs, school, and even the medical field. Jobs will have more computers and touch - screen devices because they are easier and more technologically advanced. For example, in an office job, you might use touch - screen monitors to access data more efficiently. As for school, @CAPS1 students have to take computer classes to learn how to write brochures and make websites. These skills are becoming essential in today's digital age. The medical field is now using more advanced ultrasounds that take the image and make it three - dimensional. This helps doctors diagnose problems more accurately. So, if everything is changing around you, why do you want to be stuck in the past? Although some people are worried about internet safety and viruses, there are ways that those can be limited. As for social networking sites, don't set it up for the whole world to see. Set it up for only your friends to see. Also, make sure you know who your friends are. As for viruses, don't go on websites that are known to cause viruses. Also, you can get a virus blocker that helps eliminate them. The computer also helps to give you and get you knowledge. You can learn about current civilizations and modern - day life without taking a step out of your house. Also, the internet has virtual simulations so you can experience what it was like in other cultures, in other time periods. Computers give you knowledge that helps you through your life, especially if you don't have easy access to a library. Even though some people disagree, computers are the base of technology, safe, and full of knowledge, and I firmly believe in their value. Yes, they do have some flaws, but they are a great learning tool. In conclusion, despite the drawbacks, the benefits of computers in our ever - evolving world are undeniable, and we should embrace them.
921	923	1	3	Dear @PERSON1, Experts are genuinely concerned about the excessive use of computers. They point out that individuals often spend long hours glued to the computer screen, consequently having less time for physical exercise, enjoying the beauty of nature, and engaging in meaningful interactions with family and friends. I whole - heartedly agree. When people are engrossed in using computers, they miss out on in - person interactions and the opportunity to meet new friends face - to - face. They tend to stay indoors, leading to a lack of physical activity, and there's a risk, especially for kids, of chatting with strangers. When we use computers, we mainly chat with friends online, which is a far cry from real - life socializing. We might meet new people online, chat with them, but never actually meet them in person and build a proper social bond. This is clearly one of the significant disadvantages of computer use. Another pressing problem is the lack of exercise. While sitting in front of the computer, we invest a large amount of time, and sometimes we even forget to engage in physical activities. As a result, our health gradually deteriorates. A major and rather dangerous issue is the act of chatting with strangers on the computer. Some people might randomly meet strangers online and carelessly share personal information. Kids, in particular, could even arrange to meet these strangers in person and put themselves in harm's way. Well, thank you for taking the time to read my thoughts about computers. I sincerely hope you will consider these points. Both kids and adults are affected by the problems of reduced social interaction, lack of exercise, and the risk of sharing personal information with strangers. In conclusion, the overuse of computers has far - reaching negative impacts on our social and physical well - being.
922	924	1	3	Dear Newspaper, Some individuals are inquiring about the effects that computers have on people. A number of experts are worried that people are devoting an excessive amount of time to their computers, leaving less time for physical exercise, enjoying the wonders of nature, and having quality interactions with family and friends. However, in my opinion, the computer is a remarkable tool and it doesn't prevent people from participating in other activities. First of all, the computer doesn't keep people away from other activities because there are @NUM1 hours in a day. It's entirely the person's fault if they don't have the self - discipline to step away from the computer and engage in other pursuits. Even though the computer offers a vast array of interesting things, people should have the common sense to take breaks and do other activities. So, it's their responsibility if they can't tear themselves away from the computer. Moreover, there are numerous reasons why people don't get out and do other things, so singling out computers is unfair. Secondly, the computer doesn't keep people away from other activities because there are plenty of distractions that have the same effect. For instance, the television also keeps people from engaging in other activities, but no one is suggesting that we should stop using it. Additionally, the computer is a great source of knowledge. It can teach you about a multitude of things and show you information that you might be eager to discover. For example, you can look up your family's history on the computer. Lastly, the computer doesn't keep people away from other activities. If people truly value their other activities, they would make the effort to get off the computer and do what they need to do. For example, if someone has a gym session scheduled, they should have the willpower to leave the computer and go to the gym. After all, it's not the computer that makes you gain weight; it's your own lifestyle choices. Similarly, if you plan to spend time with your family, the computer shouldn't be an obstacle. You should be responsible enough to remember your commitments. In conclusion, computers do not keep people away from other activities. It's an individual's responsibility to manage their time and remember their priorities. There are many more distractions than just computers, and it's not the computer's fault but the person's.
923	925	1	3	To whom it @MONTH1 concern, I was sitting quietly at home when it suddenly dawned on me that this situation has to come to an end! The computer business has effectively taken my mother and step - father away from me. When they are on Facebook, it's as if they've entered a whole other galaxy. Our family spends absolutely no time together. Moreover, they constantly argue, they don't get enough sleep, and we're missing out on precious family moments. Social interaction is crucial for everyone. Whether it's spending time with family or making new friends, it enriches our lives. However, arguing within the family only reduces the time we could be spending in positive social interactions. In my family, these arguments create so much friction that we end up turning to the computer as an escape. And if we're arguing about the computer itself, then the problem becomes even more complex and never seems to end. Lack of sleep is my biggest worry. When they stay up all night glued to that computer, it's bound to have a negative impact. I know for a fact that they don't have good days during school because of their sleep deprivation. Computers are causing my parents to sacrifice family time, engage in unnecessary arguments, and neglect their sleep. @CITY1 @PERSON1, I firmly believe we have a serious problem on our hands. In conclusion, the over - use of computers in my family is causing a breakdown in our relationships and affecting our well - being, and this issue needs to be addressed.
924	926	1	3	I believe that people are spending an excessive amount of time on computers. When people sit in front of the computer for hours on end, it will inevitably lead to poor eyesight. They also fail to get enough physical exercise. Most teens are struggling to complete their homework because of this @CAPS1. As people sit on the computer for countless hours, their eyesight gradually deteriorates. The bright lights emitted by the computer screen can make your vision unclear. In fact, more people are losing their eyesight from looking at a computer screen than they would from staring directly at a light. When you're sitting motionless in front of the screen, you're hardly getting any exercise. You're mainly just moving your hands and fingers, which is not enough to keep your body fit. If people don't exercise for at least @NUM1 minutes a day, our overall physical strength will decline. Lastly, teenagers are likely to neglect their homework. When they're in their rooms, they're probably on the computers. If they spend too much time on the computer, they're more likely to fail their classes, which could result in them having to repeat a grade. In other words, people are spending far too much time on the computer. If this trend continues, a large number of people will lose their eyesight. If citizens keep sitting in front of the computer all day, we'll become increasingly unhealthy. And finally, more teens will neglect their homework and won't be able to achieve academic success. In conclusion, the over - use of computers is having a detrimental impact on our eyesight, physical health, and academic performance.
925	927	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I concur with some of the professionals who believe that the computer prevents people from exercising, enjoying nature, and spending quality time with friends and family. Some people think it's trendy to be on the computer @NUM1 @NUM2. The reality is that a computer with internet access is like having @CAPS1, distractions, and much more at your fingertips. You can find almost anything on the internet these days. Some people use the internet for doing their homework. Sometimes, they can even find the exact answers to an assignment, which means they're becoming overly reliant on technology. If the world becomes increasingly dependent on computers and similar technologies, it could have far - reaching consequences. The world is already suffering because people are neglecting to take simple actions like picking up their trash and trying to stop @ORGANIZATION2. Instead of taking real - world action, most people will be sitting in front of their computers. People are becoming more and more lethargic these days. As I've mentioned, people are growing lazier because all they need to do to have fun is sit with minimal movement. This leads to people neglecting to exercise and maintain a healthy diet. They're also neglecting to spend time with friends and family. Instead of just texting or @CAPS2 someone, try making a phone call. Or, when you have free time, make plans to visit your family. All I'm asking is that you make an effort to spend time with your family because you can always make new friends or buy a new computer, but you can't replace your family. In conclusion, the over - reliance on computers is causing a decline in our physical health, social relationships, and environmental responsibility, and we need to take steps to change this.
926	928	1	3	Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, many @CAPS2 people firmly believe that the negatives of computers out weigh the positives. However, I am firmly convinced that computers help us much more than they hurt. There are indeed a few minor instances where computers have caused harm to people, but there are far more instances where they have provided great assistance to @CAPS2 people. For example, there are some cases where a victim of an accident recovers successfully with the help of computers. Likewise, there are other times when close family or friends can have in - depth conversations with each other over the @CAPS3. Also, people could learn about amazing and unique places around the world. Thus, computers are very vital to us. Computers are vital to us because they help improve our reflexes. In my experience as a professional computer engineer, I have learned that playing or using a computer can significantly help victims of reflex - damaging accidents. A computer helps the victim by giving them a more detailed and accurate feel of their environment. The victim could clearly see exactly what he is doing, and so could his doctors. Similar to the physical treatment, computers can also bring a sense of relief. Thus, the patient gets stronger both physically and mentally. Thus, computers help enhance a human's life by improving their reflexes. Likewise, to help our reflexes, computers with the @CAPS3 would enable people who are at a distance apart to connect effectively. One of the common ways people very far away connect is between soldiers and their families. Back in my military days, nothing was more comforting than talking to my loved ones. The easiest way of this was talking over the @CAPS3. It gave me a gigantic sense of comfort. Thus, computers are vital to us humans. Likewise, computers help us see places that are truly amazing. For example, when a @NUM1 - year - old boy visits a well - designed website that talks about the wonders of the @LOCATION1 rain forest. He then enthusiastically tells his science class, who in turn spread the word of preservation of the forest. The boy then grows up to be an explorer of the @LOCATION1, discovering new species. All this would happen because he was using a computer. Computers help us see the unseen. In the end, computers are great if used in regulation. They help victims heal, soldiers connect and inspire the youth. Computers are a vital source of knowledge and advancement for humans.
927	929	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1, I wholeheartedly believe computers are a huge benefit to society. I myself own a high - performance computer; it is extremely important and useful to me. Over @PERCENT1 of the families in our town own at least one computer, which shows its popularity. Computers are a great source of information. Unlike books, which you must painstakingly find and purchase, there is an enormous amount of information just a simple mouse click away! With computers, you can learn about far - away places and people without having to make the arduous journey to visit or talk to them. Let me make a detailed comparison to a book. Let's say you wanted to do in - depth research on @PERSON1. You would have to go to the library and search through numerous shelves for a book about him. And what would you do if you couldn't find one about him? With a computer, you could simply type ""@CAPS2 of @PERSON1"" into a search engine and receive a vast amount of information in under a minute! I love saving time, and computers help me do that. They also augment the information I use by providing multiple perspectives. Another astounding development in computer technology is that you can talk to others, no matter where their location is. Email is extremely faster than writing a letter, saving you the time and cost of having to pay to travel. Who @CAPS3't like that? Computers are very convenient. You can surf the internet, talk to people, and much more from the comfort of your cozy bedroom. There are jobs that you can do from home on a computer. No need to go anywhere to work. My uncle is one of those people. He is a successful stockbroker, and he operates his whole job from the high - end computer in his house. It is a convenient and a well - paying job. I asked him what he thought of his job. He said, ""I love my job because I can work when I want to work, and from the comfort of my home."" @CAPS3't you want to have his job? I would most definitely. In conclusion, computers are very beneficial to us. Did you know computers were first invented by @ORGANIZATION1 to perform calculations that were very long and complex? Look at what they have evolved into @DATE1. They bring us information at amazing speeds. They let us talk to people all over the world. They are very convenient. These are major benefits to society, and everybody should embrace computers."
928	930	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, I think computers have a positive effect on people because it will greatly help you with interacting, learning and coordination. By interacting with people like far - away friends or unknown friends, it enriches your social circle. If they are far away, it's a nice way to send high - quality photos back and forth to see how the person/people are doing. Family is a very important factor in using computers because if you haven't seen the person for a long time, you can tell how they are progressing in life through detailed conversations. If that's not the case, you can meet new people with similar interests. By meeting new people, you have more connections in your life and more people to trust and rely on. Learning! Learning is a good thing for both adults and children. Computers can teach children by vividly showing them new words, bright colors, various shapes and sizes through interactive games and educational software. For an adult, it can show them the precise meanings of words or introduce new words. Words, colors and sizes can all be found on a computer all by engaging in learning activities. A computer can not only do mental things to affect you but also physical things like improving coordination. You can improve your coordination by making your hands stronger when you type quickly and accurately. Your hands are a big thing in life and they are helpful in a lot of ways. By sitting up straight in your comfortable computer chair all day can gradually improve your posture. Your back can get straighter from all the time you are sitting properly. Your mind can be focused and in one place. Focusing on one thing is good for you such as the computer screen when you are learning or working. Now, people can think that computers are good for you too. But there could be negative ideas for people who think the opposite way. However, overall, the positive impacts of computers on our lives are undeniable.
929	931	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, I think computers have both good and bad effects on people. Some people just idly sit around all day playing games and being extremely lazy. Other people actually use their computers for things that they genuinely need. Also, some people need their computers for their jobs, which are crucial for their livelihood. I do agree that some people who spend all day in front of their computers are spending significantly less time exercising! Would you rather play games all day instead of spending some quality time with your family and friends? Not me, I would much rather be with friends outside enjoying the fresh air or having a family picnic at a beautiful park or a serene lake. For other people though, the story is much different. Some people need computers and other advances in technology for their everyday life. A lot of jobs today require you to use a computer proficiently. For example, when working at a bank, you use computers all day to handle transactions and manage accounts! I also think students rely on computers to do their schoolwork. A lot of students type up well - structured reports and other things for school on their computers. Students also use computers to look up accurate information. The internet can be a very good source for students. I know for me, the internet has come in very handy for school projects, or maybe something as simple as just looking up a difficult word. I can also see why people don't really care about advances in technology or computers! Some people don't need them for anything, and some are probably thinking people are on them way too much. To me, I honestly find computers useful because I can talk online to my family in @LOCATION1, sharing our daily lives and experiences. I hope you liked my opinion about computers. Remember, they are useful to some people, but not all. We should use them in a balanced way to maximize their benefits and minimize their drawbacks.
930	932	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 and kids of any age in this society, are way too focused on the latest technology. One piece of equipment that is significantly affecting peoples' lives is the computer. We need to get rid of this habit and learn to engage in different activities! People are spending way too much time on computers and less time enjoying nature, exercising, and need to interact with friends and family more. Take the time to agree with me as I confront you on how the computer is taking over our lives! Is time flying you by? Are you overwhelmed at how life passes you so quickly? Well, if you answered yes, stop the computer madness and head on outside! You're not enjoying nature! Nature is as beautiful as a gorgeous scene of @CAPS3 @CAPS4. Some people love oceans with pink sand. Who would want to miss this? @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2 complain that they rarely enjoy what life has to offer on the outside of your house. Just think, you won't be able to see the stupendous change of the seasons changing without going outdoors. ""I want my @CAPS6 to experience the wide variety of nature as she grows old,"" @CAPS5 said of her daughter. Well, I add, little @CAPS6 is not going to get much nature experience if she does not get her eyes unglued from the computer screen! Yes, computers are very brilliant and have lots to offer, but if you want to be missing out on the new trees being discovered every day, be my guest! @PERCENT2 of all the population in the @LOCATION2 is overweight due to technology brought into our world. The greatest impact is the computer! High - paid physicians try and teach their parents at a young age to go out and play sports while exercising at the same time and not to stay home and play video games. Now you tell me, would you rather get a good healthy exercise and have all the energy you need or would you like to slowly add on to your weight and gain health issues as you surf the internet? I remember @DATE1, I grabbed my Nike high - tops and my pink iPod and started jogging at a slow pace while listening to my favorite song. Naturally, by the end, I felt amazing when my jog was complete. Going for a jog each day is as healthy as eating a banana, @NUM1 apples, and cheese every morning. They're healthy! ""@CAPS7 since technology has been a part of my life, my two daughters have not visited their grandparents in over @NUM1 years! This needs to stop!"" @CAPS8 @PERSON1 told the press. Yes, computers have ""online - talking"" devices such as @CAPS9, but if you are never going to spend quality time with family, this is a bad habit. On @DATE3, @DATE2, my brother and I were too busy on the computer, we missed a birthday party of the family. We are addicted to this device and need to spend time with our loved ones. @PERCENT3 of all therapy patients have @CAPS2 fallen into depression and have been struggling with their plans, due to the high amount of things to do on this device and less time bonding with members of your family. Who would rather play on an old, gray, computer when you can have fun talking about your day and the game of life with your family? It's time to make a change now. What will you choose? Do you agree that computers take over lives? If you try and prove me wrong just remember, nature is a big gift and many people are missing out on the advantage. Technology is taking over peoples' exercising habits, and many families are having less bonding time. It's up to you to keep the population of @LOCATION1 in good hands."
931	933	1	3	"Dear Newspaper, I think that computers are not good for the society. There are three reasons why I think this and these are the following; First, people don't get to spend quality time with their family. In modern households, the allure of the computer screen often draws individuals away from family gatherings. Instead of sitting around the dinner table having conversations, family members are glued to their screens. Second, you can easily misspell words using instant messenger. When you're typing quickly in an instant messaging conversation, you tend to use abbreviations and shortcuts. When you're doing your homework, you can get easily distracted by the computer. The flashing notifications, enticing games, and social media updates are just a click away.  The first reason why computers are bad for the society is because people don't spend enough time with their family. I know I don't. I spend at least half my day staring at a screen when I could be outside walking my dog with friends. Furthermore, instant messenger is the most addicting. When I type something, I use abbreviations for any word. The professor at [LOCATION1] says at least [PERCENT1] students spell abbreviated words in tests. For example, if you wanted to spell ""what"" instead the [PERCENT1] would spell ""wut"".  Finally, my last reason why I think computers are not good for society is because you can get distracted by it a lot. I know that because I am drawn into the world of computers. Whenever I do my homework, I can't keep my eyes off the screen. Therefore, it clearly explains that computers are not good for society. In conclusion, computers keep you from spending time with your family, cause students to misspell words, and distract you from doing your homework. I hope you agree with me on this."
932	934	1	3	"Dear [CAPS1], I strongly believe computers have positive effects on people and the society. My reasons are you can learn and find new information on virtually anything, you are able to talk to people far away, and computers teach skills that can be used in the future. I will now like to elaborate my reasons further.  First of all, going on the internet and using search sites help you learn and find information on anything you want. On the internet, you can even ask questions on various forums, and they will probably be answered by experts or other knowledgeable users. You may even use information on the computer for a report. Statistics show [PERCENT1] of people who do reports find their facts on the internet. Google, yahoo, and other search sites have helped children become more interested in learning by providing easy access to a vast amount of knowledge.  Also, using a computer enables you to talk to other people from far - away places or friends you have not seen in a while. You can even webcam with people, which makes the conversation feel more personal. I remember a few weeks ago, my best friend moved to Florida, and now we webchat every day! Talking online will even lower your telephone bills. Chatting online doesn't cost anything, whereas the telephone charges for out - of - country calls can be quite high. Computers will let you talk with your best buddy and save money.  Last but not least, computers teach skills that can be applied later in life. Today, many jobs are done using a computer, and technology is getting more advanced. Before you know it, you will have to know how to work a computer. Also, you probably will need a computer in college. Professor [CAPS2] even stated, ""every single kid in my courses has some sort of computer."" In college, you will take notes and do assignments. Using computers will help you do this and make your life easier.  As you can see, I believe computers help people and society greatly. My reasons are you can learn and find information on anything, you are able to talk to other people who are far away, and computer skills will help you in life. Technology is advancing, and we're going to have to use a computer sooner or later."
933	935	1	3	"Dear Local Newspaper [CAPS1], Are computers really as great as they seem? It seems to me that they are used way too much in people's lives, and that computers are distractions that don't allow people to do certain things in their life that they would if they weren't always on the computer. People's lives are starting to revolve around going on the computer, checking your Facebook, and looking at new videos on [CAPS2].com.  I know from experience Facebook or MySpace can be very addicting. I'll spend hours commenting on pictures or new wall posts, and then at [NUM1] pm I've realized I haven't begun any of my loads of homework. This happens quite often, and I end up staying awake until around [NUM2]. The following morning I wake up at [NUM3] am, exhausted. I am not exaggerating either, this happens to many of my friends, and if you have kids, ask them because I am [PERCENT1] sure they are on Facebook or [CAPS3] all night.  This doesn't just happen with kids either. My mom just got a Facebook and she is hooked to it, even more than I am. Sometimes it can become a competition to see who has the most pictures, or the most friends. Kids start adding people as friends that they don't even know.  Computers aren't just distractions, they are also very dangerous. At my school, we had an assembly where they showed us how easy it was to find out someone's personal information. Even if you don't have your address or your phone number listed, there are many other ways to track you down. If you take a picture right after you won the championship soccer game, in your jersey. Just that one picture shows your team name, your last name, and your number. Anyone could easily search all that stuff on the internet and know exactly where your next game will be.  As the local newspaper [CAPS1], I am sure you must be concerned about the safety of the town, or even your own kids. Some people [MONTH1] say ""that would never happen to me"" but it easily could, especially if you're constantly on your computer.  I have noticed that a lot of teens around my age are starting to become obsessed with being on the computer. A lot of times in families, instead of spending time together, siblings are fighting over who gets to go on the computer. One sibling [MONTH1] needs it for homework, while the other just wants to talk to her friends on [CAPS3], and each believes they deserve the computer.  Computers are starting to interfere with people's lives, in a negative way. Once again, they are distracting, dangerous, and hurt families. Computers hurt society more than it helps. And maybe you should look into how much time your kids are spending on the computer."
934	936	1	3	Dear [LOCATION1] news paper, I think computers are a bad and good thing because computers keep some people inside more than usual. In today's digital age, the comfort of sitting in front of a computer often lures people away from outdoor activities. And then on the other hand, a computer allows you to talk with family members that you haven't seen in a long time, search for upcoming events and see if they are canceled, and to search up other stuff like when a movie is playing.  Computers are a big part of school too, because without computers it would be hard to study. Many educational resources are now available online, and for some teachers, most of their homeworks require you to use a computer.  There is some other things that are bad about computers too. For example: my friend stayed on his computer playing video games for most of the day. It's like when he's on that computer he doesn't listen or hear anyone, not even his parents. He barely goes down to eat dinner and when he does he has his laptop right beside him. His parents started to get tired of it so they took his TV and laptop away so he could go outside and play with his friends. After a while he started to come outside a lot, mostly every day when it was nice. They gave him back his computer and TV. The only time he goes on it now is on rainy days.
935	937	1	3	Dear Newspaper [CAPS1], [CAPS2], more and more people in our proud and courageous country of [LOCATION1] have been relying on computers. Computers were made to simplify difficult situations, such as typing, finding information, and keeping a record of financial statuses. Despite the main uses, many [CAPS3] citizens have been using the computer for things that are not necessary, which result in a loss of time for living a healthy, social life. These are exercise and spending time with fellow people, including family and friends. As a result, please read on so that you, the [CAPS4], our community, can understand why computers have become out of hand and relay my message to the readers of your newspaper.  One aspect of life that is affected is exercise. Exercise is the key to a healthy life, and due to the prevalence of modern computers, it is often neglected. Personally, I know at least four poor young children in my very school that are a victim of the cruel disease, known as obesity. The reason for the disease in these children is quite simple - they over - use computers and forget the natural boundaries to using something. Practically every day, each of the four heart - breaking children begins to use their computers from the second they get home, to the moment they fall asleep. This outrageous number of hours reduces the vital time for exercise, therefore allowing their bodies to adopt to the habits of the children: sleep, eat, computer. This sedentary manner of the four kids enables others to pick on them for being fat, yet they can't fight back as they have no strength whatsoever. Thus, the over - use of computers can result in an overweight child, with no exercise, and no power/muscle to defend themselves.  Another reason why computers are affecting [LOCATION1]'s youth is because of the lack of meaningful social interaction. Everyday I choose to walk from school, enjoying the fresh air and the sounds of nature, no matter what type of weather it is. I hope you understand that spending time with your friends and family is important, yet once again, people who abuse computer usage don't see the importance of this. Around two years ago, I was on the computer non - stop, mainly playing video games, and engaging in all sorts of computer - released activities. Every day, constantly, for about a year, I came home, went straight to the computer, and began my virtual adventures. This resulted in me losing the time I had with my family. Furthermore, if I needed to contact my friends, I just texted them, rather than speaking in person. This led to me growing apart from my family and friends.  In conclusion, I guarantee that with all the information about how computers are misused, you can see the negative impact. Hopefully, you will print this letter in the paper of [CAPS1] of your newspaper and demand a column about how computers make us lose the valuable time for exercise, nature, and family & friends. Thank you for reading my letter, and I will look forward to seeing an article relative to this subject.
936	938	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I am a child of the tech generation, or the generation in which technology has taken on a new meaning. That meaning is life. Our life revolves around technology in general, much like the @LOCATION3 revolves around the sun. The chief technological preference, computers, is greatly beneficial, isn't as bad as many people speculate, and helps us live and prosper in this struggling world. Look, if you want to roast computers then by all means, roast away. But if you do so without first regarding all the angles of them, then you, my friend, have absolutely no standing on the situation. You could say that they are a nuisance but could never have used one properly. You could argue that they can be used to detonate bombs, but, let's be practical, how many normal people actually wake up in the morning, point out the dreariness of life, and then type in a command to detonate a bomb? A serious benefit you have obviously chosen to overlook is the invaluable information it aptly places in front of you on a @NUM1 - inch screen. You can read book reviews, read books, buy things, and get the cutting - edge news you want, to name just a meager amount of possible strengths. Furthermore, not everything that you speculate as bad has to be bad just because you say it so. When you think of @CAPS3, do you always think about vulgar, inappropriate pictures, and illegal images? That's funny, because @CAPS3 keeps family in touch, gives people things to do, and keeps friends in different states on the same server. Youtube is not all swearing and bad videos. My family casts actors for shows, and one way they know what an actor is capable of is by going to their channel and looking at the videos that they have created. My mother actually contacts actors in videos to see if they want to become professionals. That is the business, finding talent where it is seldom found. Lastly, did you even think about the fact that computers are used to start companies and save lives? You probably didn't even know that, from a computer, astrologists monitor images of the universe captured by the Hubble Space Telescope, and meteorologists track cloud formations from satellites using a computer. Maybe you didn't choose to say that surgeons can dictate operations from their office in @LOCATION1 on a patient in @LOCATION2. You didn't even say that seismologists use computers to track the shifting of the tectonic plates to see where the epicenter of a major earthquake is. You just didn't know. So, let's face it, computers are important. You probably used one to do what little research you did on them. In fact, pardon me. You probably didn't do the research in the first place, instead pointing fingers at the innocent. Smooth move, buddy. In conclusion, we should recognize the true value of computers and not be so quick to judge them based on unfounded fears.
937	939	1	3	I think having a computer is good because you can research a wide range of stuff, whether it's for school projects, personal interests, or just to satisfy your curiosity. You can also meet people from different parts of the world and chat with them, sharing ideas and experiences. Computers are important to society because they help keep track of crucial info like doctor appointments, ensuring that people don't miss important medical check - ups, and criminal records for police to follow by, which aids in maintaining law and order. Having a computer is a good thing, but if you spend too much time on it, you will hurt your eyes. Staring at the screen for long hours can cause eye strain, dryness, and even long - term vision problems. Having a computer can help you talk to friends who have moved away. There are various websites that they can use to talk to you, like MySpace or Facebook or even Yahoo Chat. Through these platforms, you can stay connected with your loved ones, no matter the distance. When having a computer, it's very helpful in life and can help you in a lot of areas, such as work, education, and entertainment. However, computers can also cause problems. Spending too much time on it can lead to not getting enough sleep for school, which can affect your academic performance. Having a computer can also be bad because sitting too close or spending too much time can hurt your eyes and cause you to wear glasses. The way I look at it is that too much of anything is bad, so I think spending some time on it is good. Do you agree? In conclusion, we should strike a balance in our computer use to enjoy its benefits while avoiding its drawbacks.
938	940	1	3	"Dear local newspaper, I disagree because it would give kids and children the opportunity to do negative things like being rude, not listening, being loud, and not doing homework just because they are on the computers. Please listen to why I disagree. Here are some reasons. I know when I am on the computer, my mom checks on me every @NUM1 minutes because there are nasty things on those computers that kids and children might be looking at. You never know, they could learn how to kill someone just by being on the computer. I know when I go on that computer, I am rude and disrespectful. When I am on it, you can tell me nothing because I am so into the computer that my attention completely moves to it. That's why they should limit access to computers because it takes the attention away from important things. I don't listen while I am on the computer. My mom tells me to get off, and I'll say ""@CAPS1, I am doing something."" She will tell me to get off, and I'll @CAPS1 say ""leave me alone"" because I am on the computer and because I am focused on it. And I have the computer loud so @CAPS1 one could get my attention. So I have the computer always loud because my main focus is the computer, and I'll do whatever else later. Oh, and I don't even remember what happens when I get on the computer. Not doing your schoolwork is another issue. I know I tell my mom let me use the computer so I could do my school work, but I end up getting on different things instead of doing my homework. My mom will be like ""I thought you were doing your homework,"" and I'll say ""I did finish my homework"" when I know I did not finish it. I only say it because my focus was on the computer. These are reasons why the society should take back the computer. I hope you understand the reasons I give you because the society should really stop giving out the computers in the first place. If you have a daughter or a son and know they have said some of these things, now you know your children have been and always lied to you. I can only use the computer for @NUM2 min each day. So yes, take them away. In conclusion, the negative impacts of unrestricted computer use on children are significant, and steps should be taken to limit it."
939	941	1	3	"@ORGANIZATION1, whether @CAPS1 computers benefit our society has been a hotly debated topic among citizens in our town. Many argue that computers provide quick and easy communication, help children and adults learn, and even teach balancing habits to our generation. I firmly believe that computers are necessary in our society. ""Hi, @CAPS2, @CAPS3! I miss you!"" are the words of @ORGANIZATION1 @NUM1 - year - old @PERSON1. @PERSON1 has been working overseas for two years in @LOCATION2, @LOCATION3. One of the only ways she can contact her father is through @ORGANIZATION3. Communication is extremely important in our society; it brings families and friends closer together. Computers provide a variety of forms of communication, such as @ORGANIZATION3, @CAPS5, and instant messaging. ""@ORGANIZATION3"" allows people to have what can be called a ""visual phone conversation."" A teary - eyed @PERSON2 says, ""Since my wife died, my daughter has been my only companion. With @ORGANIZATION3, I can not only hear her voice every day but see her face, too. It never fails to make me smile."" @CAPS5 and instant messaging also give our society fast, easy communication with others. Invitations, announcements, and just a quick ""hello"" can all be done by @CAPS5. Therefore, computers are very important for communication in our society. Have you ever seen the look on a child's face when he/she learns something new? Computers provide an excellent variety of education in our society. For example, toddlers and children can use programs such as @ORGANIZATION2 (@CAPS6). @CAPS6 programs teach reading, writing, and speaking to children. ""My child used @CAPS6 when he was a toddler,"" says @PERSON3, a @LOCATION1 resident, ""and now his teachers are so impressed by his reading and writing skills. I couldn't be more proud."" Computers don't only teach children; they teach adults, too! Did you know that adults learn @PERCENT1 of their knowledge about the environment, politics, and other basic information from the computer? Computers are needed to help people learn in our society. Finally, computers teach balance. A @LOCATION1 mom says, ""My teenager @PERSON4 has learned how to balance computer and life, and I can definitely see how it connects to other areas of balance as well."" When teenagers learn to balance their computer time, they also learn how to balance extra - curricular activities in school. This shows, as a result, that students actually learn responsibility from computers. I hope that our society will consider the fact that computers are necessary. Since they provide communication, teach education, and help kids learn how to balance, what do we have to lose? Computers can most certainly improve our society. In conclusion, we should embrace computers as an essential part of our lives for the numerous benefits they bring."
940	942	1	3	"Dear local newspaper committee, I am writing to you about how there is a substantial dilemma within the concern of computer use. From my data that I have collected, computers are both somewhat good, and bad. But I believe that there are more reasonable ""concerns"" towards computer use. In my opinion, I state that computers are quite addicting due to the addiction of computer - related activities, loss of time for exercise, and how computers sometimes ""help"" one in obtaining the loss of their social environment. Computers may seem helpful, but in fact, there is also the choice of books for research. Computer use has risen to a substantial crisis line because they are addicting. An example is the well - known link called, ""@CAPS2."" @CAPS2 is a place where you can socialize. But when your child has a @CAPS2 account, and they are on the computer doing ""homework,"" there is a @PERCENT1 chance that they will end up on @CAPS2 rather than doing their homework. This important information was found at an @ORGANIZATION1 @DATE1. Computers are addicting also because of online computer games. Computer games online can be fun, but are a complete waste of time for your electrical bill and the purpose of your child's development. Computers are very addicting in terms of @CAPS2 and online games. Computers are somewhat good, but are very harmful to your health. Did you know that @PERCENT2 of @LOCATION1 has increased their weight, due to video games and computer use? Computers are horrible when it comes to this topic. Overtime, you begin to gain weight by spending more time using the computer and less time working out and staying fit. This also revolves around addiction, by using the computer over a large period of time. In the end, computers are a hazardous topic when it comes to working out and staying in shape. Computers are terrible and horrifying when it comes to friends. Friends are people who spend time with you and interact with you. But computers see it a different way. By using the computer for a long period of time, you begin to think how computers are all you need. Soon enough, your friends will leave you because you don't care about them and forget them. This also revolves around addiction. By addiction, you lose your friends and you damage your social environment. Computer use may seem ""fun,"" but is deflated when it comes to friends. In the end, I believe that computers are a waste because they are addicting, you become very unhealthy, and they strive to damage your social environment. With the facts I have stated, they have supported my reasons. Computers are not the way to go. So, try books. In conclusion, we should be cautious about our computer use and turn to more traditional and healthy alternatives like books."
941	943	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, I believe that an increasing number of individuals are turning to computers as they can be invaluable when one loses their job. Currently, some industries are facing bankruptcy, leaving parents unable to support their loved ones due to unemployment. Additionally, the prices of cars are rising steadily. If you're on a tight budget, you can search online to find great deals on cars and trucks, which can help you save a significant amount of money.   For some reason, @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people have a penchant for traveling to far - off places such as @CAPS2 or @LOCATION1, @CAPS3. When you visit these destinations, you'll need a comfortable place to stay and enjoy a good meal with your family or friends. So, you'll look for a nice hotel that offers delicious food, comfortable beds, swimming pools, and other amenities that people enjoy during their vacations.   For instance, if your parents want you to attend your local public school, but you're hesitant because you've heard negative things about it, you can find excellent schools online. Some great options are @CAPS4, cap pre, classicle, brizzal, and there are other schools that are equally good and can set you on the path to a successful life.   Now that you understand why more and more people are using computers, you should embrace technology. It can enhance your hand - eye coordination and give you the ability to learn how to use computers effectively, making your life easier and more fulfilling.
942	944	1	3	Dear Newspaper, In my opinion, I am firmly convinced that computers have a highly positive impact on people. They offer a wealth of benefits, such as enabling people to learn about far - away places, facilitating online communication, and even assisting in job - hunting.   Certainly, the computer serves as an excellent tool for learning about distant locations. Suppose someone wishes to take a trip to @LOCATION1. They can look up detailed information about the place, learn the local language, purchase tickets, and discover interesting attractions in that country. These capabilities clearly demonstrate that a computer is a positive technology.   My next reason for believing that computers are positive is the power of online communication. It helps families stay connected, allows you to find and chat with old friends (like on Facebook), and even enables you to make new friends. These aspects of online communication are further evidence of the positive influence of computers.   My final reason is that computers can be extremely helpful in the job market. They can assist you in finding a job, support you in performing your current job more effectively, and potentially lead to a higher position at work.   All the reasons mentioned above clearly show that computers are an amazing and positive technology. Just consider all the advantages: they let people communicate online, teach about far - off places, and help with jobs. This is why I firmly believe that computers have a positive impact on people, and their importance in our lives cannot be overstated.
943	945	1	3	According to the @ORGANIZATION1 government, @PERCENT1 of @CAPS1 spend @NUM1 hours or more on a computer each day. A study indicates that @CAPS1 are suffering in multiple ways: they aren't getting enough exercise, aren't spending sufficient time with their families, and aren't fully enjoying their lives. Nowadays, people often prefer to be on the computer rather than engaging in other activities.   Since more people have been glued to their computers, they have been neglecting physical activity. As a result, @PERCENT2 of @CAPS1 have become obese. Take the example of a @CAPS6 who, a @CAPS4 year ago, was fit and healthy. A friend introduced him to a website, and within @NUM2 minutes, he was hooked. After @NUM1 months, this once - fit individual became obese. He would always munch on junk food while sitting in front of the computer. When @DATE1 rolled around, he tried out for his school baseball team but didn't make it because he was out of shape. After this setback, he decided to return to his old, healthy ways of eating well and exercising. Now, he is in good shape for any sport he plays.   Next, people are failing to spend enough quality time with their families. Many jobs require extensive computer use, causing individuals to lose sight of what truly matters. A couple of years ago, there was a @CAPS6 who was about to play in the biggest game of his life, the championship game. He reminded his dad about it repeatedly. As the game was about to start, the @CAPS6 scanned the crowd for his dad but couldn't find him. He kept wondering where his dad was. After the @CAPS5, he looked again, but this time he was heartbroken. His dad had missed the game, and his team @CAPS4 the game. Now, his dad makes sure not to miss any of his son's events since he has cut down on computer use.   Finally, people are not enjoying their lives as they are more focused on the computer than on activities they love. One @CAPS6 used to play basketball with his friends regularly. But when he started spending more time on the computer, everything changed. His friends would invite him to play, but he would always decline. The computer became his sole focus. When he tried out for his @CAPS8 school team, he didn't make it because he had forgotten how to play. After this disappointment, he stopped using the computer and returned to basketball. Now, when he tries out, he makes the team.   It's a crucial decision: either waste your life on a computer or live it to the fullest. I firmly believe that it's better to live life actively rather than being constantly glued to a computer.
944	946	1	3	"Dear Newspaper, @ORGANIZATION1 has an essay on plants for science due tomorrow. Unfortunately, she was absent on @DATE1 and had no idea about the assignment. If she had a computer, she could easily log on to the relevant website to check, but the town has taken them away. Another student, @LOCATION1, is also working on the same essay. Her handwriting is so poor that her teacher will likely have difficulty grading it. So, what can they do?   Although some claim that computers are not beneficial for society, the majority recognize that life without computers would be a catastrophe. New @CAPS1 is currently contemplating removing computers from our town, which would pose a significant problem for everyone.   One reason is that people rely on computers to access information from search engines like ""Google"" and ""Yahoo"". They also use the internet for communication platforms such as ""Facebook"" and ""AIM"". Taking away computers would have a drastic impact on daily life. Society depends on computers to gather information. Whenever I encounter something I don't know, I simply look it up online. Without this resource, my homework would lack the detail and depth that I achieve with the help of a computer. Another example is when many people heard about the earthquake in @LOCATION2, they were able to pull up detailed information within seconds. This led to numerous bake sales and fund - raisers. Moreover, when kids miss their favorite @CAPS2 shows, they can easily catch up by looking them up the next day. This is an important part of teenagers' lives.   Many people also use the internet for communication. In my family, ""e - mail"" is essential. My mom makes all our family plans via email and sometimes even emails herself from work to remember important things. Without it, our family would struggle to function. ""Facebook"" is another great communication tool. Whenever my friends and I have questions about the day's events, we ask each other on this website. It's safe and saves us the hassle of making phone calls. ""AIM"" is a messaging tool that allows instant communication with friends and even video - chatting. My friends and I rely on it to show each other outfits and other items. Both teenagers and adults need to communicate through computers.   In conclusion, society needs computers to look up information and communicate with friends and colleagues. So, please do not even consider taking away computers from our town as it would severely disrupt our lives and limit our access to information and communication."

946	948	1	3	"I am so happy! I just successfully finished my school report on @PERSON1, and I didn't even need to leave the cozy confines of my house. I was able to smoothly talk with my classmate and ask her well - thought - out questions online. I also managed to gather all the necessary information just from the comfort of my computer. Moreover, I learned how to row a boat. To vividly show my class how @LOCATION1 crossed the @CAPS1 river, I took an engaging online course. This is one clear situation that demonstrates why computers have fantastic effects on people in everyday situations. Local research shows that @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2 planning their vacation use the internet. The main reason these citizens use the internet is to get detailed information about the hotel and the vacation site. That is one way that makes computers helpful and positive devices because it makes it incredibly easy for busy @CAPS2 to get ready for a trip by looking at high - quality pictures of the hotel online and getting all the info they need. Doctor @PERSON2 of @CAPS4 university says, ""Computers now offer well - designed programs that allow busy @CAPS2 to learn a new skill. @PERCENT2 of @CAPS2 currently use this software."" In today's fast - paced world, everyday @CAPS2 don't have the luxury of time to go out and join a group or class to learn new skills. That is why computers are so helpful, and people just love them. Instead of leaving home, they can be cooking delicious meals, doing relaxing yoga, or speaking a new language all from their computer at home. That is another reason why computers are useful in very positive ways. Imagine forgetting your homework at school and not being able to get an A in that class. Well, because of computers, forgetful students can talk to a classmate online and get the homework and do it. Or they could even use the internet to go to that school website and find the homework and print it out. Many students around the country forget homework once in a while, but because of helpful computers, they can easily fix their problems. Let's recap. Students or adults can get useful information off the internet for projects or even vacations. Busy @CAPS2 who don't have time to leave their house can take a class or learn a new skill right on the computer. Anyone can use the internet to talk or chat online to get school work done or to connect with long - distance friends. That is why the effects of computers on people are nothing but positive. Now what can you do? It is extremely important that computers stay in our lives. They are helpful, and we have learned to rely on them, which is why they must stay. This benefits you because newspaper houses are efficiently organized by computers, and it keeps your business running smoothly."
947	949	1	3	Many People in Society think computers are bad, but I firmly believe computers are excellent. Computers allow you to easily communicate with your friends, family, and relatives. With a computer, you can do your homework extra fast, without having to make the hassle of going to the library to look stuff up. Computers also allow you to take out your pent - up anger on ones and zeros in a harmless way. Many experts like @ORGANIZATION1 think people will talk to strangers on websites like Facebook and MySpace. If parents carefully place their sons on these websites and also make it so that only friends can view the profile, you will be a lot safer. Communications engineer @PERSON1 says that it is better for people to talk to each other online than not. I know he is correct because I have a relative in the @LOCATION1 that I love talking to, but they are @NUM1 miles away, so communication is otherwise hard to get. Then I got a Facebook account, and it is like they are right next door. @CAPS1. @ORGANIZATION2 @PERSON1 says that @PERCENT1 of strangers that are molesters/thugs go after people who don't protect their profile, so protect your profile and be safe. Computers are better than going to the library! This is because going to the library means you have to round up the kids, get in the car, and go. With a computer, you can just go into your office and do research. That saves money on gas. If you have a project, you can just send it straight to the teacher. In many cases today, experts like @CAPS1. @ORGANIZATION2 are conducting experiments that are rigged. They say violence is caused by the games, but they use test subjects like the bad people you don't want to meet. I have found video games to be a great outlet for the stress built up during the day. Many of my friends have also found this to be true. Video games make you think, which is also a reason they are good. In conclusion, computers are excellent. They make it possible to communicate with friends, allow you to take out anger, and what is not to love? Get a computer now!!
948	950	1	3	Each year, the world becomes more and more advanced in technology. Technology helps and benefits us all in a good, positive way. Computers are an important part of this positive technology and definitely benefit society. Computers help us look up places and things we have never seen before and teach us about them in detail. In addition, computers have a positive impact on families and benefit them greatly. Also, they help people from adults years out of college to teenagers in high school communicate with their friends easily. Therefore, computers help us all in some little way and make life easier and more fun. To begin with, computers help us expand our knowledge. They help us look up facts or recent news quickly. For example, just recently, the @DATE1 @CAPS1 occurred, and they usually go late into the night, so I didn't get to see the whole competition. I could just easily go look it up on the computer to see who won which medals. Computers helped me by looking up the medal results quickly so I wouldn't have to wonder who won a medal or not. Computers help us expand our knowledge all the time. They help us look up facts for reports, places we want to travel to, learn about the benefits of a certain pet, and the possibilities can be endless. To continue with, computers help families by bringing them closer in a way. A family member could be watching a funny video on YouTube or @ORGANIZATION1 and could think it's so funny that they want their whole family to see it. In addition, stores sell clothes online now, so a mother and daughter can sit down together and shop without leaving the house. Computers bring my family together when we rent movies from @LOCATION1 on the computer. It brings us together when we choose and pick which movie to rent. Also, it brings us together to have a family movie night. As a result, these things the computer provides bring out discussions in the family and give a good topic that everyone can relate to and talk about. Another way computers are beneficial is they bring everyone together. There are many ways to communicate on the computer these days. There is Facebook, Twitter, email, AIM, and many more. They are all different, but they have one thing in common: to bring old friends and new friends together. For instance, my mom just signed up for Facebook so she can talk to all her old friends from high school, and she found one really good friend who she hasn't seen in ages. It made her really happy. Therefore, it shows that computers aren't just for bringing new people together; they can bring old ones together too. In conclusion, computers play a vital role in our lives. They enhance our knowledge, strengthen family bonds, and connect us with friends. We should continue to embrace this wonderful technology for the many benefits it offers.
949	951	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, I agree with the experts when they say people are spending too much time on the computers. The reason for this is that, one, people don't get enough exercise. Two, new websites have been made, and people are curious to see how @CAPS1 works. Three, more and more teenage kids have the new technology. They are on @CAPS1 all the time and don't realize they're not spending any time with their family. Now that you know that, let's move on to my first reason. First of all, since people are spending a lot of time on the computer, they don't have time to go outside and exercise. More people probably figure they don't need to go outside. Really, they do. It's important that they get their body moving and their blood flowing through their body. Another thing is that we don't always need to get the answers off the computer. It's easy to find a friend and play a game with them. Find something to do other than play games on the computer. Now that you know, let's move on to the second reason. Second of all, the computer network has come up with new ideas for the computer. They now have Facebook. More and more people use Facebook now. This right here shows us that they won't get out and play. This also means most kids won't do their homework. Another thing is that either parents should set a time limit on the computer or they should take @CAPS1 away. There is just so much time you can be on the computer for without getting bored. Now that you know that, let's move on to the last reason. Third of all, I would like to say people are spending more time on the computer than with their own family. The reason I say this is because it's important to spend as much time with family and friends instead of being on the computer @NUM1. We need to know what's going on in our daily life. Another thing is that our family is way better than some game on the computer. Go outside with your family and play a game of wiffle ball. Now that you know that, let's move on to the conclusion. In conclusion, you have read an essay talking about how people spend more time on the computer rather than go outside to exercise, new websites keep them on longer, and they're not spending enough time with their family and friends. It's important to have a time limit on the computer and get up and moving. Don't be a lazy couch potato and sit on the computer all day. Get out and spend time with your family and friends. I hope you agree with me, and by taking action, we can lead healthier and more fulfilling lives.
950	952	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, I agree with the concerned experts, and I'm sure many others agree also. I bet you that if you keep reading, it would be understandable why I agree. First of all, too many people spend too much time talking with friends online. I think that once you start talking with them online, you should finish up the conversation face to face or by telephone. Talking online is a great way to connect with friends and people you haven't seen in a long time, but too much of that can start problems. For example, rumors. In my opinion, when friends get too excited online, they decide to start rumors about other people, and it ends up being sent to almost everybody. Another example is online arguing, which can lead up to many problems like fighting when you get back to school. How would you feel if you turned on your computer and found out that someone has been talking about you or that someone is trying to start a fight with you? I'm positive that you would not enjoy it, and your feelings might be hurt. Next reason is, being on the computer too much can affect most people's grades. Many people are going home and turning on their computer instead of doing their homework or studying. There are many people who go to my school, and their grades have declined because of online usage. Pretty soon, many people will be held back because they have failed the school year. For example, picture yourself as a parent and getting your child's report card and finding out they have all @CAPS1's or mostly @CAPS2's. You wouldn't like that either. Lastly, computers have caused another problem called bullying. Too many children are being bullied online, and they are being hurt. Those children who are being the bullies are enjoying it, while the children who are getting bullied are sad, thinking that nobody cares about them. Bullying has caused death or many other problems. Imagine being someone getting bullied, and your feelings are really hurt. You don't talk to an adult or a parent; all you end up doing is killing yourself. Picture how many parents are upset, and how yours would be too, to find that their child has been bullied to death. It really hurts them. And I'm sure if you were one of those parents, you wouldn't be too happy. In conclusion, being online too much has an effect on everybody. We should all be more mindful of our online usage to avoid these negative consequences and create a safer and more positive environment for everyone.
951	953	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1 of @LOCATION1, @CAPS2, in this modern era, the world is having a network where people can connect, learn and work efficiently. This wonderful network is here in our computers. Computers benefit society because they help @CAPS3 connect with far - away places, develop hand - eye coordination and get work done faster. In the days before computers, we were isolated in our immediate area, like being trapped in a small bubble. @CAPS2 being stuck in our town, unaware of the rest of the world, unable to enjoy the beauty of @LOCATION3 or send help to the starving people in @LOCATION2. @PERCENT1 of the money donated to @ORGANIZATION1, an organization that assists in global disasters, comes from online. Without the computer, how would our willing people help the rest of the world, or even know about it? Give our community the ability to reach out to the farthest parts of the globe, give them computers. Computers produce games and activities more intense than you can find anywhere else. Playing baseball simply doesn't require enough focus. The computer's intricate experience helps future engineers or even pilots develop a focus and hand - eye coordination that could save lives. @PERSON1, who trains the @CAPS3 air force, weighs in on the effects of computers. ""They have made a great deal of positive impact,"" he states. ""@CAPS4 soldiers have excellent eyes for controls and amazing reflexes, making them natural pilots."" @CAPS5't our community have the opportunity to excel as well? The computers we own train @CAPS3 as we use them to have reflexes and hand - eye coordination equal to the best of the military. Computers allow our lives to be just as enjoyable as they are meaningful by getting our work done faster. Before computers, @CAPS7 and calculating took @PERCENT2 more time, but now they get our work done quickly and without error. @NUM1 year old author @PERSON2 states, ""@CAPS4 computer helps me type @CAPS4 writing a lot faster and, more importantly, it is done right."" @CAPS7 and typing are just more efficient when you are using a computer. Accountants, students and even the journalists for your own newspaper need the computer to work faster and more efficiently. Don't stunt our community's workers, give them what they need, computers! Computers are too important and beneficial to lose. Our community benefits from the computers that help @CAPS3 connect with far away places, give @CAPS3 hand - eye coordination and help @CAPS3 work quickly and correctly. So, explain in your next article that we need our computers. Computers are necessary in our community and we would be lost without them!"
952	954	1	3	Dear The @ORGANIZATION1, Computers are out! The effects of over - use of a computer can severely change a person's life! People who are spending too much time on their computer will most likely spend less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with their family members and friends. I believe that the issue of computers overwhelming a person's life should be addressed in a serious manner. Exercising, an essential part of anyone's life, has been affected. Since the development of the internet forty years ago, the average @CAPS1 or body mass index of an average person has increased fifteen percent! This is no coincidence. Computers are causing more and more people to not challenge themselves to run that extra mile, or swim that extra lap, and instead stay home and play on their computers. This not only is hurting people's weights, but exercise equipment store owners are having to close their shops because less and less people are coming in to work out or exercise like they should every day! Our children are also being affected by this addicting sensation. Childhood obesity is one of the main effects on children because when they get hooked on playing on these, they as well stop exercising and play video games. The average amount of people who went to @LOCATION2 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 every year was around @NUM1, but since the invention of the computer, the attendance dropped to a mere @NUM2 people every year. Less and less people are choosing to enjoy a fresh @DATE1 and instead spend it indoors in their comfort zones. This is hurting people as well as the wildlife around them. The ratio of squirrels to people in @LOCATION2 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 was @NUM3 in @DATE2, the year the computer was invented. But a mere ten years later, the situation changed so that there are fewer squirrels! This is because now that there are less people feeding them, fewer squirrels live in the @CAPS3 @CAPS3 and have to go elsewhere to find food by themselves. Tour guides who worked in @LOCATION2 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 are being fired due to less people wanting a tour, so less tour guides are needed. Families are seeing that the more a person plays on a computer, the less time that person is going to spend talking to @LOCATION1, or @CAPS4 @CAPS5. Scientists held an experiment where they had three different people spend an hour reading a book, another spend an hour on a computer, and three hours on a computer to see who could stay in a conversation with their mother the longest. The first person spent twenty minutes on the phone with their mother, the second only ten minutes, and the last, a mere five minutes. This shows that the more time spent on a computer, the less interactions are held between son and mom, an important relationship in anyone's life. Mother's worry that the next time they have a barbecue, @PERSON1 won't be in his room, playing on his computer like last time. @PERSON2 was chosen to conduct an experiment on @PERSON2 had three friends @CAPS6, @PERSON3, and. In conclusion, the over - use of computers is having a detrimental impact on various aspects of our lives, from health to social relationships, and it's high time we take steps to address this issue.
953	955	1	3	I walked outside to get the mail and newspaper. I saw the front page talking about computers. An article said there's too much computer usage. I thought there wasn't going to be more computer sales, but it said that people are using computers and are not exercising much. I think that people aren't going to have a hard time quitting using their computers if they really want to. I had a friend who didn't know how to use the computer. He spent his hours playing outside. In the @DATE1, he tried out for @CAPS1 baseball. He is a very good athlete and he also does great in school. Other people without a job are not looking for something to do; they are at the computer every day when they should be doing work around and inside the house. People with computers shouldn't be spending all day on them like one of my friend's friends. He uses his computer every time he comes from school and doesn't do his homework on time. Every time he doesn't want to go out and exercise his mind or get a little bit of sun, and sometimes he doesn't even eat. He should give his brain a rest and do physical things that will help him. Other people, such as computer workers, should write a note to people with computers saying how computers can be addictive to people. Maybe then they'll realize how often they should use their computers and use them mainly to get information and for college. There was a girl who started to use the computer to chat with people and ended up using the computer a lot and not going to college. I believe that computers have a major impact on people. People should be going out to have fun, get sunlight, not staying at the computer all the time. Many adults don't use the computer as much as most teens and kids. People should go to the gym and build strong muscles. They should stay away from computers for a while. Going against excessive computer use would be the right thing to do. In conclusion, we need to be more aware of the negative impacts of excessive computer use and take steps to lead a more balanced life.
954	956	1	3	Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, @CAPS2's opinion on computers is that they have a positive affect on people. I think this because I know some people who exercise and also use the computer regularly. I don't think computers are a bad thing. Some people learn on computers. They learn how to exercise through various online fitness programs. Sure, some people just chat, but they can also learn about that far - away place they could go and explore its beauty and nature. I think computers have great effects on people. They help out a lot. I know @CAPS2's uncle who came from @LOCATION1. He learned how to speak English on the computer. He learned a lot and we were all proud. Some effects that computers have on people are numerous. People have classes online. For example, single mothers with kids can get their diplomas and degrees online through the computer. And there are other @CAPS3 like @CAPS2's aunts and uncles who go to English classes online and work. A lot of people have classes online. I go on @PERSON1 all the time. @CAPS4 teaches me how to type. It's fun, but also educational. I think that all computers have positive effects on people. There shouldn't be one computer with negative effects on people, but that's only by @CAPS2's opinion. Computers are like @CAPS3 robots; they do lots for us. We can type reports, learn, read online. And then there are also the games we play online, and many of them are educational games. I believe that there are lots of resources. You could search up a lot of stuff. For example, you could search up: mystery, animals, nature, and places. You wouldn't believe how many results the computer has. So, who would say there are negative effects of the computer? All @CAPS4 is trying to do is help us and improve our education. @CAPS4 helps me with @CAPS2's Spanish sometimes. So, why would people think that computers aren't good ideas? Computers are great for everything. I could go on and see what the weather is for tomorrow. Also, I could see what the news is, and I could contact @CAPS2's teachers through the computer. I think a computer would always have a positive affect on people. In conclusion, computers offer a wide range of benefits and are an invaluable tool in our modern lives, enhancing learning, communication, and access to information.
955	957	1	3	"Dear Local @CAPS1, I am delighted to write this letter to you. It has come to my attention that the people who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people. I agree with those people. I agree with them because, one: you can communicate with your family and friends via email, via @CAPS2, via @CAPS3, etc. Number two: you can use a computer for research, and number three: it can tell you directions or give you info on a restaurant or place you want to go. I will now get into more detail on these three topics. You can communicate with your family or friends via computer. For example, my friend Amor, when we were best friends and in third grade, he had to move to @LOCATION1. I cried the first day he moved. Then the next week or so, I got an email from him, and so now we can keep in touch with each other. He comes to @LOCATION2 every @DATE2 and we hang out with each other. Maybe one day, I will like to go visit him now in @LOCATION3 because he moved again, but I will have to do some research on @LOCATION3 first. With a computer, you can research a lot of things. Like this year, our language @CAPS4 class read a book called ""my brother @CAPS5 is dead"" and it was a true story. So we had to do some research on the book, and I found out that without computers, how would I be able to research anything on the website? It shared where everything was, a description of the thing, and how to get there (directions). Directions are very important. They show you how to get to a certain destination. You can get directions off a computer. I remember one year I had to go to my friend's birthday party and we didn't know how to get there. So I went online on @DATE1 and we got the directions from there and we printed them out and we found the place in @NUM1 minutes. Without a computer, we would not have been able to find the house easily. You might disagree with me on this because a computer can have bad websites and can also become very addicting to some people, but I think I am right. Thank you for reading this letter. Once again, computers are good for study and offer great assistance in various aspects of our lives, from communication to exploration and learning. In conclusion, despite some potential drawbacks, the positive impacts of computers far outweigh the negatives, making them an essential part of our modern world."
956	958	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2, you know that computers can prevent you from doing a lot of beneficial things? Instead of constantly being on the computer, you can engage in more physical exercise, play outside in the fresh air, and spend quality time with your family and friends. This is precisely why you need to cut down on your computer usage. Exercise is crucial for your body, while excessive computer time offers no such benefits. You can easily get some light weights and do simple exercises right in your room. A refreshing run along the beach also sounds like a great idea. Just by doing these activities, you can shed a significant amount of weight instead of piling it on while sitting in front of the computer. So, go ahead and start exercising to lose weight as it's truly good for you! Computers also stop you from getting fresh air and enjoying the fun of playing outside. When you're outside, you'll quickly realize that the real - world play is far more enjoyable than just mindlessly pressing buttons and clicking everywhere on the computer. You don't even have to engage in high - energy play; you can simply take a leisurely walk with someone or sit on the soft grass and have a heart - to - heart talk. The computer acts as a barrier to all these wonderful outdoor activities. Spending time with your family is an extremely important activity that your computer is preventing you from doing. Imagine you're on the computer for an hour while your family is having a lovely barbecue. When you finally get off the computer, you'll realize that sharing that moment with them is so much more fulfilling than sitting alone and staring at the screen. This is why computers are a distraction for everyone because they make you reluctant to exercise, play outside, or spend time with your family. You can use the computer, but just make sure not to stay on it for too long, or you'll keep missing out on all the fun.
957	959	1	3	"Dear local Newspaper, @CAPS1's opinion on the affects of computers is that while there are indeed some good benefits that come out of them, I firmly believe that more negative issues and situations arise from computers, and they impact people in a not - so - good way with greater intensity. @CAPS1's three main reasons as to why I think there are more negative impacts than positive and constructive impacts from computers are @CAPS2 - bullying, which is a very big and concerning issue. Also, there are numerous 'scams' and 'cons' out there on the @CAPS9. Lastly, there is a large amount of mis - leading or wrong information available online. Going back to @CAPS1's first reason, ""@CAPS2 - bullying."" @CAPS2 - bullying can be defined as rude or nasty teasing that occurs over the @CAPS9. On popular social networking websites such as @CAPS4, @CAPS5, @CAPS6, and so on, '@CAPS2 - bullying' can include mean - spirited teasing, hurtful comments, horrible name - calling, and foul language. It is much more harmful than regular bullying, like the typical ""Give me your lunch money"" scenario, because once you put words out on the @CAPS9, you can never take them back, no matter how hard you try. '@CAPS2 - bullying' represents the new generation of meanness. Secondly, scamming and cons are prevalent on the @CAPS9/computers. When purchasing items online, you never really know what you're going to end up getting. @CAPS1's father was scammed, or conned on the @CAPS9. He was looking on what seemed like a very official - looking site to purchase a big boat. He drove all the way to @LOCATION1 to pick it up. He took it out on the water in @LOCATION2, at our @DATE1 vacation home, and to his dismay, the engine and motor were broken. That's exactly what can happen when buying something off of the @CAPS9. Lastly, mis - information can be another significant negative impact from computers. When researching a topic, you should stick to the library. It may sound old - fashioned and slow, but when you research on the @CAPS9, you need to remember that anybody can put or post anything, even misleading or untrue statements and 'information' online. Researching topics is not the only way to get false information. People can pretend to be someone they're not in real - life, which is why anonymous chat - rooms and instant messaging are dangerous and unreliable. As a conclusion, the @CAPS9 basically has stronger negative impacts and consequences than positive ones. Because @CAPS2 bullying, scamming or conning, and mis - information are all negative factors of the @CAPS9, and they outweigh the positives."
958	960	1	3	Dear Newspaper, Computers are not a benefit for us because we spend too much time on them. Not everyone has a computer, and the cost of a computer is a significant factor. Not everyone knows how to use it properly. If we were to calculate the many hours we spend on the computer, people would be truly amazed at the result. People often spend their time looking up random things when they could be outside riding bikes or going for a nice walk. And clearly, you can't do those activities with a computer. Not everyone has a computer because they are quite expensive. A basic computer can cost upwards of @NUM1 and more, and that's just the cost of the computer itself. Then you have to pay for the internet, which can cost around @NUM2 a month. Additionally, you have to pay for certain apps like Windows, Microsoft, etc. The bills related to a computer add up over time, and people don't really realize that when they are paying for the internet, they aren't getting as much as what the cable company claims to be offering. Not everyone knows how to use a computer. For example, older adults don't really know how to fully utilize the potential of a computer because they never learned how to use one. In conclusion, computers aren't really a great help for our society because of the time spent on them, the high cost, and the lack of knowledge about using them.
959	961	1	3	Dear @LOCATION1, Have you ever found yourself constantly thinking about the computer, or wishing you were on it? I heard you were looking to see if computers have negative or positive effects on society. I firmly feel that it has a negative effect because of less time spent exercising, little time with family or friends, and it's very easy to become addicted to. Exercising is a very important thing for a healthy body and mind. @CAPS1 already have a hard enough time finding time to do this. So, instead of using that free time to exercise, they will probably be on Facebook. Also, the maintenance of the computer will take away time that could be used for exercising. Just @DATE1, my computer got a virus that I had to get fixed, and that took forever. That time while I was fixing it could have been valuable exercising time. Another key point to look at is obesity. We should be up and moving, not just sitting and staring at a computer for @NUM1 hours at a time. I love to spend time with my friends and family. I mean, who doesn't, right? Computers only take us away from that. Kids will be on Facebook instead of having a nice meal with their family. My @CAPS2 always told me about the great (and sometimes stupid) things he did with his friends. Now, kids just have it too easy. We will never have the same kind of social experiences as our parents. I feel it is very important to spend time with friends and family because you never know when you're going to lose them. Addiction is a serious matter, and being addicted to the computer is no exception. Our generation is so dependent on computers. For example, in the car with the @CAPS4. You just plug it in and it tells you where to go. What happens when it breaks? You will have no idea where to go because you never learned how to read a map. Or what if your computer breaks? You will have to send a letter by mail when kids are so used to typing instead of writing. That skill would be lost and you would have to learn it again. As you can see, addiction is a no - laughing matter. Once again, I must stress the negative effect of computers on our lives. We should be more aware of these issues and try to limit our computer usage to avoid these negative consequences.
960	962	1	3	"To whom it may concern, I think computers are a good thing. It is good because you get to learn about foreign places, keep in touch with family and friends, and it offers great entertainment. First, computers are great for learning about foreign places. On the computers, you can research a place and look at vivid pictures before you actually go there. If I wanted to go to a far - away place like @LOCATION3, I would go on the computer and find out the best areas to visit and look at different hotels to stay at, along with the reviews they've received. Also, if someone were to do a paper on a different country or even a state that they've never been to, they would turn to the computer. Sure, you can get the same information from books, but on the computer, you can easily filter out what you don't need. In my history class, I had to do a report on the state of @LOCATION2. I have never been there, so I went on the computer. Books could have given me the same information, but computers are always up - to - date and accurate. Second, computers help you keep in touch with family and friends. There are numerous websites that allow you to share photos and have conversations with friends or family. I recently signed up for Facebook and I am able to talk to friends instead of using my texts and running over the phone bill every month. My dad has a Facebook too. He talks to people he hasn't seen since he moved here from the @LOCATION1 white mountains. Some other popular sites are AIM, AOL, and MySpace. Lastly, computers are good entertainment. Computers allow you to watch that concert you didn't go to or that movie that's never on TV. When I went to a skateboard demo at Skate Lair, I had a ton of fun. The other day, though, I started thinking about it. I went on YouTube and typed in ""Nike SB Skate Lair demo"" and clicked on it. As I watched it, about halfway through, I saw my face! I was so excited. Computers also allow you to check the news and weather. This is good because if you are on the road and you want to see what's going on, you can take out a laptop and check the weather or news. This is why I think computers are necessary. Yes, some people do stay on for four hours at a time, but most people only use the computer for a short period. Overall, the benefits that computers bring in terms of learning, communication, and entertainment far outweigh the potential drawbacks of excessive use."
961	963	1	3	Dear Newspaper, I firmly believe that people, especially a large number of teens, do spend a significant amount of time on computers. I base this belief on my own experience and a survey I conducted among @PERSON1's @NUM1 grade @CAPS4 class. I'd like to elaborate on the idea that teens spend a lot of time on the computer. Some teens use the internet to do homework or check their emails, while others get addicted to @CAPS1 for hours on end. As a result, they don't go outside or engage in sports. In my own case, I used to have a @CAPS1 account and would sit in front of the computer all day, missing out on quality time with my family and friends. So, I decided to delete the account. However, I still feel addicted to the computer as I'm always listening to music, chatting with friends, or checking my emails, just like most people do. Regarding @PERSON1's @NUM1 grade @CAPS4 class, @PERCENT1 of the students use it every day, and @PERCENT2 said that they spend @PERCENT3 of their time on the computer. This is just one @NUM1 grade class, and it shows that most students, regardless of age, are addicted to it. This is why I believe that people spend too much time on the computer. Many students spend hours on @CAPS1 at a time. From my own experience of being addicted to the computer and the high percentage of students in @PERSON1's class who said they were addicted, I sincerely hope that parents tell their children to spend less time on the computer.
962	964	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, Have you ever pondered how much the world wide web has to offer? I definitely agree that computers have a beneficial effect on people. They enhance hand - eye coordination, enable people to learn about far - away places, and give people the opportunity to reconnect with old friends or make new ones. The internet is truly a treasure trove. Studies carried out by @PERSON1, a doctor at @ORGANIZATION1, stated that @PERCENT1 of people who type on the computer have better hand - eye coordination than those who don't. You could be improving your coordination without even realizing it! Intelligent individuals would concur that using the computer is very helpful. There are numerous computer games that demand quick reactions, fast reflexes, and good hand - eye coordination. I know from personal experience that it has been beneficial. Since I've been on the computer more, I've noticed a remarkable improvement in my reaction time. Yes, I understand that some people should get outside and exercise, but you can either exercise or improve your hand - eye coordination; there's no wrong choice. Just as the vast universe holds fascinating worlds, computers offer a window to them. The technology of computers allows us to learn about far - away places. Kevin, a scientist, claims that @PERCENT2 of our knowledge about space comes from computers! For example, think about Google Earth; it allows us to see clear pictures of anywhere in the world! I think you'd agree that without computers, we'd lack a great deal of knowledge about the wonderful world around us. Would you rather not have computers and be ignorant of half the things about the world we live in? Through high - tech computers, we can learn about life beyond our planet, such as in space and other galaxies. Did you know that @NUM1 of the population uses the computer to talk and reconnect with friends and family? I'm one of them! I know people shouldn't be overly reliant on the computer for socializing, but it's a great way to stay in touch. There are awesome websites like Skype and Oovo that let you chat with others. Friendly and educated people agree that this is a good way to catch up with old friends from high school or even grade school. Another great aspect is that long - lasting friendships can be created online. For instance, I go to @DATE1 camp every year and make new friends. Internet websites like Facebook have helped me keep in touch with them. Clearly, computers are a great resource. The time has come to make a decision, and choosing to use computers is definitely a wise one. Without a doubt, it will help you improve hand - eye coordination, stay in touch with people, and most importantly, learn about the wonders of far - away places. So, don't make the wrong choice; appreciate and utilize all that computers have to offer.
963	965	1	3	"Dear newspaper, Do you want to learn good hand - eye coordination? Do you want to have the ability to learn about far - away places? And do you want to talk online with other people? If you answered yes to all of these questions, then using a computer is the way to go! While using a computer, you can achieve many things. You can look up a healthy recipe for your family or find a good, relaxing place to do your daily yoga. Although some people claim that using a computer cuts down on your time for exercising and enjoying nature, it actually doesn't. A recent poll conducted at Planet Fitness in Newington, @CAPS2, showed that @PERCENT1 of the exercising people discovered Planet Fitness through the internet. @PERSON1, a professional in the department of health and wellness, said, ""@PERCENT2 of my customers take online courses of exercising at home so that they don't have to be in public."" I know it might seem lazy to not go to a gym, but some people are terrified of what others think of them. I mean, who doesn't want to exercise in the warm comfort of their own home instead of going to a sweaty old gym? All right - minded people would choose to stay at home and exercise from their computer rather than going to a sweaty and smelly gym. So, it's a valid option. Whether you go to a sweaty old gym or stay at your beautiful, clean home with the internet, you have a choice. Imagine, as soon as you wake up well - rested in the morning, instead of going to a yucky gym, you can stay home and enjoy a relaxing workout in the comfort of your own space. Certainly, you care about your nose and would like to smell a nice, warm apple pie. But if you don't mind the gym smell, that's fine too. So, don't go to a gym; stay at home and enjoy your day with the internet! I firmly believe that staying at home and loving your internet is a great choice."
964	966	1	3	Dear the daily newspaper crew, I've noticed that some of you disagree about using computers. I, for one, believe that using a computer really isn't that bad. For example, computers are actually great for education. Many students use them to create high - quality images of things for school projects or science fair projects. I, like most young teens and children, use these machines to play video games when I'm bored. Unlike some people, I don't spend all day on it. I usually play for a couple of hours. However, there are some downsides to having a computer at home. Firstly, the machines consume a lot of energy, which makes the electric bill rise, especially around @DATE1. On some websites, there are people with malicious intentions, like on MySpace and Twitter. But on the bright side, these potential stalkers usually get caught quickly and are put in jail. Computers actually have a positive effect on the mind and physical movements. For example, children who use computers learn how to do things like fly a kite with their parents' supervision, and it also improves their hand - eye coordination. Many children who play sports and use computers can catch a ball faster than usual. So, you can see that computers are not that bad. We should seriously think about what would happen to children if computers were banned. It would be a great loss for their education, entertainment, and development.
965	967	1	3	"I believe that computers have a positive effect on people. Although computers are a relatively new invention, they have become extremely popular. Computers allow people to communicate online with each other. They also enable students to complete homework assignments and important projects efficiently. Moreover, computers provide a safe place to store important files and pictures so that they won't get lost. Computers are helpful in numerous ways, and these are just a few examples. Computers facilitate online communication. Whether it's through email, instant messaging, or a video chat, computers have replaced old - fashioned and cumbersome ways of communication. For example, instead of writing a letter, mailing it, and waiting two days for the recipient to get it, you can simply email them. All you need to do is obtain an email address, type a message, and click send. They will receive the message instantly and can reply soon. @PERSON1, the president of the @ORGANIZATION1, says, ""Computers are an important part of technology. People use them every day."" Using them every day doesn't just mean for fun; they also assist with work. Three out of four adults who use computers say that they help with their work and improve their social status. Computers are an integral part of everyday life and can be useful in almost every aspect. Computers allow students to finish homework and projects quite rapidly. Instead of hand - writing that four - page essay, students can use textbooks and the internet to find information. Computers also enable students to email teachers in case they miss classes and assignments. @CAPS4 @PERSON3, a student at @ORGANIZATION2 who had missed quite a few days of school, says, ""All I had to do was email my teachers, and they sent me all the homework assignments. It was that easy."" @CAPS4 is not the only one who thinks computers are a big help. Millions of kids and adults agree. Computers not only let students write reports but also allow them to save them for future use. They are also great for storing important files and precious pictures. Everyone dreads it when their camera or video camera breaks and all their wonderful memories are lost. Well, just save them to the computer, and they'll be there forever! @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people who store their pictures on the computer agree that this is the best way to do it. In conclusion, computers clearly have a positive effect on people. They enable people to communicate online, complete homework and projects, and store important files. I'm sure that everyone would agree that computers are an essential part of everyday life. Our world would be very different without them."
966	968	1	3	Dear @LOCATION1, I think computers are an incredibly useful tool for everyone if they use it right. Here are my reasons why. First of all, I think computers are good because news travels at an astonishing speed. Using the internet, world - changing news can spread like wildfire and inform everyone in mere seconds. It is excellent for staying in the loop and reading about things you need to know. This reminds me of the time when a massive earthquake hit @LOCATION2 and severely traumatized its citizens. Within moments of the accident, it was already all over the internet. This brought mass attention to @LOCATION2, which led many people to donate money and essential items.   Secondly, the computer is also great for researching topics for school and personal interest. If you need facts for a school project, you can easily search what you need through the internet's wide variety of search engines. You will be able to pinpoint exactly what you're looking for. You can also look up things that interest you. If you have a favorite sports team, band, or are interested in a famous figure, you have tons of information on them at your fingertips. You can do all of this within the privacy of your own home so you can remain as secret as a @ORGANIZATION1 agent. This reminds me of the time when one of my idols died. Within seconds of hearing the tragic news, I was able to search the topic and get an endless stream of information regarding his death.   Finally, you can chat with someone from around the world if you want to! Using social networking sites like Facebook and MySpace, you can connect with your friends and chat with them for hours on end. You can also enter chatrooms with people who share a common interest with you. Just like how I talk to people about a band we both love. I believe access to news, research, and staying in touch with your friends is without a doubt the best reasons to use a computer. What are you waiting for? Get one and start enjoying the benefits!
967	969	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1, I am writing this letter to inform you about my opinion on the effects computers have on people. I firmly don't agree with the view that people are spending too much time on their computers. My following reasons will explain why I don't agree. However, I also think there is an issue with computers. Please read on to understand my reasons.   First of all, my reason for not agreeing with those who support technology is because there is no safety! I think chatting online is great but extremely dangerous. For example, most kids are followed by strangers, and it usually happens online. This is because they share all their information with unknown people. Also, kids get into dangerous situations; for example, they get kidnapped because of this information and the people they talk to.   Secondly, I don't agree because it also causes addiction to the computers. Most people get addicted to the certain things they do online. These activities can also become dangerous. For example, people play some video games where there is killing and committing crime, which we can't do in the ""real"" world. These kinds of games also bring people to dangerous paths. Another example is that we've had students bringing violence into their lives because they think violence is the answer when they're influenced by these games. The addiction to the computer is so bad that people don't have a look of vitality and are not interacting with real - world things.   Lastly, I don't agree because it also isolates people. Most people who are constantly on the computer are lonely and bored. They fall into an unfulfilling life because they don't enjoy real - life experiences at all. For example, people may even die of a sedentary lifestyle due to excessive computer use.   This letter will hopefully affect others, so thanks for reading. Hopefully, people understand why I don't agree with the one - sided view on computer use and also recognize the associated problems."
968	970	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, @DATE1's society is much more different from what it was like twenty years ago. We have phones that can easily allow us to browse the web as we please, just like a computer. Our access to such a large network brings us together, can broaden our mental horizons, and keep many @CAPS5 hard - working individuals on key point so that when the time for work comes around, they are ready. Not everyone agrees that technology is a benefit to our growing well - being, but I believe it keeps us moving forward and away from ignorance in all of its forms.   Our construction workers work extremely hard during their busy seasons. They vigorously build skyscraping towers, educational facilities, additions to our health center, and even the very places we call home. However, when the weather is not on their side and building anything can be hazardous in the long run, they must still remain at the ready when duty calls.   Lately, there has been an advancement in technology to help crane operators maintain their skills during their off - season virtually. It may @MONTH1 appear easy to the untrained spectator. To one, it @MONTH1 seem like all they do is seat themselves in a cabin, pull a few levers, and push a few buttons. However, there is in fact a precision to such a task. Pull the lever too quickly and the crane can go sharply in the wrong direction, causing it to tip over. One of our field reporters tried the @CAPS1 virtual trainer and found a new @CAPS1 appreciation for the jobs of our builders. That just goes to show that if @CAPS5 one does not keep such skills in check, they could in fact cause a serious malfunction on a construction site.   I, personally, find it very entertaining and at the same time educational to learn a language different from my own. In fact, I teach myself @CAPS4 at home. However, if @CAPS5 I did not have a computer at home, my studies would be near impossible. With @DATE1's economy, going to a class outside of school, or even hiring a personal tutor, can be enough to affect anyone's budget immensely. The internet provides an efficient, low - costing, or even free, way to help any language learner. One can even find study tips from native speakers or those who have already learned a vast bit about the language.   In @DATE1's society, not everyone has the time to go to the library and pick up a book on a country they are interested in. Some @MONTH1 say that asking a neighbor about their home can be just as effective, but that can be awkward for those that don't particularly do well in face - to - face settings. However, having a complete resource at hand can make learning an enjoyable experience. One can find blog posts about someone's visit to their country of interest and even videos of their time there. Websites made entirely for those interested in a particular culture can also prove helpful. On the other hand, if @CAPS5 someone were to be looking for an exceptional vacation spot recommended by locals, that information can be found as well.   Some people do not live in an area where they can connect with family by a simple call or a short drive. One @MONTH1 have to take a plane or pay a significant amount to communicate with relatives. Social networks on the web make connecting with loved ones easier and more affordable. The speed of instant messaging can make it seem like they are in the same room instead of across the ocean.   I hope that everything I have shared can serve a purpose to someone who has not been able to find the benefits of technological advances. Please do remember that technology can serve as a skill - maintenance tool, an educational resource, and a connection for our foreign - born citizens. Technology truly has the power to enhance our lives in many ways.
969	971	1	3	Dear Local newspaper, there are big arguments about if computers are good or bad. I think that computers benefit our society greatly. Why? Because it makes socializing easier, you can gain lots of education, and it also helps with businesses.   Wow, I can't believe how easy it is to gather people with computers. Computers are helping families chat with family members and friends chat with friends. It helps people socialize by eliminating the need for messages on paper that take forever to deliver and to get one back. Also, if family members go away on a vacation, you can still contact them easily. Or simply if a friend can't get a ride to another friend's house, they can still talk on the computer. Also, a computer gives you an opportunity to socialize with people all over the world. It's amazing how easy it is to talk with other people using the computer.   I'm really astonished by how much education we have gained from using the computer. Computers have opened up many areas to learn. Before computers, you learned about things from books, and many of those books could not teach you as well as a computer does. With a computer, you can learn about space, stars, and planets. Also, with computers, you can learn about other nations. You can know what their culture and landscapes are like without even being there. Computers have truly played a vital role in our education.   Computers have done lots of things, but they have done even more for businesses. The computer itself was a business, and people made lots of money from it. It helped businesses organize their work and money. Also, it has given people lots of jobs working on computers. Also, it gave businesses a quicker, more efficient way to put up products for people to buy. Computers have played a vital role in creating our economy.   Computers have made socializing much easier, enabled us to get more education, and helped with our businesses. This is why I firmly think that computers have benefited our society and will continue to do so in the future.
970	972	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 Newspaper, I'm writing a letter to you about how I feel about the effects that computers have on people. One of my reasons is that people who spend too much time on the computers are letting their lives pass them by. But the people who work on computers all day is a different case.   My second reason is that people on the computers can still interact with their family because they live in the same place. My last reason is why people want to spend most of their lives on the computers. I'm not talking about the people who work on computers.   The reason I say that people are letting their lives pass by is because if you are on the computer @NUM1, your life is literally passing by you. Because you are not doing anything productive, just sitting in a chair in front of the computer getting fat. Also, if you are going to be on the computer, at least try to find a job on the computer. But I'm not talking about the people who work on computers all day long, because they have to do it. It's their job. That's one of my reasons.   My second reason is that people on the computer can still interact with their family. The reason I say this is because you could be on the computer and still interact with your family because you live in the same house as them. Also, when you are not on the computer, you could be with your family and spend quality time with them. That's why I said that you still could interact with your family even if you are on the computer.   The last and final reason is why people want to spend most of their lives on the computer. I wonder about this type of person who would spend most of their life on the computer and not go find a job or enjoy their life. Also, if you have kids, you should have fun with your children and make them believe that they have parents who love them, that they had fun with them, and that they had somebody they could look up to. So don't spend your lifetime on the computer getting fat, not spending time with your children, and not making something of yourself. But I'm not talking about the people who work on computers. I'm talking about the people who don't work on computers.   That's why I said don't let your life pass you by. I hope you liked the prompt and that you won't spend a lot of your life on the computer doing nothing but getting fat and letting your life pass you. I'll repeat myself again: I'm not talking about the people who have to work on the computer. I'm talking about the people who don't work on computers. So, use your time wisely and make the most of your life!
971	973	1	3	I am writing this article to inform you on how most people are spending an excessive amount of their time on computers. In this article, I am going to tell you about computers and what people are commonly doing with them these days. Some people use their computers for business or work - related tasks. However, there are also those who use them mainly for entertainment and other social activities. These are the individuals who just sit in front of the computer all day long. What they could be doing instead is enjoying life, going outside to get some fresh air and sunshine. But no, they prefer to stay inside all day glued to the computer. Now, the reason why some people want to stay inside all day on the computer is that they are constantly on their social websites, such as @CAPS1 or @CAPS2. They are so obsessed that these two websites are extremely addicting to them. And then there are those who simply like looking things up on the web. Finally, just get off the computer, go spend quality time with your family because the computer will always be there. Use the computer only when you truly need to. Yeah, it's fun to look up things for entertainment, but all things are good in moderation. So, I hope you will listen and also agree with me. I believe I've made my point about how much you should use computers. Thank you for listening.
972	974	1	3	What computers stop you from doing is completing your homework in school. When you engage in something on the computer that you're not supposed to do, you might get stuck on a website that you can't get off your screen. So, what I'm trying to say is that you shouldn't stay on the computer for more than just @NUM1 minutes. By limiting your computer time, you'll have more time to focus on your studies and other important tasks. This way, you can avoid the distractions that the computer often brings and make the most of your day.
973	975	1	3	Computers are a common household item these days. Due to the wide range of functions computers are able to perform, most people spend a lot more time on the computer than they should, and it is having a negative impact on our society. Computers can be very helpful when trying to find information on a topic, but some people take it too far. Some people have jobs that are entirely computer - based. Others, like teenagers, will engage in gaming or use instant messengers, which sometimes takes away from outdoor activities. Another concerning situation with computers is that adults can get really into online gambling. Gambling is terrible for a person even at a casino, but now they can do it from the comfort of their living room couch. Computers can also keep you indoors, preventing you from getting fresh air and sunlight. Computers are bad in some ways but good in others. Sometimes computers are a perfect resource. For example, when your history teacher assigns you a @NUM1 - page essay on the civil war and you have no idea what happened during that period, in this case, computers are extremely useful. Or if your boss tells you to find the number of teen deaths in car accidents due to cellphones, computers seem like an ideal resource. So far, you've learned that computers have their highs and lows. But if computer time was limited, then people would be able to do more stuff outside, or read a book. Some people might abuse computers while others might not. But if computer time was just limited, I believe that a lot of things would be different in our society today, and people would lead healthier and more balanced lives.
974	976	1	3	Dear editor, I see that there is an argument between computers being good or bad. I think that my opinion can help your decision - making process. I firmly believe that computers are good. I think they are good because they help kids with social skills, they assist people with bad handwriting, and they help people learn about things around the world. First of all, computers help kids all around the world with social skills. They do so because there are numerous ways to communicate with people through the computer. There is instant messaging and web - caming websites. Also, a survey said that @PERCENT1 of parents say that the computer has significantly raised their kids' social skills. Another thing the computer helps with is for people with bad handwriting. It helps because you can go on Microsoft Word and instead of writing a great report that no one can read, you can type it. For instance, when I have a paper for school where neatness counts, I always type up my report. This can help a lot of people who can't write as neatly as others because on the computer you can change the font and everything to make it look as nice as you want. The last reason I think the computer is a good idea is that a lot of people don't like to read newspapers and watch the news, so they like to research certain subjects they're interested in to know what's going on around the world. I know my mom doesn't have time to watch the news or read the newspaper, but when she checks her email, the first thing that pops up is the biggest news of the day. People all around the world turn to the computer to find out the latest news. I hope you consider my opinion when you make your decision. Think of all the kinds of people it helps: people with social problems, people with bad handwriting, and just busy people who can't sit down and watch the hour - long news. Thank you for your time.
975	977	1	3	Dear Local newspaper, @CAPS1's opinion is yes, people are on the computer too much. I have @NUM1 good reasons why I think people are spending excessive time on the computer. @CAPS1's first reason is that people are losing valuable time. Second, they don't have much energy. Third, you're just spending your life on the computer. Keep on reading to understand why I don't agree that it benefits society for people to be so computer - dependent. People are losing time to have fun. They don't have any time for friends, family, pets, and so much more. It's mostly an addiction to go on websites like Facebook, MySpace, @CAPS2, and so on. People just need to get off the computer and have fun outside. Most people don't really get that much energy when they're always inside. Some people are always cooped up indoors and they desperately need a boost of energy. Fresh air will help with that. Maybe going to the gym or jogging outside for a while would do them good. Being inside isn't really good for you. Just being inside all the time can make you gain weight. And then you wouldn't have any time with your friends and others, especially if you're inside like always. Finally, you spend all your time at home on the computer. And you don't have any time, energy, and so on. You spend all your time inside with the computer. It's cool technology, but you don't need to be on it @NUM2. You should make time for friends and family. Now you know @CAPS1's opinion on why excessive computer use doesn't benefit society. People are losing time and everything. They don't have anymore energy. And they're spending all their time on the computer. Bye for now.
976	978	1	3	"Dear Readers, can you imagine not talking to distant friends, only knowing about your own town, or even failing to have a computer? I know I couldn't. Some of the great benefits of having a computer are talking online with friends, learning about new places and things everywhere, and being able to study for tests from the internet. First, being able to talk to distant friends and relatives is now possible with the computer. Facts show that 70% of families in the United States have distant friends with internet access, now all of these people can talk to each other! I'll never forget the time that my close friend moved, but I was still able to talk to him because of the computer. Second, the computer allows you to learn about new places and things all around the world. I never would have known about some of the places I've been to if it wasn't for the computer. National Geographic stated that the computer expert Dr. Jane Smith says ""Computers are the reason we have so much knowledge. Without computers, we wouldn't know about the places."" Third, it is now possible to study without leaving the comfort of the computer. Homework can be done on the internet online. I'll never forget the time that I forgot my book, but I could still study because of the online book. In conclusion, the computer has benefits to you, like interacting with friends online, learning about new places, and being able to study. Computers are truly all-around beneficial."
977	979	1	3	"To whom it may concern, Computers can be a great asset to our society, but they are an even bigger hindrance. People are wasting their days away on the computer. Hardly anyone goes out to exercise, or to enjoy nature. Perhaps the worst effect is that hardly anyone interacts with their friends and family anymore. If you don't want to succumb to the computers, put down the mouse and go outside! Obesity in the United States is at an all-time high. Experts agree that computers and other types of technology are to blame. People who spend a lot of time on the computer hardly ever exercise and that affects them negatively. These people have a shorter lifespan! They might not be around in twenty years to see their grandchildren grow up. Also, they have many medical problems. Dr. John Doe, an obesity expert, says, ""I have seen a positive correlation with the obesity rate and that of computer usage."" Computer usage can kill you! Obesity can also cause heart attacks and infertility! If you can avoid these diseases and health risks by getting off the computer, why wouldn't you? Using the computer is not a good price to pay for your health! Do you have fond childhood memories that involve nature? I know I do. Most people who spend too much time on the computer don't get the chance to make memories like that. They're too preoccupied with the computer to care. Many people won't ever see any of our national parks! Drew Wilson, a park ranger, says, ""In the past few years, we have had less visitors than ever before."" If people can't tear themselves away from the computer for even a minute to see the splendor of our national parks, there is obviously something wrong. Get off your computers and go outside! I share everything with my friends and family and try to spend as much time with them as possible. Almost all people who use the computer often say 80% of the time, they use it as an excuse not to see friends and family. In reality, they don't want to leave it. As a society, we are becoming too dependent on technology. A supervisor says, ""I have seen a definite decline in family enrollment. We hardly ever see kids with friends and family hanging around."" She is right. Now is the time to stop using computers! Computers may not be totally to blame for the problems stated above. Maybe it's the people, though computers do contribute to the problem. If we didn't have computers, there would be more people out exercising, and enjoying nature. Memories would be made when we hung around with friends and family. Now is the time to turn off the computer, and go outside. Call up a friend and take a stroll. When you do, know you can have fun without computers."
978	980	1	3	"Dear local newspaper, People spend too much time on the computer. Instead of exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with real people, they sit down and play games and watch music or movies on the computer. Therefore, I do not agree with people who say computers benefit the society. In cities like New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago, a lot of people's skin is jiggily and fat because of computers. Why, you may ask? People sit in front of their computers all day when they could spend that time exercising. My dad got extremely overweight when we got a new computer. All he did was sit and play games like Star Wars or Call of Duty. I couldn't believe how fat he got, so my mom told him and now instead of playing on the computer, he goes to the gym. You wouldn't believe how much weight he lost. Also, did you know that America is one of the fattest countries because people don't exercise and just play on their laptops and computers. So it would help America a lot to stop playing software and start exercising. So many people miss out on the beautiful works of nature. The cool relaxing air at the beach is much nicer than a dark stuffy room with just the glow of a computer. There's so much to discover, so much to be explored. So yes, you could find the geysers in Yellowstone online, but it's nothing like seeing it in real life. If there were computers back in the early 1900s, people would never have had the urge to find new land. You don't hear of many great explorers now, do you? I bet if everyone took a break from the computer, new species would be found or maybe even a cure for cancer. Who knows what you can do if you step out of the box and into the beautiful part of nature. ""Come down and talk to your grandparents."" ""Mom, I'm playing on the computer!"" How many times has this happened to you? Has your son or daughter been on the computer when a great-grandparent has been over? They may have wanted to play on the computer then, but they don't know if that could have been their last day with him or her. Computers will be here forever, or almost forever, but people's time is limited. Therefore, hanging out with a relative is much more important than playing on the computer. I know a kid named Jake who was playing on the computer when his friend called and invited him over. Jake said no. His friend was so disappointed and angry. I would be too. Would you like to have a friend pick the computer over you? I'd hope not. Therefore, computers hurt and are not as good as real people. In conclusion, quality time with people, nature, and exercise is more important than a glowing box. I hope you agree that computers do not always help society."
979	981	1	3	Dear newspaper, I don't think that computers benefit our society. I don't believe that computers can only be dangerous; they make people lazy and you can be easily scammed on the computer. One reason why I don't think that computers benefit society is because it is very dangerous. Computers are dangerous because people can get kidnapped or harassed. The town of Springfield police chief says that over 30% of kidnappings are from people that were met on social networks such as MySpace and Facebook. The police chief also says that there are many cases about people being harassed by stalkers or people trying to harm them. Another reason why I don't think computers benefit us is because you can be scammed very easily on the computer. 40% of people say that they have lost large amounts of money due to credit card scams on the computer. On computers, there are sites that will act as if they are selling you something and take your credit card number and all of the other information that you give them, and they will take your card and buy things with it, and you will have to pay for it. Credit card companies say that most credit card scams and frauds happen over the computer. The final reason why I don't believe that computers benefit us is because they make people lazy. Computers make people lazy because they are packed with a bunch of fun things like video games, and you can watch videos, shop, and you could see just about anything on a computer. I did some research and found that 60% of people that are overweight have accounts on multiple sites on computers. These are the reasons why I don't think computers benefit us. I hope you too heed to my advice and be more cautious about computer usage.
980	982	1	3	"In my opinion, I do believe that computers are good for you. I agree so because one, it can help you to communicate with other family members around the world. Two, it can teach you new languages you really desired to learn, and three, it can keep you updated on what's happening around the world. First, I believe that computers are good for you because it can let you communicate with your long-lost relatives you hardly see anymore. For example, if you miss any of your family members, you can simply go to your computer and search them up so you can type to them or talk to them through the chat mode. Then you won't ever have that missing feeling anymore since you have a computer. In addition, computers can teach you how to learn new languages you always wanted to know, like Spanish, or French, or even Mandarin if you wanted! You can just simply go to your computer and type in ""language of French"", and listen to what it tells you about French! Moreover, computers can keep you updated on what's happening around the world! It is way better to see it on computers than on TVs because computers give you more information about the situation of the event! Likewise, you could click ""locate area"" on the computer and see in which area the incident took place. You could also see the videos, behold the images, and seek the location of it on the computer. Sadly, my lecture has come to an end. Those were my three main reasons why computers are good for people: You can communicate with long-lost relatives of yours, you can learn new languages, and you can be updated on what's happening around the world. Wouldn't you want to experience those amazing benefits too?"
981	983	1	3	### Expanded Item 1 The computer is a great way to contact family and friends. People can send messages all over the world or just to those nearby. They enjoy playing video games or spending time on websites they like. People all over the world buy laptops to travel from one place to another. Not everybody uses a computer because they think it's not worth having, but some people do like to have one to send messages, hang out with others, or talk about how their day was. Many people want a computer, but they don't have enough money to buy one. Some computers cost a lot of money, like @MONEY3, or @MONEY2, and even more than @MONEY3 or @MONEY2, depending on which one they get. Around the world, many people sell their computers to get money to buy different stuff like shoes, clothes, or games. They often sell stuff on eBay to get more or less money. However, they can't take the computer back to get their money or to get a new one. People used to want the classic computers, but now new ones like touch - screen ones have come out. Many people have been buying them at @CAPS1 stores or @ORGANIZATION1. Since the new computers came out, people have been buying a lot, and the company has been making a lot of money from making the touch - screen computers. Every new year, the company makes new computers to earn thousands or a large amount of money. Companies all over the world make different computers to bring out new styles so people can like them and buy them. The newer the styles, the more money they make. Some people start their own companies to get money like other companies, but some of the money they make goes to the government. The money given to the government is used to take care of the homeless people. Computers are used for learning or for fun. People share computers with others; they can't not share it because it wouldn't be fair. Some people take turns using it, while some don't like taking turns with one another. Everybody can either share or have their own computer, and they can use it or not. They can't force the server if somebody wants to get on it. Some people lie and say they were going to get on it. People like joking around with others. Parents always say a computer is not a toy to play with because computers cost a lot to repair and fix. All too often, people spill water on them, and the computer messes up, making the people mad, especially if they just got a new one. When computers first came out, people bought them to see what they would be like. Many people liked them, and the news spread all over the world. People were talking about them, and the company made more and more until they were in stores all over the world. The computer became famous, and the company made newer styles for everyone. People bought a lot of computers every time a new style came out. Many people had @NUM1 or @NUM2 at home as they bought them. Some companies made other companies mad because they were making better styles. People were ordering online to get new computers, and the companies that make them are making a lot of money. Some companies stopped making them until they came up with a new computer that is the best one ever. When they did, the other companies were mad that they made a better one. Some companies joined to make one together.
982	984	1	3	### Expanded Item 2 Dear local newspaper, I whole - heartedly agree that computers benefit us totally. This amazing technology allows people to explore the world and do virtually anything. Also, computers are used for a wide variety of things. Last but not least, @NUM1 out of every @NUM2 households have at least one computer. So, computers let us do anything and everything. It helps most people with their jobs, whether it's in an office or a creative field. In college or school, it's an indispensable tool, and you can even buy a house or car online. It doesn't cost that much and is very useful. You can look up facts you need for a project or even play games when you're bored. It keeps us in touch with the world, no matter where we are. Also, many things in modern life require a computer. For example, in order to play Xbox Live, you need a computer with @CAPS1. Xbox Live lets you play video games with other people or even your friends from different places. Some homework requires computers, and some colleges are only available online, so you can stay at home and study. Anything you need, you can find it on the computer. @NUM1 out of @NUM2 households have computers, or @PERCENT1 of @LOCATION1 does. I agree that some people waste their time on computers, but without them, everything would be much harder. For example, instead of having to wait @NUM5 days for the mail, you can just @CAPS2 - mail it. Most people wouldn't have a job if it weren't for computers. It saves people's time and lets them do other things instead of having to drive somewhere to give a letter to someone. So, I think computers are a huge benefit. Like I said, you can do anything. Like @CAPS3, which is a great way to keep in touch with friends if you're on vacation from school. They are also used for several different things like downloading music on your @CAPS4. Also, it seems like almost everyone has a computer these days. If scientists are going to complain about computers, then why do they use them? I think computers are great! But what's your opinion?
983	985	1	3	"### Expanded Item 3 Dear @CAPS1, ""Computers are great! They do so much for my family and me. I can't live without a computer."" This is what many locals in the town of @LOCATION1 say. For me, computers are a place to have a great deal of fun with all the different applications. But they can also be used for researching anything you can think of. I also think that the computer is important because it is where businessmen carry out their work. My favorite part about the computer are applications like @CAPS3, @CAPS4, @CAPS5, and so many more. These apps are great because on @CAPS5, you can talk to your friends if you don't have a cellphone, or talk to friends that live in another state, just like on @CAPS3. @CAPS3 is easily my most favorite application because I get to talk to my friends, look at pictures of them, see who they are dating, and there are so many other endless possibilities. You can also play and download games onto your computer. It's always very enjoyable to do things on the computer that you like, and not have to research all the time. The second important aspect of the computer is research. Researching can be both fun and boring, depending on how you look at it. But researching is educational, and I asked a mother with a @NUM1 - year - old, a @NUM2 - year - old, and a @NUM3 - year - old, and she said, ""The most important thing to me on the computer is researching. It's fun, enjoyable, and most importantly, educational!"" The best thing about researching is that there are countless websites that have information for us to look at and learn from. People that work and have jobs are mostly the ones on the computer, and a lot of them are researching while working. People that work are basically on the computer @NUM4. Businessmen, designers, etc. The computers are mostly used by workers for e - mail. My father is always on the computer, checking e - mails, typing something for his boss, and even talking on a video conference. There are endless possibilities for workers because for some of them, computers are their jobs. Computers, in my opinion, are one of the best things ever created. They are the best because they have amazing apps for me to have fun on. But they also provide an educational opportunity through research. And they are great for people with jobs. I don't think there is any person that can live without one of these technological wonders."
984	986	1	3	### Expanded Item 4 Dear local newspaper, @NUM1 out of @NUM2 students at @ORGANIZATION1 say that they spend most of their time on the computer. I firmly believe that computers have a bad effect on people because they can cause safety issues, health issues, and of course, education issues. With all this new technology, teenagers are often unaware of their surroundings. On top of that, they're not aware of what's happening to them. Adults also use the computer, but not as frequently as us teenagers. It's time now to realize what computers are doing to us and the world today. Computers can cause safety issues. Nowadays, more than ever, people use platforms where they talk to friends. But what they don't know is that the person on the other side might not be who they claim to be. Lately, on the news, we hear of teenagers getting raped or kidnapped because the people they were talking to on the internet were not who they said they were. Bad people are always lurking on the internet, and we need to prevent them from getting in contact with the kids. Moreover, besides having bad people online, computers can also compromise your privacy. It's possible for computers to give out your personal information to other people, so we really need to be vigilant. Computers not only cause safety issues but also health issues. Computers play a major part in destroying our health. About @PERCENT1 of @CAPS1 are overweight or obese. TVs used to be the main cause for people not exercising, but now computers are doing the same. There are so many interesting things to do on the computer that it's hard to stay away from it. That means there is no way to break free from its hold. But you need to get up and exercise, and computers are preventing people from doing so. It's like it's hypnotizing us because we simply don't want to get up. Computers can also have a negative impact on your vision. I know that after a long time on the computer, I have a massive headache because my eyes hurt so badly. Also, computers can make people stop talking to each other verbally. Talking and interacting makes us have healthy relationships with one another, but computers again are preventing this. Besides interfering with our health, computers also have a similar effect on education. Computers can really be detrimental to our education. Students now easily forget to do homework. There are so many distractions today that for those who spend a long time on it, we forget to do other things that we're supposed to do simply because we're distracted. But even though we forget our homework, we also @MONTH1 forget to study before a test. This would result in lower grades. Computers shouldn't be distracting people but instead helping them. I think it's not entirely the people's fault not to get distracted on the computer because it just has so many interesting features. For example, the internet, and websites like @CAPS2, @CAPS3, @CAPS4, etc. We have so many distractions in our lives that we don't need more! Computers really don't have a good effect on people. More and more people get computers every day. They should know what it's doing to them and what's happening to the world around them. Why not go outside and enjoy nature? Maybe go to the mall with friends. There are a variety of things to do rather than staying glued to the computer the whole day. People need to stop being so dependent and open their eyes to see the effect computers have on people.
985	987	1	3	"### Expanded Item 5 Dear @CAPS1, I am writing you this letter to express my opinion on computer use. In my opinion, I think that some people use and rely on computers too much. Whether it be for a research project, talking to friends, or even getting answers for homework. Every day, millions of people are on the computer for hours on end. Moving your fingers doesn't count as exercise, and it wastes energy. Many people I know would be lost if they didn't have a computer because their friends are on it, or they need it for homework. These types of people need to be taught how to get things done without technology because one day it might fail. Some students rely on their technology to work, or they will fail. These children need to be taught that there are other ways to do things, like hanging out with friends in person, reading a book, and even doing their homework the old - fashioned way. Since students rely on their computers so much, they are always on them. Every day, people I know go home and jump on @CAPS2 for the rest of the day. They never engage in activities like going outside and doing sports. Many kids do not participate in any type of athletic sport. Obesity is a huge problem in the @LOCATION1 area, and the numbers keep increasing drastically. Everyone thinks that it is being caused by bad eating habits, but that's only half of it. People overusing their computer is also a big problem. Children around the @LOCATION1 are stuck on their computers all day checking messages and setting up pictures. While these children are on the computer, they don't even think; they just chow down on ""@CAPS3"". This computer usage problem is becoming a big deal with the obesity issue and how much people rely on it for basically everything. So we need to be the first people to stop this before it gets worse. This could be a huge problem in the future. So let's start to cut our usage time down now and find a better balance in our lives."
986	988	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, I think computers aren't good for people because they could spend that precious time exercising, hanging out with friends and family, and engaging in some good - old - fashioned reading. The first reason I don't think computers are good for people is that instead of @CAPS2'ing, they could be out getting active. You could hop on your bike and enjoy a refreshing ride around the neighborhood or even take your furry friend for a walk. Exercising might be hard work, but it's far better than just sitting there, staring blankly at your computer screen. Just because you eat well doesn't mean you're healthy. You need regular exercise to maintain a healthy body and mind. So, whether it's running, walking the dog, or going to a gym, choose activity over computer - sitting. Another reason I think computers aren't good for you is that the time you spend on the computer could be used to create memories with your friends and family. Let's say your family is planning a fun day at the beach. Instead of staying home to play games on Facebook, you could join them. When they come back, full of stories about the great time they had, you'll wish you were part of those memories. Now, think about movie night with your friends. Everyone is going, but you decide to stay home and webcam with your aunt. You've missed out on a great opportunity to have a good time with your peers. You stayed home both times just to be on the computer, and that's a lot of precious moments lost. My final reason I think computers are bad is that instead of spending time on the computer, it should be dedicated to reading. Reading on a computer screen is a far cry from reading a real book. Reading books helps increase your vocabulary and exposes you to different types of literature. Overall, it makes you a more knowledgeable and well - rounded person. When you're reading online, you're often just skimming through what people say, which could be just rumors. So, pick up a book and start reading! In conclusion, I firmly believe that people should spend more time exercising, hanging out with family and friends, and reading instead of being glued to their computers.
987	989	1	3	"@ORGANIZATION1, In today's digital age, computers are ubiquitous and have proven to be incredibly helpful. They serve as an information highway, seamlessly connecting people from all corners of the world. The new advances in technology have had a profoundly positive effect on humans globally. First off, computers offer an easy way to access a vast universe of information at your fingertips. @PERCENT1 of students at @ORGANIZATION2 say that when assigned a paper or project, the first source they turn to is the internet. As student @PERSON1 put it, ""The internet is fast, simple, and reliable when you know how to use it."" Children as young as @NUM1 are learning to navigate the internet's multiple online encyclopedias, magazines, news sites, and other resources to gather information. I vividly remember my kindergarten computer class, where we'd research dinosaurs and weather patterns on kid - friendly websites. And now, in middle school, we rely on websites like @CAPS1 Online for up - to - date and reliable information. Moreover, I've witnessed my mom, a nurse and hospital manager, use the internet to access videos and articles on how to perform certain procedures and ways to organize a productive hospital. The internet truly is a great way to have a wealth of information at the touch of a button. Furthermore, computers are an excellent means for people to stay in touch. @PERCENT2 of teenagers say they communicate with their peers using @CAPS2, @CAPS3, @CAPS4, or @CAPS5. It's a fantastic solution for our busy schedules when we can't always meet in person. Also, in this economic downturn, many families are facing job losses, which often leads to kids moving. Last @DATE1, one of my dearest friends moved all the way to @LOCATION1. I was heartbroken, thinking we'd never talk again. But thanks to @CAPS6 and @CAPS5, we talk constantly and have actually grown even closer. And it's not just for young people to socialize with friends; adults also use social networks. They connect for business purposes, discuss future deals or problems, and even reconnect with old friends they haven't spoken to since college or childhood. As you can see, the internet has had numerous positive effects, from facilitating faster research to reconnecting with old friends. Computers are truly helping everyone lead more informed and connected lives."
988	990	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, I believe the computer does have positive perks, but it also has negative aspects. Firstly, you lose interaction with people. Spending excessive time on the computer can take a toll on your relationships. If you're married, it can ruin the intimacy and communication in your marriage. If you have kids, you risk creating a distance between you and them. I'm not saying to stop using computers altogether because I use them myself. I'm simply saying don't let the computer become the center of your life. It's not beneficial for your social well - being. Secondly, you need exercise. Statistics show that @PERCENT1 of the people who are constantly on the computers gain weight faster. As a @NUM1 - year - old, I've noticed a little weight gain because of my computer use. Most people tend to munch on @CAPS1 while on the computer, and since you can't walk around with a computer in hand, you stop moving. This means you stop exercising. However, if you limit your computer time, you can find a balance where computers can still be useful. Lastly, your health is very much at stake. If you're at the computer for @NUM2 hours at a time, your eyesight will suffer. My eyes start to ache after just half an hour on the computer. And doesn't your head start to hurt when you've been at the computer for so long? Yes, the computer is fun and offers a lot of entertainment, but it also harms your health. Spending long hours on the computer puts you at risk of carpal tunnel syndrome, which is extremely painful. Computers are indeed fun and make life easier, but they have their disadvantages. You lose interaction with people, stop exercising, and put your health at risk. If you limit your time on the computer, everything will be alright, and you can enjoy the benefits without suffering the negative consequences.
989	991	1	3	@ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1, my name is @PERSON1, and I'm writing to you to highlight the benefits of having computers. I firmly believe that computers are a great tool for kids like me to learn more about the world. They open up a whole new realm of knowledge and allow us to explore different topics in - depth. Having a computer also plays a crucial role in helping people in need. It can quickly spread information about disasters or emergencies, enabling aid to reach those who need it. Moreover, it informs us about far - away places in the world, making us more aware of different cultures and events. I truly believe that if it weren't for computers, our understanding of the world would be very limited. Computers also have the remarkable ability to send emergency messages across the world in @NUM1, which can save countless lives. Some people might argue that computers make people spend less time exercising, but I think the opposite is true. You can find various exercising techniques and workout routines on the computer, which can motivate and guide you to stay fit. In conclusion, I am convinced that computers have a positive and far - reaching effect on society, enhancing our learning, helping those in need, and promoting a healthier lifestyle.
990	992	1	3	Computers are incredibly useful tools because they can provide you with almost any information you need. For instance, if you're looking for the phone number of a restaurant, you can easily find it on the computer. And when you're planning a vacation, you can quickly check the costs and compare different options. Also, if you're traveling to different places, you can go onto the computer, look for a detailed map, and print it out to guide you on your journey. However, computers also have their drawbacks. When people go on websites to chat, there's a risk that adults might be chatting with little kids. This can lead to dangerous situations and expose children to inappropriate content or interactions. In conclusion, while computers offer a wealth of benefits in terms of information and convenience, we need to be aware of the potential risks, especially when it comes to online communication, and take appropriate measures to ensure safety.
991	993	1	3	"Have you ever wondered what life would be like without computers? Some experts are genuinely concerned that people are spending an excessive amount of time on the computers. I firmly believe we should still use computers. Without a doubt, using a computer significantly helps us learn. The computer enables us to learn about various other places in the world. A high @PERCENT1 of people say they would love to look at the beautiful places in the world through it. Computers also can effectively teach you how to speak a language. @PERSON1 of @ORGANIZATION1 says that ""taking Spanish online helped me a great deal in her class"". Computers now offer well - structured online study groups that can greatly assist us in getting into a college. Many people would whole - heartedly agree that using a computer helps us learn new things. It's a well - known fact that you can meet other people on computers. You meet new and interesting people when you are on the computer. Most people really enjoy meeting other people online. You also learn social skills on the computer. @PERCENT2 of people say they learn social skills on the computer. People also can learn to develop a better personality because of its use. @PERSON2 says that ""because I got on the computer I didn't have the right personality at first, but now I feel like a whole person"". As you interact with people on the computers, you gain valuable experience. Did you know that a computer teacher in life would say if you need to use a computer in your future, you should be proficient already. @PERSON3 says that using a computer helped you improve your typing skills. Using a computer also helps with hand - eye coordination. You type a lot of essays in college too, so that can be very beneficial to you as well. So now you know that a computer helps you in the future. Without a doubt, people should still use computers as they are helpful in many ways. So what are you waiting for? Go out and turn on your computer today!"
992	994	1	3	"Dear local newspaper, Have you ever been on a computer for too long and haven't spent time exercising, or haven't spent any quality time with your family? Well, that's a big and concerning problem here in the @LOCATION1. In my opinion, to make this problem better, people should only be allowed on the computer for a certain, reasonable amount of @ORGANIZATION1 time. After that, they should enjoy themselves with a nice, invigorating workout, some time outside in the fresh air, and most importantly, spend time with their families. I think this will make the problem better, because you can enjoy yourself a little bit more rather than getting home from school and rushing right to wherever your computer is and being on it for the rest of @ORGANIZATION1 the night. I also think this will help the problem because it will also allow you to get better grades. If you're on the computer all the time and don't have any time to exercise, go outside, and bond with your family, then that most likely means you have no time to do homework. By not doing homework, your grades could go lower, and you most likely won't understand what you are learning in that class. This one problem can also affect you in so many other ways. The problem with computers and why people, mostly kids, are so attached to them is because of @ORGANIZATION1 websites such as Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, etc. Kids are completely @CAPS1 to them. This is part of @ORGANIZATION1 the problem because kids can't get off @ORGANIZATION1 them; they like it so much. This problem leads to the main problem because if parents say ""Time to get off... go get some fresh air."" the kid always goes ""one minute"", and the parents let them get away with that, but then that ""one minute"" turns into an hour at most. This is bad because by the time the kid gets off the computer, it's dark out, and they can't go run around outside. I think this is important because I think that Facebook and Twitter should have a limited amount of @ORGANIZATION1 time and should log you off after @NUM1 minutes. In conclusion, this problem is a national issue, and in my opinion, it should be a new law that kids have to play outside and spend time with their families before going onto any computer. As you can see, having all these great websites leads to a problem with kids. Thanks for your time in reading why I think computers are a big problem here in the @ORGANIZATION1."
993	995	1	3	I think computers are good, because some people don't have phones, so it's a really good way to connect with people you know, and also meet new and interesting people. Second, some people are going to college when they're done with high school. So you could just look on the computers and find a college you like, check its prices, and also find ways to get there. You can look up the college's location, transportation options, and more. Third reason is shopping. If a holiday is coming up, you could check online and find stuff that is both cheap and nice for you. You can browse through different online stores, compare prices, and read reviews. You could also order it to your house online if you don't have a lot of time to go shopping. These are some reasons why I think online is good. You can chat with others, find places and check prices, look for colleges, and also shop online. That's why online is good. In conclusion, computers offer a lot of useful functions that make our lives more convenient and interesting, so we should make good use of them.
994	996	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, I heard a lot of people are spending too much time on the computers and less time exercising, enjoying the beauty of nature, and interacting with family and friends. In my opinion, I think you should keep the computer because it helps a great deal for school homework or projects, talking to family far away, and finding new friends. My first reason why we should keep computers is because it can really help on school homework or projects. This is my top reason because it's really helpful and its useful when you need it. Also, if your computer isn't working, you can go to your friends' house and use their computers. When you're done, you can save your work on a hard - drive and print it in your school's computers. My second reason why you should keep computers is talking to family. Without the computer, you can't communicate with family as easily. In my opinion, computers are very helpful to communicate with family. If your phone is not working, you can also use the computer to communicate with your family. You can video - call them, send emails, or chat on social media. My third reason is communicating and finding new friends. Without the computer, who are you going to meet and communicate with? You can communicate with your family through the computer, or even if you're running late, you can send them a message through the computer. In my opinion, I think the computer is a really good way to communicate with your family. I know that people say they spend too much time on the computers and it's addicting, but it's good for school work like projects and assignments. Also, people say it's just to watch things on the computer, but in my opinion, we should keep computers because it's not just to see what's on the other person. It's to do school work and talk to family. I know people spend too much time on computers, but for other people, it's not the case. In my opinion, we should not get rid of computers because it's good for doing school work and talking with family. So, we should manage our time well and make good use of this useful tool.
995	997	1	3	"Many families across the globe use computers, whether they're from @LOCATION1, all the way to the deserts of @LOCATION2. However, some believe that being on a computer can have negative effects on you, like a lack of exercise. In @CAPS21 perspective, I can agree with that, but I truly believe that computers can have a positive effect on society if used correctly. With computers on @CAPS21 side, I believe there are many positive effects towards computers, such as: there are many things to do, you can learn from the internet, and it is very entertaining. If you have a computer, I'm sure you can agree with me that there are tons of good things you can do. For example, I know of many online colleges. Ever heard of the commercial, ""@CAPS1 in your @CAPS2's?"" that is where students can get their @CAPS3.E.D and have a successful career. Not only that, you can get great discounts on many items just by shopping online. There are many well - known shopping sites online, such as @ORGANIZATION1. Furthermore, many shops like @CAPS4 @CAPS5 have a catalog online, where you can shop efficiently. Lastly, if you have close relatives or friends that live far away, there are many options today like @CAPS6, (@CAPS7 @CAPS8 @CAPS9). Webcam programs like which allow you to see and talk to each other using a webcam and @CAPS10, where you can find your friends and check how they're doing daily. These are all good reasons why computers are a success in the economy. Some computers are used for entertainment. Online there are many exciting @CAPS16 you can play, like @CAPS11's (@CAPS12 @CAPS13 Online @CAPS14 - @CAPS15 @CAPS16). I play many of these, including @CAPS16 such as @CAPS17. I love these @CAPS16 because they are set in a very amusing world. You can watch many of your favorite movies and watch funny videos on the internet via @CAPS18. @CAPS18 is a world - wide used source where you can watch or upload videos so the world can see. A well - known @CAPS18 video is ""@CAPS19 @CAPS20 @CAPS21 @CAPS22,"" where a young boy gets bitten by his younger brother. This entertainment system is also a great way to use up time, like if you're bored. I can see how people can get addicted to it, but you just need to use it wisely and make a plan to use the computer maybe an hour a day. A computer also has many great sources you can learn from, like an online website that has fun @CAPS16 called @CAPS23. With this, you can play many fun @CAPS16 while learning about interesting facts about science. In @CAPS21 science class, we use this website many times to help us learn about motion/gravity. You can also conduct in - depth research on the web, which helps you with many projects. I know I use the web to assist with almost every project I have. In conclusion, computers offer a wide range of benefits in education, shopping, communication, entertainment, and learning. As long as we use them in a balanced way, they will continue to be a valuable part of our lives."
996	998	1	3	"Imagine your life without the benefits offered by @ORGANIZATION2, the computer. Do you think it would make life a little harder? Computers have positive effects on people for educational reasons and for a new way to develop @CAPS3 skills. @ORGANIZATION2 is very important to our society. Computers can help with our educational needs. When a school project is going on, more than @PERCENT1 of @ORGANIZATION2 students use a computer to access the information they need. I agree that students depend too much on a computer and not on books, but the computer has more information to offer than the average book. The computer truly lets us, as students, broaden our horizons. The @ORGANIZATION2 stated that ""nearly @PERCENT2 of @ORGANIZATION2 students learn something new from a computer that they did not already know."" In fact, in @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 @CAPS4, a student could find more information on a specific country than they could with a book. I predict that as a result of the informational access the computer gives us, soon grades will boost at least @NUM1 to @PERCENT3. In a survey that was done by the @ORGANIZATION1, it was found that @PERCENT4 of @ORGANIZATION2 students found more relevant information on a selected topic than in the whole school library. Next, the computer can help with hand - eye coordination for young kids. In school, students are observed to see how well or if their coordination is being developed. With @PERCENT3 of @ORGANIZATION2 students having very little coordination, computer games lowered the @PERCENT3 to @PERCENT5. The computer does help with the educational needs of students in @LOCATION1. The computer is a great way to socialize with friends. It is a new and inventive way to communicate. I know that some @MONTH1 say that there is less time spent in human interaction, but on the computer, it is still interaction. With a phone, you can only chat with each other, but a computer has a webcam. This device allows you to talk to people with some human interaction. Around @NUM2 to @NUM3 million @CAPS5 have this device to use. It is pre - installed into many @ORGANIZATION3 and @ORGANIZATION4 laptops, giving us portable access to talk. The CEO at @ORGANIZATION3 said that ""since the laptops have come with a built - in webcam, one out of every two that have it installed use it to chat socially and for business."" The computer can help with our communications for @CAPS3 or business needs. The computer is a good way to start and develop @CAPS3 skills. More than @PERCENT6 of @ORGANIZATION2 children use a computer to start with the beginnings of their @CAPS3 skills. Computers allow many people to interact with each other in new and effective ways. In conclusion, the average computer can benefit our lives in positive ways. From our educational needs to our @CAPS3 needs, the computer positively affects us in these two very important ways."
997	999	1	3	Dear Newspaper, Try to envision your life without computers. Writing articles on a typewriter or by hand would surely be a real hassle. The question of whether or not computers are beneficial to society has risen in the media, where they argue that people spend less time exercising, interacting with nature, and less time with their family. However, computers are a great step forward in modern science and are beneficial to communities. Computers have drastically helped out educationally at school, not to mention the easier way of connecting with friends and family. Also, computers have so many different forms of entertainment. Computers are a great step forward and are completely beneficial to our society. Firstly, computers have helped academically in our schools and at home. I can't even imagine the hassle of coming home with three assignments or writing two essays, only to have to write it by hand! Wanting to get it over with would only cause me to rush, resulting in a bad grade. Also, think of the handwriting factor. Most kids in my school don't have good handwriting, and I am assuming that teachers have a hard time grading something they can't read. With programs such as @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS2, you are given the option of different fonts, colors, bolding, pictures, symbols, and so on. Another way computers have helped academically is in schools. More and more teachers are using computers to help us learn. Tests are taken on computers, websites to help us research are visited, and other @ORGANIZATION1 programs such as PowerPoint can be used for a project. Computers help a lot in school, while helping us learn so much more. Computers also help with keeping in touch with friends and family. The days of short letters are replaced with long emails with pictures attached, sent in a matter of seconds whizzing through the internet only to arrive on your friend's screen. People can save money by not having pictures developed but instead having them stored on their computer, ready to print onto bond paper. There have been advancements in communication through computers. Things such as video chat (vchat) where you can literally see and talk to the other person, or just audio chat where you can talk to the person, have been made. Such easy ways of communication motivate people to speak to family and friends and stay in touch. Computers have made a positive impact on the community by having simple ways to talk to your loved ones. Computers can also provide a fun source of entertainment on the web. Websites have been created where you can play games, find people from your past, or maybe just look for funny videos. Anything you type into your toolbar instantly transforms into a page of links to websites where you can find details on your topic, or related things. One fun website is that of 'YouTube'. This website lets people upload videos. The possibilities are endless on the web. Another fun website is '@CAPS3'. This website is where you can 'friend' people you know from the past and interact with them. You can post videos, write messages and such. As you can see, entertainment is everywhere on the web. The time is now to understand the full benefits of computers. Computers are a benefit to modern - day society because they help academically, encourage you to stay in touch with family and friends, and provide entertainment. We should all understand that computers are a huge advance in science, and they are a great help, and also fun!
998	1000	1	3	"The effect computers have on humans is by far a positive one, and the outstanding intelligence computers provide must be embraced, not feared and avoided. Whether we like it or not, computers will be necessary to solve issues of the future. Besides, for personal usage, computers are highly beneficial. The main reason people fear computers is because of the dangers they radiate, which really isn't reasonable when analyzed closely. To not use such a complex and developed system such as the computer is completely irrational; the computer is the future, plain and simple. It is inevitable that the computer and technology related to it paint the picture of the future of our world. Whether people like the concept or not, computers will be a necessity to solve the problems and calamities that will wreak havoc on the world in time. Computers can predict natural disasters, and with that, people in the area of the catastrophe's destination can be evacuated. Lives can be saved. Computers can calculate pollution margins and provide solutions to the large amount of pollution humans release in the air and @CAPS1. In this way, nature can be spared. So much more can be attained by putting the computer to full use. People must adapt to @LOCATION1 technology, or we will fall behind and watch our @CAPS1 slip away. This proves the effect computers have on people is not only positive, but necessary to advance in an ever - growing world. Stepping down to a less global level of effects and to a more personal level proves to also be beneficial to humans. Computers in most cases do better work and create less error than humans themselves. Instead of requiring humans to work in dangerous locations such as deep water, computers can be sent down to visualize the previously unattainable areas. Also, faster communication is extremely helpful in certain circumstances, such as an occurrence in a workplace causing the area to be off - limits. A member of the workplace can simply e - mail his employer, informing them of the situation accurately and preventing them from putting themselves in danger, or simply preventing men the trouble of a commute to work. Even from @LOCATION1 to @LOCATION2, with simply the press of ""@CAPS2"", people across the world can be informed of the accident. Foreign communication, specifically by means of instant messaging, can strengthen our ties with other nations, in the fields of both business and government. Lastly, finding information is so easy with a @CAPS3. Where would we be without computers to find information rapidly? We would still be going to the library and checking out books, reading through page after page to find the information that would have taken less than even a minute on a computer. Even a person who initially disagreed about computers would have to admit that they are highly beneficial. As you can see, on even a less global level of use, the computer still proves to have a positive effect on its users. The one thing, especially for parents, that fuels the negative opinion on computers is safety and reliability. When these two topics are analyzed, it is so simple to eliminate the unreliability and danger of the computer. Installing a program, of which there are infinite to choose from, that allows ""good"" websites to be viewed, and ""bad"" or potentially dangerous @CAPS4 to be blocked. This eliminates all that is heard about online interactions and activity gone bad. Even without software to block dangerous websites, computers are generally safe. Only @NUM1 out of @NUM2 websites include content considered ""detrimental"" to humans. Also, of those @NUM2, @NUM4 provide reliable, correct information. Those two statistics annihilate the question of safety and reliability that some users come to ponder. That goes to show that the computer's negative aspects can be eliminated, leaving only the positives to remain. In conclusion, computers have a far more positive influence on users than negatives. Computers are the future, and have even proven to save lives. Why wouldn't somebody want to save the life of another? Also, the benefits of @CAPS3, or personal computers, are too large and helpful to pass up. Lastly, when viewed carefully, computers are very reliable and can be made extremely safe, which eliminates the main fear of computers. We have come so far to create such a safe, beneficial, and necessary device, we must put it to use and, by doing so, better our own lives and the life of @ORGANIZATION1."
999	1001	1	3	Dear Newspaper, I think people should use computers for specific reasons. One reason is that many people lose touch with family or others. Then, when you and someone else both have a computer, you would be able to see them. For other purposes like wanting to play online with fellow students or friends, then you have to use computers. Plus, your fingers get an exercise when you're typing. Many of us young kids say that MySpace and Facebook are bad places. Actually, it's not because most of your family is on it. Doctors use computers all the time to notify other doctors that something is wrong with a patient or to give a visual of the breathing. Workers even use it to see what's going on with the jobs, if there are any jobs open so they can take it. Students use it to show what work they have to do when the teachers aren't there. If I were a carpenter or a real - estate agent, I would have a computer with me. The reason why is that my group would know what houses are available to use or that are sold. Or I would give them different houses to choose from and give them a good deal on it. I would also bring a computer with me for GPS so I can know where I am. Many people use computers for different reasons, such as POG, cheat codes, @CAPS1 cards and other things. My reason for using this is because my work is important to me. I would do it on the computers if I miss it. That is why you should have computers all the time. You never know what would happen. In conclusion, this is why computers are very important to have. The reasons are that if something happens to you and you don't have a phone, you can use a computer. Also, it's beneficial that everyone has things to do, but computers are the best thing to rely on in various situations.
1000	1002	1	3	Dear Local newspaper, I think computers are great sources. They help us instantly when we have to find something. Computers are very helpful and they are easy to use. Once you have mastered the computer, it feels like you can do almost anything on it. Computers are great, but they can also have negative effects on us too. I like computers, but I am going to say I am against them. When people get on their computers, it's like they're in another world. When you're on the computer, you are a lot less social than you would be if you weren't on the computer. I don't know about you, but a lot of people are addicted to their computers. They get on and they stay on forever. They act like it is a necessity to be on the computer every day. I do not have to be on computer websites like @CAPS1, and here is why. Computers get really annoying sometimes. They distract people a lot. Like the other day, my sister and I were going to go @NUM1 walking, but we didn't go because she was so engrossed in the computer that she wouldn't help us exercise, so we shouldn't rely on it so much. In this economy, it is important to have social skills. Instant messaging people doesn't mean you are developing social skills. You actually have to get out and talk to people face to face. When I am on the computer too long, I know. I know this because my eyes start to hurt. This is bad for your eyesight. People sit in their houses and just stare at the bright screen. They may not know, but that is blinding, so they must
1001	1003	1	3	Dear Newspaper, People should set aside dedicated time to play with their family and friends instead of remaining glued to the computer all day long. By doing so, people would become more physically fit, forge closer bonds with their family members, and achieve better academic performance in school. It's a well - known fact that people will always get fit faster if they engage in physical exercise rather than sitting idle in front of a computer. When the computer is unplugged, anyone has the opportunity to step outside and engage in various outdoor games. When people go outside to play with their friends, they are actively exercising, which leads to weight loss. A significant number of scientists believe that it is far better to go outside and socialize than to sit on a computer and watch monotonous videos. People would be more active if they stay off the computer and venture outside, as it will keep them satisfied with their bodies and maintain good health, thus preventing them from succumbing to terrible diseases. There would be stronger bonds within families if people reduce their computer usage. Families would be more closely knit instead of growing apart due to the influence of computers. Your family is always there to comfort you whenever you have a bad day. They will help you overcome any problem so that you can keep moving forward. If you try to seek comfort through a computer, all you see is a person's face on the screen, unable to offer you a comforting hug. Without excessive computer use, you can have a closer - knit family that loves and supports each other. In contrast, with too much computer time, people end up driving their families away. Closer families also play a crucial role in helping children perform better in school. Families who stay off the computer and have regular dinners together typically have children who achieve better grades. Many scientists agree that kids who have dinners and play with their families get better grades in school. If kids can get better grades in school by staying off the computer and spending quality time with their family, we could potentially see great inventions that can benefit mankind in countless ways. All of this can be achieved by simply staying off of computers. Staying off the computer is an excellent way to benefit yourself and others. It would help people get fit, create closer family bonds, and produce more graduates who go on to achieve remarkable inventions. Just imagine what other positive changes could occur by reducing computer use.
1002	1004	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, In today's modern era, many @CAPS2 people have computers in their households, yet some of them disagree that a computer can be truly helpful. There are indeed some advantages to using computers, such as being able to search for a vast amount of information, learning hand - eye coordination through various games and applications, and becoming more organized with digital tools. However, it also has its disadvantages. For instance, children often spend more time on the computer rather than going outside, playing with friends, exercising, and staying fit. I firmly agree that computers do have a positive impact on children. Computers not only allow a child to stay in touch with their family members who live far away but can also assist them in completing a project more efficiently and quickly. On @MONTH1, it may seem that you are only doing one thing on the computer, but in fact, you can be uploading pictures and movies, downloading music, and playing games simultaneously. Now that I have shared all this with you on @DATE1, I sincerely hope that we share the same perspective on computers, recognizing their usefulness and the positive role they play.
1003	1005	1	3	"Dear The @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Experts often claim that computers are ""taking over people"", but I strongly disagree with this view. People have the self - control to spend only the amount of time they need and want on computers and then become active or spend quality time with family and friends. Computers offer numerous benefits. They allow people to learn a wide range of knowledge and skills. They also enable people to communicate effectively with family and friends, regardless of the distance. Moreover, many @CAPS5 people rely on computers for their work and jobs. I firmly believe that computers provide an excellent learning platform for people, including myself. You can learn a variety of @CAPS5 things on the computer. You can explore different countries, read the latest news articles, and even learn different languages and gain a deeper understanding of the world. Online, people can communicate with others in multiple ways. There is Skype, which allows you to have face - to - face conversations with others while on the internet using a webcam. There is also instant messenger, or @CAPS3. Using @CAPS3 is like having a real - time conversation with a person who is right next to you! Then there is email, which can be used to send letters, share photos, and leave comments. Many @CAPS5 people use computers extensively for work. Microsoft @CAPS4 provides a powerful tool for typing stories and letters. @CAPS5 people often create job reports on @CAPS4. Additionally, the internet is extremely helpful for work. Websites and search engines can offer a wealth of information that working people need. To conclude this letter, I want to emphasize that computers allow people to learn, they enable people to communicate with friends and family, and @CAPS5 working people use the computer for work and reports. I hope I have influenced you to understand why computers are not bad but rather a valuable asset in our lives."
1004	1006	1	3	"I casually strolled into my bedroom and immediately noticed the computer sitting on a wonderful desk. I couldn't help but think that computers are truly very helpful. There are many ongoing debates on whether computers benefit or do not benefit society. My opinion on this topic is clear: computers are useful, and I whole - heartedly support this technology. Computers are excellent tools that can greatly assist students with their schoolwork. For example, this year I had a science project about how my hobbies and interests are related to science. One of my interests is reading, so @CAPS1 I had to research how reading a simple book can be related to science. I went on the internet, typed in my question about reading, and within two seconds, thousands of search results popped up. I even managed to find some relevant pictures. A couple of days later, after I had handed in my project, I received it back. I was thrilled to see that I had gotten a @NUM1 on this project! @CAPS1 being able to use a computer really gave a significant boost to my grade in science. Without the internet, I probably wouldn't have been able to achieve an A on this project. As you can see, computers can be a great help to students with projects and other school - related tasks. Using this technology can also help you reconnect with friends and family members. In elementary school, my friend @PERSON1 had moved away to @LOCATION1 @CAPS2. I had no way of communicating with her until I discovered a program on the internet that allows you to chat with people. Both of us started using this program, and we've been able to talk for hours on end. I don't see @PERSON1 as often as I used to, but with my computer open in my bedroom, I can chat online with her almost every day. Computers can effectively help re - establish old relationships with friends and family. @CAPS1 communicating on these platforms is yet another benefit. Using computers can help enrich people's minds. For instance, in school we use a program called, ""@CAPS3 @CAPS4."" @CAPS3 @CAPS4 involves playing games that help you @CAPS3, and taking tests when you are ready. @CAPS3 @CAPS4 has been very useful in helping us practice for the @ORGANIZATION1's. After taking multiple tests in subjects such as science, math, and language arts, I now feel confident about taking the @ORGANIZATION1's and believe I will perform well on these tests. As you can tell, the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 tool on the computer can have a positive impact on your school grades. The impact that computers have on people is clearly beneficial to society. I think that more citizens should own computers because they can expand your knowledge and enhance your learning experience. I am clearly in favor of owning and using computers as they bring so many advantages to our lives."
1005	1007	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, Computers these days have brought about remarkable positive changes to all of our daily lives. People have been able to establish better connections with family and friends, and even have the opportunity to make new ones. While social networks are indeed great, computers can also make work incredibly easy and give it a professional look. They can also improve the skill of hand - eye coordination. But with all these benefits in mind, we may still wonder: is the computer truly a harmful or helpful device? Sometimes we find ourselves wondering where our long - lost friends and relatives have gone and how they are doing. Well, with a computer and internet access, you can easily reach out to them through popular social networks such as @CAPS1. I often hear from people that they have successfully reunited with old friends and relatives through these platforms. And not only can you reunite with old friends, but you can also make new ones with just a simple click of a button. Isn't it amazing how easy it is to expand your social circle and reconnect with loved ones now? Computers nowadays offer excellent software from @ORGANIZATION2 that can make creating slideshows, projects, and reports much easier. I vividly remember making a @CAPS2 with my best friend back when we were in @NUM1 grade. All we had to do was take the pictures, upload them to his laptop, and then add captions to all of the pictures. We ended up doing an outstanding, professional job on the project and received an A -. Although I understand that during computer usage, people often find little time to go outdoors, the technological advancement of computers can enhance hand - eye coordination. Imagine this scenario: You're up at bat in a baseball game. You have @NUM2 strikes and @NUM3 balls in your count. The stands are filled with cheering people, all rooting for you. The pitcher throws the ball, and with a powerful swing, you hit a homerun! Do you know what skill was crucial in hitting that ball? That's right - hand - eye coordination. So, while everyone is debating the effects of the computer, remember how effortless it was for me to complete that project. Also, think back to that baseball player who used hand - eye coordination to hit the homerun successfully. But most importantly, remember how easily you can stay in touch with the people you love most. The computer is undoubtedly a positive advancement in society, and everyone should be confident in its benefits.
1006	1008	1	3	Dear editor of the @CAPS1 @CAPS2, as you're surely aware, it's true that more and more people use computers, but is it really necessary? I used to use my computer all the time. However, I got into sports like skateboarding and snowboarding, so now I've distanced myself from it. Yet, there are many people who still use computers frequently. I believe that people should really try to cut down on their computer usage because they could start to gain a lot of weight, like @PERSON1. There are far better things to do than sit around on the computer all day, and it's good to be outside getting some fresh air. First, it's possible to become very overweight from excessive computer use. Being fat is not a good thing; it can actually be heart - breaking as they can't easily help themselves, and I feel really bad for them. I have a few friends who are overweight, like @PERSON1. @PERSON1 is a very overweight kid. He was about @NUM1 lbs when he was @NUM2. I haven't seen him in about a year, and we had some good times, but I do feel really bad because he is very overweight and it's terrible. @PERSON1 doesn't even know how to ride a bike, and nobody would teach him anyway because he doesn't have a father, and his mother is overweight as well, just as fat as his sister. So being overweight is bad, and sitting and playing on the computer will make it worse. Next, there are way better things to do than sit around on the computer all day. Messing around on the computer all day is like saying you're just going to throw your life away. Instead of being on the computer, you could be with friends, whether it's shopping or doing sports. You're still moving, and that's way better than being on the computer, trust me. Go for a walk or do something just to get yourself away from the computer, even if it's something a bit dumb but still fun. There's no doubt the computer can be fun, and there are many things to do on it. Most importantly, it's good to be outside getting some fresh air. Being outside is definitely an amazing thing to do. You could be walking, on a trampoline, skateboarding - anything is better than being on the computer. Even just sitting on a rock outside is good for your body because you need to get fresh air into your system. Just do something that involves being outside; it's so much fun. So all you computer lovers, get off and have some fun being outside with friends and your family. I hope you all listen to me and take my advice. Remember, it's very possible to get fat, there are way better things to do than sit around on the computer all day, and it's good to be outside getting some fresh air.
1007	1009	1	3	"Has your daughter or son ever asked you that they want computers in their school? Were you ever baffled when they said they were talking about @CAPS2 in the school, claiming that they can teach hand - eye coordination, give them the ability to learn from far - away places, or even allow them to talk to people all around the world? What did you think about that? Did you agree? If you did, then you're thinking about the positive side and not the negative. There are many reasons why I don't agree, namely safety, the money, and health. Many people say that it's good to interact with other people, but not all the time. If your son or daughter interacts with people they don't know, are you going to be worried? They can be asked who they are, where they live. Sometimes they're even asked if they can meet up face - to - face. My friend @PERSON2 said her school got those computers, and her friend @PERSON3 was asked to meet up with somebody she never knew, and she ended up saying yes. @PERSON2 says she never showed up. Would you ever want that to happen to your child? Well, this is only the beginning. Once your child's school gets computers, they will likely become addicted to @CAPS2. @PERSON1 said that ""if a child doesn't go out and enjoy their childhood but instead focuses only on their homework and just eats and stays on the computer, eventually they will become obese."" It's very important that your child does go out and have fun and get exercise because otherwise, they'll just be on the computers constantly. Have you ever wondered about that? Another thing is that the school will have to pay a lot of money. If your child ever damages the computers, then you will also have to pay a significant amount of money too. Not only that, if your child's school gets computers, it won't necessarily benefit you guys a great deal. I truly and sincerely do not believe that students should get computers. Also, your students' computers might get viruses because of inappropriate sites. Then you're going to have to pay for that as well. Lastly, the school will not have enough money for other materials. What will you do? Your child is not there to be addicted to computers; your child is there for education! Do you still support these computers? I hope not because there is a @PERCENT1 chance that they will or will not get @CAPS2. Hopefully, I've given you enough information about the safety, money, and health aspects. This is a very urgent situation, so please be aware."
1008	1010	1	3	Dear: local newspaper @CAPS1, it has recently come to my attention that people should use computers. My three arguments are that they teach hand - eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about far - away places and people, and even allow people to talk online with others. @CAPS1 teaches people hand - eye coordination because when people type on the keyboard, the more they type, the faster they get. Many people gradually gain more coordination. First, they get used to typing, then they start typing fast, and last, when they type fast, @CAPS1 gives them better hand - eye coordination. Using computers gives people the ability to learn about far - away places and people because they can search on Google for people and places. Then @CAPS1 shows a lot of websites. When they go on one website and type in a person's name and the state, @CAPS1 shows them the places related to that person. Computers give people the ability to talk with people from other places, like on AIM, MySpace, or Facebook. People can play games and talk at the same time. So the computer is very popular these days because of what people make their websites do. This is why I think people should use computers for a lot of reasons, like my three points. So, it has come to my attention that people should use computers for three reasons: it teaches hand - coordination, gives people the ability to learn about far - away places and people, and even allows people to talk online with other people. So this is why I suggest people should use computers.
1009	1011	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1, do you have a computer at home? Right now, more than @PERCENT1 of the people have at least one or more computers at home. Computers are quite common by now, but people argue whether they are really needed in our society. Computers have negative effects on people. For example, they can cause people to lose their eyesight, lead to interacting with strangers online, and result in a lack of outdoor exercise. Nowadays, one out of five people wear glasses or contacts, and the rate of people wearing glasses is increasing rapidly. Children and adults are spending too much time on the computer, which causes them to lose their eyesight. When people use computers too much, their eyes start to hurt and can also lead to headaches. These are signs of spending too much time on the computer, but people tend to ignore them because they want to get work done or are simply addicted to online video games. This shows that computers have terrible effects on society. When a person is on the internet, there are no real limitations. Once a person is online, there are endless amounts of sites to access, and not all of them are trusted. On the internet, where anyone can go, there are millions of people who are not connected or related. In other words, they are strangers. Interacting with people they don't know is very dangerous. Strangers can have a devastating influence, and there is no real control, unless it's a teacher or someone of that sort. Unfortunately, people can't trust anyone online because they don't know who the person exactly is. For example, on Facebook. People think their profiles are private, but everything that is uploaded or posted is public. Also, others will be able to view your profile even if they are not friends with that person. This is not safe in any way. The rate of people getting addicted to the internet is increasing as well. These people tend to not go outside at all and stay home. They get not enough exercise, which is very unhealthy. They also tend to get their meals from fast - food places, which are unhealthy as well. For this reason, people who spend a lot of time on the computers get fat from the unbalanced meals and never interact with people outside or experience nature. In conclusion, computers have negative effects on society. They increase the number of people wearing glasses and losing their eyesight. Second, they create an unsafe environment. Lastly, they make people have unbalanced meals and lose track of their diet. We should be more cautious about our computer usage to avoid these negative impacts.
1010	1012	1	3	Dear local newspaper writer, I'm writing to talk to you about the use of computers. I think computers benefit our communities a great deal. I feel this way because they can warn us about natural disasters, teach us about everything and anything, and allow us to talk to people online. In the next paragraphs, I'll share my thoughts on this topic with you. My first reason is related to natural disasters. Computers always warn us about them. For example, when Hurricane Katrina hit, computers were able to detect it. Many people were able to flee the city before it made landfall. Statistics show that @PERCENT1 of natural disasters are classified by computers. Computers save people's lives each and every time. Another example is with the earthquakes that recently happened in @LOCATION1. Computers informed many people about them in advance. These are my reasons for how computers warn us about natural disasters. My second reason why I say computers benefit us is that they teach us about everything and anything. We can learn about far - away places, new words, and things that are happening in our own country. For example, I had to research a person for a project. All I did was type in his name, and pages full of information popped up. You'll be amazed at how much information the computer has. It has everything you need about a person and so much more. This is my second reason why computers are helpful. My last reason is that we can talk online. Now, this has its pros and cons. Talking online is very fun. There are many websites like MySpace, Facebook, Twitter - it's never - ending. People can talk to old friends, family, or really anyone. But many people have to be careful because there are some creepy people out there. For instance, if you can't meet up with your friend, you can use @ORGANIZATION1 or ooVoo (webcam) to talk to them. The computer can be your friend, so you might as well make good use of it. This is my last reason for how the computer can benefit you. In conclusion, I think the computer makes the world that much easier. Why, you ask? It warns us about natural disasters, teaches us everything and anything, and allows us to talk online. We should embrace the positive aspects of computers in our daily lives.
1011	1013	1	3	I think people should not spend so much time on the computer. There are three reasons I think that. My first reason is that if people stay on the computer for a long amount of time, it can mess up the way you see. Prolonged exposure to the computer screen can cause eye strain, dry eyes, and even long - term vision problems. My second reason is that you could be spending quality time with family and friends. Instead of sitting alone in front of a screen, you could be having meaningful conversations, sharing experiences, and creating memories with your loved ones. My last reason is that people who sit all day on a computer gain more weight. Sitting in one place for hours with little physical activity slows down the metabolism, and combined with the tendency to snack while on the computer, it leads to weight gain. First, I think people should not be staying on the computer all day. Because it can mess up the way you see, this can happen because from you looking at a computer screen all day, your eyes can get messed up. I think you should never stay on a computer for no more than an hour. And sometimes you know you've been on it for too long when your eyes start to hurt. My second reason you should not stay on the computer for a long time is because when you are sitting there, doing what you are doing, you can be missing out on fun things that you can be doing with your family or with friends. But some people would just like to sit all day and look at a computer screen, and some people start not to like going out or even being a social person. My last reason people should not be on the computer for a long time is because some people will just sit there and eat food all day. And this will make them gain more weight. And this can make their life worse because now they are unhealthy, just sitting down all day anyway. And they should be going outside and running around. These are my three reasons I think people should not stay on the computer all day. One, it messes up the way you see; second, you are missing out on fun things you can do with your family; and last, people are gaining more weight when sitting on the computer all day. In conclusion, we should limit our computer time to maintain good health and enjoy real - life interactions.
1012	1014	1	3	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, Have you ever thought about people's views on certain technology? While some people say that others spend too much time on their computers and are wasting their time, I think computers can help us with many different things. They can assist with various aspects of our lives, such as helping with homework, interacting with people, and even aiding us in exercising. You'll find that in the end, computers end up being benefits for everyone. For many students, they need computers to help them understand their subjects. There are certain websites that offer comprehensive online lessons. Along with that, they have online books, so if they forget their real ones, they can still do their homework. My math teacher, @PERSON2, is always saying, ""@CAPS1 into the online site."" I've found that it really helps me when I'm struggling with my work. We can also ask our friends for help if we still @CAPS4't understand. That's not all we can do. There are certain sites like @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 where we can interact with other people. You can talk to them when they're out of town and have no cell - phone. You can also talk when the phone is being used and you have something important to tell them, such as helping them with their homework. When there's no telephone reception between each other, they can still communicate. Over one million people in the @LOCATION1 use these sites. People are wrong when they say it takes their time away from exercising. Many websites give good tips on how to lose weight. They show many dieting plans such as @PERSON3 or @PERSON1. Not only that, but they also have detailed exercise plans. It's not the computer's fault; it's the people who @CAPS4't ""stick"" with exercising. Also, the computer recommends many great gyms you can join, like @LOCATION2 fitness. @CAPS4't you think that's a good ""deal?"" @CAPS4't listen to those other people. Stick with my opinion that computers are benefits for everyone. They can help us with many things, above and beyond. I can't imagine life without them. Most everyone uses computers! Thank you for reading. In conclusion, computers offer numerous advantages in education, communication, and fitness, and we should embrace their positive aspects."
1013	1015	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, I disagree with those who support advances in technology, the people who think that computers have a positive effect on people. Would you rather spend your time on the computer rotting like a vegetable or would you rather hang out with your friend, travel to other places that you never thought possible or even go to a gym and probably lose some pounds? I vote hanging out with my friends! You know people who like to travel to far - away places and have fun would rather do that than waste their time on a computer. As much as people like to look at all the cool places that they check out on the internet; what's the point in just sitting there and watching the screen when you could get a plane ticket and fly to the magical place that you saw on the computer. Ok. I know that traveling to faraway places can be scary because you've never been to that area in your life, but @CAPS3's worth the try. You might discover new cultures, meet interesting people, and create unforgettable memories. Ok fine if flying is not your thing then why not try exercising. Maybe @MONTH1 you have been trying to lose some extra pounds. You could always give it a shot. Think about @CAPS3, my mother was using her efforts so that she could fit into a size @NUM1 and now look she is in a size @NUM1. Why bore yourself to death with computers that will probably give you the wrong advice when you could always ask a friend for advice. Yes, a friend, a live and breathing human being. Losing some weight will help you gain confidence if you just try. @CAPS3's just like @PERSON1, from @CAPS2 lower said, you got to want @CAPS3 if you want to accomplish that goal of yours. Everyone can go for that goal! Maybe you don't want to exercise, maybe you want to hang out with your friends and family. If you waste your time online chatting, how are you going to chat with the people that are right in front of you. If you can talk online then you can probably talk to people in real life? Right? Wrong! Some people can and some people can't. I am a very talkative person, but I know how to talk online if I wanted to, so why can't you? That's @CAPS3. The time has come to decide. Do you want to spend your time on a computer or do you want to spend your time in the real world. Get out of your chair, turn off the computer, get up. Put your hat on and walk outside and do something with yourself. Use your mouth not your hand. Talk to people, communicate with them. @CAPS3 is not that hard. Trust me. If I can do @CAPS3 you can do @CAPS3 too! @CAPS3's now or never. I choose now and so should you. Don't waste anymore time, go on a trip, take a hangout. Just do @CAPS3. Don't run back to that computer. Throw @CAPS3 out. You can live without @CAPS3. In conclusion, the real world offers so much more than a computer screen, and we should choose to engage with it.
1014	1016	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society and I am one of those people who does not agree. I disagree because if you're on the computer all day you'll forget about important things. For example, you will forget to exercise regularly. Exercising is very important as it helps you maintain a healthy body. It aids in proper blood circulation, strengthens your muscles, and helps you grow physically. If you're on the computer all day, then you won't exercise and develop as you should. Another reason I think it's such a bad idea is that you do not get to enjoy nature. When you're on your computer, you can't go on a refreshing hike in the woods, breathing in the fresh air and listening to the sounds of nature. You can't go on a camping trip, sleeping under the stars and experiencing the beauty of the outdoors. You can't do these things in the pleasant air of nature. The last reason, but definitely not the least, is that you will forget to interact with your friends and family. That is so important because a computer can teach you a lot, but it can't give you the warmth of a hug or say ""I love you"" like your family and friends can. Hopefully, you understand and realize my point of view. People should stop spending so much time on the computer because they forget to exercise, enjoy nature, and spend time with their friends and family. All I can say now is thank you for the opportunity to share my idea. In conclusion, we should limit our computer use to make time for exercise, nature, and social interactions."
1015	1017	1	3	Dear, @CAPS1 I believe that people shouldn't spend so much time on the computer because they do less exercising, they don't interact with friends and family, and it's bad for their health. People shouldn't spend excessive time on the computer. Otherwise, they won't enjoy their life outside of their houses. My first reason why people shouldn't spend so much time on the computer is that it's bad for their health. Spending too much time on their computers can strain your eyes severely. The blue light emitted from the screen can cause long - term damage to your retinas. Some people with seizures, including myself, would trigger an attack and cause us to space out. Spending too much time on the computer can mess up your vision or damage your body in other ways, such as causing back and neck pain. To me, that's very unhealthy. Another reason why spending so much time on the computer is bad is that you don't interact with your family and friends. Being on the computer all the time can make you forget to spend quality time with your friends and family. You would get addicted to being on the computer all the time. You would forget to say hi and ask how they are to your family. You won't spend time with your friends and they will start to ignore you and think that you don't care about them. Being on the computer all the time will mess up your social activities with other people. My final reason why spending too much time on the computer is bad is that you're not enjoying nature. You don't realize how much you are missing because you are on the computer. Yes, you can learn things by the computer, but you can also learn by doing it yourself in the real world. Being on the computer too much will make you not want to exercise, and that won't be good for your body. You would forget to at least go for a jog, discover new things in nature. You'll realize that exploring nature is better than just watching it on a screen. Those are my reasons why spending too much time on the computer is bad. It's not healthy. You don't interact well with your friends or family. Also, you won't enjoy nature for yourself. So just get off the computer and enjoy what life gave you. In conclusion, we should break free from the computer's hold and embrace a healthier, more social, and nature - filled life.
1016	1018	1	3	"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1, if you cast your mind back a couple of decades, before computers existed, what do you see? There were children outside actively exercising, playing joyfully with friends, and living somewhat danger - free lives. Then, the computer arrived. Computers are driving the next generation into a dangerous life of staring at an assortment of pixels all day long. Moreover, they are ruining any civilized relationships you had. I strongly believe that computers have a negative affect on society. Did you know that as the number of computers sold increases, the obesity rate has gone up @PERCENT1 since computers came into our lives? Why? Because people spend way too much time on them and not enough time exercising! Another consequence of the long hours spent in front of the screen is a decrease in eyesight ability. My family friend, @PERSON2, had to get glasses because his eyes were damaged by the computer. ""I'm worried about my daughter's eyes...she stares at that screen for hours on end!"" exclaimed @CAPS2 @PERSON3, a concerned parent at @ORGANIZATION1. How could something so harmful possibly be good for our society? Speaking of hurtful, the internet is very unsafe. Predators surf the web, looking for young, innocent people to meet and most likely abuse. @PERCENT2 of parents have been monitoring their children's computer usage, yet many parents are unaware that the internet makes it easy to talk to anybody in the world, from @LOCATION1 to @LOCATION2! Monitoring would also come in handy when it comes to inappropriate videos, pictures, and discussions on the internet. It is so easy to be surfing the web and stumble upon things you should not be seeing! Lastly, people easily get caught up in being hidden behind a computer and say mean, hurtful things that would never be said to one's face! These unfortunate factors cause many of the issues between people today. Speaking of which, computers have a very negative affect on relationships nowadays. As I mentioned earlier, so many fights happen through computer communications. Even if online conversations are friendly, they get people accustomed to making people ""@CAPS3"" through a computer, not face to face. After being in a computer - oriented friendship, people tend to forget how to act face to face and find personal meetings awkward. @PERSON1, an eighth grader at @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS4, ""I can't @CAPS5 only talking through computers, never being civilized with other human beings! Unfortunately, that is where computers are leading us to..."" @CAPS5 never seeing your best friend in person, only through technology! It might not even be your friend. It could be a dangerous poser! This is yet another problem...through the internet, you might not even know who such relationships are with! It could be fake, and you'd have no idea. Spending all day sitting in front of a computer, putting yourself and relationships in danger is, unfortunately, the effect of computers. Computers are not worth the terrible consequences civilization must face. I @CAPS6 earnestly urge you to stop the advances in technology now, before it is too late! Make the change today and safeguard our society from the perils of excessive computer use."
1017	1019	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2, I would like to thank you in advance for taking the time to read this letter. It truly means a lot to me. I am writing today because it has come to my attention that some people are saying that computers do not benefit society. Those people are very wrong! Computers are amazing! They allow easier research. I can learn about other countries, and I can talk to people online. I do all of this stuff almost every day! We're just finishing up a pretty big research assignment for English and social studies. It involved gathering note - cards from different sources. Luckily, I was able to go on the card catalog on the computer and find many books on my topic, just by typing the keyword! We can narrow down our options so easily because you can search for something so specific. After you find your topic, you can check and see if there's reliable information by reading a summary. All of this can be done in about @NUM1 minutes or less. This would be nearly impossible without a computer. I have a few relatives in @LOCATION3, @LOCATION2. A while back, my family and I were trying to plan a trip to @LOCATION2 to visit. We were able to go on a search engine and find detailed directions to their house from the airport. It gave us the directions and the estimated amount of time it would take to get there. I've also been able to do plenty of research on other foreign countries at the push of a button. It's so simple and convenient, too! My two uncles live in @LOCATION1. On Thanksgiving, my mother was upset because she missed them. I was then able to set them up in a video chatroom so my mom could talk to them. This is great; it's so convenient to be able to instant - message. I can talk to people all over the world and it doesn't even cost any money! In conclusion, computers are very helpful because you can learn about foreign countries, have easy access to research, and can talk online. There's a long list of other things that make computers great, but it would take too long to write. Thank you again for listening. We should embrace the many benefits that computers bring to our lives.
1018	1020	1	3	Dear local Newspaper, I think that computers have a good effect on people. My first reason is that some people at college are far away from home, like my sister. My family and I talk to her through the computer regularly. It's like she's just in the next room. Also, many people have an email! It tells them about sales at grocery stores or clothing stores and it saves people money using those coupons. Statistics state that grownups that use the computer at night feel more awake in the @TIME1, perhaps because they engage in stimulating activities. My second reason is that if someone is going on vacation or they are moving, they can go on the internet and find out if the place they're going is safe or if it has a nice school there. They can learn about the place and see what it looks like through pictures and virtual tours. They can also find out about colleges and see how nice they are, check if it's a small school, and find out how many kids go to that school and etc. My third and final reason is that when people use the computer, their hand - eye coordination gets better because when you're typing, you're moving your fingers and getting a feel for it. You're also getting faster at typing. Also, you're not just sitting there; you're moving your fingers and using your brain. Scholastic kids states that kids who use the computer and the keyboard bring their @CAPS1 up @NUM1 points. In conclusion, I don't think that the computer has a bad effect. After you're done reading this, I hope you agree with me that computers are a valuable addition to our lives.
1019	1021	1	3	I think that it is fine that people spend a lot of time on the computer instead of having time to exercise, enjoy nature and interact with family and friends because it is the person's choice to either stay on the computer all day or go outside. Computers affect people's lives in good ways and bad ways. People may stay inside all day and do nothing besides sit there and just click buttons. However, the good ways are that it educates you in many ways. When you're on the computer watching or reading interesting things, you could end up learning something before you learn it in school. It's good to go on the computer for a little bit, but if you're on it all day, then you could have no exercise and become lazy and fat. But if you go outside sometimes, you won't have to worry because you are getting exercise that helps out your body. I think computers are a great way to have fun. You can chat with your friends, and if you have a webcam, you can video - chat with friends. A computer is a great way for communication. Millions of people use a computer for working at their @CAPS2. Without computers, life would be ten times harder for people in this world. People like accountants use computers for their job. They store data into the computer to remember things. If you couldn't write it down on a piece of paper, the computer comes in handy. People also make websites on the internet to help educate. For example, if you type in a word, it could give you a definition. People also make @CAPS4 engines. @CAPS4 engines are some engines on a website that searches for things you type in. If you type in something, you will get what you were looking for. My whole point of explaining this is that it's the people's choice whether they would like to be on the computer all the time. Because computers and internet connections aren't free. It doesn't even do anything bad to your brain. It mostly educates it. People even go to school online; they learn and study on things that are on the internet. Plus, you could get @CAPS2 at places for working with computers. You could make programs, and anything you would want. So my statement here is that it's okay to spend a lot of time on your computer instead of exercising, going to see friends and family and enjoying nature. I think that computers are fine and it doesn't matter how long you're on it, it just depends on whether you're learning and not playing games all day and being lazy and getting fat. As long as we use computers in a balanced way, they can bring many positive aspects to our lives.
1020	1022	1	3	"Dear Local Newspaper: Are computers positively affecting society? As technology advances, humans are relying on them more and more; most people use them daily. I believe computers effect people positively because they help write papers, are a social tool, and are a big help with research. After reading this letter there will be no doubt that computers have a positive effect on people in society. My first reason why computers have a positive effect on people is they help with writing papers. Whether it is writing a resume, a science report, or a spreadsheet, none of these are ever seen nowadays done by hand. Everyone expects to see the flawlessly inked letters on the printer paper in whatever piece of writing it is. This helps the people writing the paper because writing takes many drafts to get the piece perfect; it is a pain to write each draft by hand. In addition, it is easier to read someone's writing when it's typed, especially when the writer has poor handwriting. However, computers help in more than just writing papers. My second reason why computers positively effect people is by being a social tool. Many websites online these days have social networks such as YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, and MySpace. In the listed websites above and many others as well, people can meet other people through other friends and games. The nice thing about meeting them online is that you don't have to plan a time to meet the person. When you are both online, you guys can begin chatting. The chatting also helps when people have long - distance relationships, whether friends, mates, or family. Online chatting helps people stay in - touch with someone they might not see everyday. That is a big help with everyone's social life, keeping us ""the "" @CAPS2. Online sites like eHarmony or Match.com take people with little time to worry about love and match them with their perfect mate. This also helps people who are shy get married and start a family. This helps people live happier lives, another positive effect. Finally, computers positively effect people by making research much easier. My dad always says ""You kids got it easy. When I was growing up, we'd have to go to the library and spend hours researching before we could write our papers."" Nowadays, it's simple. Using the internet and a search engine, all you have to do is type a topic and you can get all the latest articles in just seconds. Libraries might not have the most recent books, or someone might've checked out your topic's book. Then what can you do? The internet is also an extremely useful help when the research topic is very specific, if it's a certain bacteria or species that a book might only briefly mention. The internet has a much broader range of articles, so it is much easier to find information for any topic. With research taking less time to understand, people can spend more time enjoying the day, like playing outside, than in the library stressing because they cannot find a book on their topic. This is a strong reason why computers should not be seen as a negative effect on society. To conclude, computers have a positive effect on society because they help write papers, they are a social tool, and are a big help with research. Where would we be if we had to handwrite everything? Think about how many fewer friends or maybe even relationships we would have without social websites. What about how hours of research are now just two clicks away? Computers have changed our lives for the better, and we should whole - heartedly appreciate all they do for us."
1021	1023	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, I'm writing to you today to show how I feel about how computers have an effect on people. Computers have a very strong effect on people. Computers can cause people to gain weight, cause problems to their eyes, and prevent them from paying bills. We all know that we all gain weight at some point in our life, and we can lose that weight. But if you're on a computer for six hours a day, you don't have time to cook a real, healthy meal. So what do you do? You eat a lot of junk food, which is high in calories and low in nutrients. Do you really want to be the reason why someone is overweight? Picture yourself looking at a bright computer screen for six hours non - stop. Do you think that your eyes are going to be fine? I disagree. When I really tried to stare at a bright screen for a long time, I can't even keep my eyes open, and I'm pretty sure you can't say that your eyes are going to be fine when you've just been looking at a bright screen in the dark. Can you see yourself quitting your job just because you say you're going to work at home, but you don't do your work and get fired? Now how are you going to pay your bills with no money? Once your power goes out and you've lost your job all because of your computer, you have nothing to do. Now what are you going to do with your life? Well, that's all. I would like to thank you for your time. And I hope you agree with me for my three reasons: you can gain weight, have eye problems, and face difficulties in paying your bills.
1022	1024	1	3	"You are the @NUM1 visitor, click here to get your prize! That is a normal thing that will pop up on computers. These pop - up ads can give your computer viruses, and people can steal your personal information through them. That is one reason computers are bad. On top of that, ""@CAPS1, more than @NUM2 kids are abducted each day!"" says @CAPS2 @CAPS3 of the missing child agency. They get abducted when kids go on chat rooms and get themselves into trouble. They might share too much personal information with strangers. On another note, we rely on computers too much, and it's not healthy for us. ""Pop - up ads cause many problems,"" says @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS2 @CAPS5. More than @PERCENT1 of people in the world have computers. This was from a world - wide poll in @DATE1. More than @PERCENT2 of that number is kids. When kids are on computers, they always click on the pop - up ads out of curiosity. These ads cause catastrophic problems! People's computers get viruses, identities get stolen, and credit card information gets found out. Therefore, with those things happening, you are going to yell at your kids, but you can't blame them. They just thought they were going to get a free xbox @NUM3. Now that I have told you about pop - ups, let me tell you about chatting. Chatting on a computer is just a bomb waiting to be set off. ""Chat rooms are the main reason. Now that I have told you about chatting, let me tell you about how people rely on them too much. Instead of looking up what a book was about, just read it! Everyone thinks a computer is the answer to every problem when in reality @PERCENT3 of the things on the internet are false, says Technology @CAPS7, a magazine that deals with the disadvantages of technology. I remember when I needed to know if my flight to @LOCATION1 was canceled, so I went on google and looked it up. The website I went on said it was canceled, but later when I called the airport just to make sure, they said it took off when it was scheduled to! And instead of sending an e - mail, just send a letter! Do you want your kids abducted because of chat rooms? Of course not, and do you want to miss your flight for vacation? No, I don't think so. Computers are very bad and are used too often. No one wants their identity stolen because of some pop - up ad. We need to do things on our own more often and stop relying on computers to do everything for us!"
1023	1025	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I believe that computers have a positive effect on people. It teaches hand - eye coordination, gives people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allows people to talk online with other people. Computers are one of the best technology inventions yet to come that benefits society. First off, computers teach hand - eye coordination. For instance, if you're in a rush to type an amazing, long essay, you won't have the time to keep looking back at your paper, the keyboard, and the screen. So you would need to know where these handy - dandy keys are by coordinating your hand movements with what you see on the screen. However, if you had no knowledge about computers or where the helpful keys are, it would be a lot more trouble. Secondly, people would be able to learn about faraway places. If somebody wanted to take a nice, relaxing vacation or honeymoon with their beautiful wife, they would need to know the weather forecast so they would know what clothes to bring, and how much money they need to bring to visit all the luscious, freshest restaurants and hottest stores in this enormously populated city. Without a doubt, I would love to take a vacation, but if it's going to cost a fortune, I might have to re - consider this amazing trip. With a computer, you can easily research all these details. Lastly, you can talk online with other people. On blistering cold days when you can't go outside, or you don't have a phone to call them, you can message them on MySpace or Facebook as long as you want, as long as you have a @NUM1 and only an email address that nobody else has. Now it's time to decide! Do computers have a positive or negative effect on people? In my opinion, computers are great for society and we should keep having them around because they teach hand - eye coordination, and give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people. Best of all, you will be able to talk to your friends and family online. This is certainly a great form of technology that people should have.
1024	1026	1	3	"Dear trained @ORGANIZATION1 reader, @CAPS1! Ah, I love hearing my computer thunk on when I wake up. Such a lovely sound. Some people feel the need to disagree and say computers are bad for people. But, I feel the computer is a magnificent invention. All that typing will help improve hand - eye coordination. You can look up anything in the world, and you can even meet new people and keep in touch with faraway friends. The world is just a click away! What's this? You need to write a paper on how to play baseball and improve your pitching skills at the same time? No need to worry, you can just type that paper up on the computer! This is one of the many perks of owning a computer. Typing a paper is so much faster than writing it by hand. Studies show that typing a paper is @PERCENT1 faster than writing it out. Even @PERSON1, a handwriting enthusiast, says ""Typing is so much easier than having to write! I type all my books instead of using proper handwriting."" It's been said by officials that most hand - written lovers are converting to typing for better hand - eye coordination. If it's used by the people that oppose it, it's gotta be great! Let's say you're doing a project on panda bears, but you don't know anything about them. What do you do? Search it up on @CAPS4.com, of course! @CAPS4.com is a bounty of information, serving up marvels of links for any - and every - topic. I remember this one time I had a big report to write but I didn't know anything about the subject. So what solved my problem? @CAPS4! It's been proven that @PERCENT2 of information found on @CAPS4 is true. You know what else on the computer can help you with information? Just about any domain name on the web. Just type what you're looking for, add .com at the end and voila! All the information you could need. Hm, what else can the computer help with? I know. Your friend that moved away, you can send her a message and get back in touch. Or, if you don't like your friend that moved away, you can meet new people. For example, @LOCATION1 is a site designed to match people up for romantic relations. So maybe you don't like computers. Oh well, all I can tell you is that you're missing a lot. Great hand - eye coordination, magnificent information, and colorful people. Like I said, the world is just a click away!"
1025	1027	1	3	"Dear readers, many people use computers, but not so many people think the computer benefits society. Well, I do! I think this because the internet helps you connect with people you're looking for. The internet also gives you the advantage to shop online. If you don't have a @CAPS1 system, you can get directions online. If you read more, you will see why I support these details. Have you ever heard of @CAPS2 or @CAPS3? Well, in case you haven't, it's a social networking site. It helps you connect, chat, and find people you are looking for. I have a @CAPS2 and a @CAPS3 account, and they're not that bad. They're actually fun. There are games you can play, quizzes you can take, and you can chat with your friends. It's a great way to find someone you know in another town or even another country. This is one reason the computer is a good source. If there is ever a reason you can't drive to a store or wherever you need to go to buy something, you can shop online and buy it! You can just type in the address of the website and look at all the stuff they have and click what you want and buy it! They even have grocery shopping online. So next time you're really upset that you can't go shopping, just shop online. ""It might take a while to get your purchased items, but it's worth the wait."" Do you have a @CAPS1 system? Well, if you don't, don't worry! You can go online to a website such as www.mapquest.com. All you have to do is type in the address where you're starting from and then the address where you're going to. Then you can print out the directions so you won't be lost! That's definitely an advantage! So, don't you think that the computer is a definite advantage to almost everyone? Well, I do! You can use it to find people you need to find. You can shop online, and you can easily, in less than five minutes, get directions! That's why almost everyone should use a computer."
1026	1028	1	3	"Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1, did you know that two out of three @CAPS2 individuals own a computer? Computers are an incredibly helpful tool that brings benefits to everyone in society. They enable people to communicate with one another, learn new things, and teach hand - eye coordination and other valuable skills useful for school. Computers are a very useful and beneficial part of society. The advancement in technology has significantly upgraded computers, and now they allow people to communicate in various ways. For example, new webcams allow people to actually see and talk to each other directly from their computer screens. This amazing feature enables people, no matter how far apart they are, to talk to each other and stay in close touch. With my webcam, I am able to keep in regular touch with my cousins in @LOCATION1. Another common way of communication is through email. Through the internet, people can type messages back and forth quickly. It is very fast and easy, allowing people to talk to each other more frequently and communicate effectively. As well as webcams and email, computers grant people access to communication websites such as @CAPS3 (instant messaging) or @CAPS4. These websites enable people to message each other back and forth very rapidly and easily. It is not difficult to use, unlike writing a letter, so people can communicate more efficiently and conveniently. Computers are very helpful for communication along with @CAPS6. Computers are an advancement that could help people learn more about anything. For instance, they could learn about foreign places. All they would have to do is go to the internet, type what they were @CAPS5 searching for, and relevant information would come up on the screen. It would allow people to learn about places all over the world. Also, people can see pictures on the computer. For example, if someone wanted to go on vacation far away, they could type in the place and see what it looks like in detail. However, the computer does not just show places. People could also see animals, other people, the environments, and anything else they want to learn about. Plus, with new websites being created constantly, people could actually see what the earth looks like from space. They can look at houses, the wonders of the world, and much more. Computers give people the opportunity to learn about so much more. @CAPS6 more would help people, especially students, to have a better education. If you ask anyone in school, they will tell you that computers are a very useful tool. Firstly, it allows them to type. Students can type a project or paper on the computer faster and easier. It will also look neater and more organized. Plus, computers teach students hand - eye coordination. By typing or even just clicking the mouse, students are improving their coordination. This is because while they are @CAPS5 looking at the screen and typing or clicking, they have a sense of direction and know what to hit or where to put their hands without even @CAPS5 thinking. Lastly, computers help students because if they need help, they can just ask one of their friends through the computer. Students would better understand the content they are @CAPS6 studying, and when they go to school, they would already have a good grasp of it. Therefore, computers would lead to students getting better grades. Computers play a big role in society today. They are a way of communication, @CAPS6, and allow students to do better in school. Overall, computers are a very beneficial tool in our society, enhancing our lives in numerous ways.  ### Item 2 Dear Newspaper editor, @CAPS1 do you have a computer at home? @CAPS1 do you use facebook, @CAPS2, or any other type of social networking site? Well if you are like the majority of the respectable, caring @CAPS3 citizens in this country, you probably answered yes to both of these questions; and you most likely also believe that the computer is a great tool to teach hand - eye coordination, as well as an awesome way to talk with other people online. Not only that but you should notice the great potential the computer has for showing us distant, faraway lands and cultures. What would we be able to @CAPS1 achieve without hand - eye coordination? Nothing, that is what we could @CAPS1 achieve. Without the hand - eye coordination that computers and video games help you develop, you wouldn't even be able to go outside and enjoy a peaceful game of tennis, baseball, or even basketball. All because without hand - eye coordination, you are clumsy and your depth perception is off. If it weren't for hand - eye coordination, you wouldn't even be able to pick things up because your hands wouldn't go where your eyes were looking. Even though the computer isn't the only way to learn hand - eye coordination, it is still an important strategy that takes no extra effort to perform. If you are a social butterfly and love to converse with other people, then you simply must own a computer! Computers, cell phones, pda's - they are all essentially the same, and that's because they are all forms of a computer. When you think about it, our country would be nowhere without these spectacular devices. These computers helped to industrialize and grow our great superpower of a country. Can you imagine having to drive to people's houses just to talk to them? These machines can get our messages and voices to people who can be all the way across the world in just a few seconds. They are a great innovation in technology. Imagine having a paper for college or an assignment at work due tomorrow, and you have messy handwriting. There is no way you will get it done in time and have it be legible; and worse is that you'll be fired or expelled if it's not done. But your savior has arrived! The computer improves people's handwriting, speed, and research all at the click of a few buttons. With computers, there's no more need for long, tedious hours of handwriting or searching through books at the library. What would happen to us without this wonderful invention? The time has come for you to decide for yourself, @CAPS1 do you like this time - saving, teaching invention that you can socialize on, or would you rather go back to the stone age? In conclusion, the computer has become an indispensable part of our lives, offering both entertainment and educational benefits, and we should carefully consider its value in our modern world.  ### Item 3 Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, Computers are a great invention that we have created. Some people are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers instead of hanging out with your friends and family. Wait, I also agree, but spending time on your computer can actually be a good thing. It can be a good thing because you can learn something new every minute. You can also interact with your friends on it. Lastly, you can do things like stay connected with friends while also getting some form of light exercise, like using a stationary bike while chatting online. Every minute you are on the computer, you can learn something new! For example, let's say that you are on a gaming site playing a game and suddenly an advertisement appears. It will most likely give you knowledge about the product or service in the advertisement you are watching. Also, studies show that every time you are on a computer for at least @NUM1 minutes, you can learn something new during that time you spend. Another way for people to communicate is via the internet/computer. This way you can make arrangements easily, like planning a group outing or a study session. I know that spending too much time on a computer is not all that great, but these are just some of the benefits from it, so please consider this. In conclusion, while we should be mindful of our computer usage, we can't deny the many positive aspects it brings to our lives, such as learning and social interaction.  ### Item 4 Dear @CAPS1, I believe that computers have a good and a bad effect on people. Even though I think it has both effects on people, I think that it has a better effect. I think this because the internet gives people the chance to learn more about other places. It allows people to talk to family that lives far away, and it also helps to make new friends. I support the advances of technology. I support it because people can talk to their family that they can't get to see. I have three cousins that live in @LOCATION1 that I never get to see, but with computers, I can talk to them all the time. We can email and @CAPS2 to chat with each other to find out what they've been doing, how school is going, and so much more. My aunty loves to send and get pictures from them to see how much they've changed since the last time we saw them. Without the new technology, we wouldn't be able to do that. Computers also help learn about other countries and the people that live there. With the internet, you can find what the country looks like, what types of food they eat, what type of language they speak, and so much more. Recently, I had to do a project in @CAPS3 @CAPS4 about a place in @LOCATION2. I got @LOCATION4, @LOCATION3. With the help of computers, I found out so much more about the country that I never even knew about. There were so many great places to visit and learn about the history of @LOCATION4. Learning so much about the place makes me want to visit there someday. Without computers, I never would have learned so much about that place. Another great thing about the new technology is that we can make new friends and talk to different types of people from all over the world. I read recently in the @CAPS5 @CAPS6 that at least @PERCENT1 of kids have a myspace or facebook that helps them interact with people from all over the world. There can also be dangers to talking to people you've never met before. To be safe, don't tell people your phone number or where you live. But meeting new people can also be good. For example, my cousin doesn't get along very well with the people she goes to school with. But after school, she goes on her computer and talks to people that are just like her. Either way, she should be careful. In conclusion, I must say once again that I support the advances of technology to an extent. Computers help you talk to family that you don't see, helps you learn about new countries, and meet new people. Overall, the positive impacts of computers on our lives far outweigh the potential risks when used responsibly.  ### Item 5 Computers and other devices are good for humans, especially young people like myself, because they are good for communication, keeping the attention of the user, and providing unknown information. In @CAPS3 letter, I will explain. Communication is key, and technology is close to the best and fastest way to use communication. Cell phones provide calling usage, of course, but they also allow you to text someone. If you have dinner with friends and you're late, with text, you can send them a message and they should get it in no time at all. Email allows you to do the same as text, but you can write longer messages in more detail. Something that's really good for communicating is video chat. If you have a relative that you haven't seen in a long time, you can video chat and they can see you and you can see them clearly. It's like talking to one another in person. Keeping a person's attention is critical. Technology does that with games, music from @NUM1's, computers, game systems, and the newest way, iPod's, and also by providing instructions on how to do something. Of course, a teacher or parents can do that, but having or seeing instructions on a computer is so much more exciting, which brings me back to @CAPS3 topic of keeping a person's attention. Technological devices are more exciting than people, teachers, and definitely parents. But do they offer more? Information is most likely the most frequent reason in which technology is used. If a child has a project for school, they either use the computers or ask their parents. If the parents have no idea about the question their child just asked, they say, ""@CAPS1 it up on the computer"", if you haven't already done that. So in a way, the human race depends on technology. Actually, we do depend on technology. Computers, cellphones, iPods, game systems, etc., all include a little thing I'd like to call the internet. The internet has been around for a while, going from extremely slow to high - speed, and it is a magical place. It can provide you with directions, recipes, job offers, store locations, show times for movies, and much, much more. Although technology is used in everyday life from communication to searching for information, it can slowly slow us, the human race, down. I mean most of us spend most of our time on @CAPS2 or @CAPS3 @CAPS4 when we should be walking around or exercising, looking at the trees and the birds, and communicating with family face to face. Therefore, computers and other things are nice and all, but are they worth getting fat or losing touch with your loved ones? In conclusion, while computers and other technological devices offer numerous benefits, we need to strike a balance between using them and engaging in real - world activities to maintain our physical health and social connections."

1031	1033	1	3	"Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 technology has grown exponentially during the last few years. The use of computers, especially, has sky-rocketed. However, I believe this is not something to be excited about. The constant use of computers can affect people's health, relationships with family and friends, and their appreciation of nature. The over - usage of computers is a huge problem. Have you ever sat in front of a computer screen for hours on end? If so, you know the feeling of sleepiness and irritability. The lack of physical activity while using a computer impacts people more than they realize. Excessive use of computers has been linked to obesity and high blood pressure. As people spend more time on the computer, their blood pressure tends to rise. Just sitting in front of a screen is extremely harmful to people's bodies. To stay healthy, one should only use the computer when it's absolutely necessary. Spending too much time on the computer can isolate people from others. In this generation, adolescents especially, use the computer to communicate with others more than having face - to - face conversations. Communicating only over the computer can lead to social isolation. Not to mention how quickly rumors and secrets spread over the internet. Using the computer can ruin relationships, even those within a family. Neglecting family by being constantly on the computer can drive people apart. Families can seem less important. People can't focus on their families while being engrossed in a computer screen. Computers are creating false substitutes for almost everything, even nature. Humans originally lived in the wild, gathering food from the land and replanting. Our connection with nature was strong as we needed it to survive. Nowadays, instead of listening to the sound of rain and the rustling of dry leaves, people prefer the high - pitched artificial beeping and the classic ""You've got mail."" People no longer appreciate nature as they used to. The beauty of nature is simply overlooked as if it's nothing special. Well, without nature, we wouldn't be alive. Life cannot exist without something to thrive on. We can either hop on our computers and look at pictures of nature on @ORGANIZATION1.com, or we can put on our shoes and experience it firsthand. No one can truly experience the greatness of nature while on the computer. No one can feel the cool lake water sliding over their skin or the warmth of a hot @DATE1 day while emailing a friend. It's impossible. Computers have robbed us of our ability to fully experience life. In conclusion, computers are harmful to people. They can affect health, relationships with friends and family, and appreciation of nature. We must use computers only when necessary in order to stay healthy. Instead of going online, go outside and embrace the real world."
1032	1034	1	3	I support advances in technology because in the future, our world will be run by computers. People can learn about places and people that they could never afford to visit in person, and this technology helps to connect people without the need for direct face - to - face communication. Have you ever thought about the future? I know I have, and usually when one thinks of the future, images of automated things and fewer human - to - human interactions come to mind. The fact is, the world is becoming increasingly technology - driven. As we, the people, become more intelligent, so does the technology. So, what good will the future be if none of us know how to operate a simple piece of technology like a computer? How will we be able to use the more complex things then? Believe it or not, within @NUM1 years, our world will be almost entirely computer - run. You won't have to do much but command it. Without computers, how would we know all the things we know today? How would people know what Egypt looked like @NUM2 years ago? They don't have to be there; they can just look it up on the computer and learn as much about it as if they had visited. Also, computers enable us to learn about people who lived before our time. For example, if you want to know something about a past president, how would you find out? After the advent of computers, you can easily look it up instead of going to a library. Thanks to computers in today's society, our average person has access to a vast amount of knowledge. I can understand why some experts are concerned. However, for some people, computers are the only means of connecting with their family and friends. Suppose there is a family member living in a different country, and they want to talk to you. How would you go about it? I know I would try to contact them on the computer. I have friends who live out of state, and I enjoy talking to them. If we didn't have the computers we do, would we really drive across the country to talk to them? That seems extremely time - consuming and pointless. In conclusion, I hope you agree with me that keeping technology in our lives is important. It is essential for the future, allowing people to learn new things about places and people, and to communicate with friends and family. Although I can see your point that kids are not getting enough exercise, most kids who use computers are also involved in sports.
1033	1035	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 - in - @CAPS2, Computers are very helpful tools in today's society and culture. They build cognitive skills and offer a vast wealth of knowledge. I want you to understand all the benefits a computer provides. First off, computers enhance our hand - eye coordination skills. When typing, we look at the screen while using our hands to type. This becomes almost second - nature after a period of time, which is proof that it is helping with this cognitive skill. Having good hand - eye coordination is a critical part of many daily activities, such as driving and various tasks we perform throughout the day. Also, you must consider the near - infinite amount of knowledge available on this tool. You can learn just about anything on the internet, and most of it is absolutely free. In fact, on websites like @CAPS3 alone, you can find a webpage dedicated to just about any topic. Contrary to the counter - arguments' belief, a computer can actually aid in our social life. With instant messengers like @CAPS4 and @ORGANIZATION1, you can converse with people around the world in real - time. Social networks like @CAPS5 allow you to keep your friends updated on what you are doing. Please take my letter into account and publish it in your editorial. I believe computers help us with cognitive skills, learning, and socializing. Thank you for your time. In summary, computers are valuable assets in our lives, contributing to our mental development, knowledge acquisition, and social connections. We should embrace their use and recognize the positive impact they have.
1034	1036	1	3	Dear the @CAPS1 of the @ORGANIZATION1, Some people say that computers are a negative contributor to society. In @CAPS3's opinion, computers have a positive impact on the world around us. I believe @CAPS4 gives people hand - eye coordination and a way to be organized. Not only that, but people are still interacting with others. If you don't believe me now, read @CAPS3's details and you'll feel the same way I do. When you consider @CAPS4, computers give us hand - eye coordination. There's no way to use a computer without typing. Whether you're just typing in a short password or a @NUM1 - page essay, you'll always have to type, and when you do, @CAPS4 allows for better movement of your hands. This can later help you in sports when you go out and exercise. Since computers have become so popular, I think that in the future, typing or using a computer will be a common skill, perhaps even part of the @CAPS2. This could be due to the hand - eye coordination @CAPS4 gives. @CAPS3's theory is that whatever you think, you type. In addition to hand - eye coordination, computers provide organization, which is a big concern in present - day life. Do you have picture files scattered around your house? Well, there's no need for that. With computers, you can store all your files neatly. You can easily back them up and find everything. Even doctors are using computers to manage your medical needs and save time. Computers can bring order to our lives. Furthermore, computers continue to help us stay connected with friends and family. I can talk with friends or family who are far away. @CAPS4 keeps us together. I'm not saying that @CAPS4 is always a good thing, because we all need face - to - face interaction. However, when you aren't able to get that, it's a good way to communicate. To conclude, computers positively affect our lives. We're able to gain hand - eye coordination, stay organized, and @CAPS4 can bring people together when they aren't in person. You can learn about new things like people and places far away. Though some people @MONTH1 think the opposite of me, I know that computers benefit society. In the end, we should recognize and appreciate the many advantages that computers bring to our daily lives.
1035	1037	1	3	Dear editor of @ORGANIZATION1, I am writing this letter to you because I think people are not getting enough exercise since they spend so much time on the computer and visit various websites. Here are some things that I want you to write about so people can become and remain aware. My first reason is that when so many people spend a large amount of time on the computer, they don't get enough physical activity. They don't walk; they just sit and message their friends all day. They don't worry that they are gaining weight and putting extra stress on their heart because of the inactivity. As a result, it can lead to health problems. You won't be able to do things you used to do easily. My second reason is that some websites can have a negative influence on kids. Kids may see things they are not supposed to see when they have free access to the computer. These inappropriate sites, such as gun - related sites, can expose kids to things that can make them do something that might really hurt someone or maybe even themselves. Kids try to imitate how people talk on these websites, and they may use language and learn behaviors that are not suitable for their age. They can be exposed to @NUM1 harmful things on these @CAPS16 sites. My third reason is that chat sites can be places where people seek attention in the wrong way. They may say things they are not supposed to. For example, a @NUM2 - year - old may engage in inappropriate conversations. Here are some things you can write about, and please monitor these issues as much as you can to prevent such problems. In conclusion, the over - use of computers and access to certain websites are causing significant problems in terms of health, the well - being of kids, and inappropriate social behavior. We need to be more vigilant and take steps to address these issues.
1036	1038	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2, imagine a world without computers. I picture it as a far better place. Why wouldn't you want to make the world a better place? Computers can be helpful for work and business, but young children are losing precious time to exercise, enjoy nature, and interact with family and friends. What do you prefer, having computers or not having them? In my opinion, people would be much better off without them. Lack of exercise is brought up countless times in society. Computers are one factor to blame, especially with the @LOCATION1 already being one of the most obese countries in the world. Who would want to add to this catastrophe? If the number of computers used in each household increases, the number of obese people in @LOCATION2 will also rise. If computers take away time for exercise, health issues will occur more often and at a younger age. Dr. @PERSON1 says, ""If kids are spending more of their free time on the computer rather than being active, the risk of diabetes will increase for them."" @CAPS3, it is also a possible result of less exercise. Older citizens will be a big target for a heart attack. It is said that five out of six people could have stopped a heart attack just by taking some time out of their day to go to the gym or take a walk. No one should sacrifice exercise for playing virtual games and instant messaging on the internet. Less people get a chance to enjoy nature when they are on the computer all day. If more people cared for nature, then global warming would not be such a big issue. In my opinion, the citizens of @LOCATION2 would want to keep it cleaner and be more in tune with it. If more people cared about nature and enjoyed it, wildlife would not be taken away from animals. People would put an end to what some people and companies are doing to nature. Lastly, when you're on your computer all day, you don't realize what nature has to offer, like fresh air and animals. Or the endless canyons. People need to enjoy nature more; computers should not be in their way. Wouldn't most people think that their relationships with family members and friends could be a lot stronger if they interacted and spent time with them instead of with their computer? @CAPS2, think about how much a dinner conversation and family party could improve if people were closer with their family. Plus, people need family. Your computer can't get you through the emotional pain of losing a loved one. @PERCENT1 of people can get through difficult and stressful times with family. Last but not least, your social life could improve if people weren't on the computer all day. Not interacting with people could turn you antisocial and not fun to be around. No one wants to be that way. Also, your computer might not be working all the time, but your family and friends always will be there. The world would truly be better off without computers. I think everyone who sits in their room on the computer could change their exercise habits, their appreciation for nature, and also their family and friend relationships by getting off it and doing things that they will actually benefit from. There is no real need for a computer in your life, but I can't speak for everyone. The question then is, do we stop using computers or do we turn them off for good?"
1037	1039	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, Some parents are really concerned about their child being on the computer all the time. Now, I'm going to talk about @NUM1 good things about computers, @NUM1 bad things, and @NUM1 things on what you should do. One great good thing is that you get to talk to people. You could talk to your friends online about something that happened in school or whatever. That's really good because what if you forgot what the homework was or you need help on something, you could go online and ask them right away. Another reason why it's good is that you get to meet @ORGANIZATION1 people. For example, on @CAPS1 or facebook. When you meet @ORGANIZATION1 people online, they mostly come from a different country that you may have never heard about before, and then you just learn something new and interesting about @ORGANIZATION1 and you have a friend from @ORGANIZATION3, @CAPS2, or @LOCATION1. One more good thing there is, is that you can learn @ORGANIZATION1 things online about anything. It could be a @ORGANIZATION1 website that you never knew existed and something that can really help you in the future. For example, @ORGANIZATION2. @ORGANIZATION2 could be extremely helpful to you. Now, we're going to talk about @NUM1 bad things that computers do. The first bad thing that computers do is that they make you addicted. For example, me, I got addicted when I had a computer, but now I'm not. We got rid of ours, and now I just play with my sisters. The second bad thing is viruses. My grandmother's computer got a virus off of a website, and that website was @CAPS1. When you get a virus, it's really annoying. You can't do anything or you can't look anything up for school. Getting viruses is not cool at all. You have to wait a week or so before they fix it. The last bad thing is that you never want to spend time with your family. I know some people who do that, and it's not cool. If company comes over, you should get off the computer. Since I don't have much time left, I'm going to talk about one thing you should do. You should set a certain amount of time on the computer and then go have fun and do what you want to do, except go on the computer. That's what I think you should do for now. In conclusion, computers have both good and bad aspects, but by setting limits, we can make the most of the good and avoid the bad.
1038	1040	1	3	Dear @PERSON1, @CAPS1, my name is @PERSON2, and I am here to give you my opinions about computers. Computers are not only fun but also highly educational. They have a plethora of websites for games. Such as portaportal and @NUM1.com, which offer safe and fun games for kids under @NUM2. These games can be both entertaining and help in developing certain skills. They also have educational websites that can be a great aid in your work. For example, google and Ask your question.com. These websites have all the information you need on various things. They can provide quick answers to your queries and help you learn new concepts. They also have platforms like @CAPS2 and facebook. Yes, I know there have been rumors about people threatening over chats. But other than that, you're able to chat with your friends instead of waiting for your mom to get off the phone. @CAPS2 allows you to meet new people without having to immediately reveal who you are. This can be a great way to expand your social circle. In my opinion, computers are safe in different situations and are also very fun and educational. They offer a world of opportunities right at your fingertips, whether it's for learning or socializing.
1039	1041	1	3	I think that people shouldn't use the computers that much because it makes you want to be on it all day long. Like, yes, you can play games on it and talk to other people. I can understand that. But think about the other people around you, like those who live with you. People who are on the computer all day can spend more quality time with their family and friends and go to other places instead of just looking at them on the computer. I mean, instead of just chatting or using the webcam to see other people on the computer, you can maybe go to a different state and visit them in person. People who are always on the computer should get out more because they'll never do other things if they're always glued to it. For example, when @CAPS1 is on the computer, @CAPS1 might be on it for an hour or so, and then do things with family and friends, but not all the time. I understand if you work on the computer at work and then need to finish things at home for your work. But once in a while, you should get to spend some time with family and friends, not just be on it all the time. Some people @CAPS4 come home and immediately go on the computer, and that's how people start getting lazy. They start getting fat because they just sit there, go on the computer, maybe stop to eat, and then go back on the computer. Then, when they get off of it, they'll be all tired and not feel like going anywhere. They'll just want to sleep. Or if they had something to do after, they'll be all lazy and not want to do anything at all. That's why people should get out more and do things with their family and friends to have fun in real life. In conclusion, reducing computer usage can lead to a more active and fulfilling life.
1040	1042	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I took a poll of @NUM1 people, and @PERCENT1 of them agree that computers have a positive effect on people. Computers can be extremely helpful as they allow people to talk to someone in a far - away place, teach people hand - eye coordination, and give the ability to learn about people or places. Using computers is an excellent way to keep in touch with someone. For example, my grandparents live in @LOCATION2. Some of the convenient ways I keep in touch with them are e - mailing, video chatting, and instant messaging. These methods make it feel like they're just in the next room. Some other good things about talking to people online are that you can talk to many people at once or if your parents are on the phone. Another great thing about computers is that they are very effective at teaching people hand - eye coordination. The ways of teaching this are typing and clicking on something. Many @CAPS1 people, when they first start typing, look at the keyboard. But, with practice, they will advance to looking at the computer screen while typing. To click on something, you need to move the mouse while still looking at the screen. That, believe it or not, is hand - eye coordination. One last reason computers are good at helping people is that if a student needs to look up a place or person for a school report, they can very easily go to google.com and type in who or what they are looking for. Another option is, say someone is going on a vacation to @LOCATION1 and they know nothing about it. They can go on the internet and get detailed information on @LOCATION1 with just a couple of clicks of the mouse. Finally, say someone wants to learn about @ORGANIZATION2 for fun. They type @ORGANIZATION2 in, look at all the websites, choose the best one, and start reading. In conclusion, I definitely think computers have a positive effect on people for the reasons I have stated. People can talk to someone online, computers can teach hand - eye coordination, and finally, people can look up a person or place using the internet. This is my opinion on computers, and I sincerely hope you agree.
1041	1043	1	3	Dear local newspaper, my name is @PERSON1 and I'm writing to talk to you about how computers benefit society. Did you know that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 homes have at least @NUM3 computer in their home? Well, who wouldn't want one! Computers let you learn more because you can research more. It's quicker than having to go and look things up in the library. With tools like @CAPS3 and Facebook, you can talk to people you normally don't get to see. Computers let you learn more because of the internet. With the internet, you can use websites like Google, @LOCATION1 and @LOCATION2. When you look stuff up on these websites and many others, you can get valuable information that can get you ahead in life. For example, if I was looking up a chocolate chip recipe and I tried different things to make it unique then sold it, just think that life changed with one click on the computer. Also, if I had to research a topic for my history project, then I would go onto the computer, to Google and then type in my topic and be overwhelmed by getting the info that I needed and got an A on the project. That's how computers help you learn more. Computers are very quick. I can make @NUM4 powerpoint slides easily with useful information in the time it would take me to go to the library, find a good book and write enough information to make a powerpoint slide. On average, @PERCENT1 of people turn to the computer to find useful information. When I was doing my social studies project last week, I had to find out what the @CAPS4 flag looked like. So, instead of trying to possibly find a book in the library, I just hopped on Google and clicked images and typed in @CAPS4 flag. Within seconds, my screen was filled with real and edited pictures of the @CAPS4 flag. It is amazing how fast information can travel from the world wide web to your computer. So, would you rather be stuck in a library looking up information forever or out enjoying your life because you saved all that time by going on the computer? Have you ever heard of Facebook, MySpace, @CAPS3, or Twitter? Well, they are all great ways to communicate with people using the computer. When I am on @CAPS3 or Facebook, I can talk to people that I might not get to see all the time. One of my friends from camp lives in @CAPS10, so I don't get to see her a lot. So, with the wonderful invention of Facebook, I could talk to her all the time. Just think, without the computer, Facebook would have never been invented, so I would have most likely lost touch with a good friend. Also, when I go on the computer, I have the option of signing onto something called @CAPS3 or email. With this, I can talk to people and get wacky emails. That wouldn't happen if the computer wasn't invented. So, don't you want information to be easier to research, quicker to find out information, and talk to friends more easily? Well, let's make it @NUM2 out of @NUM2 homes that have a computer and help benefit society by doing your part and just getting what you need on the computer then enjoying life. Just imagine how much time you are saving by using the computer.
1042	1044	1	3	"Do you really think we need computers to live? I agree on spending less time on the computers and spending more time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with friends. I think this because I have a family. And I don't need a computer when I'm lost and don't know where I am. I get confused, not when I need to look for something, I use my iPod. If some people like to chat with each other, they use cell phones. Let's say you have a project in class, libraries are available. @PERCENT1 of kids like to read. Reading is a great way to bring your reading skills up. If you don't get the right ideas when you read, then you can ask your teachers, when it is an appropriate time, like afternoons or during lunch time. One day when I went to class, there was a project due and a kid said, ""I copied all of the words from the computers."" And that is called plagiarizing. So, some parents don't want to see their children plagiarize. Sometimes the internet is not good for children. Sometimes you need to take a break and slow down. You can take a trip and see your family. You can also look out at nature. Exercise, hike, swim and bike. Computers are not family. They are not going to make you exercise. They're going to make you lazy. Now that you've heard about why you should stop going to the computers because you have electronics, libraries and family, you should stop and make a change right now. There's nothing to lose. By reducing our computer usage, we can lead healthier, more fulfilling lives and truly connect with the world around us."
1043	1045	1	3	"What do you think about computers? I think computers have a very positive effect on people. All kids should have one. Please heed the following advice. Computers are a very good thing for kids to have. It teaches them life skills such as hand - eye coordination and a lot about technology. Expert @PERSON1 states, ""@PERCENT1 of successful jobs involve some kind of interaction with computers, and if they learn those skills at an early age they can soon become experts."" Technology is an important part of life today, and will continue increasing with the years. It's a grievous idea to want to separate our kids from technology. As a child, my sister grew up with computers. She knew how to fully use it by age @NUM2. She went to college with amazing computer skills. Today she works in a law firm as a presidential secretary. She gets paid loads of money. Today she tries to get me to learn about all tech stuff. If you have kids, you know you only want the best in their present and future. People say kids are the future, not if they're not successful. Computers are a great way for kids of all ages to learn and communicate with one another and others. We all want our kids to be happy. @NUM4 out of @NUM5 kids use the internet to research things for school and projects. Kid therapist @PERSON2 says, ""Kids who chat with other kids through the internet like Facebook, @CAPS3, and MySpace are normally more socially interactive with other kids."" I know you're thinking there are a lot of ""bad"" things on the internet and you don't want your kids to see them. Conversely, you can set limits and child - block. And you also don't want your kids at risk of obesity because of lack of exercise. So, give them time limits. My cousins each go on the computer @NUM6 hours a day. They do their schoolwork and whatever time they have left they chat with friends. It's not all bad. As you can see, computers can be seen in a very positive manner. Heed my advice and allow your kids the freedom of the internet. They will be happier, trust me. By embracing computers in a balanced way, we can ensure our kids are well - equipped for the future."
1044	1046	1	3	Do you like your computer? Does it benefit you and those around you? People are saying that computers don't benefit people. I am writing to prove them wrong and state why computers benefit us. It helps us with things like learning, communication, and even money or economic problems. First, learning is very important in a lifetime and computers can help you increase that. One, hand - eye coordination is very helpful in different sports like tennis, golf, and hacky - sack too. When you go on the computer, you learn that skill. For example, last summer, I went to play tennis with mom and she's never on the computer. She missed every ball thrown to her. Through computers all around the world, going on the computer can open you to the whole world. You can see places like @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2, and even @LOCATION3. Overall, Africa has the least computers out of the whole world. Finally, computers let you learn typing. In America, there are jobs that are for you to type. If you learn to type, then you can get a good job. If you get a good job, then you can be successful in life. Computers definitely benefit your learning. Second, computers open you up to meet new friends. One, when you go to school, you can interact more with other students. Computers let you talk to your classmates right away. According to Facebook magazine, @PERCENT1 of all the students in a school chat and talk online to other people. Two, the computer can help you communicate with your family too. For instance, if your grandma got hurt, you could e - mail that grandma's hurt. Computers can keep your family connected too. Finally, computers are helpful in social life. For example, kids with cancer, or even those who need to check their health can let you talk to this kind of people. Computers are very helpful when it comes to your social life. Finally, computers help you economically. In this economy, it's really hard to find a job. So, the computer can help you with that. There are websites online that make you take a test and actually give you a place to work. In conclusion, computers offer numerous benefits in learning, communication, and economic aspects, making them an essential part of our lives.
1045	1047	1	3	"Dear @ORGANIZATION2, Computers are destroying modern youth. The rapid advancement in technology is not a positive thing. The popular social networks such as Facebook and Twitter are putting youth at danger of cyber - bullying and child predators. Children are also becoming addicted to computers and are paying the price physically. Although we are becoming a smarter species, we are destroying the ones who will soon lead the world. This crazy computing must end! Although children are able to socialize using the computer, they are at danger of being hurt physically and emotionally. ""I really tried to ignore all of the cruel comments people were posting about me. I tried as hard as I could, but every time I logged onto Facebook and looked at what people said about me, I died inside. I almost had no desire to live."" That quote was said by @PERSON1, a former student of @ORGANIZATION1. He is a victim of cyber - bullying. Thousands of students just like @PERSON1 are being pestered just as bad, and if not worse. The social networks that modern technology promotes harvest cases like @PERSON1's. If this rapid increase in technology continues, then we will see many more cases such as that one. In the past year, @NUM1 cyber - bully victims have committed suicide. Those are @NUM1 lives that could have been saved; @NUM1 families that could still be together. This computer madness is losing lives. We cannot allow this to continue. Not only are computers causing emotional danger, but also physical. The average teenager spends between one to four hours on the computer, making the one hour of exercise seem miniscule. The large number of obese children is in large part caused by computers. The many features of computers, such as instant messaging, music playing, and games, draw kids in, making them spend time they could use exercising, in front of a computer. Statistics show that the average obese child spends @PERCENT1 of their free time on a computer. The time they spend exercising and playing makes up only five percent of their day. In @DATE1, children spent @PERCENT2 of their day in front of a computer and @PERCENT3 outside. Over the past @NUM4 years, these numbers have headed south due to the advance in technology. These numbers prove that computers have dictated obese children's day, making their physical condition even worse. Computers are to blame for our world's weight issues. As I conclude this letter, I can only hope that I persuaded you to make a stand and halt this technological advancement. In conclusion, computers are harvesting cyber - bullying which leads to emotional discomfort. They also dictate time, and as a result, children become obese. We must take a stand and alter statistics for the better. We need to find a balance so that technology doesn't continue to ruin the lives of our youth."
1046	1048	1	3	Dear readers, @CAPS1 what if I told you that every time you sit in front of a computer, you are that much closer to death? @CAPS1 what if I said that computers are slowly destroying your lives? This @MONTH1 might not seem that serious, but it's truly shocking. You can't possibly disagree. I firmly feel that humans should not use computers, or at least use them very scarcely. Computers make people get less exercise, they kill brain cells, and they can completely ruin your lifestyle. You @MONTH1 might believe computers have not impaired your life, but the consequences remain. Many @CAPS2 children today are obese and lazy. They don't get any exercise. There are many reasons for this, but one big reason is because they sit in front of computers all day! Computers @MONTH1 might improve reflexes and such, but you can achieve that by exercising, too! When you sit in front of a computer, it sucks you in. Ten minutes turns into one hour in a flash! That is one less hour of exercise. Virtual sports @MONTH1 might be fun, but they keep you from the real ones. Without exercise, one @MONTH1 can become obese, develop diabetes or heart problems, or even have muscle troubles. These can be hazardous, and even deadly. Computers don't exercise your body, nor your mind! Now, that fact brings me to my next point. Computers @MONTH1 might have information to teach you, but that type of learning has its consequences. When you sit in front of a computer, your eyes are glued to the screen. Now, scientists from the @ORGANIZATION1 foundation have found that staring at the screen kills brain cells. Basically, these cells do not reproduce as easily as other cells, and they sometimes don't reproduce at all. You are just one step closer to death. I'm sure you don't want an early death. Try opening a book! They are cheaper, more accurate, and don't kill your cells! Don't stare at the computer screen, because you're slowly destroying your body, and knowledge can be gained elsewhere. For a final point, I would like to say that computers simply destroy your lifestyle. Virtual people are not your real friends and family. Computers cause you to turn away from them. Online interaction is not like just talking to someone in person or on the phone. You can lose your real friends. Plus, computers run your lifestyle because half the things you think you are learning aren't real. You can't trust certain sites or certain people. Being with ones you know and love is much more beneficial, because computers drag you in and you're taken away from the real world. I feel that we should all take a stand against computers. They take away exercise, cause brain cells to die and other problems occur, and they can ruin your lifestyle. No one wants to be a lonely joke! Read a book, get outside and play; but stay away from the screen. There are better alternatives. Take a stand, and do @CAPS1 what is best. Be the healthy, happy person, and lay off those computers, so that you can get the best of life!
1047	1049	1	3	"Dear editor of my local newspaper, In my opinion, computers have a positive effect on people. I wholeheartedly support the advances in technology. I believe @CAPS1 using computers is a positive thing because @CAPS1 it teaches hand - eye coordination, gives people the ability to learn about far - away places and people, and even allows us to talk online with others. In the following paragraphs, I will share with you my opinions and why they are the right opinions for all to believe in. Firstly, hand - eye coordination plays a big part in our lives. Many of us engage in sports. Now, sports isn't just about being the best; @CAPS1 it's about getting better and doing your best. Sports take a lot of practice, and one way is through computer games. Though I bet you didn't know @CAPS1, these games help you develop hand - eye coordination. Defeating these monsters and such in computer games really helps you in sports. Catching and throwing, which are big parts in a lot of sports, are all about hand - eye coordination, and where do you think you get @CAPS1 that skill from? Practice and computer games. So next time you're on the computer, play some games, and that will be like practicing for sports and will help you develop the hand - eye coordination you need to succeed in a sport. Secondly, @CAPS2 another reason in favor of computer use is because @CAPS1 it gives us the opportunity to learn about places and people from all around the world. Think about @CAPS1 before computers. If you wanted to know something, you might have to search all around for a book that tells you @CAPS1, and @CAPS1 that process could take a long time. Now, you just type what you want to know on Google or Bing, and there's your answer. This ability to quickly find what you're looking for allows you more freedom to learn and spend other precious time doing other things you want to do rather than taking the time to locate and read the right book. As you can see, this is a useful ability and can be a big help when you need to know something fast. So help yourself and use computers to make life easier. Thirdly, computers are a great way to communicate. They can let you talk to people all around the world when you might usually not be able to. This is a great way to stay in contact when people move, go away on a business trip, go on vacation, or even to meet new people. Say you can't get a hold of someone because their phone is off and it's important you talk to them. You could email them or if they're online and have @CAPS3.M, you could @CAPS2 instant - message them. This would save you the hassle of having to keep calling them. Also, if you want to see what they're doing or where they are, you could use a webcam and see them instead of just talking to them. As this paragraph shows, the internet and computers open up more communication channels than ever before. As I wrote above, I showed not even a fraction of what computers are good for. My reasons for computers being more of a positive thing, rather than a negative thing, are as follows: they help us with learning things that before we couldn't, communicate with others, and help us develop hand - eye coordination. I can only hope that as I write my conclusion, ""that my opinions were heard and that this letter has helped all see why computers are a great thing, not a bad one."
1048	1050	1	3	"Dear @PERSON2, ""@CAPS1, @CAPS1"" I'm sure you all have heard the sound of a mouse clicking or people typing if you've walked into an office, our local library, a doctor's office, or even our district's schools. The reality is that computers and the world - wide - web are seen and used everywhere. Without a computer, how would @CAPS3 we be able to access our emails, interact with family members across the ocean, and finish that research paper our teacher has assigned us? In my opinion, computers have a phenomenal effect on people and their lives. The computer helps develop hand - eye coordination, learn about specific subjects, and interact with people on the computer. Therefore, with such positive effects, @CAPS3 we should keep using this wonderful technology and get our jobs done. Have you ever walked into your school's lab or an office building and all you could hear was the clicking of mice or the buttons being pressed down on the keyboard? Well, not only is a job being completed, but you are also exercising. I remember last month when my class was assigned a five - page essay. After the second page, my hands hurt very badly. @CAPS4 However, not only was I completing my essay, I was also exercising my hands. Not only does using computers allow you to exercise, it also helps develop hand - eye coordination. Have you ever played a game where you had to catch fish, or played a fast - paced game of pinball? Well, those games require one key thing: hand - eye coordination. Computers are very helpful in today's world. The computer and the world - wide - web are useful in several other ways too. The internet also allows you to learn about certain subjects or events you might not have a book for. My best friend, @PERSON1, called me one day from the train. On the phone, she was frantic because she was giving a speech and she did not know what the statistic was for type @CAPS5 diabetes. What do you do when you have no book for a specific subject? @PERSON3 She went on her laptop and found all the information she didn't know. This is just another way the quick access to a computer benefits people. ""You've got mail"" I'm sure you have all heard this before. Besides communicating through letters or on the telephone, the internet has also given us more ways for fast communication. When you need to confirm a meeting place or ask your classmate what problems were assigned for homework, what could be a fast means of communication? Sending an instant message or an e - mail are two ways, of course. Not only does using computers allow you to communicate quickly but also privately. Both your e - mail account and your instant message account have passwords so that only you can access them. Every four out of five households have a computer available for completing assignments, checking e - mails, and learning about the events that happened in @LOCATION1 last week. The computer has had a positive effect on numerous people and their everyday needs. In my opinion, the computer has been one of the best technologies in history. This amazing technology has helped students, teachers, doctors, police officers, and even your bank agents serve our community and make it a better one. Thank you."
1049	1051	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 our society should have computers because it teaches you things that a school or job will never teach you, and it allows you to be in contact with your friends and family that you don't see a lot. I would like for you to appreciate my concern on how @CAPS1 our society should have computers. First, we should have computers because it teaches us things that we might not have been taught before. I say this because if you want to know about the @LOCATION1 more and the school or job doesn't teach you as much as you want to know, then all you have to do is look it up on the internet, and there's a good chance you'll find it. @NUM1 A large number of people would rather have computers to look up things instead of not knowing much about something at all. Next, we should have computers for @CAPS1 our society because we could contact people online that we haven't spoken to. My opinion is that if you haven't talked to a friend or family member in a while, you can talk to them online. Also, if they don't have a phone or if they do but it's long - distance and you can't talk long - distance on your phone, you can talk to them on the computer or email each other, etc. Suppose your phone isn't working and the only thing that's working is your computer; you can use it to stay in contact with somebody. All you gotta do is talk to them online. Would you rather talk on the phone or the computer? In conclusion, @CAPS1 our society should have computers because we could learn about things more and we could chat with people. I would like for you to appreciate my concern on having computers in @CAPS1 our society.
1050	1052	1	3	"Did you know that @PERCENT2 out of @PERCENT1 children today, prefer to play games on the computer than do other activities? My opinion about this topic is that it is more important for children to do things other than sit on the computer all day. The reasons why I feel this way is because it is important to exercise, children tend to be addicted to playing on the computer, and if someone's life revolves around the computer than they most likely won't be able to live in the ""real world"". When a child sits at the computer all day, they are not getting exercise. Today, obesity is a major problem. If people stay on the computer less and exercise more, then this situation could improve. Also, it is important for children to get fresh air. When someone plays on the computer, they are not getting as much fresh air as they would outdoors. Lastly, those who realize the importance of exercise tend to participate in sports to stay active and have fun. Once you begin to play games on the computer, there is often no turning back. In today's society, children of all ages become addicted to the computer. Children who are addicted pay no attention to their surroundings. Also, some of these games might be inappropriate for younger players. Lastly, if children become addicted, they could do poorly in school for refusing to do homework. If a child is constantly on the computer, then they have a chance of not being prepared for the ""real world."" In the ""real world,"" you can't rely on computer games. Also, games won't teach you things that you can only learn during school. Later in life, when you want to get a job, you won't be able to be accepted because you will not sound knowledgeable. Lastly, when you are writing your application to go to a college, they will look at your records of sports and activities you've done in middle school. When they don't find anything, they will reject you because of your lack of participation. So when you are sitting at the computer screen, remember all the possibilities you have other than the computer. For example, it is important for you to exercise, playing games on the computer could make you addicted, and you won't be prepared for the ""real world"". What is your opinion? It's crucial that children and parents alike understand these drawbacks and make more balanced choices to ensure a healthy and successful future."
1051	1053	1	3	Dear newspaper, @CAPS1, my name is @PERSON1 and I firmly believe that computers have a negative influence on people. When people are glued to their computers all day long, they have significantly less time for physical exercise. They are exposed to a lot more danger, and they spend less precious time with their family. These are just some of the reasons why computers don't benefit society. Moreover, more time spent on computers directly equals less time for exercising. With the obesity rate steadily rising, no one wants to be unable to perform regular activities. By spending all your time on the computer, you're just setting yourself up to become overweight and unhealthy. It also makes many people feel self - conscious about themselves. If they don't have enough time for exercising and keep indulging in food, they will become even more self - conscious. Furthermore, it will bring more danger to you and your family. There are numerous places on the internet where you can meet new people. But how can you be certain that people are who they claim to be? If you spend more time on the computer, then you will increase your chances by @PERCENT3 of getting a personal assault, or even giving away your personal information. So why should you take such a risk? Just get off that computer! Even if you don't encounter an internet assailant, you will still be so engrossed in your computer that it's more likely for you to be harassed. I definitely don't want that for my family. The last reason is the most important to @PERCENT1 of @LOCATION1 family. If you are spending all this time on your computer, you will be missing out on precious moments with your family. This time is very important because you never know when your family will be gone! And it is a very scary topic to think about. I know that most people in @LOCATION1 would love to spend all the time with their family. On another note, a survey shows that @PERCENT2 of children who spend time with their family and less than @NUM1 minutes on the computer have grades higher than @NUM2 in all classes. Wouldn't you want to make the honor roll in your school? In conclusion, computers have a negative effect on people! Spending most of your time on your computer can cause less time spent exercising, more danger and harm to people, and less time spent with your family. Wouldn't you just rather spend less time on your computer? Thank you for your time.
1052	1054	1	3	I think computers are very beneficial. There are so many diverse uses! From learning, to games, to videos, and they serve as a tool that is extremely useful. Without computers, we would be like the @CAPS1 (apologies for any @CAPS1 offense). We would have to patiently wait for a newspaper or the news to come on @CAPS4.V. to see breaking news. Let me explain my reasoning in the next few paragraphs. First and foremost, there are countless things to do. You can play a wide variety of online games, offline games, surf the vast web, chat with friends, watch videos, and so on. Without the internet, I probably would have lost my interest in @ORGANIZATION1. I am now an active member of the online community called www.MOCpages.com. I post my creative creations, look at others' amazing creations, and engage in commenting and chatting. I use the internet to conduct research for school projects. Right now, I am researching @CAPS5 @CAPS6 during the @CAPS7 @CAPS8. Normally, I would have to laboriously search through books to find relevant information. Now it is much easier because keywords are efficiently matched. Finally, it is an excellent tool. Did you know that the military heavily relies on computers to store crucial information, carry out attacks, maintain records, and even pilot certain planes? I need to use a computer to type up my homework because, as you can see, my handwriting isn't the neatest. Also, I stay in regular touch with my dad, who works in @ORGANIZATION2. I hope I have persuaded you on my position. Remember, computers can do lots of things, help us learn, and they are a truly fantastic tool. Thanks for reading, bye!
1053	1055	1	3	To whom it @MONTH1 concerns, To many people, it is so much fun to use computers, but then they become so obsessed that they can lose so many things that they hold dear. My stand is that computers can harm people in terms of money, weight, and sleep. My opinion is just that - my opinion, but I will stand firm with what I believe. My father's main concern is the financial aspect. With five kids and just one laptop, who would be truly happy? With people sitting and staring at a computer game all day long, the bills just keep piling up until you lose everything, such as your house, family, and money, etc. But who cares about them when you are completely obsessed with your computer? My personal concern is the overweight problem. Yeah, I agree it is nice to sit in a soft, cushy chair with your computer and bowls of chips and boxes of pizza. But sooner or later, all that fatty food will catch up to you when you least expect it. Will you get up and take a jog, run on a treadmill, or go for a @NUM1 - minute walk? Probably not while that computer game is running. That weight will keep increasing until you can't even move. Sitting at a @NUM2 - hour stretch will really take a toll on your eyes, brain, muscles, and other important body parts due to lack of sleep and the constant urge to keep using it. I can relate this to my brother with his addiction. He gets home, and boom, he is on it until maybe @NUM3 or @NUM4 o'clock in the @TIME1. Eventually, he is going to get sick, and I'm not to blame for it. When you sit at a computer for long periods, eventually you are going to make yourself sick and in some cases, even die if you stay up that late. Now, as a common teen, I love to go on the computer, but one thing I do not do is sit and watch movies or play games every hour of every day. I get outside and run so that I will not fall victim to weight, financial, and body problems, like @MONTH1 people do. So don't waste your life on a game or chat room. Get out there and do something like sports or just get some fresh air.
1054	1056	1	3	Many people say that computers help them in their everyday life. A few examples are that you could learn about places you didn't know about by searching on Google. You can get facts and reviews about the place. You are also exercising your fingers while using the computer. It helps with communicating with other people. It can help you find long - lost family members. It reunites lots of family and friends you might have been looking for. Also, it is beneficial for hand - eye coordination. Another great feature that comes with a computer is going online. You can look and browse at things available in a store. Without having to drive all the way to the store and wasting gas and polluting the air. Instant messaging (I.Ms) is a way of finding out what's happening worldwide and getting breaking news. You can still interact with family and friends and can even meet new people. There's email, instant messaging, and much more. So you can always interact with others, and if they don't have an account, signing up is easy. If you just go into nature without any knowledge, you don't know what's there. You could look it up and find out what the park has to offer. And that concludes my opinion on how computers are helpful in lots of diverse ways.
1055	1057	1	3	"Dear local newspaper, @DATE1 I am going to write to you about whether I think computers are a good idea or not. Yes, I do think computers are an awesome idea. I think this because, first of all, you use computers for school projects. Secondly, it is an easy way to make friends from other towns. Lastly, you can get educated. Yes, the electric bill could be higher, but for a good cause. You shouldn't just assume computers are bad for us; you might be surprised. First of all, I am going to explain to you why we need computers to do projects. Well, from personal experience, my social studies teacher always prefers you to type your final draft. Also, using a computer makes your projects easier because spell - check fixes your mistakes, and search engines find everything you need. I find it much easier to use a computer for projects, and I know all of my friends think it is also. If you aren't persuaded yet, keep reading because I'm sure you will be eventually! Secondly, I am going to talk to you about making friends just with a computer. I know that parents these days are really happy when you have come home and made new friends. Just by using a computer, you could easily go online, search for friends you want to get to know better, and chat with them. (Make sure they are who you think they are!) The other day my friend @PERSON1 came up to me and said, ""Meet my friend @CAPS6 I met online!"" I was really happy for her and realized computers are helpful. Everybody needs friends who are there for them, and computers are the perfect solution for that! Lastly, I am going to talk to you more about why and how you could get educated. Do you know what @ORGANIZATION1 is? You can search @CAPS7 on @ORGANIZATION1! If you really wanted to know something and you were really curious, you could search on @ORGANIZATION1! This is a great way to get educated. Also, computers help you with grammar and spelling because every time you are on a word - processing program typing a random story, it will fix your mistakes, and you will learn from these mistakes. So, to sum up this paragraph, a computer is an easy way to get educated, and you need to keep computers to see for yourself. In conclusion, I was asked to write a paper to you to see if I would like to keep computers or not. By now you know that I would like to. In case you are still unsure about my reasons, I will simply restate them. First, you need a computer for projects. Second, you can make friends. Last, you can get educated. All of these things are a huge benefit in later life. Don't forget you can get educated! That is what everybody would like! I'm sure you will come around and agree. Thank you for listening to me."
1056	1058	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, I firmly believe that computers have a positive effect on people. They do so because you can engage in conversations with others online, it enables you to complete research at a faster pace, and they are far more efficient and user - friendly. I will further elaborate on my reasons. First of all, computers allow you to communicate with others online. Engaging in online conversations can enhance your communication skills and let you get acquainted with diverse individuals. I often talk to my friends online. We interact using webcams, instant messaging apps, or social platforms like Facebook. Computers and webcams are extremely useful for staying in touch with friends who have moved away or for keeping in contact with relatives. Next, computers enable you to conduct research more quickly. Studies have shown that @PERCENT1 of people prefer using a computer to gather information for any type of paper rather than referring to an encyclopedia or other books. Computers are much more efficient and easier to use compared to books. I wholeheartedly agree that computers are highly efficient, and I personally enjoy using them. If you utilize a computer for research, you'll be surprised at how soon you can finish. Finally, computers are more efficient and easy to operate. If given a choice between a computer and a set of encyclopedias, most people would undoubtedly choose the computer. Computers are so much simpler to use than books. On the computer, all you need to do is type what you're looking for in the search bar, and within a fraction of a second, your results will appear. In contrast, if you use a book or an encyclopedia, it could take several minutes to find the information you need, and they usually provide only a limited amount of details, unlike a computer that can offer millions of results for a single topic. This clearly demonstrates that computers are more efficient than books. In conclusion, I am convinced that computers have a positive effect on people. This is because you can communicate with people online, they allow you to complete research faster, and they are more efficient and easy to use. I sincerely hope you will concur with my thoughts about computers.
1057	1059	1	3	I think that computers do have a positive effect on people because they teach hand - eye coordination, also give people the ability to learn more, and lastly they allow people to talk online. First, they teach hand - eye coordination, and I believe this is beneficial because when people enter the workforce, they can likely be more focused and work at a faster pace. So, if people have good hand - eye coordination and their jobs involve working on a computer, it can make their work easier and more enjoyable. Second, they give people the opportunity to learn more. We have numerous websites filled with information, so people can expand their knowledge. If they are more knowledgeable, they may be able to secure a well - paying job. They can look up anything they're interested in. By conducting extensive research and attending school, they can achieve the job they've always desired because knowledgeable people are more likely to succeed. Lastly, they allow people to talk to others online. When people can communicate with each other, it's a great advantage. For instance, if they don't have a phone to reach someone they need to contact, they can use a computer to either send an email or use a webcam to see the person. I firmly believe that having a computer is beneficial for all these reasons: it helps develop hand - eye coordination, gives people the ability to learn more, and allows them to talk online with others.
1058	1060	1	3	Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 is a place where people are constantly on computers all day, every day. I don't think computers are a benefit to society because you get less time for exercising, less time for enjoying nature, and you spend less time with family and friends. Computers are not a benefit to society. To begin, computers are not a benefit to society because they reduce the time you have for exercise. Wouldn't you rather go out and exercise to lose weight instead of just sitting around on your new computer, having your mind drained by it? @PERSON1 said that @PERCENT1 of people who get a new computer spend @NUM1 minutes more than their usual time on it. Next, you could be outside enjoying nature. The New @CAPS2 @CAPS3 Newspaper has expressed concerns that if too many people own good computers, no one will be outside enjoying what's left of nature. Eventually, there may be no trees left in the world, and humans could become extinct forever. Lastly, you won't be spending time with your family or friends. For example, when I got X - box Live, I couldn't stop using it. I was addicted. And when my family got a new computer, my older sister was glued to it. She would spend all day and all night on it. Now, if parents take the computer away from kids, they will have more time to exercise, more time to enjoy nature, and more time with family and friends. In conclusion, computers are not good for society.
1059	1061	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, @CAPS4, do you think that computers have a bad effect on people? I @CAPS4. People spend too much time on the @CAPS5. When they need to be working on their @CAPS5, they get distracted and start doing their own thing. Other people sit at their @CAPS5 and get mad or angry at @CAPS6. When people don't know what to do, they turn to their @CAPS5. When working on the @CAPS5, you easily get distracted. I can attest to this. People get distracted because they notice that little internet button in the corner of their eye. Then they just click the internet symbol, and they're off doing something other than their job. The internet is not the only distraction on a @CAPS5. Games are another distraction. @PERSON1, @PERSON1, and hearts are all games that come pre - installed on the @CAPS5. People get mad or angry at their @CAPS5 because @CAPS6 doesn't have enough storage, @CAPS6 deletes something they need, or @CAPS6 simply won't turn on because it's out of power. They blame all of these issues on the @CAPS5. If @CAPS6 doesn't load fast enough, the person might say, ""@CAPS7, why are you being so slow? I need to get my paper for work!"" If the @CAPS5 deletes the paper, the person might exclaim, ""@CAPS9, where is the paper I saved? Are you playing a game on me?"" But if the poor @CAPS5 is dead and won't turn on, then the person might say, ""Why aren't you turning on, you stupid computer?"" Moreover, people spend all of their time on the @CAPS5. When they're bored and can't find something to do, they reach for the @CAPS5. This isn't the best idea, in my opinion. People in the @ORGANIZATION1 have access to a @CAPS5 at home and even on their phones. The over - use of the @CAPS5 in the @LOCATION1 is becoming a problem in my eyes. Spending too much time on the @CAPS5 can lead to weight gain because you're sitting in front of the @CAPS5 instead of going out and hanging out with your friends. In conclusion, I believe that @CAPS5 have a bad effect on people. They cause distractions at work, people blame them for things they forget to do, and excessive use can lead to people skipping the gym and becoming overweight. So, do @CAPS5 have a bad effect on people? Yes, they do."
1060	1062	1	3	"Do you have a computer at home that you use? Everyone uses the computer for various reasons, such as chatting with friends or working on projects. Computers can be beneficial in many ways, but they also have their drawbacks. Computers are designed to assist us in learning. I personally think that computers are good. We can learn about events happening far away. For example, if we have a big project in @CAPS1 @CAPS2 about @LOCATION2 and we're unsure, the computer can help us focus on different aspects and even let us see pictures. Computers can provide the history of a place without us having to do extensive research. I remember my sister talking about a question that had to be answered using a computer. The answer was related to World War @CAPS3. She got a good grade. We can also be able to see what's going on in the @LOCATION1 and other places. All you need to do is go on the computer and look it up. ""Okay class, today we will be going down to the computer lab to do some research,"" said my teacher. ""What are we going to research?"" ""Events that are happening in the @LOCATION1."" All of these events can help us with research projects and many other things. We can also use computers for a variety of purposes. Computers have different programs. For example, some programs allow us to look up information, play games, and help with our homework. I've just realized that you can pretty much do anything you want on a computer. @CAPS2 shows that @PERCENT2 of people in the @LOCATION1 go on the computer for help with their studies. I can recall my friend telling me that she always types her essays because it's easier for her teacher to read and it looks neater. So, the programs are useful to us. People often go on the computer to find and save information about sales. I usually do this so I know when it's a good time to go shopping and buy what I want. Well, you should really consider the advantages of computers, especially for those who can't find other sources of information easily."
1061	1063	1	3	"Computers can be extremely useful to people in numerous ways. They can effectively help us contact friends and family from all corners of the world. For instance, you might need a computer for typing a well - structured paper for school or work, and it also provides seamless access to the internet. If you have a friend or family member who has moved away, computers offer an easy and convenient way to stay in touch. Phones don't always provide the option to call from around the world without incurring high costs. Say your best friend moved out of the country, you could effortlessly email them or instant message them through computers. What if you want to chat with someone right next door even when there's a blizzard and the snow is four feet deep? Computers are a simple and reliable way to contact them. When my friend went to @LOCATION1 for the @DATE1, I used instant messaging to have long and engaging talks with her. Imagine you're at work or school and you're asked to write a five - page essay. Do you really want to write it all by hand? Imagine writing out hundreds of pages like a newspaper every day. Typing on a computer is an easy solution that doesn't require as much physical effort and it takes less time. Typing also makes your work a lot neater and much easier to read. Not even a large library has all the information you need. What if you need to write an article for your newspaper about a newly discovered animal? A library won't immediately buy new books about it. The internet is an ideal way to get information the moment it happens. What if a celebrity got hit by a bus or a rocket in space just landed successfully? You can't expect to go to the other side of the country to watch and take notes. The internet gives information on anything possible. The internet also allows students to take online schools or classes. When my oldest brother couldn't take @CAPS1 in high school when it was needed for college, he took an online @CAPS1 class at home with ease. The internet also helps you find vacation spots when you're going away from home. What if you need a plane, train, or boat ticket? What if you need to rent a car but you can't go over to the store or airport? You can go online to purchase tickets conveniently. Have you ever heard someone say ""@CAPS3 it upon google"" when they don't know the answer to something? I remember my friend telling me about her new dog breed that I never even heard of. When I got home, I went on the internet and thoroughly researched it. The internet is a very useful tool to everyone. Going on a computer allows you to talk to anyone, anywhere, type anything needed, or to use the internet. The computer makes life a little easier and it's fun too, and would be a handy tool for writing a newspaper. In conclusion, computers have become an indispensable part of our lives, offering a wide range of benefits that enhance our daily experiences."
1062	1064	1	3	Did you know that the positive effects computers have on people far outweigh the negative ones? I firmly believe that the usage of computers increases one's knowledge of far - away places safely, can be used for seamless communication, and can make everyday tasks much easier. Computers have truly become the essential tools of modern society. Firstly, using a computer allows a Floridian to learn in - depth about Connecticut, or a Canadian to learn about the vast world around them, all from the safety of their homes. In a study conducted by the @ORGANIZATION1, it has been clearly shown that without the computer, @PERCENT1 of all people would have been completely ignorant of the one - child dilemma in @LOCATION3. In addition, since the crime rate in @LOCATION1 @LOCATION1 is @PERCENT2, an American might not want to visit @LOCATION1 @LOCATION1, @CAPS1, but they must learn about it for a business project. What do they do? They simply venture onto the computer and gather everything they need to know about @LOCATION1, from the security of their home. While people can learn about far - away places from the safety of their houses, they can also use the computer for communication purposes. The computer is an outstanding tool for communicating with other people. In a survey done in @DATE1, @PERCENT3 of computer users had some sort of social networking or instant messaging program installed on their devices. Some well - known examples of these are @CAPS2, and @CAPS3, respectively. Being able to contact people has never been easier. Did you know that out of every @NUM1 Americans, they spend an average of a few hours online every day? Is it truly a wonder that the average I.Q has increased in the last @NUM2 years? When online, students can receive valuable help from fellow students, experienced teachers, and even renowned experts! Users of the computer can get constructive feedback on their essays, support when trying something new, and even a significant boost in self - confidence. Communication is a great utilization of computers, as is the simplicity to perform everyday tasks online. In today's fast - paced society, the computer can make everyday tasks so much more convenient! When I was a child, my mom spent hours in the local grocery store, painstakingly shopping for food. That all changed when my mother discovered @LOCATION2. It is a safe and easy way to buy food online and then have it delivered right to your doorstep. Not only that, but @PERCENT4 of Americans with computers have paid their taxes online. A once - complicated job has become simple, with the mere click of a button. It's amazing that the majority of our day need not be filled with mundane errands, but with what we truly want! Whether that be to exercise or simply enjoy nature. In a nutshell, computers are great assets to society. They have a multitude of purposes and functions. They can increase a person's knowledge of far - away places safely, be used for communication purposes, and make everyday tasks simple. It's hard to even fathom how we managed before this remarkable device came along. In conclusion, computers have revolutionized our lives in countless ways, and their importance will only continue to grow.
1063	1065	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2, my name is @CAPS3 and I really don't know where to start this letter. I'm writing you this letter to let you know that I think not everyone should use a computer. My first reason is that many people get so distracted by the computer that they completely forget about school. They become so engrossed in writing, chatting, or playing @CAPS4 that they lose track of their academic responsibilities. As a result, their grades start to get low, and they often don't do their homework either. My second reason is that they don't spend enough time with their parents. They are so focused on the computer that they neglect the important relationships in their lives. They miss out on family conversations and quality time with their loved ones. My third reason is that spending too much time on the computer can make people sick. Sitting in front of a screen for long hours can cause eye strain, back problems, and other health issues. Also, they may not get proper education because they are so caught up in the virtual world. They don't engage in real - life learning experiences and may fall behind in their studies. That is why it is bad to use a computer a lot. I hope you understand my concerns and take them into consideration. In conclusion, while computers have their uses, we need to be cautious about over - using them to avoid these negative impacts.
1064	1066	1	3	"@ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1, there is a lot of intense talking and arguing about computers. Some say they are extremely helpful to society, while others hold the opposite view. As for myself, I am one of those firmly on the side that is for computers. I think they do a great deal less harm than good. First of all, the hand - eye coordination of the user is mostly improved over a period of time, which is highly beneficial for learning musical instruments. Also, it gives a great learning ability to people, particularly students. If there were no computers, for a student to do a report, he/she would have to painstakingly read through an encyclopedia, which takes a significantly greater amount of time than simply looking it up on the internet. Finally, computers are great for communicating with far - away friends or family. The first subject on my agenda is the hand - eye coordination skills. These skills refer to the ability to work with your hands and eyes simultaneously. There is a number of impacts these skills can make. The most apparent is in the realm of musical instruments. If you are trying to learn a new song to be played on guitar, you must precisely move your fingers to the notes corresponding with the screen. Another place where hand - eye coordination comes in very handy is in sports. One sport where hand - eye coordination makes a huge impact is in football. If the ball is thrown, then the wide receiver must watch the ball with his eyes and make sure he puts his hands in the best position to catch the ball accurately. I am also going to strongly argue the vast world of learning that is provided by computers. Let's just say someone asks you who was the @NUM1 president of the @ORGANIZATION2. Where would you go to find that answer? I don't know about you, but I am definitely going to look it up on google (an internet search engine). Also, schools @CAPS1 can ask a lot more of their students because they have all this information at their disposal. They can assign more challenging projects and expect students to complete them with the help of the computer. Lastly, I would like to cover the communication abilities that the computer offers. First of all, let's say you have a very close friend who moves out - of - state. How are you going to keep in touch? You could try using phones, but yet the long - distance fees have sky - rocketed over the past @NUM2 years. Did you know that if you talk long distance for @NUM3 mins a day, that would cost over @NUM4 a month? In today's economy, you need to save money, not spend it all on long - distance calls. The internet charges no additional fees for chatting no matter how far away you are from each other. So hopefully my letter will be able to surpass ""@CAPS2'bama's failed health care bill"" to at least make it somewhere in the paper. People need to know the facts about computers before they try to argue about them. In conclusion, computers bring numerous benefits in terms of skill development, learning, and communication, and we should recognize and embrace their positive aspects."
1065	1067	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2, many people have computers, and many people use them. It's been brought to my attention that the government is worried about people using them too much. Well, I think you can't use a computer too much because they offer so many wonderful things such as information, communication, and life skills. Information is something we as humans constantly strive for. Also, in modern schools and jobs, you need to know a variety of unusual facts. Where can you learn these? Computers, of course! When @PERSON1 (my teacher) gives us a research paper on Walt Disney, we use computers to find our information efficiently. Without the computer, I wouldn't know that Walt Disney died before Disney World opened. That clearly shows one of the many important things we need computers for. Communication is another crucial aspect of our lives. With a computer, you can have multiple ways to communicate. Yes, some of these ways can be dangerous, but many are safe. When I was in @NUM1 grade, my teacher Ms. Casserelle set up a class - wide email for us. This allowed us to email another school in a safe and educational way. This form of online communication was perfectly safe as long as the person using these forms of communication is semi - responsible. Where can you go wrong with that? Did you know that @PERCENT1 of your life skills can and are learned on computers? As a matter of fact, your job most likely involves a computer! One essential life skill you can learn is how to type. As I stated earlier, research papers need computers, well, it's not just for the information. You have to type them too. Most jobs in our world need the computer for something or other. Can you think of a job that doesn't require one at all? I didn't think so. Information, communication, and life skills are all important to our human nature. I think computers are extremely important to humans. Whether you admit it or not, everything we do involves a computer to some degree. Can you spend many countless hours on a computer? Yes, but you need to because they are so integral to our daily lives. In conclusion, computers are an essential part of our existence, providing us with valuable resources and opportunities for growth.
1066	1068	1	3	Computers have had a huge impact on society, but do they truly make everything better? People spend an excessive amount of time on the computer. Computers do not help your brain; in fact, they can make you fat, and for a large number of people, they cause drama. People should cut down on the time they spend on computers. Computers do not offer any benefits to your brain. Consider this: while you may complete a significant portion of your work on computers, what about your children? They spend the majority of their time online, engaging in pointless activities. Instead, they could be going outside, enjoying the fresh air and physical activity, or even studying. The internet is accessible to the entire world, so anyone can use it. If your child is on the computer, they are exposed to many vile things that will not be beneficial to them in the future. It's a well - proven fact that the less time you spend watching TV or using the computer, the better your grades will be. I clearly remember my mom always scolding me for being on the computer and getting bad grades. So, she took the computer away for a while, and now I have much better grades. Evidently, being on the computer does not make you smarter. The computer can also cause you to gain a considerable amount of weight. If you're on the computer a lot, you're sitting around, and many people eat while using it. So, you're sitting at the computer, munching on snacks. This can easily lead to weight gain. I know from personal experience that being active, going outside, or exercising really makes you feel good. Once you gain all that weight, it is extremely difficult to lose it. Sitting around like a couch potato is not healthy; you can become obese. You might say you're content with your weight, but no one can claim it's healthy. A significant number of people have died due to being severely overweight. It takes a huge toll on your life. If you don't want to risk dying from being too heavy, then I strongly advise you to get off the computer and go outside to live your life. The last major drawback of computers is the drama they cause. Most people have Facebook, AIM, or other similar platforms. If you ask anyone with one of these accounts, they will most likely say they've gotten into a fight through one of them. Additionally, there's a new platform called Formspring that allows you to be anonymous, and people go on others' pages and say horrible things. One of my friends was a victim of this, and it really ruined them. Moreover, there are so many people on Facebook who lie about who they are, and anyone can easily find out personal information about you. Nowadays, people know how to hack into others' computers and obtain sensitive data. So, computers can not only be unhealthy but also potentially deadly. Why would you want any of these negative things to happen when it's so easy to reduce your computer time? Remember, computers don't help your brain, they can make you fat, and they cause a lot of drama. So, please use the computer sparingly.
1067	1069	1	3	"A large number of people in @ORGANIZATION1 use computers for many different types of tasks on a regular basis. Computers are indeed very beneficial to society. Even though some people, especially during @MONTH1, tend to use their computers too much, the tasks they complete with them help our world run smoothly. One significant way that computers benefit our society is that they enable us to complete tasks such as writing a paper, researching information, and much more, at a much faster pace. For example, if you, as part of @ORGANIZATION1, needed to quickly print an article in the paper about the devastating earthquake in @LOCATION1, computers would be of great help because they would allow you to type the article much quicker than having to handwrite it. This ability to complete things quickly and efficiently is a major advantage of computers. Another reason why computers are very beneficial to society is that they allow us to maintain relationships with people from long - distance. Since around @DATE1, computers have played a crucial role. For instance, I've moved halfway across the country, and computers have allowed me to stay in touch with friends and family. In a recent survey, @PERCENT1 of college graduates said that computers not only let them stay in touch with friends who stayed in town but also allow them to actually see each other through video calls. Our society benefits from computers because they connect us to the world. Another important aspect is that computers allow people to gain knowledge very quickly. Search engines such as @ORGANIZATION3, @ORGANIZATION4, @CAPS3, and more enable us to research anything we want to know at just the click of a button. This ability to access information rapidly has a great impact on people. Without this easy access to knowledge, people would have a harder time becoming more intellectual and intelligent. With that intelligence, they can achieve great things. According to @PERSON1, a well - known computer scientist at @ORGANIZATION2, ""The knowledge people get from computer search engines allows them to better perform @CAPS2 tasks and achieve more in their lives."" Computers benefit society and have a great effect on people when they are balanced with other important things such as exercise and socializing. They teach us new information quickly, perform tasks efficiently, and allow us to keep in touch with people across the world. If it weren't for computers, things would take longer to get done, and society would not function as effectively. We need computers to perform @CAPS2 tasks and carry out the necessary activities of daily life. In conclusion, computers, when used in a balanced way, are an essential part of modern society."
1068	1070	1	3	I firmly believe that spending a lot of time on the computer is not a good idea because @CAPS1 has various bad things available online. @CAPS1 makes people less intelligent and also makes you extremely lazy. These are the three main reasons why you shouldn't stay on the computer all day. One of the reasons is that the computer exposes you to bad things online, like the risk of kidnaps. I've seen a large number of videos and movies depicting how an older man or woman starts chatting with young kids online, and then they arrange to meet at some place. Subsequently, the young teen or kid never returns. It's a terrifying reality that lurks on the internet. Another reason is that the computer makes you stupid. For example, when I used to be on the computer all day, I would get up to get something to eat. Sometimes, I would absent - mindedly go into the bathroom thinking it was the kitchen. It felt like I was in a daze when I finally got off the computer, as if I had just woken up from a long slumber. My last reason is that the computer makes you lazy. You just sit in front of the computer all the time, on the chair, without getting any sunlight or exercise. The allure of @CAPS1 makes you want to stay there even more, and it's not good for your mind or body. These are my three compelling reasons why you should not stay on the computer for extended periods. The more time you spend on it, the more you'll be inclined to stay. So, don't stay on the computer because there are bad things on it, and @CAPS1 will make you lazy. Please limit your computer time for the sake of your well - being.
1069	1071	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I think that using a computer can have both beneficial and negative impacts on people. The benefits could include gaining knowledge and meeting new people, while the bad effects could be weight gain and a lack of social skills when it comes to talking with friends over the phone or in person. First of all, gaining knowledge through the computer is truly essential. I think this because when your computer crashes or breaks down, having prior knowledge about computers means you would most likely know what to do to fix it. You wouldn't want to have to spend money on anti - software that probably doesn't work effectively. Another reason why using the computer for knowledge - gain is good is that if you aspire to become a computer engineer, all the time you've spent on the computer could really pay off later in life. It would give you a head - start in understanding the field. Secondly, computers can help you meet new people from foreign countries and other states. You don't necessarily have to meet them in person; you can just have a friendly conversation online. This broadens your social circle and exposes you to different cultures and perspectives. The third and last reason why sometimes computers can be bad for you is weight gain. Most people spend so much time on the computer that they don't get enough physical activity. All they do is sit down, munch on unhealthy snacks, and play games or watch videos. This sedentary lifestyle is really bad for your health. In conclusion, using a computer moderately is far better than using it excessively. It can help you gain knowledge, meet new people, but it can also make you gain weight and lead to a lack of social skills. So, it's important to strike a balance in your computer usage.
1070	1072	1	3	Dear editor, @CAPS1, while you might think that people spending a lot of time on the computer is good, I strongly disagree. People should get more exercise. Also, they don't get enough fresh air. Finally, they don't spend enough time with family and friends. Now, we have to determine whether people should spend a large amount of time on the computers. Those people who spend a great deal of time on the computer could be going outside every day to get exercise. Some parents have unfortunately got their kids hooked on playing on the computer all day instead of going outside to get exercise. There are so many outdoor activities they could engage in. They could ride bikes through the neighborhood, zip around on scooters, play basketball at the local court, or have a game of wiffle ball in the backyard. They can also go swimming at the local pool, participate in various sports teams, or go to a playground to have fun. Finally, they could take a long, leisurely walk on the beach, enjoying the sand between their toes and the sound of the waves. People need to get fresh air instead of being cooped up on the computer all day. They can go sit on the beach for a while, soak up the sun, and listen to the ocean. They can go outside to watch their kids play or attend their games like baseball or basketball. They can also go outside just to enjoy the beauty of nature. They can sit on their porch to wait for their kids to get off the bus from school. Those people who love to play on the computer don't spend enough quality time with their family or friends. They could visit their family more often, perhaps take a weekend trip to see relatives. They can go out for lunch with their friends, catch up on each other's lives in person. Also, they can spend more time doing things with their kids, like going to the park or having a movie night at home. Even though there is a chat function on the computer, it's always nicer to talk to your friends face - to - face. The time has come to decide whether people spending a lot of time on the computer is a bad thing or not. They don't get enough exercise every day, which can lead to various health problems. They also don't get enough fresh air, which is essential for good health. Finally, they don't spend sufficient time with their friends and family, which can strain relationships. So now, you need to write a letter to your local newspaper, clearly stating which side you're on in this important debate.
1071	1073	1	3	To my opinion, computers have a negative effect on people. I think it has a negative impact because it causes people to get less exercise. You spend less time with your family and friends, and it distracts you from getting things done. First of all, computers have a negative effect on people because it causes them to get less exercise. For example, there are many football, soccer, and baseball games. Instead of practicing these sports, they will just sit in front of the computer on the webcam all night. Another way is that you can get work done without even leaving your house. You can shop online, stay home and work online, and even go to college. Those things used to involve getting out and around, but now you can just stay at home all day and do those things and be lazy. Second, the computer causes you to interact with people less. Now, when family or friends come over, I went to my friend's place and she didn't even look at me as she was playing computer games. I know that a lot more kids are like this too because I was reading in a magazine that parents are interacting with their kids 30% less as they got a computer. Lastly, I think the computer has a negative effect because it distracts them. It distracts kids during conversations. First of all, when people try to talk with someone on the computer, it is very hard because they are absorbed in what they're doing. Secondly, the computer distracts kids from homework. I know this first - hand because whenever I have to type up assignments, I get distracted and end up going on different websites and not getting my work done. Lastly, it distracts kids from household chores. Some kids just put them to the side and forget to do them because they're busy playing games or surfing the web. I know that if I did that, I'd get in big trouble. Those are the reasons why I think the computer has a negative effect on people. Because it causes them to get less exercise, they don't interact with people as much, and it distracts them. So unless you want all those things happening to you, I suggest you spend less time on the computer!
1072	1074	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 have been complaining about computers in our society. They say they are keeping children inside doing nothing, but really they are helping us so much! The internet is where you can research anything, and tons of helpful ideas come up. Moreover, using a computer helps us with hand - eye coordination. Lastly, computers allow us to stay in touch with people who are far away. Like last year my friend went to Poland, and we were able to talk through our computers! So, lastly, join me and help the world know that computers are good! First off, I would like to say the computer is a good source of information. How would you like it @CAPS5 if you still had to read scrolls from Greece when you could look at information online? Not to mention, when you need to know something really fast, like now you're stuck before a big meeting. Then all you have to do is simply type in what you want to know, then bam! Just like that you know, and off to your meeting. Secondly, using the mouse and keys on a computer can increase your hand - eye coordination. Like my parents always say when I'm typing an essay, 60 words per minute is a good rate. Moreover, out of 100 kids, 80 get better hand - eye coordination after getting good on the computer. A lot of times kids have a lack of coordination, but I have a feeling that if kids use the computer, that will change. Most importantly, the computers help us stay in touch with far - away friends like I mentioned before. I stayed in touch with my Polish buddy. Moreover, a lot of people don't have cell phones so they have an @CAPS4, gmail, facebook, myspace, or a twitter. All of this allows us to stay in touch and keep us updated on our friends' lives. This is very important because if we are social, then we will get out with our friends and do stuff, which is very important for our well - being. In conclusion, @CAPS5 it is good for our society to have computers in our lives. @CAPS5 will help us in the future. We will get good grades on projects because of our online sources. We will be healthy with hand - eye coordination from using the mouse and keyboard. Lastly, we will have many friends. These are all very important in life. So keep computers!
1073	1075	1	3	Dear readers, I write to you today about the effects of computer usage. I feel that there are some positive and some negative effects from using the computer. You can talk to people, and you can get work done, but if you are on this too much, you'll start to gain bad health and miss other things in life. Throughout the computer, there are many ways to communicate with others, which is an amazing thing. Whether it be through a game, typing, or real chatting, it's very important to talk to people, and this makes things much easier than going out and talking to people face - to - face. For example, pen - pals. Over the years, people have written letters to their pen - pals, but now you can send it over email, and email doesn't cost any money. Just type up your letter, click a button, and done. Another positive point about computers is that you're able to get work done on it. From work for a business to school work, it doesn't matter. You hear of people using computers to do work all of the time. Why do you think there are computer labs at school or desks with computers in offices? Computers have become advanced and the easiest thing to get things done with. Presentations, essays, graphs, anything. A concern I have of the computer is that people are becoming too addicted to computers. Many younger people are overusing computers, which leads to bad health. When people sit in front of a computer screen all day, only getting up to grab something to eat, people will become obese. To stay healthy, people need to be outside and exercise. We need to make rules to keep people out in the open and give the younger generation a healthy life. So, I have mixed feelings about computers. They can be amazing for a while but only for a while. And if you can't see this, open your eyes and realize that a balanced approach to computer use is necessary.
1074	1076	1	3	"To the editor of the @ORGANIZATION2, I am writing to state my opinion as to whether computers benefit or harm society. I believe that computers are a great tool for several reasons. First, computers are a learning resource, and a way people stay updated with the world around them. Also, computers keep us connected with friends and family more easily. Clearly, computers are more helpful to people than they are harmful. Life as we know it today would be greatly altered without the advances in computer technology that have been made over the past few decades. Today, if I need to know something, whether it be for @ORGANIZATION1 or my own reasons, I can almost instantly look it up and get answers from many different sources. This helps people to be more educated and updated with the world around them. Dr. @PERSON2 from @ORGANIZATION1 recently performed a study on high @ORGANIZATION1 teenagers and concluded that, ""@CAPS1 with access to computers scored significantly better on standard testing due to background information they have acquired while online"". Along with the internet, there are programs such as @ORGANIZATION4, and @ORGANIZATION3, which help people to learn a new language, or write more effectively on the computer. Also, computers keep us updated with events that are happening in the world. For example, when the earthquake devastated @LOCATION1, I first saw it on the news, but got very few details. I then looked it up online and immediately got the death toll, the aid that was being given, and ways I could help donate. Without computers, I would have known none of this. Another reason as to why computers are so helpful to society is that they are tools that help us to keep in touch with others. With things like Facebook and @CAPS2, I can chat with people, invite friends over, and even plan parties. Without computers, I would need to call each person individually, but with computers, I can write one message and send it to everyone all at once. This gives me more time to do things like play outside and exercise. Also, things like @CAPS3 and Facebook help people to stay in touch with old and distant friends. Studies done by @ORGANIZATION5 show that 70% of people with some type of social networking account have a more active social life than those who do not. According to doctor @PERSON1, this means that these people will have an easier time adapting to different social situations than those who do not. Clearly, this is a great benefit. In conclusion, the computer helps society a great deal more than it hinders it. It easily allows people to stay educated, updated, and connected. It helps people stay aware of the world around them and educated about everything. It makes things that would otherwise take lots of time very quick, giving people the chance to do other things such as playing outside. It keeps people socially capable and active, and allows people to connect with others. Without a doubt, computers are a very good thing and will continue to play a vital role in our lives."
1075	1077	1	3	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, computers have effects on people and their lives. A lot of people, especially children, spend their time after school playing games, on MySpace, Facebook, and checking their email addresses. Instead of going on computers all the time, I think that children and adults should go out and have a good time. There's not a problem with going on the computer once in a while, but if you spend all day on a computer, then that's pretty bad. Adults shouldn't let their children spend all day on a computer, and adults shouldn't either because it won't help your life. Computers could mess your life up by the choices you make, the pictures you put up, and the things you write. For example, if you have a MySpace or Facebook and you put bad pictures up, in your future when you want a good job, they could just look back at that and say, ""Look at this. I don't want this person working for me."" And there you go, messing up your future. Instead of going on the computer all the time, you could go outside, do sports to keep your body healthy, go out in the world and learn new things, or even plan trips to go on with your family, walk around, and do stuff like that instead of going on the computers and putting yourself at risk of losing a job or messing up your future. You shouldn't let computers mess your life up because if you do, then your life won't be the same. Children could mess their lives up because of the things they wrote or pictures they put up, which other kids could see and be mean to them and talk about them for the rest of their school year. Things could even lead to a fight over one little word you said or picture you put up because you thought it was cute. Sex offenders are on computers, and some people don't even know it until they get taken away or killed. Parents don't always know when there is a sex offender around or online talking to you or your children, trying to go meet up with them. They also could put fake pictures up to try to get you to speak to them or to get you to meet them somewhere so they could take you. So, you shouldn't let the computers get to you. You should take control of your computer use and protect yourself and your family from the potential dangers."
1076	1078	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1: you recently posed a thought - provoking question in your Newspaper, the @CAPS2 yourk @CAPS3, asking if the readers were for or against technology. I whole - heartedly support computers because they offer one a great opportunity to learn about different people all over the world and their rich cultures. They save massive amounts of time in today's fast - paced, hustle - bustle society, and you can easily talk to people online via certain user - friendly computer programs. With a computer, one can access scores of detailed information about foreign countries and their unique cultures. I read an interesting article in the @CAPS4 @CAPS3 about a man who was participating in a church program. In this program, a foreign citizen would come to @LOCATION2 for a while to make friends and learn about the @LOCATION1. This man, @PERSON1, was assigned a woman from the farms of @CAPS6 who had never been out of the fields. @PERSON1 thought it would be nice to welcome her in his house with a familiar setting. Unfortunately, he knew nothing about @CAPS6. However, he did have a computer, and he quickly retreated to it so he could learn everything about her home. When the woman stepped into his door, she was ecstatic to feel like she was home again. She ended up staying with @PERSON1 and getting married. If he had not charmed her with his knowledge from the computer, she might not have stayed and had a wonderful life with him. Also, @PERSON2 from @ORGANIZATION2 says that language students such as those learning Spanish and French have a @PERCENT1 higher success rate if they have a computer to learn more about the countries. He says the average grade for kids with a computer is an A, but the average grade for kids without a computer is a @CAPS9+. Therefore, having a computer to learn about faraway places and people can ensure happiness and success in the future. Computers also save a massive amount of time. In the school Newspaper, @PERSON6 told about her homework problem. ""One night I had a huge amount of homework. I had vocabulary words galore to deal with. I had to look up each word in the huge dictionary, and I was failing @CAPS11 because I just didn't have the time for my homework! Then my family bought me a computer. It was so nice using the online dictionary. I could finish my homework in @NUM1 minutes compared to @NUM2 hours! I was finally doing well in @CAPS11."" Without her computer, @PERSON6 would have had to spend @NUM2 hours on @CAPS11. She would have just kept failing without her time - saving computer. Also, @PERSON3 says that @PERCENT2 of people get to work faster when they look up traffic reports on the computer instead of listening on the radio. He says that @PERCENT3 of people get a raise because their boss is so impressed with their consistent timing. As you can see, time is a valuable thing which computers can help save. Finally, computers allow one to talk online. A student once had the misfortune to break one of his vertebrae. The doctor told him that he would not be able to participate in school for a while. The student, @PERSON5, came up with a plan to speak to his teachers via his laptop and webcam. Everyday, the teachers would give @PERSON5 an update over his computer. When he finally marched back into school, @PERSON5 barely had any work to make up because his teachers had interacted with him over the computer. Without his computer, @PERSON5 would have had a month's worth of work and learning to make up, which would have been overwhelming. Also, @PERSON4 of @ORGANIZATION1 says that students that communicate with their families during college have better relationships after college. Obviously, being able to talk to someone over the computer is a useful thing to have. In conclusion, having a family computer is a very good thing. Not only does it allow people to learn about places other than their home, it also gives us more time and allows us to talk to others without ever leaving the comfort of home. I recommend that everyone who wants an easier life should invest in a computer."
1077	1079	1	3	"Dear newspapers, I think that computers have a positive effect on people because you can conveniently chat online. There are various electronics designed for children that they can easily plug up to their computer and learn different useful stuff. And you can securely pay your bills on the computer. People who have no phone or don't want to leave the house at that moment and have a computer can go on chat rooms or a local website to chat with friends and family. Also, many people who have popular websites like Facebook, MySpace, etc., can find new people and discover that they have so many things in common. And some people do find that special @CAPS1 person that they've been looking for. I think that they just recently came out with a new electronic for little kids like Leaf Frog that they can plug up to a computer/laptop. With this device, they can learn their alphabet, counting numbers, and even spelling in an engaging way. This is a great product for little kids so they can use the extra learning opportunity over the @DATE1 or after school, so they can stay smart and learn both in school and out of school. One day I asked my mother what she was doing, and she said she was paying the light bill. I was like, ""How can you do that?"" and she said through a website, but I forgot what it's called. You can pay your bills right there. So instead of going out and going to a local store where they pay bills, if you get a computer, you can do that in your home with no hassle. So people who publish the newspaper, I think and I hope you think too that this is a good response that tells you good things about a computer. And I hope it sticks around for a long time as it continues to bring so many benefits to our lives."
1078	1080	1	3	"People are asking me, ""@CAPS1, do you think we should spend more or less time on computers?"" I firmly say we should spend less time on the computer because children spend an excessive amount of time on online games. Second, kids and adults spend way too much time on MySpace, Facebook, MSN, and even AIM. My third reason is that children should be outside playing and exercising. These are my three reasons why we should spend less time on computers. My first reason we should all spend less time on the computer is that children play so many online games, such as @CAPS2 of Warcraft, @CAPS3, Soldier Front, etc. A big problem with kids playing these games is that they become addicted to them and will play for hours on end. Children should be outside getting bigger muscles and strong bones. Kids keep playing these games and are ruining their lives by neglecting physical activity and real - world interactions. This is my first reason why we should spend less time on the computer. My second reason why we should spend less time on computers is that children and adults spend too much time on the following: MySpace, Facebook, Twitter, AIM, MSN, etc. These online pages cause people to go on one to connect to their friends, but they also cause a lot of drama and could lead to fights or rumors. About @PERCENT1 of kids and adults go on these online pages every day. It's time they spent more time outside or hanging out with their friends in person. My last but not the least reason is that kids should be outside playing instead of being on the computer. Children should go outside with their friends and play sports or games, something that doesn't involve the computer. This is my third reason why children should not be spending more time on computers. As I said before, people should spend less time on the computer. Kids spend too much time on online games. Adults and kids spend too much time on online pages. And last, children should be playing outside. It's time we put a timer on our computer and spend more time outside to lead healthier and more fulfilling lives."
1079	1081	1	3	Dear @LOCATION1 @CAPS1, I think computers have bad effects on the people in this world. Yes, they have their pluses and negatives, but computers are somewhat dangerous. Some people who use computers use them for the wrong reasons. Some people search porn sites, which are inappropriate and can have a negative impact on mental health, and hack into servers, which is illegal and can cause damage to systems. I believe computers are supposed to be used for positive things not negative things. Another reason why I'm against computers is that the people online are dangerous. A lot of people think they're talking to one person but it's really not that person. It could be anyone with malicious intent. Nowadays, people just carelessly give out personal information to random people. This is how kidnappings and murders happen in our world. @CAPS3 - @CAPS2 is also a major problem with computers. (@CAPS3 - @CAPS2) - means @CAPS2 someone over the computer. The effect of that is someone getting hurt and a crime not being solved easily. People also spend way too much time using computers. Instead of getting outside and enjoying the fresh air and beauty of nature, they waste time on computers. This is also the cause of a lot of obesity. People become obese due to not getting out and exercising. This world uses computers for the wrong reasons. This needs to change so that we can reduce the risks and negative impacts associated with excessive computer use.
1080	1082	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1, You use a computer a lot right? Good if you do because do you believe that experts are questioning why @CAPS5 use them a lot? Well, I think people need them because it's how @CAPS5 stay informed about what's going on in the world. It's how @CAPS5 know how the weather is like so potential accidents can be avoided. You can turn on your @CAPS2.V., but then you have to wait for the specific information you want to come on. So you decide, @ORGANIZATION1, should @CAPS5 be outside more? Don't you need to know what's going on too? Of course you do, everyone does. I think that it is extremely important that @CAPS5 know if a meteor is about to strike the world, right? President @PERSON2 even says the computer is where @PERCENT2 of the world gets information on what's going on. Are you just going to sit there and not listen to the president of the @LOCATION1? I don't think so. I'm @PERCENT1 sure that @ORGANIZATION1 doesn't want to be known as the accident - prone State. Well, that's why @CAPS5 need the computer! For people to know if it will snow, sleet, or if there is bad traffic, then @CAPS5 need to go to the internet to find out when, where, and what time. The CEO of @CAPS3, @PERSON1, says, ""When someone says '@CAPS5 might be getting some snow or rain,' then they usually go right to the internet."" You can turn on your @CAPS2.V. to find out what's going on, but not all of the information you will want or need to know will be available. So you will have to wait. The internet just provides the information right on the spot. No waiting involved! (unless you have a bad internet connection). Do you think these reasons are making a good argument? I do. Do you use your computer for finding out what's going on, what the weather is like, instead of relying solely on the @LOCATION2? If so, I think you would agree with me that computers are essential for staying informed."
1081	1083	1	3	I think that using a computer is fine. The reason is that if you have family members living far away, instead of just hearing their voices on the phone, they can talk to each other and, most importantly, see each other. You can also show them the cool new things you have. When you have a loved one who is away on a trip, you can still see them. Computers are helpful when your car is broken down or when you don't have a car. You can buy stuff from stores in the comfort of your home. Almost everything you can get from a store is available because they have online stores that can mail items to you. Also, now you can buy food on the internet and lots more. Computers can save money as they can tell you where to get good prices. There are lots of dating sites to meet different people and go out, and you can share your comments. Texting on Facebook can let you save money by texting for free. You can play free online games with your friends. You can make a website and watch movies and shows online. There are just a lot of things you can do on a computer. I know lots of people don't go outside to exercise, but I agree with some experts. A lot of people need to lose weight or need to go out into the real world more. Because of this technology, some people are overweight and don't go out much. They eat lots of food. But computers are very helpful in lots of ways and are so much fun. Those are my reasons why I think that computers are great and should be used more.
1082	1084	1	3	Computers are a good benefit for people. First, a computer is a helpful machine in different ways. For example, I personally go on the computer to check for my homework. It is also good because whenever you don't know something, you can just go on the internet and search for it. Computers won't affect our health if we don't use them for a long time. They can help students make projects by using Word, Excel, and other Microsoft software. So I think computers are a great machine for people to have. Secondly, using a computer can also help you socialize with people. Many students, including me, use Facebook. So even if we are not right next to each other, we can still talk. Computers can be used to make new friends too. But as our health teacher, @PERSON1, said, “There are people you don't know, and we are not supposed to give out our information.” Computers can be useful for friends who live far away. If your friend moved to another state, you could use the computer to chat with him. There are many ways to socialize with computers. Lastly, exercising is important to everyone, but using computers doesn't mean we can't go outside and exercise anymore. Maybe computers are addictive, but if you keep track of time and use the computer for about half an hour at a time, you can still get the exercise you need. Exercising is an easy thing to do. Children like to exercise, so there shouldn't be a problem. For instance, my neighbor always comes over to my house and asks if I want to play football while I'm talking with someone on the computer, and I still go outside and play. So the computer is a great machine that isn't very addictive, so parents don't have to worry about children exercising. I think computers have great effects on people, like going online to do research or talk to friends. Grown - ups need them to work. So that proves computers are a great machine.
1083	1085	1	3	Computers have helped people tremendously over the past years. Thanks to computers, scientists have found cures for diseases, jobs have become easier, and communication with friends or family has become affordable. I believe that computers have a positive effect on people because they educate people about places in the world, help people with their jobs, and give people a chance to talk to others without having to pay anything. If someone is planning a trip to a country, they can go on the computer to learn more about that country and its culture. Another thing they might do is go to a website that can help them find affordable flights or a hotel to stay at. If a child is doing a report about a country in @LOCATION1, they can go on the computer to find out facts about that country. Computers educate people about places all over the world. You can go on a website that has videos and short clips about what has been going on and learn about current events at no cost. If you want to see a friend for her birthday but don't have the money to fly halfway around the world to see her, you can video - chat with her. Computers help people save money by allowing them to talk with friends, family, and even co - workers on the computer. Computers have been very helpful ever since they were invented. They help people learn about places all over the world and about anything they want to learn. They also make jobs and work easier and help people save a lot of money by talking to people on the computer instead of on the phone. Computers have improved dramatically over the years. The screens used to be so small, and you would have to press all these buttons just to boot it up. Now, computers can be as big as a flat - screen @CAPS1, and you can turn them on with just a push of a button. Who knows what computers will be like @NUM1 years from now? It's certain that they will continue to bring more convenience to our lives.
1084	1086	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 post, I have been thinking about the way computers affect our lives. On this very topic, I am agreeing with the experts who say people are spending too much time on their computers and less time doing other things. I do believe everyone, including myself, spends a lot of time online. Even if it's for research, don't you think it would be better to open a book to get the information? The same goes for computer games. Instead of playing virtual kickball, wouldn't it be better to play it outside? The main points I'm trying to make are that computers hold us back, they are not physically able to help us, and going away from the computer, or even going outside, would be better. I mentioned how computers hold us back. The more time we spend on them, the more daylight we waste that could be used for other things. I say this because instead of going outside, we want to stare at a screen and play games or chat with friends. Online chat especially has an effect on most people because we are trading in a fun day outdoors for one where we just talk online and stay indoors. I also believe that if we had a time limit on computers, it would be more of an incentive to be social and go out and do things. Unfortunately, computers prevent us from doing that, and all we end up doing is waiting around doing nothing. Another reason is that computers can't physically help us and make us active. I can relate to this because I am a cheerleader, and I am constantly on YouTube learning how to stretch and do new things. Even though I learn and spend time watching how it's done, I get hurt and can't do it. That's why I try to get closer to a gymnastics teacher who can physically help and interact with me to correct my form. Lastly, I believe that the less time we spend on computers would help us and be so much better. I know that after an hour or more online, I feel lazy and don't want to do anything. However, if I go outside, I feel full of energy and become active. Being off the computer feels better and is better for us. To sum it all up, computers are great to have, but too much of them isn't good. It really does hold us back and is worse for our health. Oh, and one last thing, too much time on computers makes you less active. However, thank you for reading. We should all be more aware of our computer usage and find a better balance in our lives.
1085	1087	1	3	You say that computers are bad for today's society? @CAPS1, I'm here to prove you wrong and tell you that they can actually benefit today's society. Maybe some kids don't have phones, so they can go log onto Facebook and get everything a phone has to offer and more. School is full of homework assignments and projects. Using computer programs helps a lot and gives a professional touch. And how could you forget Google, the most famous online system that everyone loves? You can do just about anything with that page. So, think again when you say computers are bad for society. Facebook, www.facebook.com, is one of the most visited pages on the internet for all different ages. It definitely benefits you. Logging on, you can see your friends' profiles, their newest updates on pictures, videos, and their lives. You can get every little detail. If you don't have a phone, no worries. Facebook has a chat system, so you can talk with friends and relatives. Maybe there's a family party coming up, you can get inboxed with all the information and visit the relatives' homepages to see how they've been doing. @CAPS3, if you haven't logged into Facebook yet, you definitely will now! “This project will be done on the computer.” How many times do you hear a teacher say that? Almost every time you're given an assignment! Windows and @ORGANIZATION1 programs will really benefit you when you need school help. Let's say you've been assigned a project to create a product commercial in computer class. You can hop right onto Windows Movie Maker and get all the help you need. You'll have the ability to create your project right on the program so it looks and sounds professional. One program you can always use throughout life for presentations is PowerPoint. In my history class, we were assigned to research a famous person from the @DATE1's and do a presentation. When I got my assignment, I went right to PowerPoint and got a great grade! Lastly, there's @ORGANIZATION1 Word, used for all kinds of projects or homeworks, especially for writing papers or short stories. With spell - check, you're guaranteed a better grade! Google! Everyone knows it and everyone loves it. This web hit can be used for just about anything. From searching for pictures and information for a school project, watching videos of songs, friends, or TV shows you love or want to check up on, to looking at websites. Some say the internet holds people from exercising, but Google can show you videos of special workouts or websites on healthy eating or an online exercise group or fitness club. So now you see that the internet benefits us tremendously! “Have you changed your mind? Have you listened closely?” @CAPS3, so your life just became a whole lot easier. By using Facebook for socializing, @ORGANIZATION1 and Windows programs for school, and Google for life and health, you have just benefitted from my writing and from using modern technology, the computer.
1086	1088	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, Have you ever yearned to see the entire world with just a simple click of a button? It's as straightforward as going out and buying a computer. These days, computers are becoming increasingly popular. Some individuals think that people rely on computers excessively. I'm here to assert that such an accusation is baseless. First, computers are extremely useful for schoolwork. Let's assume you have an essay that requires @NUM1 words or more. You can effortlessly use the word count feature, and then you'll have the exact number of words. Moreover, if you need to look up information about a particular topic, you can simply type in the word and conduct a search. Instantly, you'll have millions of options to choose from. If you encounter a homework assignment that you don't understand, you can search for how to do it on the internet. But this is just the beginning. Another reason computers are so wonderful is that you can meet and interact with people from all over the world and learn about their cultures. You can enter a free chatroom and meet someone from @LOCATION1. In the process, you'll also gain insights into their culture. This can also be an effective way to learn another language. If the person is fluent in @CAPS1 and @CAPS2, they can teach you. You might even get a glimpse of how an @CAPS2 household functions. Then, you can draw comparisons between the way you both live your lives. Finally, you can gain a better understanding of the world around you. There are numerous websites where you can obtain a live satellite feed of places in every corner of the globe. You can also conduct research on the planet itself. You can learn about the care of the earth and what occurs within it. You might also discover more about nature, such as plants and animals. You can even explore space. You can learn about planets, whether there is life, water, or anything else on them. These are all things you can research. To sum it all up, you can complete your schoolwork, interact with people worldwide, and learn about the world around you. This covers only a fraction of everything you can do on computers. However, don't spend all day on them. Make sure to go outside and have a great time too!
1087	1089	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, I have several questions for you and I'm hoping you can answer them. I've been wondering. Do you have any computers in your house? If so, how many? Also, do you enjoy using the computer? I'm trying to figure out how many people don't use computers because I'm curious to ask them how they manage to get by without one! Computers are indispensable in our modern lives. Virtually everything in the world can be accessed through one computer. You can talk, send emails, and even see people because nowadays, most people have a webcam attached to their computer. I want to tell you about all the great things computers do that make our lives so much easier. People are constantly looking for ways to get in touch with others. For example, if your phone runs out of battery, how will you tell your friend what time you're going to meet at a certain place? You can easily send her a text from the computer. You can either use your screen - name to text someone or visit websites like verizon.com, at&t.com, sprint.com, etc., and text people from there. This will save you from standing your friend up and feeling guilty about it. Has there ever been a time when you needed a phone number but couldn't find your telephone book? It's happened to me. But you know what I do? I go on the computer and visit yellowpages.com and simply look up the restaurant or place on the website. It's that easy. You can look up almost anything on the computer, including prices, places, and facts. Most of the time, accurate information will be available. Computers are very helpful when you need assistance with historical, scientific, and @CAPS2 facts. They are a part of our daily lives. People need them for communication, finding telephone numbers, or getting facts about anything. A significant portion of someone's life can be stored on the computer. If you have poor handwriting, you can type up your paper and submit it neatly. As I said before, computers are essential in our present - day lives. @CAPS3, after reading this, I'm sure you'll agree.
1088	1090	1	3	Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1's opinion about computers is that they bring great benefits to people. They offer help when people need it and provide entertainment. That's why computers are beneficial. @CAPS1's first reason is that a computer can be a great help. For instance, if you have to write a paper and need to look up some research, you can use the computer. Or if there's a long mathematical equation, you can look up the formula. As you can see, this is how computers benefit people. @CAPS1's second reason is that it offers entertainment. There are social networks like MySpace and Twitter. If you like to watch TV or listen to music, there are also dedicated websites for that. So, this is why I say computers provide entertainment too. @CAPS1's third reason is that it helps with communication. If you're in different countries and can't meet in person, you can talk to others through instant messaging or a webcam. Or if you're homeschooled and don't get to see other kids your age often, you can talk to them on the computer. As you can see, this is why I say computers are very useful. They offer entertainment, enable communication, and assist people. In conclusion, computers are truly beneficial in multiple aspects of our lives.
1089	1091	1	3	Dear editor of the @CAPS1 @CAPS2, People often claim that technology is having a widespread impact on everyone. Computers play an active and positive role in our daily lives. They help us with school projects, allow us to understand cultures around the world, and give us the ability to communicate with friends and family no matter where they are. Our school assigns a large number of projects, and the computer is our primary tool. If you plan to travel to a far - off place, you're likely to research it on the computer first and then make your travel plans. It's also commonly used to interact with friends on platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and @CAPS3. Computers are great for learning and communication. To start with, as eighth - graders, we're preparing for high school. This means we have to do projects, reports, and research on the computer. The computer enables us to find information for a project or create a diagram or data table for a survey. Many people use this approach in their jobs too. They write reports on celebrities and famous historical figures. Sometimes, books can't provide all the information we need. So, we can simply look up the person's name, and we'll find hundreds of websites with information and photographs. Additionally, computers allow you to book flights, check prices, and look up tax rates. Sometimes, people don't want to drive to a local car dealership. So, they go online to a car - selling website and can view all the features of the car, its price, and mileage. The only way to get tickets for many events is through the internet. There are websites that let you book any kind of flight, whether it's to Florida or to @LOCATION1. If you want to know how the economy is doing, you can look up tax rates and find out how much our country is in debt. You can even learn how much an average family pays in taxes each year. Computers are highly resourceful at @CAPS2. They give us the ability to do more than we can imagine. Most importantly, computers have created a way for us to talk to friends and family around the world. Facebook and Twitter are very popular these days. They let you talk to friends, post photos, and share about your personal life. There are also lifestyle games on these platforms. @CAPS3 is not as popular anymore because it doesn't offer as many features. It only allows you to talk to friends, which is why fewer people use it. People want to do more than just talk. It's clear that computers have evolved over time. These days, they enable us to talk with friends, conduct research and projects, and book flights and buy cars. Our school curriculum has many projects and reports that can only be completed with the help of a computer. We can research people and places, get pictures, book flights for long - distance trips, and buy cars and other items online. We can also communicate with friends on Facebook and Twitter. In conclusion, computers have a positive influence on people.
1090	1092	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4, Are you constantly telling your kids to do their homework and get off the computer? Well, I might have a solution. Computers don't bring much benefit to our society today. People are spending too much time on them, missing out on enjoying the outdoors, and taking away time that could be spent with friends and family. I believe setting a daily limit on computer use might help solve these problems. Computers can be extremely distracting, and people use them too frequently. Staring at the computer screen can damage your eyes and harm your brain cells. This is something that both kids and adults often overlook. You need your brain cells for school, sports, and other activities. Computers can also distract you from finishing your work, and then you have to stay up late to complete your homework. Homework should always come before computer use. Time passes quickly when you're clicking and typing. Before you know it, it's ten o'clock at night, and your work is still unfinished. Since my schedule is very busy after school, I try to finish my work first and then go on the computer before my dance class. This way, I can catch up with my friends and relax. Taking time away from the computer is a wise decision. As @DATE1 approaches, the weather is going to be lovely, and you don't want to waste a beautiful day sitting in front of the computer. The human body needs oxygen, and clearly, computers don't provide that. A great way to get oxygen is to go outside for some exercise and fresh air. Playing outside offers so much more than a computer. You can swim, jump, or play sports. My doctor once told me, ""Everyone should have at least an hour of exercise a day."" You can't achieve that by sitting at your computer. Next time the sun is shining, regardless of the season, go outside and take a break from electronics. Spending time with family and friends is a wonderful way to stay off the computer. Friends and family are not to be taken for granted. They are there for you when you're feeling down and can make you laugh. When your relatives come to visit after a long time, you don't want to spend that time on the computer. Talking and catching up with them is a great way to reconnect. During family holidays, we turn off our computers to spend quality time with each other. Friends and family are precious gifts. So, don't let your computer use ruin your friendships or family relationships. Get away from the computer and build those important bonds. In conclusion, we should limit our computer use to make the most of our time with loved ones and the outdoors."
1091	1093	1	3	Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 has come to my attention that some people have been concerned about using computers too much. Well, I firmly disagree with this statement. I think the computer effectively teaches you hand - eye coordination. When you use a computer, your eyes focus on the screen while your hands deftly move the mouse or type on the keyboard. The computer also lets you connect with more foreign people and places. Through various online platforms, you can interact with diverse cultures and individuals from across the globe. Lastly, computers are excellent tools that help you communicate with others. As recently stated, I think computers are useful because they help with your hand - eye coordination. For example, when you write papers for school or a document for work, you're using the coordination. You might not even notice that once you get the hang of typing, you tend to move your fingers faster across the keys. This machine is a beautiful invention; please don't take @CAPS1 away! The computer is integral to everyday life and is very useful for learning new things about far - away places and people. Another thing that you don't realize when using a computer is that the information you get is not just from someone in your vicinity but from long - distance places. How would you get that information without spending a ton on airfare or gas? The computer is the quickest way to find out information! Finally, the computer is an important resource because you can chat with your friends. A @CAPS2 researcher showed that computers offer a convenient way to stay in touch. You can chat @CAPS3. I think computers have positive effects on all! They teach hand - eye coordination, they teach you about far - away places, and the computer lets you chat online with your friends! I hope you see the computer the way I do.
1092	1094	1	3	"Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 you know, the majority of people now possess computers. These devices have greatly advanced society and technology in numerous ways. Some people say that computers have negative effects, but that is not true. Computers have influenced people in many beneficial ways. Although some experts want people to use computers less, this technology is required in schools. Kids are told to type their papers, which allows them to finish their assignments faster. This faster completion can lead to kids not staying up too late when doing homework. That is better for their physical and mental health. Computers also develop hand - eye coordination, which is an essential skill for later in life, whether it's for driving, playing sports, or using other tools. In my opinion, computers have greatly contributed to technology. They are letting us explore places that no human has ever or could ever go, like the depths of the ocean or distant galaxies through virtual simulations. We can make and distribute items much faster with the help of computer - aided design and manufacturing. In addition, computers also let people learn about far - away places, different cultures, and different people. Through online courses, documentaries, and social media, computers can expand everyone's horizons and let them know about places and things that they never knew existed. Social media platforms, with one of the largest number of members, are very popular. Facebook is a website that people use to communicate. More than @PERCENT1 of most students in an average school have one. They communicate there more than they could without computers. Computers aren't making people ""anti - social"" or making them interact with friends less; they're actually enabling more frequent and diverse conversations. Computers are letting people communicate daily with people from all around, without having to worry about running out of cellphone minutes. Overall, computers are letting people broaden their horizons and discover a wealth of new things. They are more of a benefit than a burden. Computers are truly the next best thing since sliced bread."
1093	1095	1	3	Dear Newspaper, I thought that I should express my concern. @CAPS4 are becoming too dependent on computers. @CAPS4 need to go outside more and be physically active. While some people @MONTH1 think we're not wasting our time on the computer, I strongly disagree. We should only go on the computer if it is necessary. People are always coming up with @CAPS2 gaming ideas to draw people in, but what people don't realize is that it doesn't only waste their time but also our money. Electricity bills are through the roof because of constant computer use. Also, instead of going out to meet @CAPS1, people are staying home and talking on social networking sites, which makes them less social in real - life situations. Children are not enrolling in sports, which makes them lose any physical strength they would get from regular exercise. Also, children could be getting overweight by just sitting there with no physical activities. @CAPS2 ideas like Microsoft Word are fine, but going on the computer every day just for games is not. Teachers, parents, and everyone need to show these people that the computer is not the only thing in life. Computers can benefit us very well by letting us have knowledge of something at the tip of our fingers. However, computers can and will take away family and friend time. Now, I'm not saying that computers are completely bad, but what I'm saying is that it affects everyone around you, not just the person that's using it. What @CAPS4 need to do is get together and unite. @CAPS4 need to go outside more and exercise. @CAPS4 need to limit computer use with the help of adults. Therefore, let's make this a better place and get out and have a little less time for going on to the computer.
1094	1096	1	3	I think that we should have computers. Because it helps us find people and it helps us talk to people and it helps you search for things too. For instance, if I can have a brother that I never knew before, then I can use the computer to find that brother through genealogy websites or social media. Then I can talk to my friends online if I go to MySpace or @CAPS1 because you can, in @MONTH1, be able to have friends on MySpace. And by searching on the computer, you can find new things and you can look up things like the weather in a different country or state. I can find out how cold it is in Texas, and you can search and look up to see how old a particular thing can be or how old it can get. In conclusion, computers are valuable tools that offer us the ability to connect with others and gain knowledge easily.
1095	1097	1	3	Dear fellow citizens, @CAPS1 think if you had to get a book for every question you had. That would take a long time to even get the book, let alone read it. Computers have helped the modern world with answering questions, staying in touch with long - distance friends, and providing entertainment. Computers have helped us with more than those things. The @CAPS2 is such a universal thing that it's hard to come up with all of the helpful things it does. For one, the @CAPS2 helps us stay in contact with our friends that are far away without talking on the phone with them. Sites like @CAPS3 and @CAPS4 allow us to communicate and/or play with them. @CAPS1 think if the only way to talk with a friend from a different place would be to pick up the phone and call them, well, your friendship would disappear very quickly. This would happen because no one usually has the time to pick up the phone and talk to the person and do nothing else. Well, when you talk to them on the @CAPS2, you can do other things. For example, if I wanted to, I could talk to someone on the @CAPS2 and clean my room at the same time. Furthermore, computers allow us to play games or watch funny videos or anything else that is entertaining. On top of that, I remember when my brother would let me use the computer to play games again. I was excited. Also, computers can play movies, @CAPS5 shows, and videos. If you ever miss a show, you can go to the website of the show and watch it. This could save someone time and effort. Lastly, the computers are much more efficient in looking for things. It is much faster than looking through the library, and you don't have to leave your home. Although people say that the @CAPS2 is taking away time from reading, well, it really isn't. For everything you want, you can read online, or if you really want to, you can have the @CAPS2 read for you. Reading isn't a problem at all. @NUM1 of America believes that computers help greatly, and how they have more time to do things. The @CAPS2 is being upgraded every day and it keeps getting better and better. In conclusion, I believe that computers are helping us and are not a bad thing. Computers are great for us and good for busy people. Now go and get a @CAPS2 to enhance your life.
1096	1098	1	3	Dear local newspaper, there are several reasons how computers have an effect on people. My position is to convince the local newspaper why certain people shouldn't and should use computers. People get caught up on the internet, or people don't have enough money to explore the world, so they just stay on the internet. In effect, people shouldn't waste their time on the internet because you will get caught up. For example, my friend @PERSON1 stays on the computer more than @NUM1 hours. He tells me that he's on a chat line, hooking up with other people. He forgets about everybody. He's so into the internet. He stops going to school, and he's gaining weight. Now he's just a nobody. He just sits in front of his computer and does nothing. I feel like he just threw his life away just for some stupid chat line. It's not hard to find another person in our city. There are a lot of beautiful young ladies out here to explore. Similarly, people shouldn't waste their time on the internet because you start losing time. For instance, you spend less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. People stop focusing on important things, and start paying attention to other things like the internet. There was a great person. She was so successful. She made tons of money. Until she started losing her focus. She lost her job. She stopped because she was so stuck on Facebook. Facebook is like a place for friends where you could meet other people from different places and you could just find people to date on that website. Facebook turned her life around. I remember her telling my mom how her life is so messed up now. How she got fired, how she doesn't pay her bills, and how she's moving into a smaller place. Sometimes websites make you lose focus on important things in life. Consequently, certain people should use computers because the internet helps you with certain things. In summation, it helps you find hotels or trips to go on with your friends or families. I love being on the internet. One time I signed up for this website that was called MySpace. For a moment, I did get caught up on it. In conclusion, while computers can be a great tool, we need to use them in moderation to avoid the negative impacts on our lives.
1097	1099	1	3	Dear local Newspaper, my opinion on the effects that computers have on people is that more and more people are becoming obese. People tend to get moody, and it seems that computers are addictive. I think computers have a huge effect on people. The number one thing is that more people every year are becoming obese because they do not leave the chair they sit in for most of the day. Also, they get so lazy that they don't want to get up, so they will just order food and have it delivered right to their house. The next idea is that they do not get enough exercise because they just sit there all day and don't move. But when they do move, it's just to get something to eat or go get their phone. This is why they should limit kids and adults to only @NUM1 hours or less of computer time each day. Another reason is because people who are on computers tend to get moody. Like one second they are happy, and once they get off the computer, they are sad. They get all cooped up inside for the whole day. They don't see enough sunlight, and they don't interact with enough people. If they limit their computer time to an hour each day, the moodiness would change. People need a lot of exercise to maintain weight and muscle. The last reason the computers have effects on people is that people will tend to act addicted to the computer. Like if they are playing a game all day and don't realize it, they will get addicted and not stop playing all day. People need to leave the computer and do something else like ride a bike or play a sport. In conclusion, what I am trying to tell you is that it is not good that people stay inside all day and play on the computer because it is hazardous to your health and it is putting you at a high risk of obesity. So, can you please listen to my ideas and spread the word about the importance of balanced computer use.
1098	1100	1	3	"Dear Newspaper, I have been reading about the debate about computers. People say that computers are teaching important skills. Others are saying that, ""People are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising."" In my view, I think that people should be able to use computers (I mean they were meant to help us anyway). Just think how much computers have helped the human race, from talking to friends/family in other countries to looking at what time the plane leaves to @LOCATION1. It is said that more than one million people and up use their computer more than once a day. Without the computer, there is no worldwide web, which is connected to everything in this world. Without computers, you wouldn't be able to control any robotic equipment, which will give more jobs, but the cost of food will also go up tremendously. Without computers, the equipment wouldn't work in hospitals. Computers can save lives as they store important information. We would have to go back into the dark ages with typewriters again. Another big issue is that people are overusing the computer. Once you learn to moderate the usage of your computer, that won't be a problem. Some people say computers cost too much. There are ways to make so - called ""down payments"" on computers, something like a loan, but you pay each month, and setting up the internet is easy as @NUM1. So, yes, there are good and bad things talked about computers, but without them, we wouldn't have a modern era. We can control the robot that makes products and the equipment that saves lives. So, with all this said, I would like to say thanks for listening, and let's embrace computers while using them responsibly."
1099	1101	1	3	Dear, I am writing this article on computers to inform you of my opinion on computers' positive and negative effects. The reason why computers are so successful is because of some of the great information they provide. Such as directions to a place you are going to or home information on a subject or a person. Although these all sound good, anyone can post information on the internet, so some information might not all be accurate. Some reasons why the computer is bad is because of links which are not safe and can give your personal information to a stranger and come back to haunt you in the future. Also, websites or pop - up icons are not suitable for younger kids and expose them to content that is too mature for them. Lastly, talking on the computer is a part of our everyday lives, such as emails. Almost every American with a computer uses emails. An email is a great way to relay information. Also, the new source of web - conferencing gives you the ability to see people and communicate through the computers, which is rapidly growing in the @LOCATION1. In conclusion, while computers offer a wealth of benefits, we must be vigilant about the potential risks, especially when it comes to information accuracy and protecting the young.
1100	1102	1	3	"Dear local newspaper, I think that the computer is not a bad thing because of three reasons. One reason is that we can learn about a far - away place. Another reason is they teach hand - eye coordination. The last reason is we can talk to friends and meet new people. From the computer, we can learn about a far - away place if we were doing a report on it or just out of curiosity. We can learn what kind of plantation grows there for food. For example, tropical places grow bananas and coconuts. We can learn what they eat. Like in @LOCATION1, they eat many beans, and a lot of their food has beans, even their salads. We can find out their language as well. Maybe they talk Spanish like in @LOCATION2. You can also teach hand - eye coordination because it involves using your fingers and eyes to see what you are typing. You use your hands on everything while typing, whether you are typing on the keyboard or you are using the mouse. But it is not just for learning things; it is also for friends because of all these sites like MySpace, Facebook, AIM, WebChat. The possibilities are endless. You can even play games. If you don't know someone on Facebook or MySpace, that's okay. It is a great way to meet new people and new friends. And another thing, if you are having trouble finding a friend, you can just see if they are online. It is good for getting together somewhere or for making plans. And for those people who think it is taking away family time, you can always just say, ""Okay, that's enough,"" and talk to them. So, in conclusion, computers are good because you can learn about places, improve hand - eye coordination, and talk to new and old friends. We should make the most of this useful tool while also maintaining a healthy balance in our lives."
1101	1103	1	3	I believe that the household computer can be an incredibly useful tool for every - day things. It can assist with research and development, whether it's for a small business idea or a school project. For homework, it provides access to vast libraries of information and educational resources. In terms of art work, there are numerous software programs that allow for digital painting, graphic design, and more. It also serves as an always - renewing travel dictionary, helping you learn about different cultures and languages. It's like a 24 - hour super store filled with never - ending items, where you can shop for anything from clothes to electronics. Video games offer a great form of entertainment, and it functions as a very sophisticated calculator for complex mathematical tasks.  New programs are coming out all the time, but addiction is always seen as a very bad thing. If you become addicted, you'll start to have no friends or girlfriends as you'll likely ignore social gatherings. You'll probably start to ignore your family as well. You'll get carpal tunnel syndrome from typing for long hours and fatigue from staring at a bright screen all day and looking at it closely. You'll probably get a bad back from sitting all day in a chair, or kneeling or leaning back in a chaise lounge. It might seem comfy at first, but it's bad for you.  In conclusion, computers help a lot and they are fun. But they are also addicting. So have fun, but don't get addicted. Computers can be fun, but using them in moderation is healthy, and that's what should be done.
1102	1104	1	3	Dear Readers, one of the most important inventions of the past decades is the computer, and it has its pros and cons. I think people, especially teenagers, spend too much time on computers. They spend too much time on social media and online gaming, and not enough time outside enjoying nature and playing sports or exercising. While they can talk with friends via video calls, it is not the same as going to the park with friends and playing a game of baseball.  Families also become distant from each other when they sit around on their laptops. Teenagers spend too much time on the internet, browsing aimlessly instead of doing more beneficial activities like reading. I'm sure we all know at least one obese person or teenager. My neighbor is the size of a killer whale and eats just about as much as one. He will sit on the computer chair and stare with his eyes glazed at the computer screen for hours on end. Sometimes I wonder how many brain cells he wastes per second. I will bet that everyone who reads this knows someone like my neighbor. The statistic that 30% of teenagers in the United States is obese is not exaggerated at all.  In my opinion, it is the fault of the internet and computers. Instead of going to the gym or the soccer field with friends, they go to the computer and talk and eat junk food. They spend their time watching pointless YouTube videos, while they should be playing baseball or football. Doubters say you learn hand - eye coordination with computers, but you can learn better with sports. Computers are a large factor in obesity because they encourage people to sit around instead of doing the standard 60 minutes a day of exercise.  The next pressing issue is the amount of reading the average teenager and young adult does. I would say that the average gets about 15 minutes of reading a day because they are too busy chatting with friends on the internet. I have a cousin who reads about a book every 3 years and fails every test he gets and has stayed back 2 times. Instead of reading and learning, he is chatting and texting. He wastes these excellent educational opportunities while there are people in under - developed countries like Somalia who are lucky to own a book. I know more than 70% of the kids in my class do not read anything except the required reading, and that is because they sit around on the computers wasting their time. The literacy rate in our area is about 80% and that number is decreasing because of the lack of reading done and the time spent on computers. I have seen a survey that says 4 out of 5 teenagers spend more than 4 hours a day on computers.  These statistics and quotes have left me thinking, how much time do we really need to spend on computers instead of reading? Or else we will turn into oversized monkeys who can't even read. The computers and the internet are doing more than just erasing brain cells and harming our health; they are taking away the experiences that we could have outside in nature. Nature holds natural wonders like the Grand Canyon, the Rocky Mountains, and the Great Barrier Reef. What beats skiing down a large slope, or climbing Mount Everest? Certainly not computers.  Unfortunately, that's what most teenagers choose to do. They sit and tap on the keyboard instead of walking nature trails and walking on the beaches. They sit on old moldy chairs and stare at computer screens, unlike the people enjoying the butterfly gardens and wildlife preserves. Instead of taking steps to help the environment, we are sitting on the computers, sleeping and being mesmerized by the light of the screen. We should be preserving and learning about what is left on the planet, but we are not because of these computers and the internet.  I have presented a strong argument against computers that you may listen to or not. I strongly urge you to take action to start reducing the time spent on computers. Set up programs at your house or town for turning off the computers. We need to do something now!
1103	1105	1	3	"Dear editor, last week, I noticed an article in the paper headlined ""Get off the computer and go exercise."" This caught me off - guard because there are many benefits to computers. For instance, it enhances education in multiple ways. You can learn about foreign countries, their unique cultures, traditions, and histories. You can also talk to other people from different parts of the world.  Every school has a computer, and they are easily accessible and very helpful. I know that last year, if someone asked a question and the teacher wasn't sure of it, we would go straight to the computer. It also helps us do better on projects. I know I had to do a project last month, and without the computer, I wouldn't have completed it successfully.  We also use the computers for the programs they have. In art class, we made a cartoon and made it look real with Photoshop. It's also easy and fast to use a computer for research. You can search for information on various topics, from science experiments to historical events. You can also learn about far - away places with a computer. For example, you can find out about other countries in the world. You could find out if it were landlocked or not, how many people live there, and facts similar to those. You can also learn the history about the country such as their leaders and government. Finally, you can also learn up - to - the - minute facts with websites like BBC.com.  Lastly, you can talk with other people using email, instant messaging, and websites like Facebook, which allows you to connect with friends. With email, you can talk with someone for business purposes, receive links to useful websites, and share information. Instant messaging is just like texting on your phone, except much faster. You can instantly talk to people and catch up with them. Thousands of people are on Facebook. You can connect with old friends, and talk to current ones. I know my mom uses Facebook and talks to old friends since she moved.  So, in my opinion, I think computers are a good thing to have. Not only do they enhance your education, but they also teach us foreign countries' history and let us connect to old friends. When you were in school, do you remember your ""best - friend - for - life?"" Well, with Facebook, you can catch up with them, instead of them being just a memory."
1104	1106	1	3	Dear Board of Education of the local school district, did you know that eight out of ten homes in our town have at least one computer if not more? Computers help us with daily things and make many tasks, like writing an essay, much easier. They benefit our society in many ways. Without computers, some families would lose contact with loved ones who are far away. Not to mention, they can keep many things very organized and neat easily. Maybe the best benefit is how you can learn about far - away countries and cultures with the click of a button. Computers have endless possibilities to how they can benefit our society.  Many people don't realize that some families can not be with each other as easily as others. If a family member is in the military, sometimes talking on the computer is the only chance they get to communicate with their loved ones back home. Saying that this is not a benefit is a lie. For others who don't have such a severe need of communicating, it is still a convenient way to have a conversation with someone far away without racking up the phone bill for a long - distance call. Also, many times this can be an alternative to parents buying their children expensive cell phones. So having a computer is definitely a benefit to communicating.  The computer can also make many tasks much easier. For example, if you were assigned a 10 - page essay in school, typing it on the computer would be much neater and quicker than writing it all out. Also, many businesses rely on computers to keep data organized and all in place. Like the program Excel, Microsoft created this to make a simple way to organize data. It is much more efficient than having everything in different files with millions of text entries in every drawer. So another benefit of the computer is that it can keep things organized and provide easy ways to complete everyday tasks.  Maybe the greatest benefit of the computer is how much you can learn so easily. Say I was curious about the recent earthquake in Japan. If I wanted more information, I'd head straight to the computer. You simply go to Google or another search engine of your choice, type in the subject, one click, and bam, you could read for hours all of the websites and articles that would come up. The computer is full of information, and is right at our fingertips. This is definitely a huge benefit to our society.  The computer is a wonderful tool that can assist in so many ways, whether it is communication, organization, or just satisfying curiosity. This advance in technology is just another way to improve everyday life. Computers don't just benefit our little town, they benefit our whole society in all of the amazing things they do.
1105	1107	1	3	Computers are good and bad. Computers are good because they are a great way we can communicate with other people in different states. Through email, video calls, and social media platforms, we can stay in touch with friends and family who are far away. Another reason computers are good is that they can keep you out of trouble and can keep you entertained. There are countless games, movies, and shows available on the computer for entertainment purposes.  On the other hand, computers are bad because some people can become computer freaks and hyper - focused on computers. They may neglect their studies, work, and social lives. They might spend all their time in front of the computer screen, ignoring real - life interactions.  In conclusion, computers have their advantages and disadvantages. They are useful for communication and entertainment, but we need to use them in a balanced way. We should not let them take over our lives and prevent us from engaging in real - world activities. By being aware of the potential negative impacts and using computers responsibly, we can make the most of their benefits.
1106	1108	1	3	Dear local newspaper, as you can see, about @PERCENT1 of our population overuse the computer. They should be outside, breathing in fresh air and spending quality time with their family and friends. On the other hand, the computer can be extremely useful. For many people, their family lives quite a distance away, as well as some friends, and there's a possibility of getting out of touch. You can also learn about far - off places, like @LOCATION1. The computer is often used for projects and essays, which is very important. You can learn a great deal with a computer. The computer can be used in numerous ways. One way is to keep in contact. Sure, you can just go to the park and spend time there, but not everybody lives that close. For people who have relatives or even good friends who live quite far away, a computer is what you need. It is a great way to keep in contact. You can keep everyone updated on a daily basis. For example, my cousin recently went out of the country for college. She will be there for a few months, so she has her own blog on the computer to keep everybody informed and stay in contact. The phone is not always a viable option. To learn about far - away places is wonderful. Online, you can learn about the history of specific places. You can see the towns and so much more. You can even view pictures. Maybe one day you will even get to see those specific places in person. How exciting would that be? School is a big part of life nowadays. Students have project after project, essay after essay, and it's a lot of work. As you grow older, it becomes more work, and with a computer, you will have less of a burden. With essays, you can type them and fix your mistakes without it looking messy. Projects are easy to correct too, so making a mistake isn't a big deal. On the other hand, more Americans now than ever before are overweight. The computer has a lot to do with that. Most people will come home and sit on the computer for the rest of the evening. They don't realize what a big impact a computer can have on a person. More people should be out exercising and spending time with family. Computers can be a negative or positive thing. It can be more helpful than you could ever imagine. But, yet it can make a huge negative impact on people. It can help keep contact with people, learn about far - away places, or even assist with school work. Let it be beneficial, use it when you need it.
1107	1109	1	3	Dear Newspaper, Computers benefit society because they teach people in various ways. They are also helpful because they solve problems that humans might have difficulty dealing with. They can also entertain us when we have nothing else to do. They can teach people many things. They can help tourists learn about a location they wish to travel to. Actually, @NUM1 out of every @NUM2 tourists research the area they're going to on a computer. They help students catch up or fully understand something. One time I was having trouble with fractions in math. So I decided to look up the way to find the answer, and it helped me catch up with the class again. The computer can explain cultures from anywhere in the world. According to culture digest.com, @PERCENT1 of people visiting a new country find out about the culture first. Computers solve problems that some people might not be aware of. It can solve a math problem easily with a built - in calculator. @NUM3 out of @NUM4 computer users have used the calculator to help them solve a problem. They also solve geographic problems. There might be an outdated map, but this is easily solved with live satellite maps. Map tools says there has never been a flaw in their system. Computers have a wide variety of entertainment options. They can play music. @PERCENT2 of teens get their music from the computer rather than a CD. Computers can entertain you with games. One day it was raining hard and I had nothing to do, so I went on my computer and played minesweeper. This kept me very entertained. Please take this letter into consideration. Thank you for your time.
1108	1110	1	3	More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. Well, to me, it does benefit society in many ways, such as learning online. You can learn many things online. You can practice math, improve your reading skills, and even enhance your writing abilities. You can also have fun online if you're bored at home and have nothing to do. Also, you can interact with friends and family members through email and other means. When you're online, you can learn a great deal. If you're at home and you need to study for a test, you can go online and study. You can also learn more, because you can learn how to solve a math problem if you don't know it, or just catch up on your reading. People sometimes need a computer because they might get bored, so they can go online and play games and have a good time. People, especially kids, get bored at times, so they can just go on the computer and play games and trivia quizzes so they can still learn something. Computers can let you interact with your family and friends. You can send an email or have a webcam chat. If you haven't talked to someone for a long period of time, you can just go to the computer and talk to them. If you want to find a former school classmate that you haven't talked to in years, you can do so now. Computers do benefit the society. In my own opinion, we do need computers. If parents do not want their child on websites they don't approve of, the parents can always block those websites. Computers are really necessary; they can help in a huge way.
1109	1111	1	3	Being a teen myself, my computer is something I don't think I would be able to live without. But is it holding me back from more important things? I think so. I feel that not having computers will, in a way, educate people more effectively than now. For example, with school research papers, we immediately go to the computers in order to find information when we could be using books and magazines. With the widespread use of computers, many people don't properly know how to use and find information in books. Also, being around computers and using them so much is pulling families further apart and preventing humans from being more interactive with nature and the environment. For many people, using a computer is a lifestyle; it's something we tend to use more than religiously, and that might not be the best thing. Children, teens, and even adults get extremely addicted to computers. Teens and children use laptops and tablets every day in order to do their school work and to talk with friends. As well as parents/adults, they use it to get their work done and use it as an easy means of communication with co - workers. To this very day, people have become very addicted to computers. I know for certain that in my family, my mother, nor my father, nor my brother, nor I could go through a day without using a computer. As I mentioned before, computers are also pulling families further apart. There is less family time and communication between family members these days, due to computers. Instead of spending time with the family, teens prefer spending time on the computer chatting with their friends. I bet if a poll was taken on how much family time has been taken away in households because of computers, I almost guarantee it would be quite a large amount. I know the only true family time some families have without computers is dinner, and that isn't much. Lastly, many humans are not as connected to nature and as involved as they used to be. Using a computer keeps people inside and not exposed to nature. Though there are many advertisements and pop - ups on the computer that inform us about how to take care of the earth properly, we so easily ignore them and remain playing on the computer rather than going outside and doing something to help make the world a better, cleaner place. Not only is it just about taking care of our earth, but it is also the fact that not many people these days go out and get the fresh air they need as much as they really should. Most likely not all of that is due to the use of computers, but I bet a great deal of it is. Like I said before, it is super hard to imagine a day without a computer. I mean, how would we communicate or do our work? But there are truly other ways to do them that we just aren't very used to because of the fact that we are so attached to them. I never really noticed till now that it is possible to live without a computer, and that so many people are missing incredible things such as family and nature because we are so addicted to the computers. In conclusion, we should try to strike a balance and reduce our over - dependence on computers to regain what we've lost.
1110	1112	1	3	Dear local Newspaper, In my opinion, I believe that computers have helped our society a great deal over the past decade or so. This is because when you're on the computer, you develop better hand - eye coordination. Also, you learn how to type and do other things with a computer that you will need to know how to do if you want to get a decent job that pays well. Also, now on the computer, you can go on Facebook and other websites where you can make friends and chat with other people. So it's not only helping your social skills and hand - eye coordination, but also you are most likely to get a good job if you know how to type and use a computer. First off, having a computer teaches you to have better hand - eye coordination. This is because when you get a computer, having better hand - eye coordination will teach you how to type better and more quickly. Secondly, having a computer will teach you better social skills. This is because now a lot of people go on Facebook, and you can make friends and chat with your new ones. Also, when it's a cold and rainy day, you can occupy yourself by playing different games, and you can also check the news and the forecast for tomorrow's weather. Lastly, when you learn how to type, you have a good chance of getting a good job because you know how to type and work a computer. This is because when you are looking for a job that pays well, you will most likely have to know how to type and operate a computer. All in all, in my opinion, I think computers have helped our society over the years, but other people might think differently. So now let's see what you think about the role of computers in our society.
1111	1113	1	3	"Click, click, click the mouse of a computer goes as you are searching throughout the vast expanse of the internet. Computers are truly a great way to teach kids how to be social, make people more intelligent, and assist you with your homework. I firmly believe that computers have a very positive effect on people. Computers can teach kids to be social because, first off, computers are like an all - encompassing online phone. You can talk to people in numerous ways, such as through Facebook chat, AIM (chat), MySpace, Twitter, Skype, and a lot of other communication platforms that I haven't mentioned. Also, I think if a teen, kid, or even an adult is too nervous to talk to people on the phone or in person, and is socially awkward or painfully shy, they can start off by just chatting with people online. Once they feel more comfortable, then they can start talking to the person on the phone or in person. For example, I once, in @MONTH1, met this girl who was very sweet, but was painfully shy and everyone knew it. So one day she decided to make an AIM account and talk to people on it, and prove that she isn't an annoying weird girl that everyone makes her out to be. She turned out to be one of the nicest and funniest people I have hung out with in a while. This is how the internet can help you. Have you ever felt that computers sometimes make you more intelligent? Well, in my opinion, I think that computers help out so much more than a book. If you want information, it's just about typing some keys and a click of a button. Having a computer is like having your own personal handbook of everything in the world. A lot of people these days study from the internet, I know I surely do. Statistics show that @PERCENT1 more people say that computers are more helpful than books and can make you a lot more intelligent because the internet has so much more detail than books and more facts. @PERCENT2 of kids that have a computer use it for homework. Computers are a great tool to use while you are doing your homework. I spend most of the day on my computer doing homework rather than off it. For example, say you have a report and you need facts on @CAPS1 @PERSON1, and where he was born. You would just type in, ""when was @ORGANIZATION1 born."" And voila! There it is with the date exactly. Also, if you are working on a piece of writing like your rough draft, why spend the time trying to write really neat and perfect? When you can just open up a word document and type it up. To sum everything up, computers have definitely a positive effect on people from these three reasons: computers are a great way to teach kids how to be social, make people more intelligent, and help you with your homework. But I understand where you're coming from; people are spending way too much time on their computer and less time exercising. However, you can look up great ways to exercise on the internet and watch videos of people that have @CAPS2.V shows about exercising and do it with them on the computer. Remember, computers aren't just a waste of time and a way to kill your brain cells. They have a very positive effect on you, and we should embrace their benefits while also being mindful of our usage."
1112	1114	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I am here to persuade you to agree with me on the fact that the use of computers does benefit society. Some reasons why I think this are related to school work, business stuff, and also the overall research on important things. My first reason why I think that computer use is benefiting society is because @CAPS6 is often used for school work. For instance, students use @CAPS6 for various projects. They can also conduct some type of research on topics they might be interested in. But one of the most important reasons why computer use is so high is because there are a lot of people taking online classes. Whether it's for college or for the sake of your own self - learning. This is why I think school work should be a valid reason for computers benefiting society. My second reason why I think @CAPS6 benefits our society is the business or job part of the computer. Many people these days work at home; they have their own virtual office and almost create their own company. Another reason is that many people also use ""@CAPS4 @CAPS5"" or publisher. @PERCENT1 of the people who work at public businesses do this, and this also goes along with creating ads, which could be another reason for this. But then again, you can also pay your bills online! I remember when I helped my mother pay one of the bills online, and let me tell you, ""@CAPS6 was easy!"". My mother said she would do @CAPS6 more often now that she knows how to use @CAPS6! Clearly, the business side should be more than enough for me to convince you. My last reason is the overall research on all important things. Some of these important things are: online catalogs, the news, and another one, the most important things of all, job openings. I know myself, and I love to shop! So instead of leaving the house, I just go on the online catalog to my favorite store called ""@CAPS8"". The main reasons why I go online are because they have more variety and sizes. As for the news, that's mainly for my parents because I don't watch the news. Lastly, when I am @NUM1, I would like to find a job, even if it's minimum wage. @CAPS6's still something, right? This should be a strong reason for agreement! In conclusion, I think my @NUM2 reasons are very well clear: school work, business, and overall research. If these reasons don't convince you, I don't know what will! We should recognize the significant role computers play in these aspects of our lives and support their continued use for the betterment of society."
1113	1115	1	3	"Dear Newspaper, consider a family. Just a normal family whose lives have been drastically changed due to computers. They are overweight, constantly suffering from fatigue, lonely, nature - deprived, and lazy. However, they could have turned out differently if they just shut down their computers. They might have become healthy, fit, energetic, radiant, hard - working people if they had stopped spending hours on the computer daily. Although there are some positive aspects, the negative impacts of computers can be dramatic. They isolate you from friends and family, they deprive you of the beautiful nature around you, and most of all, they, over time (@MONTH1), cause you to become overweight or even obese. Friends and family are two very important things in everybody's life, even if you don't realize it. By using computers rather than interacting with them, you are weakening the connections you have. Computers, over time (@MONTH1), cause you to isolate yourself. They might cause you to talk less to your loved ones. Unfortunately, friendships can be damaged. ""Spending long hours on my computer had caused me to become distant. It made me feel lonely,"" @PERSON1, @NUM1, says @CAPS2. By the excessive use of computers, you are not doing yourself a favor. Computers can deprive you of the nature that surrounds you. You most likely would be glued to your computer rather than going outside. Instead of spending countless hours on the computer, you could be playing a sport or engaging in an outdoor activity. By playing sports, you are increasing your hand - eye coordination, far more than if you were to be on a computer. Wouldn't you like to be having fun with your friends playing volleyball, basketball, swimming, or even going for a hike rather than sitting in front of your computer? I know I would! The obesity rates of this country will increase if people continue to use computers. You will rise about @PERCENT1 from lack of exercise. Computers can ruin lives by increasing your chance of becoming unhealthy and overweight. So now think, would you want to be lonely, overweight, and deprived of nature? I know I definitely wouldn't. This is why computers should be used less frequently! So, it's high time; let's join together and raise awareness of the negative effects of computers and take steps to lead a more balanced life."
1114	1116	1	3	"Dear local newspaper, I am here today to state my reasons why I am against the usage of computers. My first reason why I am against the usage of computers is the negativity associated with it. For example, too many pop - ups come on the website you're on, and then there are those mini - little advertisements like ""@CAPS1 on me"" ""free trial"". And that's not good for children to see when they are using the computer. These pop - ups can be distracting and may lead children to click on inappropriate links. My second reason why I am against using computers is regarding who's online when you're up there. @NUM2 out of @NUM3 people use the computer every single day, and @NUM3 out of @NUM5 people are up there chatting with young little girls and boys. And they may not be who they say they are. What I'm trying to say is these people are called ""@CAPS2"". These people roam through the internet day and night trying to find little boys and girls. Just like I said earlier, that's not good computer usage. The purpose of getting on the computer is to look for information or play games, not that other stuff. My final reason for being against computers is the lack of monitoring. A lot of parents don't watch their kids when they are on the computer, so most of the kids look at a lot of inappropriate sites or things that they shouldn't look at. And that's their fault because they should have a parental lock up there. In conclusion, basically what I am trying to say is computers can be dangerous sometimes because you don't always know what you're clicking on, and you can accidentally @CAPS1 on the wrong thing and end up on a site that you don't want to be on. We need to be more cautious, especially when it comes to children's computer use. So, these are my opinions, and maybe you can understand what I'm trying to say. It's important that we take steps to make the online environment safer, especially for the younger generation. Thanks."
1115	1117	1	3	"Statistics show that more and more people every year are not getting their exercise and are on the computer talking to their friends on Facebook or MySpace or something like that. Will people go outside more or will they sit and type? Here is the reality: more and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. Those who support advancements in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people's lives. Well, I firmly (@CAPS2) believe that it does not have a positive effect on people. My reasons are that people who use computers more don't get their exercise and get fatter, and if you put your name and address on the computer, there is a slight (@CAPS3) chance that you will be kidnapped or murdered. My final reason is that you don't spend as much time with the family as you should. Obesity in the @LOCATION1 has gone up at least @PERCENT1 because people aren't getting their exercise and are spending too much time on the computer aimlessly (@CAPS4). A well - known figure, Nothinka, says that: ""There are too many people who don't get the exercise they need."" The @ORGANIZATION1 says ""@CAPS5 people like the internet, but what people don't know is that there are @CAPS5 bad people out there who would like to get their hands on your info."" As you can see, I firmly (@CAPS2) believe that it would be a wise idea if you wrote an article on technology. Because of the rising @ORGANIZATION1 obesity in America and the issue of @CAPS8 safety, it is now or never that you write this article. It will probably make you hundreds of @ORGANIZATION1 dollars. So, get out your @CAPS9, pick up your pencil and write. @CAPS5 people think that computers are fun, yes, but you are not realizing what you're doing. You could be @NUM1 lbs one day and then be @NUM2 lbs the next. Remember that it would not be a bad thing if you wrote an article on this. We need to raise awareness about the negative impacts of excessive computer use and encourage a more balanced lifestyle."
1116	1118	1	3	"@CAPS1, @CAPS1 boom, bom! Those are the distinct noises of pinball echoing on my computer. @CAPS2! Yea, we won! Those are the kind of noises you definitely don't want to be hearing all throughout the day. Always being glued to your computer is truly bad for your health. @CAPS5, you are such a computer freak that you will surely become overweight. It's extremely bad for your eyes, and you won't be able to enjoy the beautiful nature around you. ""@CAPS3, you don't want to be so heavy that you can't even lift yourself out of bed, do you? I don't think so. @CAPS5, if you are always sitting at the computer desk, then you might end up like that. @PERCENT1 of doctors say that if @CAPS5 you don't get up from the computer desk, you will become obese! Being obese is truly terrible for your health. It can take precious years off your life. @CAPS5, if you want to live a long and healthy life, you need to get up from the computer and start exercising. ""@CAPS4, I think I need a stronger prescription, my eyes are getting worse! @CAPS5, if something like this has ever happened to you, it's because you've been straining your eyes by looking at the computer screen all day. @PERSON1 says, ""@CAPS5, if you are at the computer all the time, you will need glasses or a stronger prescription."" @CAPS6 and children need to get away from their computers. Studies show that more adults are on computers, playing games than children. Have fresh, healthy eyes and get away from the computer. Imagine the sun shining across your face. The sun giving you the most beautiful tan. @CAPS3, do you like the sound of this? Take a break from your computer and go outside. This is the amazing experience you can get from going outside. @CAPS5, if you just sit at the computer screen, maybe you can only watch someone else enjoying the great, relaxing experience you should have. Get up, get active and go outside. Now is the perfect time to get up from your computer. @CAPS5, if you haven't learned yet, the computer is an unhealthy thing for humans to use. Be like me and get rid of your computer. You need to be healthy and most of all, active. Have good eyes and enjoy nature. Don't use the computer."
1117	1119	1	3	Currently, there has been a heated debate on whether or not computers truly benefit society. Some people say that computers enable seamless internet conversations between friends, and they can pass off detailed information about faraway places and people. However, I firmly tend to believe that the computer is not entirely necessary. People end up exploiting most of their precious time on computers, significantly reducing their exercise time. Not many individuals pay proper attention to nature. Instead of just talking to friends on the internet, why not meet them at the local park? Many people who are constantly using their computers experience a reduction in their metabolism. This is one of the primary reasons why the @LOCATION1.A has the highest obesity rates in the world. In addition, the less you exercise, the less healthy you will become, and the more pain you'll receive. You will feel more tense if your muscles are not exercised regularly. If we, as @CAPS1, continue to lack exercise, there won't be many bright possibilities for us in the future. Isn't it truly difficult to accept that people pay too much attention to the computer when there are numerous endangered species in nature? Pandas, polar bears, whales of different types, and other precious creatures all desperately need our help to fight this extinction problem. Unfortunately, we end up paying much of our attention on the computer. With due consideration, as humans, we have the power to make things possible, so we should actively help these creatures in need to survive for generations. Perhaps we @MONTH1 could learn more about these wonderful creatures if we take some time off of the computer to do so. Perhaps we will find nature far more interesting. Why do we rely on text messaging in our computers when we have the wonderful ability to talk to our friends in a park? We have the freedom of speech in the @LOCATION1. Our families need our help occasionally, but sometimes we're just not available. While reducing our social life, our computer hours are becoming increasingly more important, and they are distracting us from what's truly most important. In conclusion, when considering your computer hours, you must seriously think about what can be done for nature, for your health, and for your family and friends. By making small changes, we can lead a more balanced and fulfilling life.
1118	1120	1	3	Dear editor, I have heard about the ongoing advance in technology dispute. I would like to clearly state that I think it does indeed benefit our society. I think this because: You can easily communicate with friends, they assist you with schoolwork, and they are a reliable resource whenever you need to find information. Please read on so I can explain my reasons in detail. Computers and technology benefit us in numerous ways. One of the main ways is that they enable you to talk to friends. Computers give you an incredibly easy and fast way to communicate with others. Instead of sending a boring letter that takes forever to reach its destination, you can quickly hook up with your friends whom you haven't seen in a while. I remember when my friend moved to @LOCATION1. It would have taken me a very long time to reach there, so instead I went online and had a great conversation with him. Also, it's much easier on your hand compared to writing a long letter. Now please read on for my second reason. My second reason is that computers are an excellent way of looking up information. Searching through books for information can take days. You can go online and find everything you need in just ten minutes. In fifth grade, I had to do this really challenging project. I spent @NUM1 days looking in books and found very little. But then I looked up everything I needed to know in just half an hour. Lastly, they offer more comprehensive information. If you go on @ORGANIZATION2, you could find hundreds of relevant sources on one topic. Easy, right? Now read on for my next reason. My last and strongest reason is that technology can help you find anything in everyday life. Computers can help you find your way around. They can even search the supermarket for you. They can help with anything. One year I went on vacation to @LOCATION2. My mom got a bit confused, so we got lost and needed help. Now, if we hadn't had the computer, we might never have found our way. Wouldn't you be more confident if you had a computer by your side? Computers can also find great places for you and your friends or family to have fun. They can find places you've never even heard of, such as @ORGANIZATION1. Now I'll sum it all up. So, as you can clearly see, technology benefits our society in a huge way. Mostly for these three reasons: You can communicate with your friends, they help you in school, and they are a reliable source for everyone's life. I hope you have enjoyed reading this. Please take this information into account for your next decision. Thank you for your time, and thank you for reading my paper.
1119	1121	1	3	In my opinion, I firmly think that computers are extremely helpful to people. They can provide them with the detailed information that they @MONTH1 might urgently need. For instance, students can look up historical facts, scientific theories, and literary works on computers. Moreover, computers can also help people learn a great deal of new things. People can take online courses, watch educational videos, and participate in virtual workshops. In this way, computers have become an indispensable tool for people's learning and growth. We should make good use of computers to improve our knowledge and skills, and at the same time, we should also be aware of the potential negative impacts and use them in a reasonable way.
1120	1122	1	3	I believe that computers have a strong negative effect on society but a far stronger positive one. Computers these days have reached an incredibly advanced stage and offer a multitude of benefits. They allow you to have in - depth conversations with your friends, enable you to access information with astonishing efficiency, and have significantly increased our manpower in scientific research. Almost every teen has a screen name that enables them to engage in lively chats online with their friends. This function not only keeps kids in touch but also keeps them socially active. Even though instant messaging can sometimes distract kids from their daily life, it can also be incredibly helpful. Just last week, a friend of mine had forgotten to write down their homework and easily contacted me online. I was able to let them know @NUM1 within a matter of seconds. Similarly, with this online communication, you can also talk and video - chat as if you were right there with your friends. Since not every day do you get to physically go hang out with your friends, this is an excellent and convenient alternative. Not only is it quick and easy, but it's also completely free. Computers keep kids off their phones and prevent them from racking up huge phone bills and causing those loud and annoying phone - bill conversations about how to limit texting. The most important effect computers have on society is the efficient gathering of information. The internet allows people to access millions of websites at lightning speed. Every second of the day, there is someone on the internet searching for data that they would have had to spend hours in the library to obtain. Computers are a key part of modern society, and we are highly dependent on them. Without them, we would all be at a significant loss. They provide an easier way of life that us somewhat lazy @CAPS1 need to thrive. The internet keeps us updated and well - informed on what's going on all around the world without us even having to leave our homes. We need the internet, and we couldn't access it without computers. One of the largest aspects of life that computers have helped us with is research. Computers have multiplied our manpower and given us a more organized way to store data. Recently, I was watching a show where they had a computer testing items for @CAPS2, a process that would take a human weeks to complete. They also help us be more different and creative people. With the development of computers, they have become smaller and more compact until they were able to fit in the palm of our hand. They have led us to think that we can achieve greater things in life, keep our earth safe, and reduce the damage we cause to it. They have led us to research the unknown areas of the world where @NUM2 years ago, a scientist with just a pad of paper wouldn't have dared to even think about. Computers have linked the world through seamless communication and vast information and have propelled us to greater heights in understanding how we came to be. Overall, society undeniably needs computers, and they have an overwhelming positive effect on society, making our lives more convenient, informed, and full of possibilities.
1121	1123	1	3	Many people own computers and use them every day, right? Most of them are on their computers from the moment they get off work or finish school until it's time to go to bed. What I think they should do is find some other activity to engage in instead of sitting in front of the computer for six hours, achieving nothing meaningful in their lives. Moreover, when you stare at a computer screen for such a long time, it can damage your eyesight. Why stay on the computer all day when you can step outside and breathe in some fresh air? Why would you want to be glued to the computer when you have family and friends you could be spending quality time with and taking care of? You don't want to be lazy and do nothing for yourself. You should be able to go for a walk instead of being confined in the house using the computer. Why would you even prefer to be on the computer when you could have a great time going out to eat at a nice restaurant or visiting a place you've always dreamed of going to throughout your entire life? You can't always rely on a computer. When you want to go out and discover something new, you have to experience it firsthand to truly understand what it's all about. You don't want to lead a boring life, do you? That's what it seems like when you just sit around on the computer every day, looking at a bunch of random stuff. Since you want to do what you like and have fun, it's clear that spending less time on the computer and more time on other activities is the way to go.
1122	1124	1	3	"Dear @PERSON2 - @CAPS1, I strongly suggest that people do not spend as much time on computers as they currently do. People will be able to engage in much better things, such as regular exercise or spending more quality time with family and friends. Both of these activities are beneficial for people's physical and mental health, and they are more useful in the long run. Please consider the following reasons why it will be more advantageous if people do not spend excessive time on computers. First, exercising is an excellent alternative to sitting in front of a computer screen. A recent joint study by @ORGANIZATION3 and the @ORGANIZATION1 found that an average person spends five hours per day on the computer. By reducing at least some of these hours, people will be able to incorporate more exercise into their daily routine. Also, @PERSON3 at @ORGANIZATION4 states that ""@PERCENT1 of people do not exercise enough in the @LOCATION1 alone."" If some of the time spent on the computer is reallocated, people will be rewarding themselves by taking good care of their bodies. Moreover, I once tried not using my computer for a week, and it was an incredibly rewarding experience. In that free time, I learned how to perform a backflip in gymnastics. There are numerous possibilities in the realm of exercise if people use their computers less. Second, if people do not spend as much time on the computer, they will gain more experience in developing social skills. For example, @PERSON1 at @ORGANIZATION5 says, ""When people spend time with family and friends, they acquire necessary social skills for later in life."" A study at @ORGANIZATION2 indicated that people who spend three hours or less on their computers have up to @PERCENT2 better social, verbal, and quick - thinking skills. Spending time with family and friends instead of being on the computer is extremely beneficial. I make an effort to spend at least three hours a day with my family and friends, and as a result, I have strong and healthy relationships with them. Clearly, it is better to spend less time on the computer and more time either exercising or socializing with loved ones. Some people might argue that people can interact with others online, which also counts as social skills. However, in reality, people gain better social skills from face - to - face interactions because they need to use quick thinking and express their emotions effectively. Altogether, I firmly believe that spending less time on the computer is the best approach to maintaining good mental and physical health. Thank you for considering my opinion."
1123	1125	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, it has recently come to my attention that computers are having a significant impact on people's daily lives. I wholeheartedly agree with this view, especially considering the high rates of obesity in our country. More people need to engage in regular exercise, interact more with friends, and enjoy activities that do not involve technology. Some people seem to be completely addicted to their computers, but perhaps this letter will make them realize the need for a change. Many individuals are spending an excessive amount of time on their computers and neglecting physical exercise. People should start prioritizing exercise and reducing their computer time because the obesity rates in many states are continuously rising. Yes, you might say, ""I'll just go on a diet."" However, diets don't always work, and many people have tried them without success. Even a simple one - hour walk with your dog is far better than lazily browsing the web. And if you're interested, you could join the local gym for @MONEY1 a month. But the key is that you have to be willing to take action. Now that you know how to address this issue, it's time to get moving! More people should interact with friends instead of constantly turning to their computers. Interacting with friends or family will enhance their social skills overall. Yes, perhaps you and your friends are out and hungry. Chances are, you'll have more fun engaging in physical activities with your friends than you would on the computer. By interacting with friends and family, you'll be better prepared for social situations later in life. It will make you more confident in job interviews and less nervous when meeting new people. Finally, learning to enjoy things that don't involve technology is essential because many people don't experience as much fun in the real world. You have to actively seek out that fun. This can be achieved by inviting a friend to go on a camping trip with you or spending a little money to treat yourself. The outdoors and nature are full of beautiful and amazing things; the only way to appreciate them is to have fun outside and explore the wonders of the world. In conclusion, many people's lives are being negatively influenced by computers, which are disrupting their daily routines. But perhaps by following these simple tips - exercising more, interacting with friends, and enjoying non - technological activities - people can regain control of their lives and lead happier, healthier lives."
1124	1126	1	3	@ORGANIZATION1, I strongly believe that we need computers. Computers are extremely helpful and play a very significant role in our world. They provide us with the ability to learn about a wide range of very interesting facts, and they also allow people to communicate with others online. After reading my letter, I hope you will agree with me. First of all, computers are important because as our world becomes more technologically advanced, computers are essential for almost every job. You would want people to be proficient in using a computer. For example, police officers use computers to track down wanted criminals and store criminal records in the system. Schools rely on computers every day for students to write reports, search for information, and complete their homework. As a student myself, I know that kids use computers constantly. For instance, @TIME1, I used my computer to complete the math homework assigned by my teacher. After you read my letter, I hope you will share my view. Secondly, computers give you the opportunity to research places all over the world. Another great feature of computers is that you can access the latest news and stay updated on everything that is happening in the world right now. Computers are also very useful if you're not fond of writing by hand. You can type your work on a computer, and if you're a fast and accurate typist, you might even finish your tasks more quickly. I use my computer to write all my essays and book reports for @LOCATION1. I also use it to check the news and see what's going on globally. Lastly, computers are great because they enable you to communicate with people online. You can either send them an email or have a face - to - face conversation via a webcam. Online chat is a convenient way to keep in touch with friends who are far away or to ask a friend about the homework. I like using a webcam for these reasons. On my birthday, my sister couldn't come home from college, so we set up webcams. As a result, she was able to be virtually present when we opened presents and sang the birthday song. After reading my letter, I hope you will be convinced. I hope I have successfully persuaded you that computers are very important, which is why we use them so extensively. Computers are incredibly helpful, they allow us to learn interesting facts, and they facilitate communication with others online.
1125	1127	1	3	"The use of computers has been steadily increasing since personal computers were first invented. Although there are some advantages to using computers, such as conducting research and interacting with people, there are significantly more negative aspects than positive ones when it comes to computers. Computers have a detrimental impact on the way people live in the real world, outside the ""virtual world."" Many people end up being overweight or obese because they spend too much time sitting in a computer chair and not enough time engaging in outdoor exercise. People also tend to interact with individuals on the computer whom they don't communicate with in the real world or don't know at all. Moreover, people often disclose personal information to strangers, which leads me to my second point. Theft occurs every day across the globe, whether it's a bank robbery, a store theft, or even identity theft. Using a computer can increase the risk of such thefts. There are hackers who break into people's banking accounts, which contain all their personal information, and withdraw any amount of money they desire. Millions of people have their personal information accessible online, which is extremely dangerous. That is yet another drawback of computers. My final point is about all the costs associated with computer use. Many people have to spend a significant amount of money on glasses because they stare at a computer screen almost all the time. Some people even have to pay for rehabilitation. There are individuals who are actually addicted to the internet, and they have to spend thousands of dollars to recover their health. As you can see, there are clearly more cons than pros when it comes to computers. Any of these negative consequences could happen to you, so I strongly advise you to limit your computer use. By being more cautious and reducing your reliance on computers, you can protect your physical and financial well - being."
1126	1128	1	3	"Do computers hurt you when you exercise? I think that a computer couldn't help you in many careers. If you say it's good for you, it's what you want, but it's not really necessary. So, let's get to the argument. Well, owning a computer can keep you away from exercise, and exercise is good for you. So, the more time you spend on it, the more you'll get addicted. Yes, owning a computer can be helpful in some ways, but most importantly, it can also be a hindrance. I mean, if you're a business guy, you'll need one. But if you get engrossed in all the things you can do on it, before you know it, your day has gone by, and you have nothing left to show for it. It's really rude to waste your day like that. What to do now? Let you be on the computer again? And the whole day is just spent on it. Why go out when you could chat with friends online? I'll tell you. You sit around, munch on a couple of snacks, and then you have more and more food. Then you go swimming, and you're fat compared to all your friends. Where's the exercise? Yet at work, you're just sitting there, entertained by that addicting computer. And so your friends notice and wonder. Next, they ask how it happened, and you say, ""I was on my computer too much, got fat due to lack of exercise, and ate unhealthy."" Then they invite you to do activities. Recently, you're back to your six - pack, sexy self. You feel so good about yourself now. You're hot and not just amazed; life's good. But with the computer, you don't have to use it all the time. Just go on it to do what you have to do, not what you want to do. If you want to chat with your friend, go to a fun place out instead of being a home - bound no - life. This is why you should only use technology if you have to so your body can stay healthy and in shape, just like you need your body to be!"
1127	1129	1	3	"Dear local Newspaper, This era is all about computers. Computers are a great benefit to have. They increase hand - eye coordination, talking skills, and provide easy knowledge. My first point is about hand - eye coordination. This is an extremely important skill because it helps with physical movements, such as using your hands precisely. Studies have shown that 8 out of the 10 individuals have improved hand - eye coordination. Also, it helps kids in that it stimulates the nerves in the hands and brain for kids that have had surgery on their hands. Last year's study has shown that 70% of kids have improved hand movement faster than with regular therapy. Secondly, the importance of computers in communication, like email or instant messaging, is remarkable. This is great for pen - pals because it saves time for responses compared to traditional mail and also saves money as there's no need for mailing to different places. When you email them, there will be a fast response. Also, this will help people that are shy around others. A study has shown that 60% of shy kids have increased their talkative skills in school. Also, most talkative skills will help kids today with their confidence. Finally, the computer is a very helpful knowledge tool to use. Most books will be more challenging to find the exact information you need because there's always extra information that's not needed and it will take longer to find. With a computer, all you need to do is to type in what info you're looking up. ""It's an easy sensation"" said Time magazine. That was one great comment from Time. In school, however, there are helpful tips that are making it easier and quicker to find information with bookmarks. All you have to do is go up to bookmarks, find the website, and click, and that's it. In conclusion, the era of computers is becoming more popular by the hour. And the benefits of the computer, like hand - eye coordination, talkative skills, and easy knowledge, make it an essential part of our lives."
1128	1130	1	3	Dear Newspaper, I disagree with the whole computer thing. I think it's just a waste of money and a waste of time for kids. The consequence is that the kids will get fat, and they will never want to go outside. They will prefer to play video games and eat junk food. If you stay on the computer for too long, it can make your eyes weak, and it sometimes can give you cancer. You can die from cancer, or you can get really sick without dying but will endure a year of pain. Mostly, kids stay on the computer for hours playing stupid games and will never go outside. They will stay inside for days and never go out to play with their friends. When they get sick of their games, they will want to try and hang out with their friends, but they won't be able to as they will be too fat and slow. My aunt died from using a computer too much. She had brain cancer and passed away. She lived for 2 years with the cancer. I felt so bad for my cousin as he had to watch his mother die all because she used a computer every day as that was her job. Therefore, I state that computers should not be used for more than 2 hours a day. By limiting computer use, we can avoid the negative health impacts and encourage a more active lifestyle.
1129	1132	1	3	Dear Newspaper, I disagree that computers are important to people because they offer research, online colleges, and online stores. Those are my top 3 reasons, and I'm going to give more details. My first main idea is that computers help students find important information. For instance, you can use Wikipedia to help find information about the battle of Gettysburg and other important historical events. One example is I went to AmericanHistory.com to find good information about Route 66 and what happened there. People also look up a lot of stuff that involves school. You can get research about the earth and what happens to it, like environmental changes and natural phenomena. My second main idea is that computers are good for people when you finish high school and want to go to college. Some colleges can be found on the internet, and you can attend college at home on your computer. One example is my cousin. She goes to college on the internet because she has to take care of her two children. Whenever you watch television, you see a commercial about online colleges because they are trying to tell you to go to school online. This provides flexibility for those with other responsibilities. My third and final reason why computers are good for people is that some stores have an online store where you can look at what they have in the store. Children like to go shopping a lot, but they can't always go to the mall or the stores because you don't want to go. You can let them see what they want and buy it online instead of going to the stores. It can be shipped to your door without you having to go anywhere. My mom sometimes orders from Amazon.com so she doesn't have to go there. It gets shipped to our house in less than a week. These are my 3 main reasons why people should have a computer. They can find research, access online schools, and use online shopping stores. This can help people understand the importance and usefulness of computers.
1130	1133	1	3	Dear Daily news editors, Hello, my name is John, and I would like you to write an article on the effects computers have on people. Computers have been the must - have technological item over the past 10 or so years. They allow people to learn many new skills, get important work done, and even socialize! However, some experts believe that people spend too much time on computers, and as a result, people are not as active or healthy. Everyone wants to be healthy. While computers are fun and useful, could they have a negative effect on society? 60% of Americans are employed as of 2020, and with that number dropping, people need to get more work done to keep their jobs or even keep their businesses open. With computers available at work (or school), much more work can be done. With programs like Microsoft Word, people can type reports efficiently. And with programs like Excel, Google Sheets, and iCalculator, workers can calculate taxes faster, so they have more time to focus on other work. Some people are working with stocks, and these days, the stocks could be good or bad, so you need to keep up! You can go to the stock websites and control what you buy and sell, without increasing your phone bill from calling the brokers. Laptops make work possible on the go too! Computers teach many skills you need to know for jobs and other skills you occasionally need in life. You can learn typing, work with various programs, and even programming, which are all needed in some lines of work. Computers also increase math skills and hand - eye coordination! And you can read your favorite books via online scans! Now you might be wondering why not pick up a real book? Well, with online scans, you can access a vast library, and some are free! Not only do computers teach skills and assist with work, they are very fun too! Between Facebook, Twitter, email, Google Buzz, MySpace, ooVoo, Skype, and GamesRadar, there are lots of ways to talk to friends and meet new people. On Facebook, I can have up to 50 people talk to me whenever I want! Why not talk to real people? you ask. Well, the answer is simple. Maybe it's a lazy Sunday and nobody wants to go out anywhere, or maybe your friends want to talk right before bedtime. Talking to real people is important, but it can't be done all the time! Online gaming has become a huge sensation! And not only teenagers, adults and seniors can “game” too! So many people are gaming now, that if you're not, you are missing out on an amazing experience. Some people think gaming is a waste of time, but the same can be said for any indoor leisure activity. Everybody needs a fun activity they can do anytime! Besides, everybody likes having fun! Some people believe the ludicrous notion that technology is making America into fat, lifeless losers, but it's the opposite. You can socialize online and meet new people. People (like myself) can balance computers and games with exercise and sports. With computers, you can efficiently complete work and learn new skills! Computers are positive if used correctly. I hope you like this article. Thanks for reading.
1131	1134	1	3	Dear sir, I believe that computers are truly great for society. There are numerous benefits to having a computer at one's disposal. You can communicate with people online via instant messaging, which is far more reliable than a traditional telephone or cell phones. Many times, people don't answer the phone when you need them. With a computer, you can effortlessly send a message from the computer directly to the person's cellular device. You can learn a great deal from a computer, such as facts about the world and people around the globe. You can even learn things from the internet that your teacher can't even teach you. Then you can study and expand your knowledge. It can be a problem if you're on the computer more than you exercise, but with today's technology, you can exercise while using a computer. You can play music from it while you work out, or watch a movie while running on a treadmill. Even though some people spend too much time on the computer, there are ways to exercise and use the computer simultaneously. So, there are both ups and downs, but in the end, it doesn't matter how much you use the computer as long as you can get exercise at the same time. That's why I firmly think it is a great benefit to have computers today.
1132	1135	1	3	"Recently, there has been an intense debate about whether or not computers benefit society. Although each side has its own valid reasons, computers undeniably have a positive effect on people and on society. Computers are beneficial in several significant ways. With the use of computers, you have the remarkable ability to research and learn about foreign and local places. You are also able to communicate with others effectively and they help people complete everyday tasks with ease. At one point in everyone's lives, you need to know about local or even foreign places. It is completely unrealistic for someone to travel to every place they need to know about. This is where computers come in extremely handy. Over the internet, you can thoroughly research everything from the main staple of the diet in @LOCATION3 all the way to the day the new year starts in @LOCATION1. You can learn about things in the comfort of your home, or within your home town. I remember once in @NUM1 grade I had to do a challenging research project on @LOCATION2. By going on the computer, I learned all I needed to know and then some. The project was a breeze, and I got a perfect score. Also, you can learn about local upcoming events, and about the world around you. During childhood, every kid has many curious questions, some their parents might not be able to answer. Using the computer is a quick and easy way to get these answers. Computers help educate the minds of people and without them, we might not know as much as we do now. Communicating with people on the other side of the world is quite difficult. Mailing a letter could take weeks to reach the recipient. Computers provide us with an immediate method of communicating with others whether they are local or far away. Last year, my uncle moved to @LOCATION3 for work. I never got to see him often. We communicated with each other regularly over computers, and when he came home for Christmas, we were as close to each other as we were before he left for work. Computers kept our relationship healthy and I do not think it would have been that way without them. Scientists say that about @PERCENT1 of all @CAPS1 have communicated with someone at least once through computers. They also say that @PERCENT2 of these people regularly use this method of communicating. Although we still use phones and ""snail mail"", I do not believe that our society would be able to function socially as well without the available use of computers. Everyday, computers are helping people get through their days with minimal problems. People get things done quicker, giving people more time to do what matters most, interacting with their families. Without computers, everyday business would take about twice as long leaving less time for the fun things in life. @PERSON1, my neighbor, said ""@CAPS2 and banking are so time - consuming. I do not know that I would be able to handle it without the ability to do my banking online."" In addition to tasks and enhancing, computers help with everything from shopping to finding the perfect phone company to use for your new business. Having the ability to shop and browse online takes away the time spent on arriving, walking around, and waiting in checkout lines, letting you relax and take your time throughout the rest of your day. Typing also gives you hand - eye coordination. Without it, you wouldn't be able to do everyday things such as opening the door to playing sports outside with your children. Using computers helps people get through their lives easier and more efficiently. I could not even imagine life without them. Computers benefit the people of society in every possible way. By helping them obtain knowledge, purifying and strengthening relationships through constant communication ability, and helping make their everyday lives easier, they have a purely positive effect on people everywhere. Computers have a great effect on people and should continue to be used in everyday society."
1133	1136	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1, did you know that more than half the students in the world use the computer to study? I truly think that most people don't spend excessive time on the computer. And even if they do, it's usually for studying, learning, or catching up with old friends. Here are some solid reasons why I think that computers have good effects on people. Most kids use computers to learn in - depth about things they are studying in class. And they also use the computer to thoroughly study about a country or a person they are doing a report on. Also, there are engaging games on the computer that can significantly help you with math. Now onto my second reason. You can also use the computer to send warm emails to friends that live far away, and also you could use popular platforms like Facebook to find friends that had moved away. And you could also use a high - quality video camera to have a real - time video chat with a friend. Or if you are a busy business man or woman, you could video - chat with clients all across the country. Now onto my third and final reason. Computers also have useful applications like Microsoft Word which lets you neatly type things such as essays or term papers instead of having to painstakingly write them out by hand. Also, there is an application that lets you create an impressive PowerPoint if you need to make one for a project. And there is an application that lets you paint beautiful pictures or draw detailed pictures. Those are some compelling reasons why I think that computers have good effects on people. If we didn't have computers, the world would be very different. For instance, kids wouldn't be able to search things for projects efficiently or type essays conveniently. And you wouldn't be able to keep close contact with someone who moved away. Also, you wouldn't be able to make professional - looking power points for projects. And that is why I firmly think computers have a good effect on people.
1134	1137	1	3	Dear: @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I think computers are one of the most revolutionary inventions ever. They greatly help education and make everything much more convenient, and traveling is also made easier. It helps education because teachers always use computers to effectively help kids learn important information. For example, if we have to study for something, there are well - designed websites specially made for studying. Also, there are sites that can patiently teach little kids how to read or write. Almost all schools have computers these days. Some schools even generously give computers to kids so they can use it to study. @PERCENT1 of students in the @CAPS7.S use computers more than textbooks and achieve high test scores. That's why computers are a great asset to education. A second reason is that it generally makes everything more convenient. For example, instead of spending hours writing an essay for school and then having your hand ache and finding out it's filled with mis - spelled words, you can simply type it quickly and use spell - check. I have never heard one person say that the computer hasn't made life more convenient. Another example is if you had to find some information about your new dog. Instead of going to the library and spending a long time searching, you can simply open up your internet and then search it and find the info you need in seconds. That's why the computer makes everything more convenient. The last reason is that traveling is so much easier with a computer. Without it, you have to go to various places to buy tickets. In fact, I don't even remember what it was like to not book online with a computer. All you have to do is go to the relevant websites and then buy it from there. It's so easy. People can also communicate with each other more conveniently. I haven't sent a physical card in years. Instead, I send emails. It's quicker, more convenient and more reliable. That is why traveling, communicating, and mailing are all made more convenient. Overall, the computer is one of the most helpful things ever and with technology upgrading daily, soon it will be even more convenient to do things. While too much computer use is bad and people shouldn't overly interact with the internet, the computer comes in handy almost all the time. That is why I think the computer is revolutionary.
1135	1138	1	3	Dear, @ORGANIZATION1. There has been lots of heated talk and intense arguments about computers and whether they benefit the society. I believe it does benefit society. One reason is because you can communicate with others in a very effective way. Another reason is there are many interesting things to do on these computers or even on the world - wide web. Having computers is always extremely handy. You can talk or have a web - chat with friends. This one time online I found my old friend from @LOCATION1, that I hadn't seen in five long years. Whenever I come home from school, I'll quickly go on the computer and talk to all my friends. The computer is a great place to make well - thought - out plans or to catch up with some buddies. My next reason for why they benefit society is there's so much to do. It's like an amazing at - home amusement park. The internet is a wonderful thing. Whether it's for doing homework or playing exciting games. Even on some weekends, I'll just sit down for two or three hours and just enjoy playing a game. But, I still make sure to exercise daily. Yes, computers can get addicting but, it's always good to go outside and get some fresh air and exercise. Many people say over @PERCENT1 of the @CAPS1 population has a computer, and @PERCENT2 check email or go on the computer every ten minutes. Yes, it's not healthy but it's their decision. In conclusion, I believe computers are indeed beneficial. I have stated many valid reasons why. Such as, they are great for communication or catching up with some friends, also there's an infinite amount of things to do. So if you don't have a computer, go out and get one. They will definitely be worth your while.
1136	1139	1	3	"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, The average American uses the computer at least once every day. Undoubtedly, computers benefit society. With them, people can easily learn about far - away places, learn without having to carry heavy books and papers, and chat with people all over the country and sometimes even the world. First of all, computers can teach you all about the world without you having to go to a library. Free sites like Wikipedia provide fast knowledge about most anything. You can use these sites for essay writing, trip planning, and just to satisfy your curiosity. Some people believe that computers prevent people from exercising and enjoying nature. However, computers promote exercise and going out to look at nature. Computers provide quick and easy access to travel agencies, as well as information on popular tourist areas. They also bring up advertising sites for gyms and ideas on exercising at home. Computers don't hinder workouts and nature walks; they make it easier to do them. But computers make other things easier as well. Studying can be much easier with the use of computers. Instead of dragging around heavy books, students can carry a small laptop. Students also don't have to worry about keeping track of papers. Everything can be saved to a laptop. Computers organize files so even a messy student can keep organized. Another advantage is that anything typed on a computer is neat and easy to understand, unlike some handwriting. The use of laptops in @ORGANIZATION1 is an example of how schools can be simplified. Each student is given one to use instead of books. ""Studying is so much easier,"" said one student. Studying is very difficult for some kinds. Computers can make it simpler. My last argument is that people can talk to anyone using chat sites. If someone has a cousin in a distant country, they can still keep in touch. It's the same for friends who moved. E - mail is a lot faster than traditional mail. A mail carrier taking an e - mail from one person to another is almost instantaneous. It is also more private. Unlike mail that is just sealed with glue, e - mails are password protected. There are also other sites that are for socializing. Instant messages also allow people to talk with one another. This can help people learn about culture in other cities, states, and sometimes even different countries. These sites can help close the gap between cultures. They can help get rid of racism and make the world more ideal. Computers make our community better. They let us learn about far - away places, make it easier to enjoy studying, and enable us to talk to other people from almost anywhere. So, think about anything, and you'll realize computers truly are beneficial to our society."
1137	1140	1	3	Computers are the future. Computers are the best technology we've created. They allow us to improve our hand - eye coordination, learn about faraway people and places, and interact with our friends. Computers improve our hand - eye coordination. Typing is a great way to enhance this vital skill. By not looking at the keyboard and knowing which buttons are where, we train our hands and eyes to work in harmony. Using a mouse is also an excellent method. Moving the digital mouse on the screen with the one in your hand requires precise hand - eye control. This can improve writing, because when you write, you need to move the pen in your hand accurately, just like moving a mouse or typing. It can also help with driving. When driving, you can't look at the steering wheel; you have to keep your eyes on the road. In order to do that, you must know how you're moving the wheel, and the hand - eye coordination skills developed through typing and moving a mouse can be very useful. Computers can help with hand - eye coordination, which in turn can assist with writing and driving. Computers can increase our knowledge about faraway places and people. Cultures come in a wide variety, and we can learn about all of them from the comfort of our own home. We can also learn about nature from our home. Learning about different cultures can teach us many things, like what kind of clothes they wore, the food they ate, and the places they lived in. This allows us to change our own culture by getting inspired from others. Learning about new places can help broaden our minds about other spots in the world that can lead to a vacation. Lastly, computers allow us to interact with friends from our chairs. Chatting, e - mailing, and video - chatting are all great ways to stay in touch. With a webcam, you can even see the other person as if you were face - to - face with them. You can also e - mail important files, such as pictures, documents, and even videos. This can be very helpful for someone's job. In conclusion, computers can teach us hand - eye coordination, can teach us about faraway places and people, and let us interact and share with friends. Computers are a very important part of my life, and their benefits are truly invaluable.
1138	1141	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. Those who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people like me. They teach hand - eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and they even allow people to interact online with other people. I will tell you why we should benefit from these computers. The first reason is that computers teach hand - eye coordination. You can learn how to type really fast. Without good hand - eye coordination, how are you supposed to hit a ball coming at you with a bat, or how are you supposed to catch a ball with your hands? The second reason is that you can learn about faraway places and people. Cultures come in a rich diversity, and we can learn about all of them from the comfort of our own home. We can also learn about nature from our home. Learning about different cultures can teach us many things, such as what kind of clothes they wore, the food they ate, and the places they lived in. This allows us to change our own culture by getting inspired from others. Learning about new places can help broaden our minds about other spots in the world that can lead to a vacation. For example, if we learn about a beautiful beach destination, we might plan a trip there. Lastly, computers allow us to interact with friends from our chairs. Chatting, e - mailing, and video - chatting are all great ways to stay connected. With a webcam, you can even see the other person as if you were face - to - face with them. You can also e - mail important files, such as pictures, documents, and even videos. This can be very helpful for someone's job. In conclusion, computers are really special because they teach us hand - eye coordination, let us learn about faraway places and people, and enable us to interact with friends. We should all make the most of these wonderful machines.
1139	1142	1	3	"Dear @PERSON1, @CAPS1, you know that @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2 spend too much time on their computers. I believe people should spend more time outside with their family. This excessive computer use can certainly lead to brain problems, difficulty seeing, and the biggest concern is death. First of all, there are people with brain problems because they are on the computer too much. When they are out with their family, their minds are still on the computer. People stay on their computer for a non - stop amount of time. In a recent survey, it showed that teenagers stay on the computers the most. Most people don't have a life outside their computer room. Eye doctors have been getting calls from parents. They are worried that their child/children have a hard time seeing. I interviewed an eye doctor, and this is what he had to say: ""I had one child come into my office, and he had the hardest time seeing."" He asked the child's mother why he was having a hard time seeing, and she said, ""My son spends on average of three and a half hours on the computer."" The child had to get a pair of special glasses so that he could see better. These glasses are really expensive. I have read about children and adults dying from using the computer too much. They have fried their brains from over - using the computer. Their brains tell them to do things that are illegal. For example, breaking into homes, killing people, and hijacking cars. I heard one kid used the computer so much that he started to kill people and got shot by a cop. The more people die from using the computer too much, the higher the death toll will be. It is now or never for our friends out there to work together on cutting down on how much we use the computer. I'm sure that no one wants to be part of the death toll until it's absolutely necessary. It is time to go outside and have fun with your family. They miss spending time with you. So get off your butt and go outside. But wait, make sure you turn your computer off so that you are not tempted to go back on it. By reducing our computer use, we can lead healthier and happier lives."
1140	1143	1	3	To the @CAPS1, I have recently heard that some people think that computers don't benefit society. However, I disagree with that. First, it allows children and adults to learn about distant places and other things. Also, it allows family and friends to connect with other family and friends. And lastly, it is a form of entertainment on a day that you can't go outside. Some people might not agree with me. However, I believe the computer wasn't a waste of thought. I think the computer is a benefit to society and the whole world. First, the computer allows children and adults to learn about distant places and other things. People, professors, historians, and other highly educated individuals share past discoveries and information about various things every day. That means every day someone can learn something new. When I do research on an important person in history, I learn things I never learned in school. The computer is the best way to allow people to share the info they've learned for other people to see and gain knowledge from each other. There are endless possibilities for everyone who owns a computer to learn. You wouldn't believe the things you can learn on a computer, such as unique historical events, rare natural phenomena, and different cultural traditions. Also, the computer allows family and friends to stay in touch with other family and friends in far - away places. If there were no computers and some of your family moved to a different city or country, there wouldn't be an efficient way to stay in touch with them. The computer allows you to send e - mail to a family's computer or cellular phones. The computer is the best way to stay close to your family even though they are far away. My brother is in @LOCATION1, and every day I get on the computer when I get home and video - chat with him. If there was no computer, I wouldn't be able to chat with my brother as easily. Lastly, the computer provides a form of entertainment on a rainy day. Certain software gives people the chance to create games and post them online for the public. When I can't go outside because of the weather, I get on my computer and play video games. The games keep me company. I can even play with other people through online multiplayer. Some of the games are educational as well. They teach you different things about history, like historical battles, famous leaders, and ancient civilizations. In conclusion, computers are truly a remarkable invention. They offer a wealth of knowledge, help us stay connected with loved ones, and provide entertainment. We should embrace the many benefits that computers bring to our lives.
1141	1144	1	3	"Dear @LOCATION4 @ORGANIZATION2, Computers are truly a remarkable invention, yet an increasing number of people are starting to develop a dislike for them. On the one hand, I firmly believe that computers have far - reaching positive effects on people. First of all, they offer a wonderful avenue for kids to have fun. Moreover, people can learn a plethora of very interesting facts. Lastly, it serves as an excellent means to communicate with friends and family. These are a few compelling reasons I think computers put a positive effect on people. To begin with, on a computer, you can have a great deal of fun by playing a wide variety of games. The computer also saves money for a lot of us. For example, if you were to buy a dedicated game system, it would cost well over @MONEY1, but on a computer, you can easily find and play numerous games for free. Not all games have to be like ""@CAPS2 of @CAPS3"" or ""@CAPS2 of @CAPS5""; they can be engaging games about sports. Suppose one student broke his leg and he loves playing soccer. He could simply turn on the computer and play a realistic game of soccer even though he has a broken leg. People can also learn various facts right from the comfort of their computers. The most important thing that computers are made for is to facilitate learning new things. No one in the @CAPS2 knows everything, but if everyone puts what they know into the computer, then people can learn anything from them. I remember once when my friend told me about some guy named @PERSON2. I had no idea who he was, so my friend started laughing at me. When I got home, I searched him up, and by the time I was done reading about him, I knew more than my friend about @PERSON2. If we ever have a question in class and our teacher can't answer it, he/she always tells us to either ""@CAPS7"" it or ""@CAPS8"" it. They both are popular search engines. Not only can you learn a lot from computers, but you can also communicate with people from different countries. What if @PERSON1 did not invent the telephone? How different would our life be right now? Anyway, most people use the computer to communicate nowadays. Whether it's through video calls or instant messaging, or whether it's @ORGANIZATION1 or @CAPS11, all are great ways to communicate with people. With telephones, it costs money to talk with people in a different country, but with the computer, it is absolutely free. You could be living in @LOCATION1 and chatting with someone in @LOCATION5. You could live in @LOCATION2 and email someone in @LOCATION3. Communication everywhere is fast and easy with the computer. My whole family lives in @LOCATION6, and it costs us twice as much to make a call there. When we use the computer, it is even better because they can even see our face through the webcam. As you can see, computers are not negative at all. All I know is that they help people around the @CAPS2. They help kids have fun with the games we can play. Additionally, it teaches children and adults various new things. Lastly, it is a great communication strategy. I hope that you put those reasons in our local paper so everyone can see how computers have a positive effect on people."
1142	1145	1	3	Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, Have you ever considered that over @PERCENT1 of @CAPS3 own computers? Computers are one of technology's greatest marvels and are rapidly sweeping across the nation, as well as the entire world. As you can probably tell, I whole - heartedly believe that computers have positive effects on people. Computers teach hand - eye coordination, create the ability to learn and research quickly and efficiently, and don't forget that they offer multiple ways to chat online. Have you ever played a game of baseball where you just can't seem to hit the ball? Well, it sounds like you need to work on your hand - eye coordination. Studies have shown that @PERCENT2 of people that use computers have an increased hand - eye coordination when doing activities like sports or games. So if you use a computer regularly, you'll be hitting homeruns, not striking out. After you've won your baseball game, it's time for homework, and guess what? Your teacher assigned a project that's due tomorrow! Don't panic, just get online! Computers help you learn and research at a much faster pace than going to the library and getting a book. Say you need to know the date when olympic gold medalist @PERSON1 was born, just google it! Finally, once you have your information, all you have to do is cite your source. Ok, now your homework is done and you want to talk to your friend about your plans on @DATE1. Computers offer numerous ways to chat online. There's @CAPS4, @CAPS5, @CAPS6, woVoo, @CAPS7, and many more. So you sign into @CAPS7 and talk with your best friend. Now you're not bored anymore. Computers are a great way to decrease boredom, just by talking with friends online, but you better go to bed soon because you have @ORGANIZATION1's in the morning! As you can see, computers are deeply incorporated into our daily lives. They're everywhere! I believe that they're changing society, mostly for the better. They teach hand - eye coordination, help you research and learn, and let you chat with friends. Additionally, if you don't already have a computer, then it's high time you get one.
1143	1146	1	3	@ORGANIZATION1, In my point - of - view, I firmly think that computers are positive and can provide a vast amount of information to us humans. Even though some people say computers are sometimes used way too much, computers play a crucial role in helping the world stay connected with relatives and family from around the world, finding jobs in different countries and states, and also learning about the entire world. I'm going to explain to you in detail why I think computers are positive for humans. To start off, I would like to say that not everyone's families and friends live close to each other. They might live across the whole other side of the world. This is precisely why we have webcams and chatting options on computers. How could anyone expect us to see our family and friends if there were no webcam? Okay, yeah, we have cell phones, but not everyone can afford them. People can go to their nearest library and use the computer there for free! The next reason why I say that computers are important is that when you get tired of or fired from your job, you can't just sit at home and expect to live in your house for free. You have to find another job. You can sign up for jobs right on your computer. How much easier could it get? Now you don't have to borrow your mom's car to go to the interview. Furthermore, the last reason I would like to mention is that learning about the world is very important for both the young and the old. You don't think that every single teacher visited somewhere else and that's how they know about the world? No, of course not! Teachers also use computers to look up information on a certain subject. For me, I like to learn about crocodiles in @LOCATION1. I live in the @ORGANIZATION2. Do you really think I would go all the way to @LOCATION1 to learn about crocodiles when I can just turn the computer on and get lost in the crocodile world? No, of course not. It would be fun though to travel to @LOCATION1 to see that, but I don't have that kind of money. To sum all this up, I think you can see my part of the argument. I really consider leaving computers to do what they do best: helping humans. It's one of the best inventions ever made. Wouldn't you agree?
1144	1147	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1 staff, Are computers helpful to us on a regular basis? Computers are extremely helpful machines that significantly increase productivity daily. Computers not only assist people in discovering @ORGANIZATION1 places and learning more about other parts of the world but also allow people to communicate with others around the globe. In addition, computers are equipped with word processors and other useful applications that help workers carry out their jobs daily. So, now, do computers help people learn more about our earth? Many teachers and students use computers daily to aid in their teaching and learning processes. There are numerous online websites that help students discover and understand different areas around the world. For example, there is a @LOCATION1 website (www.canadamaps.org), and this website has an interactive map where students have to match the place/area onto the map. There are also websites such as mapquest and yellowpages to help people navigate cross - country and around town. As you can see, computers also contribute to students' education and just our everyday life. A large number of teenagers of all ages like to use a program on computers called @CAPS1. @CAPS1 stands for @ORGANIZATION2 @CAPS2 @CAPS3. This program enables people of all ages to talk with their friends or colleagues instantly. What one does is type in a chat box to someone, and the message is instantly sent to the person. Emailing is used for many purposes. It can be used to catch up with friends or to discuss something with another person. One can also attach documents that usually consist of important information. Emailing helps things go faster, just like your computer. But, if your newspaper were written out by hand, then that would take a lot of time, require many people, a large amount of paper, and a significant amount of money. As you can even see, @ORGANIZATION1, computers are a necessity! So, as you can see, computers really are needed. Computers affect us in many ways that aren't noticed clearly or easily. Like I said, computers teach and help people learn about different places around the world today, help us communicate with others around us or in @LOCATION2! And as well, they allow us to bring our work, family, friends, and cases everywhere we go. In addition, computers allow us to word - process papers so that our lives are made easier for our everyday life. So, don't spend your life on the computer, but use it for our needs. Please use computers to help our everyday routine. Stop writing on that pad, get up and type it on your computer!
1145	1148	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, Have you probably noticed that there is a lot of controversy over whether computers are helpful or harmful? I for one wholeheartedly agree that computers are helpful because they help you learn about new things, talk to people around the world, and try new experiences. For instance, have you ever wondered what the capital of @LOCATION6 is? Well, with the computer, you could find that answer in the blink of an eye. That's because the internet provides unparalleled information that no book can offer. The internet really lets you see what is happening in our world because there are various news sources and blogs on it. @PERSON1, do you remember the earthquake in @LOCATION4? Well, I sure do, because I found out about it on the internet. You can also find directions to places, sports stats, and information about different locations. Well, what's a better way to find out about those places than talking with people who live there? I don't think anything is. Seriously, is it better to read about @LOCATION5 or talk to someone in @LOCATION5? That's the beauty of the internet; it bonds the world together into a tighter relationship. I remember chatting with people from @LOCATION3 while the gold medal game was on. Sure, some people would say that you could meet someone in person from a different country. Well, how would you meet someone from @LOCATION2 in @LOCATION1? Because I never have. People could say go to the place to talk to the person, and with the internet, it's very possible. Have you @PERSON1 ever wanted to go to @PERSON4? Well, with the internet, all you need is your credit card, and you could be there tomorrow because the internet allows you to try new things. Have you ever wanted to try ping - pong? If so, you could order a set online and have it shipped to you in a couple of days. I always wanted to go to a zoo, but I didn't know of any. So I used the internet to search for zoos near @LOCATION1, and before I could even move, the results for @PERSON2 zoo were right in front of me. That is why the internet is very helpful. To sum it all up, the internet is very helpful to people who use it correctly. But I agree that the internet can be inappropriate. With proper filtering of the not - needed sites, the internet can do almost anything.
1146	1149	1	3	Dear The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, Computers are truly a remarkable piece of technology. They are great for numerous reasons. Three prominent reasons are pleasure, convenience, and education. I firmly believe that these three aspects are the primary drivers for our widespread use of computers today.  One reason we use computers is for pleasure. On various websites, you can engage in conversations with friends, keep tabs on what they're up to, and even have face - to - face video chats. Moreover, you can enjoy a vast array of entertainment options such as watching blockbuster movies, binge - watching your favorite @CAPS4 episodes, and exploring countless videos. In addition, the computer serves as a personal music player where you can listen to your favorite tunes, play exciting games of all genres, and quickly check the latest sports scores. I strongly believe that pleasure is one of the main reasons we use computers today.  Another reason why we use computers is convenience. Most households in @LOCATION1 are equipped with a computer. Computers are incredibly convenient as you can pay your bills online with just a few clicks. You can also communicate with co - workers about work - related matters via email. Additionally, computers empower people to create professional websites, making their businesses more visible and accessible to a wider audience. As you can see, computers are a very convenient piece of technology.  The final reason why we use computers is education. On a computer, you have access to a wealth of knowledge. You can delve into @CAPS5 history, explore different sports disciplines, and stay informed about current events around the world. Computers can assist you in studying effectively, taking detailed notes, and completing your homework. When I have a project, I always turn to the computer to find in - depth and important information about the topic. As you can see, education is the most important reason why we use computers.  Now, I think you understand how computers are indispensable in @LOCATION1's education, pleasure, and convenience. I hope you've taken my opinion on computers into account, and I also hope you continue to spread the word about how great and essential computers are in our daily lives.
1147	1150	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, It is my belief that people are spending an excessive amount of time on computers. Nowadays, computers have become so versatile that you can do almost anything on them. For instance, you can talk to friends, play a wide variety of games, and even control your home lights! But, what are they taking away from us? They are eroding our communication skills and giving rise to cyber - bullying. They also prevent us from enjoying the beauty of nature and engaging in physical exercise.  One out of every @NUM1 teens spends more time communicating with people on the computer than having face - to - face conversations. This mode of communication hinders children from learning valuable social skills that come with in - person interactions. As a result, it becomes more difficult for children to make friends or perform well in work - related situations. Studies indicate that with each new generation, communication skills are decreasing by @PERCENT2. Eventually, if this trend continues, we will end up in a world where real - life communication is severely lacking.  This style of communication has also spawned a new type of bullying. What have we done to our social fabric? You waste over @NUM2 days a year sitting in front of your computer. During this wasted time, you could be out jogging or taking a leisurely walk. In fact, the percentage of people who own a computer is much greater than the percentage of people who exercise regularly. The computer can't do the exercise for you. You physically have to get up and move. It's beneficial for your health and allows you to breathe in fresh air.   Regarding fresh air, @PERCENT1 of people who use computers at home are more likely to fall sick than those who take breaks and go outside. Sure, you can look up a green - spotted tree on the internet, but it's nothing like seeing it in real life. Discoveries about new species can't be made on the computer; you have to go out into nature to find them. People are becoming more and more detached from the environment because of the computer. They are looking at pictures instead of experiencing the real thing.  After writing this, I realized that I was also guilty of these habits, which scared me the most. I've noticed that I am becoming more and more dependent on the computer each day. I don't see my friends as often, I don't go outside as much, and I don't exercise as regularly. This is true for most people, whether they realize it or not. I personally vow to cut down on my computer time starting today. If you limit your time on the computer, you will see the difference. Computers are taking over our lives, and it's time we break free from their hold and do something more meaningful with our lives. This will improve our overall well - being. So, this brings me to my final point: computers are a bad influence on humans, and we should use them less and focus on bettering ourselves by doing more in the real world. Thank you for your time.
1148	1151	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I am writing to you today to express my view that the increasing use of computers is a great thing. The reasons behind my belief are that it teaches hand - eye coordination, it enables people to learn about faraway places and people, and it allows people to communicate online with others.  The first reason why I think more and more people are using computers is that it enhances hand - eye coordination. For example, there are typing programs available for the computer that train you to type using all your fingers instead of just your index fingers. Through consistent practice, you can learn to type accurately without even looking at the keyboard, which significantly improves your hand - eye coordination.  The second reason is that it gives people the ability to learn about faraway places and people. Suppose you have a school project and you're researching another country. You can use your computer to gather detailed information about their religions, cultural traditions, and the overall characteristics of the country. You can also explore different kinds of people. You can look up historical figures like @PERSON1 from @DATE1's era to @PERSON2, who is our current president. This exposure broadens your knowledge and understanding of the world.  The last reason is that it allows people to talk online with other people. You can set up an account on popular social media platforms like Facebook, MySpace, @CAPS1, or @CAPS2 and start interacting with people. You might even get to know some kids in your neighborhood that you've never met before.   Lastly, I firmly believe that the increasing use of computers is a wonderful development. People can learn hand - eye coordination, gain knowledge about faraway places and people, and have the opportunity to talk to others online. I talked to the people who have just started using computers, and @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people said that they were impressed with what they had experienced. So, I encourage you to go out and get a computer and see for yourself how beneficial it can be. Thank you.
1149	1152	1	3	Imagine this: You entered a raffle at your child's school for an all - expense paid trip to @LOCATION1, and you won! You're initially overjoyed, but then it dawns on you that you know nothing about @LOCATION1. You're clueless about the local weather conditions and the types of food they eat. You're not quite sure how to prepare for the trip. So, you turn to the computer and use the internet to learn everything you need to know about @LOCATION1. You pack appropriately, taking into account the climate and cultural norms, and you end up having a fantastic time. All because you had a computer.  Computers can significantly enhance your education, regardless of your age. They also enable you to stay connected with friends and family and are essential for many jobs. Computers allow us to learn about different countries and cultures. We now have a much deeper understanding of other places compared to the pre - computer era. But computers can teach us so much more than just about different countries. They can help you learn a whole new language, or they can assist you in grasping complex science concepts better. There are numerous online colleges where you can study at your own pace, which is extremely convenient if you have a busy schedule.  The internet is an excellent way to keep in touch with your friends and family. You can use various methods such as email, instant messaging, video chatting, or create an account on social media websites like Facebook or MySpace. For example, my cousin has been in the navy for @NUM1 years. Before I got a Facebook account, we had lost touch. Now, I can talk to him regularly and stay updated on his life.  When most people think of computers, the first thing that comes to mind is the internet. However, computers have many other uses. Nowadays, many jobs rely on computers. Banks use them for financial transactions, @CAPS1 professionals use them for data analysis, teachers use them for lesson planning, @CAPS2 workers use them for administrative tasks, and even cashiers use them for processing payments. Computers are no longer a luxury; they have become a necessity. In fact, @NUM2 out of @NUM3 jobs require computer skills. Computers allow you to type up a well - formatted book report or make an important letter look professional.  Computers have revolutionized the world, and once the change has occurred, there's no going back. As we've seen, access to a computer made that trip to @LOCATION1 a breeze. Clearly, computers have become an integral part of our daily lives. You can use them to stay connected with friends, perform your job efficiently, and most importantly, learn a vast amount of knowledge. In conclusion, computers have transformed the way we live, learn, and work, and their importance will only continue to grow in the future.
1150	1153	1	3	"Imagine this: You entered a raffle at your child's school for an all-expense paid trip to @LOCATION1, and you won! You are so excited until you realize you know nothing about @LOCATION1. You don't know what the weather is like, you don't know what kinds of food they eat. You're not quite sure how to prepare for the trip. So you go online and learn everything and anything about @LOCATION1. You pack appropriatly, and you have a great time. All because you had a computor. Computers can help you get a better education, no matter what your age. It also gives you the ability to keep in touch with friends and family, and are necessary for many jobs. Computers help many people learn about different countries and cultures. We know so much more about other places now than we did before computers. But computers can teach you so much more than just different countries. They can teach a whole new language, or help you understand the science lesson better. There are many online colleges where you can learn the lessons online and on your own time which is good if your really busy. The internet is a great way to keep in touch with your friends and family. You can use email, instant messaging, video chatting, or you can make an account on websites like facebook or myspace. For example, my cousin is in the navy, he has been for @NUM1 years, and before I got a facebook, I had lost touch. Now I talk to him all the time. When most people hear computers, the first thing that pops into their head is ""internet"". But that's not all a computer is good for. Nowadays, many jobs use computers. Banks, @CAPS1, teachers, @CAPS2, even cashiers. Computers are no longer a luxury; they have become a necesity. In fact, @NUM2 out of @NUM3 jobs require a computer. Computers allow you to type up that book report, or make a very important letter look professional. Computers have changed the world; and once it's changed there's no going back. So, it looks like access to a computer made that trip to @LOCATION1 easier. Clearly, computers have become a part of every day life. You can keep in touch with your friends and use it for your job. But most importantly, you can learn so much!"
1151	1154	1	3	Dear Readers, I understand that some people in [MONTH1] think computers can affect people's lives. This is because it causes them to not go outside exercising and enjoying nature. My point of view is that people have the choice to go outside, exercise, and enjoy nature. Computers give so much information that it could give people ideas of different activities people can do outdoors, like hiking in nearby trails or having a picnic by the lake. Computers also have the ability to download videos and other software that people can look at and perform exercising with them, and learn techniques such as proper yoga postures. In my life, my mom and dad, and many other people in my family, look online at different websites to see what activities we can do on the weekends and seasonal activities, like apple - picking in the fall. Computers are very important and are life - changing. If it wasn't for computers, some people wouldn't be able to get an education. Doctors, police officers, and banks use computers for their jobs and it helps us go through our everyday lives with ease. From what I see and understand, computers have a positive effect on our lives. Computers can be negative but it all has to do with self - control and how you use it.
1152	1155	1	3	Computers are becoming more advanced every day. Almost everyone owned, or owns a computer. I think they benefit society very greatly. One of the many ways is that they teach you hand - eye coordination. So even when you're playing games, your hand - eye coordination is improving. With hand - eye coordination, you might need it to play sports like baseball. When do you need hand - eye coordination the most? I use it most when I'm playing hockey or baseball. For instance, when hitting a fast - moving hockey puck or a pitched baseball, precise hand - eye coordination is crucial. So next time you're on a computer, remember your hand - eye coordination is improving. Another reason we benefit from having computers is that we learn about far - away places. For example, you know about places that are far away from you that you can or can't travel to. Use a computer to gain some background knowledge. If you travel somewhere on business and know nothing about it, what do you do? I know! Get on a computer and do some research about it! An example of this is if you have to fly out to [LOCATION1] and don't know anything about it, use a laptop on the way over there. If you do that, you'll have some schema about the place, like local customs and popular attractions. As you can see, laptops and computers are great for learning about foreign countries. Finally, computers are great for learning a new language. You need to learn Spanish in a couple of weeks. What will you do? Download a free language - learning app. If you don't know a lot of French and need a few words but don't have a dictionary, use a translator. When you are talking to someone from [LOCATION1] and you don't know their language, use an English - to - African dictionary translation app on your computer. Computers have great translator applications that are free. So if you don't know a language, hop on a computer and learn it! In conclusion, computers are used every day and help us greatly, whether it be learning a new language, or just talking to friends. Computers benefit society greatly.
1153	1156	1	3	"To the editor of the daily newspaper, I strongly believe that computers have a negative affect on people of all ages. Computers these days are being used way too much for privileges that we already have. While people are using the computer for random activities, they are not having any physical activity. Also, emailing and Facebook are great websites to communicate with, but people are checking emails all the time instead of paying attention to when their parents get home from a long day at work. With this, people are so consumed into the computer that kids get side - tracked and forget to do homework. Computers are a great invention, but with today's society, there are too many issues that aren't always being addressed. In the first place, people aren't getting the exercise that they need because they are playing on the computer or video - chatting with a friend. About [NUM1] of America is obese, so exercising should definitely be a priority, but with these new websites and activities on the computer, people are getting held back. For example, instead of going for a jog in the park, they're sitting in front of the screen. With this, kids and adults are communicating in high - end ways that waste too much time. The computers have so many unimportant activities that are not needed, which make us not exercise because many people think that the options and webpages are important and needed. Indeed, computers are a technology that is needed, but people are taking advantage of it too much by having their whole life in the computer instead of having it toward other things such as exercising and being healthy. In addition to computers taking away from exercising, they are also taking time away from your family. For example, [TIME1] when my dad got home from a long day at work, no one truly gave him the bear hug that he was longing for because everyone was so interested in their email or what my sister's friend just said on Facebook. Family is the most important part of your life, and if computers are getting in the way, computer use absolutely has to be changed. Which is more important to you, family or computers? I understand that you still talk to your family and give them hugs, but when you're talking to your sister through Facebook even though she's just in the next room, it's obvious something needs to be done. Computers affect you and everyone around you in more ways than one. Finally, computers take away time from family but also from schoolwork and work. Most kids spend so much time on the computer that they forget to do their homework. This is unacceptable. Kids and teenagers are always playing games, Facebooking friends, and video - chatting, making them realize late that they need to start their homework! A girl from [PERSON1] said, ""One time I was on Facebook for the whole afternoon and then I realized I never started my [CAPS2] essay!"" This has happened to so many people because computers are too distracting and drain your brain. Moreover, yesterday I remember that I was video - chatting my friend for [NUM2] hours and didn't start my homework until [NUM3]! The computer distracts everyone that uses it, which is unacceptable. Without a doubt, computers have a negative affect on people. They take people away from exercising and waste time in front of the computer, which is unbelievable and terrible. Also, they cut communication with your family, making it rare to truly bond with them. With this, people become glued to the computer and forget to do their homework. Overall, computers are things that make life that much more stressful. Thank you for listening."
1154	1157	1	3	"In my opinion, computers are a good source of information, communication, and business. Computers make things easier. For example, instead of going to the library to get information on something, you can use a computer. Computers are one of the most advanced technologies. You can search for anything in the world, like historical events or scientific theories. Computers are also a huge help on a project at school or at work. Some people's jobs require them to use computers, such as graphic designers who use design software. Computers are even good for learning about things you've never even heard of. Some people even take classes online, like online language courses or coding classes. Computers could also be helpful to plan a vacation. You can look up travel destinations, book flights and hotels, and read reviews from other travelers. Computers are often used to communicate with others, family, and friends. If you own a computer, you most likely have an email, homepage, or [CAPS1] to keep in touch with people. There are even sites to meet new people, like dating sites or hobby - based forums. In my opinion, I think computers have a positive effect on people. Computers can be used for many things; they are a good source of technology. Computers could take much time off your hands. For example, you have a [NUM1] - page essay due tomorrow. I'm sure it'd be way easier and faster to type it out than to write it and mess up. When typing a letter or paper, computers have ""spell - check"" so if you mess up on a word, it will show you where you made your mistake to save more time."
1155	1158	1	3	Dear newspaper, I think that there are many reasons why computers are good for people. Computers are good for people because they help keep friends connected. Reason two is that they can be great knowledge sources for people. The third reason that computers are good for people is that there are many programs that are team - based and help people with teamwork and team - building skills. Those are three of the many reasons why I think that computers are good for people and have had a positive effect. First of all, I think that computers are good for people because they help keep friends connected. If you move to another town, go to a college far away, or move because of a job, you will most likely, if it is further away, lose connection with your friends. But using a computer can solve that problem. In social networking sites like [CAPS3], Twitter, and MySpace, you can simply look up your distant friends from where you previously lived and have contact with them. You can catch up with each other, recall good times you've had, and maybe make plans to meet each other sometime. [PERCENT1] of [CAPS2] have been reconnected using social networking sites on a computer. Experts also say that it is important to stay connected with your past to sustain well - being and to be happier. I have had an experience when a social networking site has reconnected me with a [CAPS2]. When I was younger, I had a [CAPS2] whose grandmother lived close to my dad. After a little over a year of us being good friends, he moves to [LOCATION1]. I thought I would never hear from him again. Later that year, I also moved to a different town. Then, my [CAPS2] searched me on [CAPS3] and we got connected again. I have found out he moved back to where I used to live. That is the first reason I think that computers are really good for people. The second reason is that computers can be great knowledge sources for people. If you ever need to get information and don't have to go through the hassle of searching a book, then a computer is the thing for you. As long as you know how to find an accurate and reliable source, then a computer is an amazing tool. You can look up almost anything and you will be able to find lots of information on it. Statistics show that you can find [PERCENT2] more information on a computer than in a book. Experts have stated that soon books will be obsolete and computers will reign as knowledge sources. That is the second reason why I think computers are good for people. Last of all, I think that computers are good for people because there are many programs that help with teamwork and team - building skills. What I mean by programs is, of course, video games. Almost all of the computer games out there have multiplayer features. Within the multiplayer universe, there are match types that involve a great amount of teamwork. For example, in some strategy games, players need to coordinate attacks and defenses. In the age of these games, you must communicate and talk to your team if you want to win. And that is the only way you will win is by using teamwork. That is the third reason why I think computers are good for people. In conclusion, I think that computers are good for people. They help to reconnect friends, provide knowledge, and build team - building skills with programs that are available for them.
1156	1159	1	3	"In a study conducted by @ORGANIZATION1, @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people are spending more than @NUM3 hours a day on the computer. ""Since computers became so popular here, there has been an increase in social problems, health issues, and pollution,"" says @PERSON1. The question is then, do computers really benefit society or do they have a negative effect on people? I strongly believe that these computers are badly affecting us. First, fewer people are spending time outside enjoying nature. Imagine sitting outside under the brilliant fall sun as leaves of red, yellow, and green dance with the wind. How will anyone see the beautiful sights of the outside world if their eyes are glued to the computer screen? Eight out of ten @CAPS2 surveyed by the national nature @CAPS3 admit to not going outside on sunny days but instead playing on the computer. ""The more people who see how beautiful nature is, the less likely they will pollute it with smoke,"" says Dr @PERSON2. How is our country supposed to be clean if people won't even turn off the computer for the @NUM4th hour a day and see the world? In conclusion, computers have a negative effect on a person because they prevent them from seeing beauty. Second, computers take up so much time that people are not spending enough time with their families. I used to think that talking with someone online was enough. Now, I've realized that talking in real life with people is better. I remember meeting a girl. She would always talk with others via email, texting, or instant messaging. Seventy - nine percent of families split up due to social problems. All smart, intelligent people know that talking about families or just having a chat around is important. These successful people know the key to happiness is communication and are working to help get rid of the over - dependence on computers. Lastly, more time on computers means less exercise. Teenagers are supposed to get one hour of exercise each day, but @NUM5 out of @NUM2 teens surveyed at @ORGANIZATION2 admit to not getting that exercise. There has been a @PERCENT1 increase in obesity in children from @DATE1 when computers weren't as big. Now almost @NUM4/2 of boys in @NUM8 grade at @ORGANIZATION2 agree to spending too much time on computers. In conclusion, computers take away some important things like exercise. Come on now - can't we agree that computers have a negative impact? Our poor environment is getting killed because no one sees the beauty of it, families are falling apart as computers occupy their lives most of the time. Stand up against computers today! It will be the best choice you ever make."
1157	1160	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I believe computers have a good effect on people. The reasons I believe that is because the computer teaches us a lot of things. You can also find a relative you have not seen in a long time. Two more reasons are that you could talk to your friends, and another is you need it to put music on @NUM1's, @CAPS1's, and other devices. My first reason I thought computers have a good effect on people was because it teaches us a lot of things. If you wanted to know about a country's culture, you will be able to go and find out on the computer. Without the computer, you would have to visit the country not knowing what shot to take for the sicknesses they have. Other things it could teach you is how to get from one place to another without stopping to ask people where a place is. It's important to know things, and on the computer, you can look it up and find out. Another is you can find a family member you haven't seen in a long time. Being able to reconnect with someone is very important. What if something happened to them and you didn't know, like a broken leg or hip? You can find out if you find them on the computer. Also, a lot of people in @MONTH1 have family they miss and want to be close to or talk to again. They cannot find them and feel close to them again. And they can find you if they really need to talk to you. You could also talk to your friends in a chat room with other friends or alone. If you have moved far away, the computer is a good way to keep in touch with your old friends. Talking to a friend relieves some kids of their stress they had. It helps when your friends make you laugh and talk to you about leaving everything alone and taking a breath. Everyone has one friend that talks them out of doing bad things. A friend like that is helpful. Last reason is you need a computer to put music on your @NUM1 players. Music is very fun and a lot of people love to listen to it. If you had no computers, there would be no point in buying a lot of electronic devices because a lot of them you need the computer for. People like to listen to music on their @CAPS1 or @NUM1 while exercising, but you need the computer to put music on it. Without computers, there's no point in having music. In conclusion, I think computers have a good effect on people as they offer knowledge, connection, and entertainment.
1158	1161	1	3	To @CAPS1 regarding your concern, today people of all ages are using computers. Computers are a great way to do reports, talk to friends & family, & also to research things you may have needed to know. Kids in @ORGANIZATION1 have many projects to do, and most of these projects involve writing a paper. Teachers have trouble reading other students' handwriting, so it would be helpful for the students to use the computer to print out a very neat paper. The computer has many ways that you can write that paper, and now it will be very useful. The nearby library will always have extra computers that students can use to write a paper. If you walk by a teenager on the internet these days, you may find them on '@CAPS2'. '@CAPS2' is a website to talk to friends & relatives. Some of these relatives may live very far away or not have a phone to talk on, so you can talk to them here. Some people think '@CAPS2' is 'stupid' and can't be any good because it takes away time for homework, but what if a @CAPS3 forgot to write down the homework? The @CAPS3 could go on '@CAPS2' and chat with a friend from @ORGANIZATION1 to get that homework. There are many search engines on the computer such as '@CAPS4 pile', '@CAPS5', or even the ever - most popular '@ORGANIZATION2'. Most people use these web pages to research for papers, trips, or even just to find out random information. Many people want to go to @LOCATION2 or @LOCATION1 for @CAPS6, but don't know what to do when they get there. By going on one of the search engines, they would find that in @LOCATION1 they could go to the @LOCATION1 zoo. In @LOCATION2 they could go to @CAPS7 world or the @CAPS8 @CAPS9 @CAPS10 to learn all about @CAPS11 and how it is in a @CAPS9. Thank you for taking the time to read this, and I hope you will look into what I said. The computer clearly offers numerous benefits in education, communication, and information - seeking, making it an essential tool in our daily lives.
1159	1162	1	3	"Dear Local @CAPS1 Newspaper, although I see why some people think that computers and technology are bad for society, I on the other hand strongly disagree with them. In my eyes, technology, especially computers, can bring people together and computers are very beneficial to students. Also, computers can save you time and money now. First off, computers can bring people together. I had one of my best friends move across the country, all the way to @LOCATION1! And I don't get to see her, so I now video - chat with her on my laptop. And if I didn't have that opportunity, then we probably wouldn't have stayed in touch with each other. That experience was not only with a friend but it happened with a family member as well, my grandmother. Every year for Passover, the whole family comes to the house to celebrate, but because she is getting older, we video - chat so she can see the whole family together. It is a wonderful experience. As I said before, computers can be beneficial to students. You might be thinking ""I can only understand that"", but I am a student at @ORGANIZATION1 and sometimes I forget to write an assignment down. So I get my laptop and go to @ORGANIZATION1 notes.com. If it weren't for that, I would have gotten a zero on the homework. See! Computers are very beneficial! Have you ever been in a situation where you need something but you just don't have time? Well now many things can be ordered online. You can get things from food to clothes and toys. Surveys have proven that over @PERCENT1 of average consumers order off of the computer and save money from gas because they don't have to drive. Overall, I think computers can be handy and helpful to all ages, especially students with homeworks, for keeping in touch with family and friends, and for adults who don't have a lot of time. And I think as years go by, more and more people will start to realize the great advantages that computers bring to our lives."
1160	1163	1	3	"Dear Newspaper, I strongly believe that the effects on people caused by computers are positive. Computers can help you connect with far - away friends or family members, find great naturistic parks, and help you find local gyms or exercise equipment. These three reasons will show you that computers are a very important asset to our society in the following passage. To start off, computers can help you connect with faraway friends or family members. According to a recent study, @PERCENT1 of @LOCATION1 citizens have talked with a friend or family member living across the country via the internet. Another survey done by The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 magazine showed that the computer is the best way to stay connected with a loved one. @CAPS9 best friend @PERSON3 is @CAPS4, and all of his cousins live in @LOCATION4. @CAPS6 told me, ""If the computer was never invented, they would be like ghosts to me."" @CAPS6 relies on the computer to talk to his loved family. Clearly, the computer plays a huge role in reconnecting faraway friends and family members. How would you feel if you loved nature but could never find any amazing parks? My guess is terrible. Luckily, all you have to do is type in ""amazing nature parks"" in a search engine. In about two seconds you should have fantastic results. Many believe that the computer takes away time to enjoy nature, but I believe that it enhances the experience. @CAPS9 sister loves nature; she loves taking pictures of beautiful scenery. However, she lost interest over time. She said, ""I got tired of taking pictures of the same local things everyday."" I typed in nature parks on a search engine, and @CAPS9 sister is back to traveling all over @LOCATION2. Lean @PERSON2, a nature expert, says that @PERCENT2 of people who lose interest is because they don't know any new places to go. Also, an article in a @CAPS7 magazine concluded that the best way to find nature is the internet. As you can see, if it weren't for the internet, barely anyone would have the love and passion as most people do today for nature. Who needs exercise? Everyone. Currently, @LOCATION3 is extremely overweight. We need to enroll more people in gyms and create more exercise equipment, but how will people find out? Over the computer. According to @PERSON1, @PERCENT3 of gyms have a website which can be accessed over the computer. ""The best way to get members,"" @CAPS8 @NUM1 @LOCATION5 magazine stated, ""is to create a website online."" @CAPS9 friend's dad recently just joined a brand new gym that opened up three days ago. ""How did you find out about it?"" I asked. ""It was simple, I just searched local gyms, and it came up!"" Experts say that the computer restricts time to workout, but in all truth, the computer is the key to getting people to exercise. Connecting old friends and faraway family, finding great nature spots, and finding local gyms and exercise equipment are three very hard things to do. However, these are three things the computer does very well. If reconnecting with loved ones, loving nature, and exercising are bad effects on society, then what is good? Clearly, computers have a highly positive impact on our lives."
1161	1164	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1, I am fully aware of the ongoing and rather intense debate about technology, and more specifically, computers. Computers are truly a remarkable, helpful, interesting, and even fun piece of technology. They open up the world to new people and places, and limiting such a powerful tool is completely uncalled for. Computers are the keys to innovation and creation. When @ORGANIZATION1 conducted a comprehensive study on the use of computers, @PERCENT1 of people stated that they got their news, accessed files, and even planned their daily lives through the computer. Now, @PERCENT2 of creations are being accomplished through the computer. This clearly illustrates the immense power of computers, allowing people to do things that were once considered impossible. Nowadays, humans are capable of spreading information around the world in mere seconds. Computers also play a crucial role in helping businesses grow, whether through effective advertisement or useful work softwares. They are the key to opening the world to new possibilities and options that were not achievable @NUM1 years ago. I understand that my opposition is not only against computers but also wants to limit their use. This is not only unfair but possibly unconstitutional. They argue that people exercise less due to computers. However, @PERCENT3 of people, when asked if computers had negatively impacted their exercise, said ""no."" One man even stated, ""Because of computers, I learned new workouts and even found a great local trainer."" @CAPS2, you can surely understand that computers are not just about games and toys. They allow people to grow and learn more, helping them find places to travel and assisting in their exercise. Computers are a wonderful tool when it comes to communication. Emails, @CAPS3, and other softwares enable people to communicate across the world. @CAPS2, as the world begins to innovate itself, communication is the key. People are capable of spreading news in seconds. In fact, @PERCENT4 of news is now disseminated through the computer. New @CAPS4 times and the Wall Street @CAPS5 have mainly moved their news to the internet, allowing people across the globe to access them. Work is also primarily done through the computer now. People are able to send files, ship products, and even place orders online. Even important business meetings are conducted through the computer, where all the participants can be comfortably at their homes. Computers are a necessity when it comes to communication, work, and news. I sincerely hope you understand and put to use my opinion. Computers are essential for a world that aims to solve problems, communicate effectively, and expand. That is why I firmly believe there is no problem with computers."
1162	1165	1	3	Dear @PERSON1 @CAPS1, I am writing this letter to sincerely inform you that I think computers are a smart investment for a couple of very valid reasons. The following are some key reasons on why computers benefit society. They allow children to do their homework with some much - needed help. Children can talk to their other friends, and when they are bored, they can play games or listen to music on it. UGH! I don't get this sometimes. I am sitting at the kitchen table, trying hard to do my history homework, but I don't know the year the Revolutionary War took place. @CAPS2, I go into my room, turn the computer on, and @CAPS6 there. I quickly go to Google and look up what I need to know. This also benefits parents too. Because if they are doing the bills or something, they don't have to be bothered. The kid could look it up and know it is @CAPS6! Finally, all my homework is done, but my computer is still on. I'm going to see who is online that I can talk to and make sure I didn't miss any homework. Talking to your friends online could really help you stay in contact with friends in other states or just people you don't see very often. This can help make new friends or make friendships closer and cause fewer problems. Alright, nobody is home or online @CAPS2. I think @CAPS3 is going to kick back, turn some music on, and maybe take a nice nap. Or I can play the new Counter - Strike game I got! YEAH, on playing Counter - Strike. I had the least deaths on my team that game! Alright, that's enough of Counter - Strike for the day. I think I'm going to turn some music on and lay in bed, relaxing. Now that I have told you all of the benefits of computers, you @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6! should keep in mind that it can help with homework, talking with friends, or just having some great fun. In conclusion, computers are truly a valuable addition to our lives.
1163	1166	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Computers are helpful once in a while, but @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people firmly believe that they are a waste of electricity. Computers aren't beneficial to everyday life overall. When people are on the computer, they often spend multiple hours glued to it. This means that they aren't getting enough exercise, and they are harming their bodies in the process. Not only this, but people have a strong tendency to use this machine obsessively. They spend more attention on the computer and not enough time with their family. Everyone knows that exercise is important. However, what happens when we don't get enough? Heart disease is the number one cause of death in the @LOCATION1. Heart disease is often caused by obesity. That's what happens when you don't exercise. When you are on the computer, you are sitting down rather than moving around. This means that your metabolism isn't working effectively, and you burn fewer calories. That is not healthy for anyone, even people in perfect condition. Gaining weight isn't the only way you can potentially harm your body. When using the computer, you have to look at the screen, which emits very bright @CAPS3 lights. After looking at the screen for so long, your eyes will begin to feel the harsh effects of the lights. Many people say it's like staring into a flashlight for an extended amount of time. About @PERCENT1 of the kids at our school wear glasses because of using the computer for too long. That @PERCENT1 is @PERCENT2 more than we had before. We used to have about @NUM3. Like I said before, when you use the computer, you use it for an extended amount of time. What about family? They deserve more attention than a machine. To spend more time on the computer than your own flesh and blood isn't right. In a detailed survey, an average of @NUM4 out of @NUM5 people said that they spent about eight hours on the computer between work and home, and only about an hour with family. The results were truly more than shocking. With all of this in mind, ask yourself how useful the computer really is. Sure, it's good at researching things quickly, but it's also good at making people gain weight, making people spend money on glasses, and tearing them away from their family members. At the end of the day, the computer isn't very helpful at all. We should really reconsider our over - reliance on it.
1164	1167	1	3	How do you think the world would be without computers? I think it would bring us back a couple of technological ages. We need computers for communication and to learn things that we need to know. Without computers, our country would be at a significant disadvantage. People say you don't get enough exercise and don't enjoy nature enough. Well, there are ways to address these concerns on computers too. Communication is one of the greatest advantages of computers. Teenagers love to @CAPS9 @CAPS10 each other when they are at home because it's so fast. It's like really talking to them face - to - face. @CAPS1 - @CAPS2 is another popular thing people love to use. Bosses of companies use @CAPS1 - @CAPS2 to send @CAPS10 to everyone so they're all on the same page. There is also a new video chat feature where you can talk face to face with someone and see them from the other side of the world if you wanted to. You can also learn all you need to know on computers. They have dictionary sites, history sites, encyclopedia sites, etc. You can find any specific time in history and have a whole site dedicated to it. Or a well - known site called Wikipedia, where you can look up a certain thing and get a whole web page filled with information about that object or person. Schools also use various sites to help students expand their knowledge. They have math sites, English sites, @CAPS3 studies sites, and (a science teacher's favorite) @CAPS4 @CAPS5 for everything you need to know about science. They also have lots of websites for help with a new language. There is a recent program called @CAPS6 @CAPS7 that is available on the computer and teaches you any language as effectively as any human teacher. Some people still say it's not enough. They say you still need exercise, nature, and time with your family. You can still do all that on computers. You can look up certain workouts that you might want to try. You can search for good trails to hike on that are near where you live. They have websites (like @CAPS8) where you can @CAPS9 @CAPS10, @CAPS11 pictures, play games, and video chat with your family members who might be living across the world from you. But you can still do it. Even though I have explained a lot of reasons why computers are a great thing to have, there are still a ton more. They teach hand - eye coordination and many other skills too. You can check sports scores from the night before or check sports scores from @NUM1 years ago. You can do all this on the computer and more. This is why computers have a positive effect on people, and everyone should have a computer to enhance their lives.
1165	1168	1	3	"Dear, newspaper writer, I think the computer has a positive effect on people because @CAPS1 helps people around the world learn to speak a different language, @CAPS1 helps people talk to their friends around the world, and @CAPS1 helps people by making it easier to write a letter and send it out to people they work for or to their bosses that need the report by the end of the day. Those are the three main reasons that computers have a positive impact. @CAPS1 helps people learn to speak a different language without spending a lot of money. For example, using Rosetta Stone, you have to spend @NUM1 US dollars, but online, you don't have to spend a dime. The best part is that @CAPS1 is completely free. The slogan for Rosetta Stone is ""I have spent less money than months of formal classes."" I think their new slogan should be ""We have a better learning company than anyone else."" That is why @CAPS1 helps people learn a different language. @CAPS1 also helps people by making it easier to talk to their friends. You can use AIM, web - cast, and even text to make it easier to communicate with friends on the internet. The reason these communication tools were created is so people don't have to travel to far - away places and spend money to tell a friend important news. That's just one of the many benefits. So, in conclusion, you don't have to spend a lot of money to tell a friend something. The third reason that the computer helps people is that people can email their boss that they are faxing their final report for the big interview for a new position in the place where they work. @CAPS1 helps your boss by making the report easier to read and better presented. You could be in Japan and your boss could be in Florida, and the message will take like @NUM2 minutes to reach your boss's computer. That is why @CAPS1 makes it easier to send messages to your boss. The three main reasons are that you can learn a different language without paying a dime, you can talk to your friends more easily, and you can send messages to your boss more conveniently than by calling him or her. Those are the three reasons that clearly show computers are positive and bring many advantages to our lives."
1166	1169	1	3	To the Middlebury paper, regarding the article on whether or not computers benefit society, my opinion is that they have numerous pros to make them a worthwhile thing to have in our towns, schools, homes, and businesses. They can help more than they hurt, and can you honestly envision your life without checking e - mails and staying up - to - date with our society? Computers in schools help to increase the amount of learning for our children. For example, a student can study their math facts online during math class or learn about the skeletal system in health classes. It also is an advantage in conserving money because instead of having to pay for your son or daughter to fly to Rome to learn about the Colosseum, you can let them learn about it on the internet first, to see if the trip is actually worthwhile. Also, an essential thing needed in life is hand - eye coordination, and a way to practice that is by playing exercise - practice games on a computer. That helps install the coordination that your towns' children will use for the rest of their lives! Educational benefits will only increase as technology advances, so cutting children off from it now is a big mistake! With computers, communication is seamless. Students can get homework through their e - mail, saving time so they have more free time. The cost - effectiveness of computers is evident because instead of paying for phone bills and tutors for your children and cellphone bills, you can just talk through e - mail and potentially save money! Keeping in touch with families is simplified also because in just one e - mail you can catch up with all your family members! Speeding up communication with computers clearly has benefits no one wants to miss out on. So why would you make that mistake? When addressing the issue, you can't place the blame on computers for why people don't exercise as much. People choose how often they exercise, not the computers. Computers don't control whether you stay connected with your family or not. If anything, they help keep you together! Spending time in nature is that particular person's choice, no one else's. All these cons can't be blamed on computers, because it's the people that decide how much they're used, not the computer. All in all, I think keeping our use of computers where it is now is the best idea, because without it, communication and education will decrease and with that, who says exercising will increase?! Overall, the choice lies with the computer's user, not the computer, so when used with discretion, computers contribute greatly to society.
1167	1170	1	3	"Dear @ORGANIZATION3, it has come to our attention that certain members of our society believe that computers are not beneficial. This position stems from a lack of judgement and a closed mind. Computers are lifelines to business workers who use them to complete all of their work. These tools also enable news of disaster or weather to spread efficiently and effectively. These technological devices also create and sustain communication between family members and friends. In today's society, computers are vital, and getting rid of them would be like stopping oxygen from making its way to the body, accompanied by multiple severe consequences. First and foremost, about 80% of all modern companies require their employees to work on computers. These works of art aren't just handy - dandy toys; rather, they are as essential to the working class as a #2 pencil to a student taking a test. @PERSON3, an owner of a small business, agrees. ""Our company designs software and uses computers extensively. Many of our employees work from home and have to own computers."" The growth of computers is not something to be frowned upon, rather an achievement in technology enhancing the lives of others. By ripping computers from the lives of workers, chaos would be created with many unappealing consequences. Adults aren't the only ones whose jobs consist of computers. Nowadays, students' homework is mostly online. Computers decrease the amount of time needed to write an essay and are a great help to students of all ages. @PERSON4, an eighth - grader at @ORGANIZATION1, is an example of this dilemma. Every night she has at least three hours of homework, and usually one hour of it requires a computer. However, this isn't a problem because it cuts back the time it takes for @PERSON4 to do her homework. She can quickly type up an English essay or research a science topic instead of doing it painstakingly slow using an old - fashioned method. Moreover, computers are doors into the real world, especially for residents of @LOCATION1. Whether some people like to believe it or not, @LOCATION1 is a bit of a secluded area where people aren't aware of what is going on outside of their closed - off town. Computers cause news to spread like electricity and open @LOCATION1 residents' eyes to national and global problems. @PERSON2, another student at @ORGANIZATION5, states, ""When the earthquake took place in @LOCATION3, my friends and I were all at lunch. When we came back to class, our teacher was projecting the news via her computer onto the white board."" If computers were taken away, a stream of knowledge would be cut off from adults and children. Most importantly, computers create communication between friends and family. Calling up to talk to someone isn't always an option, so computers are the better choice. Families can connect with each other no matter whether they have cell - phone reception or what area of the world they are in. @PERSON1, a senior at @LOCATION1 and @ORGANIZATION1, who agrees. ""When I go to college next year, I am going all the way to @LOCATION2 and want to be able to talk to my family. Via email and instant message, I can contact them even when it's inconvenient because they don't have to respond right away."" @PERSON1 brings up a good point. Computers serve the luxury of communication, which is vital to keep 90% of healthy relationships, as shows a study at @ORGANIZATION4. In conclusion, computers are an incredible piece of equipment that should be valued and not taken away. They are vital to workers and students and bring news to residents of any corner of the world. Computers also are how friends and family are able to stay connected and communicate. Therefore, I urge you, readers of the @ORGANIZATION2, to raise your voice about the benefits of computers, so they aren't taken away from our society."
1168	1171	1	3	"@ORGANIZATION1, are you there? ""Can you hear me?"" You never have that issue with computers. It has come to my understanding that there is a dispute about the benefits of computers - should we have them and advance them, or not? Well, I believe that computers are a necessity to an average person. Computers help everyone and make life easier! Sure, there are cellphones and other helpful electronics, but are they always trustworthy? Computers are always reliable - whether it's for homework or another reason! Computers provide easy interaction without disruptions, they make it easier to learn, and if you are smart, then they are safe. Without computers, who knows where our society would be? To begin, computers allow people to have conversations with others who are halfway across the world! There are a variety of applications that you can choose from, and they are all easy to use. My personally preferred option is Gmail email. I myself have family in Australia, which is a whole continent away! Sure, I could call them, but my phone bill would be extremely high! How else am I supposed to keep in touch with my loved ones? Do you know how many others face the same problem? Through a recent study, 200 out of 500 families in New York say they have relatives that are far away. That is 40% of New York's population! Imagine there was no computer for them to use. Phone companies would make a fortune and regular families would struggle financially. Or worse - they would lose any relationship with their family. Do you want that? Computers are easy to access, and you can interact with loved ones, friends, or new people. It doesn't get any better than that! So, which would you choose - losing your family relations or keeping in touch via email and computer applications? If that isn't enough, computers make it easy to learn new things and accomplish tasks. I know that as a student of @PERSON1, other students and I need to type our homework at least three times a week! Just yesterday I had to type up a response, a free - writing choice, and an entry for a history project. Imagine if we had to go back to using typewriters. Either homework wouldn't be done or everyone would have a major lack of sleep. Both options are unacceptable. Plus, computers are great for research. If you have to look up a new country, look at far - away colleges or find out about the world, why not visit your handy computer? You could learn which college is right for you without leaving your house. You could ""visit"" a new country without leaving town! Sure, you could read a newspaper, but answer me this: where does the paper come from? Yup, trees are cut down for them. Computers are the easy, environment - friendly alternative for you. If those two reasons didn't convince you, maybe this one will. Most people think computers are unsafe, and that might be partly true. But if you are smart or listen in school like me, you will know that isn't always the case. In our school, we are taught about the risks of computers and how to prevent any possible threats. I'm sure most schools do. In fact, nine out of ten students say that when it comes to safety, computers are rated an A+. Everyone knows about hackers, and so we avoid them. My parents even say that for over thirty years they have never had a single issue or risk of safety when using a computer, and neither have I. ""Threats are only powerful if you let them be and let them take control,"" says a cybersecurity expert. So, if it's safety you are worried about, then don't. The kids of today and tomorrow know what is out there and how to stop the minor threats. So, why don't we recap what we learned today. Are computers helpful and the best way to go for communication? Yes, they are. What is the best way to learn new things easily? I believe the correct answer is computers. Are they safe even if some don't agree? Yes. It wasn't phones... no, not television... oh yes, computers! I see why you might think kids should be outside, well let me tell you, cellphones and TV will keep them from that anyway. At least computers don't rot your brain. Well, I have done my part. I support computers and their advancement. But it isn't up to me, is it? No, it's not. So please do your part by spreading the word. It's the right thing to do. You know that you want to!"
1169	1172	1	3	More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. I feel that those people who think computers do not benefit society are right. I feel this way because people need to start exercising more, interact with family and friends, and enjoy life. Please read on to understand in detail why I feel this way. Firstly, those who are always on the computer need to exercise more. They need to exercise to stay healthy and strong. If they don't, they will most likely consume more food and gain a significant amount of unwanted fat. Some of them don't even engage in any form of exercise at all. This lack of physical activity can lead to various health problems such as heart disease and diabetes. Secondly, they don't interact with their family and friends as much. Those people tend to argue with their family because they have to get off the computer. When you fight with people, you want to escape the situation, so you go back to the computer. It's not healthy to be on the computer for long periods at a time. This isolation from real - life social interactions can cause emotional distress and a breakdown in family relationships. Lastly, they should enjoy life. They should see the world through their own eyes, party with friends and family, go to college, and do something meaningful with their lives. They need to enjoy things as they originally were without any computers, iPods, or even cellphones. They could go on hikes, visit historical places, or participate in community events. In conclusion, the reasons I feel this way are because people need to exercise more, interact with family and friends, and enjoy life. I hope you understand as to why I feel this way.
1170	1173	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, I believe that computers are beneficial to society. This is because computers perform tasks such as aiding in research, facilitating communication with others, and offering fun games and websites. Computers are really great resources for whatever you are trying to do. Honestly, in a world without computers, I wouldn't know what to do. Computers are like digital encyclopedias, which have just about all the information you are looking for. Computers have databases or websites designed to assist with research, just as they do. Say that you have an essay due tomorrow and you need quick and valid information. You can simply go to JSTOR, which is a well - known computer database. You will end up with reliable facts to help with your final draft. So, you wouldn't have to search far and wide to conduct research. Communicating is something else that the computer helps with. For example, email and Skype are ways to communicate. Email is where you can send a message and wait for a reply, while on the other hand, Skype provides instant replies. The latest thing in the communication world is video - chatting. This is where the person you are chatting with can hear and see exactly what you are doing. This is useful for families who live a good distance from each other. Computers play many roles, and being used for fun is one of them. The internet has many fun gaming websites such as Pogo.com, Miniclips.com, and Kongregate. These websites help take your mind off a bad day. You can also buy computer games for your computer. A very popular game is The Sims. This game is based around your character and the life you choose for it to live. This game can take you to
1171	1174	1	3	"Dear Local @CAPS1 @CAPS2, did you know that a long time spent on technology could result in cancer? Ever since they were invented, computers have been advancing more and more with each passing year. People, especially children, forget the risks to physical health, the well - being of family and friends, and even mental health. The obesity rate is soaring in @LOCATION1, reaching the highest it has ever been. People wouldn't even know that technology is to blame. @CAPS2, did you know that the average @CAPS3 teenager spends at least @NUM1 hours on the computers? Think of all the calories that build up without exercise. If people could limit their computer use, they would be at a lower risk for diabetes. Diabetes is one of the most common diseases associated with technology, besides obesity. @NUM2 @CAPS4 are diabetic, which means we are not at a safe health rate. If you limit computer use to @NUM3 hour a day and work out at least @NUM4 minutes a day, think of how healthy you will be. You will have more energy, better mental focus, sleep won't be an issue, and you will be more physically attractive. Computers also lead to friendships being torn apart. Cyber - bullying is also a problem. @NUM4 of students are cyber - bullies. This means that friendships may fade if they spend all day on the computer, and it takes a toll on mental health when they turn on the device. @CAPS2, did you know that some forms of cancer are caused by the radiation of technological devices? Radiation eats away at the brain, causing Alzheimer's and other mental diseases that often surface in old age. Young adults in school also got used to texting. @PERCENT1 of students text, and @PERCENT2 get used to terrible spelling. That's @PERCENT3 who accidentally write ""thru"", ""lazy"", or even misspell @CAPS5 during school. This is the mental impact of technology taking over. So, as you can tell, computers affect health, socializing, and even mentality. So don't be part of the problem. Please, stop the overuse of technology."
1172	1175	1	3	"Dear people, Computers have been around for not a very long time, and every day, more people buy computers and use them. As they are used for entertainment, education, and talking with people far away, they have had a negative effect on people. Let me explain. First of all, when people start using computers, they enjoy it. They surf the @CAPS1, play games, and use it for work. But as they keep using it, they start to get addicted. People are addicted to computers because of the games and the ability to access the @CAPS1. In fact, @PERCENT1 of all the people in this @CAPS3 who own a @CAPS8 are addicted to computers. That percentage is expected to grow to @PERCENT2 in the next @NUM1 years. Addiction to computers leads to serious issues. People have died because they spent too much time on the @CAPS8 without eating and sleeping. In another newspaper not long ago, it stated that a student attending @ORGANIZATION1 was dropped out for performing so poorly during school. His parents found out that he was addicted to this game ""@CAPS3 of @CAPS4."" This game is currently the most played game on the @CAPS8 in this @CAPS3. Studies state that @CAPS8 addiction is almost as bad as smoking addiction. My second reason why @CAPS8 has a negative effect on people is because of online bullying. People chat on @CAPS5, @CAPS6, @CAPS7, and email, and people are bullied. A friend of mine recently was emailed with words that hurt his feelings. Online bullying is worse than in - person bullying. That's because once you say something on the @CAPS8, people don't know who you are. @PERSON1, a professor who recently conducted studies of online bullying, says, ""Online bullying has become more severe than face - to - face bullying. People are threatened more and hear more bad words than in in - person interactions."" The online bullying and harassment is going to get worse if people don't stop. Also, people can get arrested for what they write online. My final reason why computers have a negative effect on people is that people spend too much time on computers and don't exercise. @CAPS8 contributes about @PERCENT3 to overweight people. On the @CAPS8, everything is much easier. Instead of mailing, you can e - mail. You can listen to music instead of walking up to the radio and turning it on. You can buy tickets, shop, talk with friends, and have fun just by sitting at a @CAPS8. But this is why people become overweight and obese. @PERCENT4 of the people who use computers are obese or overweight. People spend less time interacting with friends and family and enjoying nature. In conclusion, computers have a negative effect on people, and parents should control their child's time on the computers. Just because of a @CAPS8, many issues arise. So, if you think you are addicted, try to make a time schedule for your whole day. Use the @CAPS8 for an hour at a time and take breaks before using it again. Addiction, online bullying, and becoming overweight are not the only problems of a @CAPS8; there are many more."
1173	1176	1	3	Dear newspaper, I hear that more and more people are using computers, and I think that's so awesome because people can talk online with other people. Moreover, they teach you how to use a computer. It gives people the ability to learn about far - away places and people. Computers are the most advanced technology, so it's no wonder that people are using it. I love to be on the computer all day because I always enter @CAPS2 and talk online. For example, some people like to talk with a family member who is not in the @LOCATION1, so they communicate via the computer. Sometimes I talk online with my cousin in @LOCATION2 because I haven't seen her for @NUM1 years. So I think talking online or using the computer is important. For example, even grandma has @CAPS3 and she talks online with her family members. I think using the computer is not a bad thing because it helps you stay in communication with your family or friends. That is why I think the people who say otherwise are wrong. Secondly, it teaches you hand - eye coordination. My grandma is old, but she uses the computer, and for example, she has a nice hand - eye coordination because when she presses the letters, she is always correct. I think computers have a positive effect on people. It also helps people write better. For example, I love writing, and when I write on the computer, I don't need to go elsewhere. It kind of helps me with my eye and hand coordination. Another great thing is that it helps you find far - away places and people. For example, on @ORGANIZATION1, you can find whatever street you want. It also helps you find information about people on the computer. For example, if I have a project, I find the information on @ORGANIZATION1 about people or places. The computer is really helpful because you can find pictures of places and information about people. I think it has a positive effect on people. Finally, I think the computers are great benefits to society. One reason is that you can talk online with people. Additionally, it teaches you hand - eye coordination and helps your brain and sight. It also helps with your hand movements. Another reason is that it gives people the ability to learn about far - away places and people. For example, I have a project in @CAPS7, and I have to learn and search about forensic doctors, and I can search for everything on the computer. I think the computers are a great benefit to society.
1174	1177	1	3	"I agree that computers have a bad effect on people because they will spend less time exercising. Spending too much time on the computer takes away knowledge and time spent with family and friends. So, please listen up as I explain why I feel this way. My first reason for this situation is that people will spend less time exercising, which can lead to drowsiness or laziness if you stop being physically active. Another aspect is that it can affect your ability to run or even stand up because @PERSON1 says that, ""People who exercise a lot will be able to do work, but if you don't, you won't be able to do much."" Also, you'll miss out on the fun while you're too lazy to join in. My second reason for this situation is that it takes away knowledge. For one, you might forget what you learned. Secondly, tutoring might be needed because you couldn't focus. Moreover, you might even forget the people you know and where you live if you spend too much time on the computer. My third reason for this situation is that it takes time away from your family and friends. In conclusion, computers clearly have a negative impact on people in terms of health, knowledge, and social life. We should be more mindful of our computer usage to avoid these negative effects."
1175	1178	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, As a student, I believe that computers have many bad effects on people. Most people think that computers are just new, helpful technology, but there is more to it than that. There are many concerning things going on in the cyber world. Computers are quite helpful in school research, work, and other important stuff, but there are many bad effects too. Kids these days are so attached to their computers almost all day after getting home from school. This means that they barely do homework, projects, and important assignments because they get too distracted by the computer. There are some parents who get tricked by their kids into thinking they are just doing homework, but in reality, kids these days are meeting tons of strangers through social networks such as @CAPS2 @CAPS3, @CAPS4, @CAPS5 @NUM1, @CAPS6, and other networks. Once they decide to meet in person with these strangers, many things can go wrong because not everyone is as nice as they seem through the internet. It shows how dangerous it can be for kids to be using the computers so much. People such as young children, pre - teens, and teenagers are able to view many harmful and inappropriate things that anyone their age shouldn't be viewing at all. Another concern is how people spend all day on their computers, probably eating any type of junk food and then not exercising at all. They gain weight and are not physically fit, which becomes a health issue for kids as young as age @NUM2 to much older people such as age @NUM3 and even older. This turns out to be a bad health lifestyle for people. Since people spend nearly all day on the computer, they aren't able to go out and discover new things, exercise, hang out with friends, or just have fun and spend time with their families. I also strongly consider that the computers or laptops should not stay in a kid's room because then they lock themselves in their room all day and even stay up till really late, even past midnight. Then it becomes a real issue for kids or adults to get up early in the @TIME1 for school or work and they are usually late. This clearly shows how computers are not so great for people all the time. In order for people to be able to use their computers and still have a life, they can plan out a schedule of how long to use the computer, and it might help them out a lot. By taking control of computer usage, we can minimize these negative impacts and lead a more balanced life.
1176	1179	1	3	I believe that people spending too much time on computers can significantly affect their health and the relationships they have with friends and family. If you are engrossed in the computer and one of your friends asks you to go outside, you are most likely to decline because the computer is captivating your attention more than the idea of going outside. This not only hurts your physical health but also strains your relationship with your friend. Similarly, if your family is going to a movie for some quality family time, you might choose to stay home and be on the computer. This has a negative impact on the relationship with your family. Most people prefer to stay on the computer rather than spend time working out. As a result, when you spend a long time on the computer, you often end up feeling hungry and keep eating. Since you're not engaging in physical activity, you gradually gain weight. Moreover, not working out and constantly having your mind focused on the computer can make you more susceptible to getting sick. That's why a large number of people are not in good health due to excessive computer use. Computers can truly mess up your relationships with family and friends. Sometimes, your friend may invite you to go outside or work out, and you say no because you're glued to the computer, which damages your relationship with that friend. Or, your family could be having a movie night, and you're on the computer while they leave. This clearly messes up your relationship with your family. Being on the computer, you might even go nights without getting proper sleep. For instance, if you're playing a really exciting game on the computer and it's time for you to rest, but because the game is so addictive, you don't sleep. Then, after a while, you become addicted and can't stop playing. Consequently, you won't get enough sleep, and if you have school the next day, you won't be able to concentrate as you'll be too preoccupied with the game. In conclusion, computers are not as beneficial as they seem. They can have a detrimental impact on your health, disrupt your social life with family and friends, deprive you of sleep, and make it difficult for you to focus.
1177	1180	1	3	Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1! It's @TIME1, get off that computer. But mom, I don't want to. I'm in the middle of a game. Does that conversation sound familiar? Of course it does. Every kid loves to play on the computer. However, noticing your kid being on the computer @NUM1 for extended periods is definitely not a good thing. In this matter, experts are undoubtedly @PERCENT1 right because both kids and adults are spending an excessive amount of time on the computer. These people could be doing other productive things like exercising more, enjoying nature, and interacting with friends and family. Spending too much time on the computer is extremely unhealthy. On the other hand, if someone kicks you off the computer, you can actually start working towards getting that six - pack you've always wanted. There are three main things that can effectively get you in shape. First, taking a light run every night on your community track can transform your legs. Instead of being fatigued every time you walk up the stairs, your legs will become firm and strong, able to run lap after lap just as a warm - up. Every year, my dad takes me to the track in @DATE1 and times me for @NUM2 and @NUM3 yard dashes, the @NUM4 meter, and the mile. Between the months, I train consistently all the way up to @DATE2, and then my dad conducts another assessment. I do this training because I play baseball. Weight lifting is another excellent way to get in shape. Some basic exercises include bench pressing, squatting, and dumbbell curls. There are more challenging exercises, but I won't elaborate on them here. Once you feel like you're in good shape, take all that training and apply it to a sport. Exercising is not the only alternative. Enjoying nature is also a great option. Just step outside if someone kicks you off your computer. Absorb every aspect of nature, from the scurrying squirrels to the towering trees. If it's winter, enjoy the snow instead of being inside @NUM1 playing computer games. But, if that doesn't appeal to you, then hang out with your family. You can gather your family and plan a trip. You could go to a baseball game, a park, or the movies - anything that will get you away from that computer. In conclusion, I firmly believe people should prioritize exercise, enjoying nature, and spending time with their families instead of being glued to the computer @NUM1.
1178	1181	1	3	One girl sits quietly by her computer, diligently doing her homework. Another girl, also with her computer, is happily chatting with her friends. Those girls are engaging in activities that contribute to making our world more productive. I firmly think that computers have a positive effect on people. Computers can assist people with hand - eye coordination, help them learn about far - away places, and enable them to communicate with others online. These are the ways in which computers can make our society better. Firstly, the computer can teach us valuable hand - eye coordination skills. By playing various games on the computer, we can acquire skills that can be used in real - life situations. For example, a boy can play a football game online and then take what he has learned and apply it in a real football game. Hand - eye coordination developed through computer use can allow us to learn new things about our society. We can utilize these skills to discover novel ideas and contribute to the betterment of the community as a whole. Moreover, these skills can also help us perform multiple tasks simultaneously. Multitasking is a challenging feat, but with the help of hand - eye coordination and computers, it becomes more manageable. A second advantage is that computers can aid us in learning. Some people may be unaware of what's going on in different parts of the world. The computer can direct us to reliable news sources. It is literally like having one huge source of information at our disposal. Another positive effect that computers have on people is communication. Many people have accounts on platforms like Twitter, Facebook, MySpace, etc., and all these websites can facilitate interaction. Products such as Skype, video chat, AIM, and email allow people to have in - depth conversations online. Email, in particular, offers a plethora of possibilities. You can not only talk but also conduct business, send pictures, invitations, and announcements. Schools, offices, and companies all over the world make use of these products, and it not only enhances society but also makes the world a more connected place. In conclusion, computers do indeed have a positive effect on people around the world. They can improve hand - eye coordination, help you learn about far - away places, and assist people in communicating effectively. That one girl doing her homework is more likely to get an A, and the girl talking on her computer can sign off and go to be with her family, having made the most of her computer time.
1179	1182	1	3	Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, I believe computers and advancing technology bring numerous benefits to society because they can enhance hand - eye coordination, offer an easy way to learn about far - away places and cultures, and allow people to save and use their time more efficiently. First of all, every person needs good hand - eye coordination. Without it, you might throw a ball in the completely wrong direction or even end up getting hit in the face with it. Computers also play a significant role in children's education. They can help students discover and learn about far - away places. For example, if a student is studying @PERSON3 in @LOCATION1 in their @CAPS2 @CAPS3 class, @PERSON1 in @CAPS4 class, or maybe @PERSON2 in music class, instead of rummaging through the old, dusty biography book, it would be much easier to look them up on a search engine. Additionally, the computer is extremely useful for everyday working or stay - at - home parents. If you need to get in contact with a certain person or business quickly, you don't have to take the risk of looking in the phone book and finding that the person or business isn't listed. You can simply go to @NUM1.com, type in a last name or business name, and you're all set. Also, if your child is being a nuisance, screaming and running around the house, you can set them up with an educational game on the computer so that you can get your household chores done. These are three of the most important reasons why I firmly believe computers benefit society. They contribute to improving hand - eye coordination, offer effective learning techniques, and save everyday people a significant amount of time. In conclusion, computers are an invaluable asset to society, and their positive impact is undeniable.
1180	1183	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I think computers have a bad effect on people for three main reasons. Firstly, they can really harm your eyes. Secondly, it is not safe if you have little kids in your house. Finally, if you're constantly on the computer, you will rarely see your family or friends. The first reason why computers have a negative impact on people is that they can severely damage your eyes. If you're always staring intently at a computer screen all the time, you run the risk of going blind. Moreover, having poor eyesight can lead to serious head injuries just from the strain on your eyes. The second reason is that it is not safe to have a computer in a home with little kids. For example, you might be watching an adult movie that little kids are not old enough to see. This can have a very bad influence on them. Also, it has a negative effect on family dynamics because if you have a little kid in the house, they might always be around when inappropriate content is being accessed, and they might hear or see things that are not suitable for their age. The third reason is that if you're always glued to the computer, you will hardly ever see your family and friends. You'll miss out on important family gatherings and social interactions. If you're constantly on the computer, you won't be present in the real - life moments that matter. You need to be more aware of what's going on around you and keep an eye on the little kids in the house. In conclusion, it's important to limit computer use. You should get off the computer and go spend quality time with your family and friends, as this is crucial for your well - being and the health of your relationships.
1181	1184	1	3	"In today's day and age, computers are an indispensable key part of business, education, and recreation, and they significantly benefit our society. First of all, you can acquire a better education by learning from them. For instance, they offer interactive learning materials and vast knowledge resources. Also, it is an excellent way to communicate with people across the globe. Finally, it even teaches hand - eye coordination that you can effectively utilize in your everyday life. My first point is that you can get a better education using them. For example, the textbooks that we use in social studies at our school still refers to @LOCATION3 as the @LOCATION1. Computers are a great way to get up - to - date information about the world. ""With our outdated textbooks in school, the @CAPS1 is our number one recourse to get information."" @CAPS2 @PERSON2, eighth - grade teacher. With computers, you can learn about far - away places without leaving the comfort of your own home. In addition to getting a great education from them, computers are an excellent form of communication. I remember when I was in @NUM1 grade and my father was across the world on a business trip. Our phones couldn't call long - distance, so we relied on computers to communicate with each other. This helped me get over my father's absence. When you use a computer to communicate, you are also saving money. ""You can save over @MONEY1 a year when you use the @CAPS1 to communicate over a cell phone."" @CAPS2 @PERSON1, electronics expert. Finally, the use of a computer increases hand - eye coordination. With all the typing you do on a keyboard, your hand dexterity improves steadily. In fact, ""@PERCENT1 of computer users are more coordinated throughout their day, opposed to people who don't own a computer."" @CAPS3, a recent poll in the @LOCATION2 times. And in this day and age, hand - eye coordination is a necessity. Besides, wouldn't you like to have the ability to have your hands work without having to look at them? So as you can see, computers would benefit society and everyone who uses them. They are a great benefit that @CAPS4's need for their education and business. Thank you for listening."
1182	1185	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1, People generally like computers, which is @CAPS2 a well - known fact. They are very much like a dry, addicting, and irresistible entity. Despite what people believe though, computers are very good for our daily lives. You can communicate, play @ORGANIZATION1, listen to music, watch movies, and even learn a language on the computers. So in all ways, the computer is anything but bad. @ORGANIZATION1 are fun. They help us relax. In today's age, traditional @ORGANIZATION1 just don't give people the joy they experienced when younger. Computer @ORGANIZATION1 are the perfect replacement. Imagine playing baseball with a friend who lives miles away from you, while still being a kid in @LOCATION1, or setting out on your exercise adventure. Computer @ORGANIZATION1 broke the border, giving you a higher level or that familiar ""You got mail"". Many people hear that sentence more than once every day. By many, I mean millions. @CAPS2 is an alert saying that someone sent you an email. @CAPS4 are messages sent over the @CAPS7, faster than any traditional service. Instead of waiting @NUM1 days for a letter, in a matter of minutes you can have a message sent to your friends. Microsoft @CAPS3 @CAPS4, and other electronic messaging systems are a superior form of communication, and these let us speak to the world! Although it sounds silly, if @CAPS5 you wanted, you could send a message to anyone with a message box. Let's say you went to watch a certain movie, but you don't own it. With a computer with a disc drive, you can watch any @CAPS6. Better yet, you can download the movie's media available @CAPS7, with you able to watch them with the click of the mouse. Computers are filled to the top with gadgets and accessories that make our life easier. @ORGANIZATION1, movies, @CAPS4 - anything you desire is likely on a computer. They are the perfect tools in modern society, and we truly cannot do without them."
1183	1186	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1: Some people believe computers benefit society. However, others feel they are too consuming. For me, I believe computers help society. Computers teach hand - eye coordination, provide people with information, and even allow us to chat online with other people. I'd bet your job requires you to use a computer, and you probably even have a personal computer which you like to use to chat with friends. I do that all the time and I enjoy it. Another thing I like is sports. One of my favorite sports is softball. In softball, you need to have good hand - eye coordination, which will help you swing at the ball more accurately. When a pitcher throws the ball, you have to hold the bat at the right angle and watch the ball to know when to swing. If kids used computers and became good at hand - eye coordination, then possibly more kids would join a local sports team, and possibly even join a travel team. Do you like to travel? I do, and the way I learn about places before I go is by looking that particular place up on the internet. About three years ago, I went on vacation to @LOCATION1. I wanted to know what it was like there because I had never gone before. So when I looked it up, I found out that they had many tourist attractions and ""packages"" that let you swim with dolphins. I was very excited to go, and when I did, I had a blast. And to think if I didn't look it up, I would not have known what kinds of fun things they had! No wonder so many people like computers! One of the biggest reasons why I like computers is because I can chat with my friends online. One main attraction online is @CAPS2, and everybody, primarily, has one. Some people have one because they like to look at pictures. I have one because I like to chat with my friends. One night I was chatting with a friend. We were laughing and having a great time, and then she reminded me that we had science homework due the very next day! I thanked her and then completed my work. You see, if kids chat online, their friends can remind them of important necessities such as homework. This could improve grades by @PERCENT1! So you now see why society needs computers. And if you have forgotten, let me remind you: computers teach you hand - eye coordination, let you learn about far - away places and people, and now allow you to chat online. Just think what would society be like with no computers. It would be a much less connected and informed place."
1184	1187	1	3	"Dear Local Newspaper, Have you ever used a computer? More than @PERCENT1 of the population uses computers. Computers benefit society and have gotten people all over the world smarter and more advanced. Computers help people learn new things and keep in touch with family and friends! They @MONTH1 also seem a bit addicting, but people generally know when to stop. Computers have brought us a long way! Computers are a magnificent tool for exploring new things. The great websites, for example, search engines, dictionaries, and even @CAPS1, all virtually encourage us to learn about the ""riches"" of the tropical @LOCATION1. By allowing people to easily access tools that help us gain knowledge, computers can make us more advanced in many aspects of our lives. For example, by using the computer, scientists can develop new theories and uncover new things! Computers also have websites and programs that can help you stay in touch with family and friends! ""I have kept in touch with many of my friends from high school,"" @PERSON1 explains. ""The computer, through email and Facebook, is a great way to stay in touch with them!"" Computers have websites including Facebook and MySpace that can help people stay in touch and find family and friends. It has come to my realization that many people would feel lonely and isolated if they could not use the internet to connect with friends. But with the help of computers, people are lively and happy, especially when connecting with friends! Although computers are good for this, they @MONTH1 be addictive. I have known people that @MONTH1 have computer addiction. But on the other hand, people can make their own decisions about what is right. If people want to spend countless hours sitting in front of the glowing technology, then that's their choice. Not one person can force others to use or not use computers. It is simply unconstitutional. Most people understand that computers are a beneficial and fantastic source of technology. @NUM1 out of @NUM1,000 people in the world are addicted to computers. From this small number, we are able to conclude that computers are far from being overly addicting. In conclusion, Computers have a positive effect on people. They teach, help us stay in touch, and are not overly addicting. Therefore, they are very beneficial to the world, its people, and technology."
1185	1188	1	3	### Fifth Item If you ask me, computers are going to soon be a big problem in our lifestyles. Computers are just another material thing that everyone has and seems to be benefiting from, but they aren'@CAPS1 actually beneficial in all aspects. This technology is taking away people's freedom and will, and they don'@CAPS1 even notice it. It is pretty clear to me that things need to change. To begin, the computer is yet another distraction to our daily lives. I think that it is safe to admit that we don'@CAPS1 really need this kind of distraction. Distractions like these keep us from doing the things we need to do, such as exercise. Everyone wants to get their extra weight off, but they can'@CAPS1 because they want to check websites or talk to their friends. So it's pretty much a lazy distraction. Would you really want to give up your health because of something so materialistic? If we keep clicking away, more than @PERCENT1 of the population that are currently fit and healthy will become obese. I think we need to reform this problem soon. Like not promoting websites on so many @CAPS1.V networks, or having a computer shutdown week, anything that will get people to be outside enjoying life as they should. To continue, have you ever found yourself asking your kids on how to work the computer? Don't you see how sad that is? Our future leaders are already glued to the games, email, and instant messaging of the net. It's plain to see that they are already spending too much of their time online. This is a concerning fact because more and more kids each year turn in less and less schoolwork because they have better things to do such as chat with their friends or watch funny videos online. It's a scary thought because these children are our future leaders. This is a critical point in their lives. They need to learn about things now so their futures aren't hanging by a thread. Instead of making a habit of going online every day, why not make a habit like trying to get all your homework done each night? Things in children's lives need to change before they pay for it later in life. To sum it up, many things about our lifestyles need to change. Whether it be in schoolwork or losing weight. So I think it would be best if we took out, or lessened our computer usage to reduce the distraction and focus more on living life without revolving our world around a click. By making these changes, we can lead healthier, more productive lives and ensure a better future for ourselves and the next generation.
1186	1189	1	3	Proven by @PERSON2, it is evident that the best @CAPS1 major shows that over @PERCENT1 of children either have desktops, laptops, or some type of internet access. What do you think about this? Well, I believe the computers are taking up people's time, especially children's, and not letting them get their work done. Also, computers are not only allowing people to talk to their friends, but they are causing @CAPS5 bullying. Finally, @CAPS1 are also just making parents more stressed out because they have to pay another bill for internet. Children nowadays come home, change their clothes, and log right into the computer and start talking to friends and listening to music. All this sounds good until their report cards come back and they see they are failing half their classes. I remember when my friend @CAPS3 would go home, change, eat, and log right inside the computer. As days went by, at the end of the year, she noticed she had two problems. She was getting overweight and she was failing all her classes. She noticed that getting on the computer was not necessary, so for the next month and a half, she cut down on her time on the @CAPS1, did her homework, and this pushed me to believe that children have an issue with @CAPS1. Proven by @PERSON3, the cyberbully situation is such that over @PERCENT2 of children have been cyberbullied or @CAPS5 bullied someone. All this happens when children are not being watched or get bored and pick on someone. What should we do? People ask @PERSON1 and she says well, take away the @CAPS1. I remember when I read about the young girl on newchannels.com and it was about @CAPS5 bullied but never. This shows that children all over the world can be getting cyberbullied at any moment. We need to take action to protect our children from these negative impacts of @CAPS1.
1187	1190	1	3	Dear local newspaper, Computers are truly a waste of time! People who say they are helpful are just using that as an excuse. Some people claim they are good for research and talking to people. However, both of these things can be done without a computer. Computers are just a money - wasting thing that gets in the way of your life. People spend hours on computers talking to people. You don't need to do that. You can use a phone instead and call them. After a detailed study, they proved that talking on a phone is cheaper than using the computer. In this tough economy, why wouldn't you want to save money while getting the same result? Also, on a computer, you don't really talk to the person; you are really just typing words to them. This can be very dangerous. Who knows if the person talking to you is really the person you think. Why take the risk when you can just use a phone! Using the computer is like smoking. It is very addicting! People stay on computers for hours every day and don't get exercise. If you just sit there moving your hand, you are not really burning calories. This is a huge problem! Obesity is already rising with the number of fast - food places, and computers are making it worse. And the worst part is parents don't care. Some children go on the computer for @NUM1 hours a day, and their parents don't encourage them to go outside. Children need encouragement to get moving, or they will never start, and they will get bigger. We need to form a group to help stop this, or before you know it, @PERCENT1 of the @LOCATION1 will be obese. Another excuse that computer lovers make is they say they are doing research on a country. Even though this might be true, there are other ways you can do this. Why not ride your bike to the library and get a book on the country. By doing this, you will burn calories and get to learn the same stuff you would have on the computer. Also, not everything on the internet is true, so you might have false information. By getting a book, you know it's true. People that love computers will never get away from them overnight; it might take a month or two, but if we act now, we can make a change and put a stop to it. Computers are a waste of money. You can live without them very easily, and without them, the world would be a better place. People are being lazy and use excuses on why they need a computer. If you are stuck on a computer for @NUM1 hours a day, you will never have any family memories. All you will remember is when you were on the computer, and who wants that? We should all strive to reduce our computer usage for a healthier and more fulfilling life.
1188	1191	1	3	"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1 @CAPS2, do you think that children spend too much time on the computer? The issue that is going around is whether @CAPS2 computers have good effects on people or bad ones. I strongly believe that they have bad effects on people. I believe this because people spend more time on the computer than they do exercising. Another reason is that people argue it teaches hand - eye coordination, well, so does sports and just playing. My last reason is that people argue that it is something that helps you learn about people and far - away places, but books can do the same thing. I know a lot of people feel that computers have good effects, but the truth is they have bad ones. First, people spend more time on the computer than they do exercising. People rather stay inside and play games on the internet than go outside and play tag or any sport. On a talk show, it was said that, ""In @LOCATION1, people are a lot overweight"", and it was also said that the number of overweight people in the world was similar to that of @LOCATION2. So I believe that people should get off the computer and exercise. Secondly, people think that it teaches hand - eye coordination, but so do sports. Instead of being on the computer learning hand - eye coordination, you could be outside learning it. Again, instead of just sitting at the computer, you're outside running around having fun while you learn hand - eye coordination. My last reason is that people argue that people use it to learn about far - away places and people, but they have books for that too. People rather look stuff up on the computer, but as soon as they're finished, they start playing games on the computer. Also, some of the information might not even be true. Because people hack sites all the time and change things, but you can't hack a book. The only thing you can do to change it is to rip out pages, and that only wastes your money to buy a new book. So I believe that books are more reliable. Now is the time to make your decision. Do @CAPS2 computers have good or bad effects? I believe that computers have a bad effect on people. Other things could teach you remarkable hand - eye coordination, and there are other great sources to learn about other places than the computer. Most importantly, people should spend more time exercising than they do on the computer. Now it's time for you to go ahead and put this on the front page of your newspaper and let the whole world know. By raising awareness, we can hopefully help people make better choices regarding computer usage."
1189	1192	1	3	"Dear @LOCATION1, I'm writing this letter to you to tell you my opinion on the effects computers have on people. My opinion is that computers have a positive effect on people. The first reason is they give the ability to learn about people and places in the world. Another reason is that computers bring unity to the nation and even the world. The last reason is it can help you be organized and get a job. Now I will move on to give more details on my first reason. When I have a school project on a famous person or somewhere in the world, I know that the computer will give me more comprehensive information than a book. If I am doing the project on a place and I want to know how far it is from where I live to there or what's the weather of that place, all I have to do is type it down in a search engine, and the computer will give me a bunch of reliable websites that will answer my question. Now, if you can't draw a picture for your biography project, go on a search engine and type down the name of the person you're doing and don't forget to type down ""pictures"" or ""photos"", and you will see a large number of pictures of that person. Now I will move on to my second reason. Computers bring unity in the nation and the world. For example, think about these social networks like @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and @CAPS3. These networks have millions of people on them that you can talk to. And what about the @ORGANIZATION1 webcam, where you can talk to the person face to face. Just recently, there have been earthquakes in @LOCATION2 and @LOCATION3. You can spread the news to family members or friends to tell them to support and help those in need. Now I will move on to my last reason. Computers are everywhere. There's never a job that does not have a computer involved. That means that you need to know how to work with computers to get a job, which can be a significant advantage in today's competitive job market. In conclusion, computers offer numerous benefits in learning, social connection, and career development, and their positive impacts far outweigh any potential drawbacks."
1190	1193	1	3	Dear @LOCATION1 @CAPS1, Computers lately have been considered a distraction and an unnecessary device. I personally think that they have many things to offer everyone. Each aspect helps us understand things and subjects we couldn't understand before. Also, computers are now said to make people lazy or physically unfit, but that depends on the person. They could easily go out to play and talk with family and friends if they wanted to. Computers are also becoming an important tool for learning, making information easier to access than before. The most popular and common use of a computer now is communication. Many websites are invented based on the main idea of communicating. Computers are an important part of the future life that isn't harmful or unnecessary. Recently, we have been able to use computers in so many helpful ways. We can learn and study new and important things. We can research and collect data to cure a disease or work on a machine. They are now an important and useful part of the jobs people have. Almost anything published or shown to the public went through a computer. So people do their jobs on computers, working and learning. Like a job where you print out a paper every week or even every day. You use computers to edit and put together your paper before printing. So basic computer skills are important for people to have for new jobs and common ones you see every day. Computers are rumored also to be too time - consuming and unhealthy for a person. However, computers are an optional thing for people to use in their own required time. The person could go out and see friends and family. They could go to the gym or go on a vacation without a computer. Yes, they are fun to use and have a lot of things to do, but it isn't needed like air or water. You can live without using a computer for a week. You can take a walk, read a book, go hang out with your family and won't be pressured for computer time at all. If you're worried about it, take a break from it for a while. You can do things without a computer. Learning with computers is a common thing lately. In @CAPS2, they're going in the computer lab to learn to read on certain programs or do other tasks. Studying or writing essays in my grade is mostly done with the help of computers. Researching for a class and making a project also rely on computers. Computers are useful in school. You can also read about new subjects and learn new things on computers, possibly helping you in your classes. The biggest use of computers now is communication through many websites like youtube, facebook, myspace and many others. They allow people to communicate their ideas and opinions. You can talk to far - away friends and family without a high phone bill. You can see politics and daily news to the weather. Almost all means of communication can be done with a computer. So now you see computers are a vital and useful part of the daily technology we have at our reach. It is not unhealthy or time - consuming unless you are allowing your computer usage to be that. We should embrace the positive aspects of computers while also being mindful of our usage.
1191	1194	1	3	"Letter to the @CAPS1. I firmly disagree with the so - called ""experts"" who claim that computers could have negative effects on people. The idea that you socialize less with family and friends is a truly pathetic argument. Social networking sites like @CAPS2 or @CAPS3 allow seamless interaction with all your friends. Online games like @CAPS4 help you meet new people who could be hundreds of miles away from you! Twitter is great when you just want to say something quick like ""@CAPS5 to @LOCATION1"". @CAPS18 allows you to talk to friends, comment on their interesting videos, and subscribe to them, plus it provides hours of free entertainment. Computers also offer a plethora of fun games to entertain users. There are many free games, like @PERSON1, that have endless gameplay possibilities. @PERSON1 (made by @CAPS6) claims to be the most popular @CAPS7 (@CAPS8 @CAPS9 Online @CAPS10 - playing @CAPS11) on the web. You can level up various combat skills: attack, defence, strength, ranged, and magic. Or you can focus on non - combat skills like wood cutting, prayer, farming, fishing, mining, and cooking. @PERSON1, like most @CAPS4, has quests of varying difficulties. For example, for one quest you have to bravely kill a demon, but for another, you just need to find a missing cat. There are over @NUM1 quests, and there are never fewer than @NUM2 people playing at a time. Some other notable @CAPS13 games are @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS14: @CAPS15, @CAPS16 of @CAPS17, @ORGANIZATION2, @LOCATION2, and @ORGANIZATION1. As you can see, the computer has an impressive list of entertaining @CAPS11 for all ages, not to mention sites like @CAPS18 or addicting games. Computers don't really affect exercising. That's a personal choice, so you have to choose between spending time on @CAPS2 or going to the basketball court. It's like saying that before we had computers or video @CAPS11 consoles, a @CAPS20 board stopped kids from exercising. The computer doesn't actually stop us from exercising. It's our minds and our judgment. If you have bad judgment, you'd stay inside all day tweeting and @CAPS21. With a good strong mind and willpower, you can overcome a bad decision and play sports or go to the gym. All it takes is good judgment. Just to recap what I've said, there is plenty of social interaction on computers and there are many choices on how to do it. Many sites amuse us, and we should make good use of that. Not to mention you can buy great games like @CAPS16 of @CAPS17 or @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS14: @CAPS15 for your @CAPS13! Computers don't actually hinder exercising; all it takes is good judgment to get off that chair and exercise."
1192	1195	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, imagine having everything known to man right at your fingertips. Picture having an endless source of information readily available in your own home. Wouldn't you want all of this all the time? The question then is, do computers have positive effects on people? I strongly believe computers do benefit society. Firstly, computers teach you excellent hand - eye coordination. The main way is through typing. When you start typing, you initially look at the keys, but gradually you memorize all the locations of the keys. Also, exciting computer games teach hand - eye coordination. If you weren't looking at the screen intently, would it be possible to win the game? When computers teach you hand - eye coordination, you can apply it to other things too. For example, you definitely need it in sports, specifically baseball. If you didn't have good hand - eye coordination, you wouldn't be able to catch the fast - moving ball or be able to hit the ball accurately when you swing. Hand - eye coordination is very important. Secondly, computers give people the ability to learn about places and people. When people are deciding when to go on vacation, they turn to the internet. They can find out what there is to do. Why would you travel to a place if you know nothing about it? Many use the internet to research other countries. When the eighth - grade students did reports, they sourced a large portion of their information from the internet. Eighty - seven percent of them used the internet. Finally, some people say computers take away from interaction with family and friends, but computers actually allow you to communicate with other family and friends around the world. Wouldn't it be wonderful to talk with your loved ones in a different state or country? The main ways of online communication are @CAPS5 - mail or @CAPS6 @CAPS7. These allow you to send someone a message quickly and easily. It is much easier to remember someone's @CAPS5 - mail address than it is a phone number. Why settle for just talking when you can actually see the person? It would be like them being in the room with you. Computers are a great way to talk to someone. Why wait any longer? Computers are a great way to refine your hand - eye coordination skills. You can research faraway people and places to see what life is like around the globe. Most importantly, you can communicate with family and friends online through @CAPS8, @CAPS5 - mail, or @CAPS10. Definitely, computers benefit society. So go and share this information with other people to convince them that computers are positive.
1193	1196	1	3	Computers do not have a negative effect on people. They keep you well - connected with family, help you complete work for school, and also allow you to play engaging video games and look up a wide variety of music. Computers can keep you in touch with family and friends. You can find out the locations where they live. You can learn how they are doing and what they have been up to. It allows you to easily e - mail them and lets you see friends who have moved far away. Computers also assist you in schoolwork. They help you find accurate answers to questions a teacher could ask. They help you write well - structured reports for any subject. Also, there are many useful sites that you can visit to get help with a book. These sites could also direct you to your school's website. That way, if you forgot what your homework was, you have a reliable place to check. Even if you were absent, most papers and questions are available on the internet so you can complete the homework. Another common thing computers are used for is watching movies. Whether it's an old classic movie or a new release, you can find it. Computers also serve the same purpose for music. Anything from @CAPS1 to @CAPS2 to country and back can be found. New @CAPS3 shows and music can all be discovered. Video games are also very popular. Many people play these because they can connect with friends. They can talk to friends that they haven't seen in a long time and avoid getting bored. If it's raining out and there's nothing else to do, there are always games to play. And if you want to talk, there's always someone there to listen to you and maybe become your new friend. So computers are not a waste. They can keep you in touch, help you make new friends, get rid of boredom, and find everything in @CAPS4 shows, music, and movies.
1194	1197	1	3	Dear, Local Newspaper. I think that it would be far better if people got outside to get some exercise and enjoy the beauty of nature while interacting with their family and friends. If you go out with your family and friends, maybe more teens and adults would be in better physical shape and be more healthy. Imagine we jump out of bed, have some delicious breakfast, and head to the park to get some exercise with our family and friends. A lot of family and friends, I think, spend way too much time on the computers or their laptops. Because if they are on the computer for too long, then they will not want to go outside and exercise with their friends. More and more people are using the computer. But not everybody agrees on this statement. What I believe is that it would be better to solve the problem and have everybody get outside and breathe some fresh air with family and friends. But some people don't think that is the right thing to do. People who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people. Well, I don't think that is the way to go because you need to get outside to get some fresh air with people. But if you want to go on the computer, you can, but I think it should be only for a short while. Some people have a business that they have to work on when they are at work. Sometimes people have to work on their computer every day, so if that is the case, I think they should be allowed to use the laptop or computer. But if you are a teen, you should only go on if you really need to, like when you need the internet for research or for writing a paper. But if you are going on just to talk to friends, then that is a waste of time in someone's life, at least in my life it is. I think as a teen, you should be focused on studying and doing your homework instead of being on the computer because I think it would be better to make sure your grades are good and you aren't failing in your school career. So that is why it is best to make sure you aren't on the computer all the time talking to your friends. Jump outside and enjoy the outside weather with friends and family members. I hope teens and adults get outside from now on because it would be better for all of us and everybody would be healthy. If they try this program, it will really work. I promise it will work and you will be healthy and not feel bad about yourself.
1195	1198	1	3	Dear to whom this @MONTH1 concerns, I know those who don't use computers wonder why people are so affected by them. Well, I think a computer is better than a newspaper. On newspapers, you can find the news, of course, but also weather forecasts, houses for sale, TV listings, job openings, and other things, just the same as on @CAPS1, but it's like a virtual version. It benefits society for certain reasons, but it depends. Sometimes computers can have negative effects on people, but they also teach people how to read, write, type, learn, and do other useful things. We can talk to others, see pictures of people we know, and google information about things we need to know. It helps when we need to find our way around using mapquest. A negative issue with having computers with internet access is that there are certain websites that are not age - appropriate. Kids might be on websites their parents don't know about, looking up information or interacting with boys they meet over the @CAPS1. There have been cases where people make plans with someone online and the next day the person is gone missing. I think if experts take away computers, most kids will be mad and upset, and there will be nothing more to do but play video games and go outside. In conclusion, while computers have their drawbacks, especially in terms of online safety, they also offer a wealth of educational and social opportunities. We should find a balance in using them rather than completely eliminating them.
1196	1199	1	3	Computers are incredibly helpful in everyone's daily life. Through them, we can learn a wide variety of new things. They offer a convenient way to contact others across distances. Moreover, they make the writing process a lot easier. Overall, they have a highly positive effect on the world. Technology enables everyone to explore new and interesting topics. If something is typed into @ORGANIZATION1, relevant results will quickly pop up within seconds. By simply clicking on these results, the information that is needed is clearly displayed. The computer is also extremely useful for writing research papers. The internet allows for a more detailed and elaborate final draft. The knowledge gained through learning on the computer can significantly benefit one's grades in school or performance at work. It is always great to be able to contact anyone we want. With the computer, people are able to @CAPS1, have in - depth conversations on @CAPS2, or even have a face - to - face talk with a loved one on a webcam. On @CAPS2, pictures can be added so that anyone who wasn't able to attend an event can now vividly see what it was like. Webcams hooked up to the computer let people communicate face to face with someone else they might not have seen in months. These are all excellent examples of why computers have a positive impact on the human race. Writing out papers by hand can be a difficult and tedious task. On the computer, it is possible to type out words without having to reach for an eraser for any spelling mistakes. These mistakes are promptly picked up by spell check. This way, no points are deducted for wrong spellings. Sometimes people @MONTH1 have rather sloppy handwriting. These difficulties can all be effectively solved by a typing program on the computer. Therefore, computers must have a positive effect on people. They teach new things, allow people to contact others who are far away, and can also make the grading of a paper an easier task. This clearly concludes that computers greatly benefit the society we live in today.
1197	1200	1	3	Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 it has recently been brought to my attention that on a beautiful sunny day like this, it's puzzling why somebody would want to stay inside. The sad reality is that too many people are squandering their time inside on their computers, instead of enjoying the wonderful day outside. Computers are negatively affecting the @LOCATION1 @LOCATION1 population. We are reaching a point where our whole world might become absolutely chaotic if nothing is done about this situation. For one thing, the @LOCATION1 has the highest number of obese children in the world. Generally, children should be actively running around to burn off their calories; even some people in their teen years should do so. Instead, kids are sitting in front of computer screens, engrossed in virtual games, checking emails, and such. Even doing simple chores around the house could bring down the obesity rate a lot more than sitting idle, staring at a screen all day. The whole screen - related issue brings me to my next point. Staring at those bright and flashy lights for too long is not good for your brain. In fact, computers cause @NUM1 out of @NUM2 child seizures a year. The radioactivity in a computer could also severely harm you by giving you cancer. With no cure for any cancer yet, you have to realize that every time you are on that computer for too long, you are putting your life at risk. The longer you're on, the more and more radiation is going to reach your brain. Do you really want to cut your life short knowing that you are the one responsible for it? It could almost be called a form of self - harm because if you're reading this, then you've been warned. So, we've basically covered the effects that computers have on your body physically. The computer can also affect you mentally and socially. When @DATE1 arrives, you will have plenty of time to be on the computer, but did you know that over vacation, you lose @PERCENT1 of everything you learned in school? It's been scientifically proven that computers cause memory loss. So, what if you get back to school and you can't keep up with what's going on? It's really frustrating, isn't it? If you would've just read a book during the time you were on the computer, maybe you could've gained valuable knowledge rather than losing it. Computers can affect you socially because not everybody wants to sit inside on the computer. So, while people are out having a great time, you will be all alone, by yourself with nobody to talk to but a computer. Would you like a computer to be your only friend? The debate about this topic could go on and on for days and still have no clear winner, but in all honesty, when you go to turn on that computer, think to yourself, is it really worth it? Think of everything you would lose, everything you could never get back, or would you rather do something that you would gain from in the future. It's your choice, but be responsible enough to make the one that would benefit you.
1198	1201	1	3	Dear editor, Computers are becoming increasingly prevalent in the @LOCATION1. People are spending an excessive amount of time on computers instead of engaging in other activities, and this effect is not beneficial to society. Because of computers, people have been lacking in exercise, missing out on enjoying nature and other parts of the world, and forgetting about interacting with family and friends. Computers should be used in moderation and not in place of other important events in our lives. First of all, computer users receive significantly less exercise than those who do not use computers frequently. According to a comprehensive survey done by the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, only @PERCENT1 of computer users reported that they exercised at least once every week. In contrast, @PERCENT2 of non - computer users (non - frequent computer users) reported that they exercised at least once every week. Can one even imagine what it would be like if everyone was a dedicated computer user? Nearly everybody would be overweight, lethargic from lack of sleep due to long hours on the computer, and out of touch with the real world. Getting exercise is an essential part of everyone's life, and lacking it could be extremely harmful to one's health. Stepping away from the computer and instead getting some exercise would make for a healthier and more fit country. Not only do computers deprive people of getting exercise, but they also prevent people from fully enjoying nature and other parts of the world. By traveling to @CAPS1 and other unfamiliar places in the world, one is able to experience and learn about different cultures in a profound way. Going on the internet @MONTH1 can be a decent way to learn about other places, but actually feeling the unique ambiance and environment of a foreign place allows for a much more in - depth understanding. For example, when I went to @LOCATION2 for a vacation, I learned about the stark differences in traditions and culture. I saw the clear separation between the poor and the rich when I looked from the humble shacks along the river to the magnificent, elegant edifices scraping the sky. It was an experience I could never encounter on a computer. People should be able to enjoy the wonders and differences of the world not on a small screen of a computer, but through the real - life view of their own eyes. Lastly, computers inhibit people from interacting with family and friends. From my personal experiences, I tend to unconsciously ignore friends and family when I'm on the computer. Speaking, playing, and generally socializing with others is a critical part of everyone's life. Without this basic necessity, people cannot be truly happy. In summary, computers should not be used in excess. This kind of excessive use could lead to people getting less exercise, not fully experiencing the world, and a loss of interaction with friends and family. To make a better country and nation, the people of the @LOCATION1 @LOCATION1 should make a conscious effort to reduce computer use.
1199	1202	1	3	Dear Newspaper, I firmly think that computers have a positive effect on people, and here are my well - thought - out reasons. You can easily get in contact with people, if you have a question you can quickly look it up, and you can efficiently do your job on a computer. I believe that these reasons will also make you view computers positively. Many people like computers and own one. My first reason is that you can get in touch with friends and family. I think this is a great reason because if your grandmother lives in @LOCATION2, you don't want to drive there every single time you want to see her when you live in @LOCATION1. You can use the computer to have a live chat with her, so you wouldn't have to make that long drive all the way there. If you wanted to, you could also use the computer to plan a specific day to go and visit her. You would also use a computer to get in touch with friends. If you needed to ask them a question about the homework, they could quickly answer it. That is my first reason why computers have a positive impact on people. My second reason is that if you have a computer, you can look up questions that you might have. If you needed to know something for a big report and none of your friends are available or awake, you can turn to your computer. Computers can be extremely helpful when you need an answer. If you didn't have a computer, it would be so difficult to get the information you need. That is why I think that computers can effectively answer your questions. My third reason is that you can work on the computer. If you're a stay - at - home mom, you can use the computer to handle finances in an organized way. A lot of people work on the computer to contribute to saving the environment by reducing paper usage. When I grow up, I'll probably work on the computer because it is much easier and more efficient. That is why I think that you can work on the computer. The reasons I've chosen are that you can get in touch with family and friends, you can look up a question that you might have, and you can work on a computer. I hope you will have a positive view of computers as they are really helpful. Some people might think that computers don't help develop your brain or increase your knowledge, but many people like and own one. I think that you should also have a positive view of computers.
1200	1203	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, A large number of @CAPS2 people at my school sit on their computers after school. They don't go outside to enjoy the beauty of nature, visit with family and friends, or even engage in some exercise. A significant number of @CAPS2 people are affected by this behavior. Going outside can greatly enhance your knowledge. You can go on a peaceful walk in the woods. When you are on your walk, you @CAPS2 might find some interesting new species of plants or animals. Also, when you are outside, you can play with your friends or siblings. In @CAPS2 times, in many neighborhoods, there are a lot of kids around. You can start a spontaneous pick - up game of baseball. You can also build new and exciting things. You could find a big and sturdy tree and build a cozy treehouse or a fun tire - swing with your family. Going outside leaves you with a plethora of fun activities. When kids sit on the computer, they don't interact with their family or friends. During the @DATE1, you can go to the beach with your friends. It will cool you down without having to pay money for an air conditioner. You @MONTH1 also might find the opportunity to go to a different state for the day. Or you could go across the country to see your sick grandma or your newly - named cousin. Going on a picnic will give you quality time to get to know new people. You could invite your friends and have them bring a new friend for the whole group to meet. You will also get to enjoy a lot of tasty food, and who wouldn't want that? Going places with your family and friends can lead to a worthwhile and memorable experience. @PERCENT1 of kids choose to go on the computer rather than exercise. As a result, kids will become overweight. When on the computer, @CAPS2 kids will often eat mindlessly. Eating for hours each day is not a good idea. You can go out for your school's basketball team or run distances in cross - country. Once you are on the team, you will make new friends and get your daily exercise. When you are on a team and exercising, you will learn @CAPS2 important life skills. You will learn the benefits of working as a team and by yourself. So, getting your exercise is a very important part of your life. Why would you choose the computer? You wouldn't be able to enjoy the outdoors or spend time with family and friends. You would become overweight and unhappy. So, don't choose the computer; choose another activity!
1201	1204	1	3	"To @CAPS1 @CAPS6 @MONTH1 concern: @CAPS2 I have been informed that you had the idea that more and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits the society. I strongly disagree. I firmly believe that computers have a significantly positive effect on people. Having computers can effectively teach hand - eye coordination, endow people with the ability to learn about @CAPS3 and faraway places, and even enable people to talk online with friends or family conveniently. Don't you want your children to grow up with great hand - eye coordination? More than @PERCENT1 parents voted yes. As shown in many reliable statistics, adults and children that use the computer for an hour or more a day have better hand - eye coordination than a normal adult or child that only uses @CAPS6 once a week. By using the computer for more than one hour a day, your typing becomes quicker and your reactions increase notably. Not only does typing quicker affect your computer techniques but @CAPS6 also helps you outside of your home, like in sports. For example, if you play the sport baseball, the speed of your pitch will increase over @PERCENT2 if you use the computer for over an hour a day! If you're a batter, your reaction to the pitch will also increase by over @PERCENT2! Just by using the computer. Is time running out for your @CAPS3 project to be done? Without computers, you wouldn't get the information you need quick enough. Dr. @DR1 from @ORGANIZATION1 states, ""You can get the same information on people, other countries, and @CAPS3 from the computer as you can from a book, and it's easy. In addition, you have to buy books to get their information, unlike computers which are inexpensive and allow you to look up what you need. Don't settle for less, get the best! Over @PERCENT3 of @CAPS4 have old friends or family out of the state that they would still like to keep in touch with. By having a computer, you can chat with them through your webcam! Instead of calling them up or sending them an email, you could chat with them and still see them in the flesh! Several computer owners say, ""@CAPS5 like you're actually hanging out with them!"" @CAPS6 takes over @NUM1 days at least to receive a letter back or an email from them if they live far away, but with computers, @CAPS5 is instant! Wouldn't you like to talk to friends and family every day instead of waiting around for a call, email, or letter? I think yes. All in all, having computers is a great investment. I would also like to point out that without computers, you wouldn't be able to talk with friends/family online, get better hand - eye coordination, or even have the ability to learn about @CAPS3 in just a click of a button! Isn't this what you want? It's clear that computers bring numerous benefits to our lives."
1202	1205	1	3	"Dear Newspaper editor, Have you ever been working on a paper, or reading something and there's that word you've never heard before? And you just can't figure it out? That's where a computer can help you. Yes, some people do waste all their time online, but they have personal issues. Computers are extremely useful as they help us with all of our school projects and enable us to conduct research efficiently. You can @CAPS3 reconnect with old friends that you haven't seen in years, and learn many good things through the internet and computers. First off, we would not be able to do some of the things we do without computers. For school projects, I use @ORGANIZATION1 word and powerpoint all the time. Our teachers prefer us to do that instead of handwriting everything. Getting information on the computer is so much faster and easier. I mean, the time it would take you to look up the word ""elephants"" in the encyclopedia is probably @NUM1 times more than it takes to look it up in Google. Plus, in about @NUM2 1/@NUM2 seconds, Google can call up millions of websites just about ""elephants"". Another reason why computers are very beneficial is that you can reconnect with old friends you haven't seen or talked to for years. You can @CAPS3 meet new @CAPS1 through dating and Facebook. Especially, there are three main things, and there are websites like Twitter where you can follow celebrities and @CAPS2. The internet provided by computers gives great information to people. Some kids take online @CAPS3 @CAPS4, and they really have no other choice but to rely on computers. So in conclusion, computers can be very beneficial to lots of people. I know it's not a good thing to sit there all day and play computer games, but we can get lots of things accomplished, like school projects, or any project really. It's @CAPS3 nice to meet up with someone you haven't talked to in a while sometimes. We have learned many great things from the internet. I hope you consider my opinion and recognize the value of computers in our daily lives."
1203	1206	1	3	"Dear editor @ORGANIZATION2 the source, @CAPS1, I have noticed that many people have been spending too much time using their computers. This is something that needs to stop because it impacts people's health, safety, and education. To open my statements, overuse @ORGANIZATION2 the computer can lead to poor health. Take my friend @PERSON1 for example. He sits at home on his computer all @DATE1, engrossed in playing games, going on @CAPS2 and @CAPS3. He rarely gets any exercise and he almost never sees daylight. As a result, @PERSON1 @LOCATION1 has gained @NUM1 pounds, which has led to obesity and heart problems. He even wears wooden teeth because his general hygiene has declined as well. Another common health problem that develops from excessive use @ORGANIZATION2 the computer is arthritis. Dr. @PERSON3 @ORGANIZATION2 the @ORGANIZATION1 told @ORGANIZATION3, ""The massive amounts @ORGANIZATION2 typing on the keyboard can lead to joint problems, arthritis, and other joint - related problems."" In fact, a study that took place from @DATE2 to @DATE3 to see the long - lasting effects @ORGANIZATION2 computer overuse had some shocking results. @PERCENT1 @ORGANIZATION2 the test subjects saw doctors for problems with joint pain. These health risks are a concern, but people's safety is an even bigger issue. When people excessively use the computer, they put their safety and well - being at risk. People have had serious injuries and scams placed on them because @ORGANIZATION2 the internet. In @DATE4, a girl named @PERSON5 was kidnapped and taken to @LOCATION2. She met a man on @CAPS4.com named @PERSON6, who cunningly persuaded her into meeting him at an airport. From there, she was taken to @CAPS5 and held for ransom. Every time people use their computer, they put themselves at risk. Dr. @PERSON4 @ORGANIZATION2 the @ORGANIZATION2 claims, ""I've seen @NUM2 @ORGANIZATION2 internet - related kidnappings & other crimes. The victim was a person who overused the computer and frequented the internet."" Safety is one @ORGANIZATION2 the most important things in life. But people's education is also affected. When people overuse the computer, they can impact their education. The internet holds false information and can be a waste @ORGANIZATION2 people's time. When students are working on a report, they very often use the internet to get information. Websites like @CAPS6 and @ORGANIZATION4 are most commonly used. This can be a big problem. Did you know that @PERCENT2 @ORGANIZATION2 information on the internet is wrong? That's more than half @ORGANIZATION2 it! The internet can also be a time - waster. My bro, @PERSON2, had an assignment to do @DATE1. He spent @NUM3 hours using @CAPS2 and didn't even write his essay. He received a zero on that grade. In closing, overusing your computer can cause health problems, put your safety at risk, and hurt your education. It's crucial that people limit their computer usage to avoid these negative consequences."
1204	1207	1	3	Dear editor, Have you ever used a computer? Odds are you have, which means you know how convenient and positive computers are. Did you know @PERCENT1 of all @CAPS1 use computers regularly? These technological marvels provide many ways to communicate and learn, clearly showing that computers have an extremely positive effect on people. Who hasn't ever played a game on a computer? Computers provide many forms of entertainment, such as games, music, and videos. I once had to drive @NUM1 hours to see my grandma in @LOCATION1. The only thing that kept me away from the grasp of boredom during the long trip was my portable computer, on which I played games and watched movies. Critics of computers argue that people who use computers do not ever participate in physical activities. Of course, try exercising when you are crammed in a car traveling @NUM2 @CAPS2. This is a clear example of how computers positively affect me. It was @NUM3 on a @DATE1 @TIME1, and my mother was just about to have a baby. Unfortunately, none of my relatives were there to witness this baby coming into the world because they all live on the other side of the @LOCATION2 @CAPS3. However, this minor set - back did not prevent them from seeing the @LOCATION1 baby. Thanks to computers, they didn't even have to leave their homes. This is because computers offer many ways to be social, such as social networking sites. Within @NUM4 hours after the baby was born, there were many pictures and videos up on these social networking sites that let everyone enjoy my @LOCATION1 baby sister. Computers make life convenient for all. Last but not least, computers are not only a fine tool for school, but are necessary to succeed with your education. One snow day in @DATE2, I was assigned a research paper on @PERSON1. Too bad I didn't know one thing about @PERSON1, so I asked my mom to drive me to the library to take out some books for my report. But due to the snow, the library's power went out and therefore they were closed. This was not an issue, though, because I only had to spend @NUM5 minutes on a computer searching for information, instead of spending hours browsing through countless pages in a book. Thanks to computers, I received an A on my report. Overall, computers serve many helpful purposes for people. These marvelous machines can provide entertainment, socialize with people around the world, and even provide information on any topic you would like. @ORGANIZATION1 readers, now you understand why computers are positive for your lives and everyone else's. I encourage all of you to spread this message to everyone, so they know all the benefits of using computers and can make the most of this amazing technology.
1205	1208	1	3	I disagree with the idea that computers are good for you because, first, if you spend too much time on them, you do nothing productive. This can lead to a very unhealthy lifestyle. Second, you can meet bad people on the computer. Third, you can get into something bad. So if you want to know what happens next, you will have to keep reading on. The reason you do nothing is that people need to be active and because everyone has to lose or gain something sometimes. But if you keep doing nothing every day, your body will get used to inactivity, and you won't be able to move or walk properly. The second reason is that you can meet bad people on the computer because people can't tell you all the things you want to know, and they might be doing things that are not okay. They could even be criminals or have bad intentions. The third reason is that you can get into something bad because you might be talking to someone and say something about yourself, and they could use that information against you. You don't even know what they'll do with it. Now, someone might come to you and ask why you're in trouble, but they won't tell you the real reason. Being on the computer for a long time can get you into a big mess. You don't do anything productive, you might meet really bad people, and you can get into something bad. Now you know why being on the computer for a long time can be bad. So, now you have to decide which side you're on. P.S. Thank you for taking the time to read this and consider the negative impacts of excessive computer use.
1206	1209	1	3	Computers have numerous effects on people these days. Most of these effects are highly beneficial and can lead individuals to become more self - confident. Computers serve as powerful educational tools, enabling people to learn about ancient figures, from philosophers like Socrates to warriors like Alexander the Great, and to complete various school projects, such as history presentations or science experiments write - ups. Moreover, computers are excellent sources of entertainment. People can play a wide range of games, including classic arcade games like Pac - Man and modern racing games with high - definition graphics. They can also interact with friends on social media platforms and watch a plethora of videos, from hilarious comedy skits to emotional music videos. Additionally, computers can increase one's chances of finding a job or enhance job performance. For instance, they can teach job - specific skills and allow job - seekers to search for suitable positions online. For most people, education is crucial. Since kids may not spend enough time in traditional school settings, computers offer an alternative way to learn. Kids can explore different places around the world, learning about their cultures and geographies. They can also complete their projects, like writing a well - structured essay or preparing a science fair project. Moreover, they can learn about famous personalities from different eras, such as Mozart in the music world or Marilyn Monroe in the entertainment industry. In conclusion, computers have a profound positive impact on people, enhancing education, providing entertainment, and facilitating job - related activities.
1207	1210	1	3	There have been many advancements in computer technology, and there are people who support it and those who oppose it. I am against excessive computer use and will explain why. Firstly, when you spend a lot of time on the computer, you spend less time exercising. If you don't exercise regularly, you are likely to gain weight. This weight gain can lead to a loss of physical fitness, and you may not be able to perform activities you could previously do. In severe cases, it can even limit your mobility. To avoid this, it's important to plan your computer time. Instead of wasting time on unimportant computer tasks, you could go for a jog outside, as time is precious and should not be squandered. Secondly, you spend less time enjoying nature. Nature is incredibly beautiful, but it is being destroyed, and most of us do little to help. Out of the billions of people on Earth, only a few hundred thousand are actively involved in environmental protection. It's a great shame to watch nature decline while we remain idle. Finally, you spend less time with friends and family. This is the most significant reason. Your family is your closest support system, and your friends are equally important. They bring joy, laughter, and support into your life. If you immerse yourself too deeply in the computer world, your family may feel neglected and could distance themselves from you. Your friends are also vital as they share good times with you and lift your spirits when you're down. Remember, they may not always be around. In conclusion, these are my three reasons for being against excessive computer use. Spending less time exercising, enjoying nature, and with loved ones are all serious concerns, so we should use computers more moderately.
1208	1211	1	3	Dear editor: Did you know that a significant percentage (let's say @PERCENT1) of people in the @LOCATION2 have computers? These computers are undoubtedly benefiting society. People rely on computers to stay updated on important issues, communicate with others, and acquire new information. Computers have become essential for daily life. It's crucial for news to spread quickly, and computers are an effective means to achieve this. Ordinary people like you and me need to be informed about the weather, global events, and other significant topics. By using a computer, you can access this information immediately. For example, instead of waiting for the weather report on TV, you can find out the local weather within seconds. Recently, there was a devastating earthquake in @LOCATION1, where millions of civilians lost their lives. In case of a natural disaster in @CAPS2, computers can ensure that everyone is promptly informed. Not only do computers help with important updates, but they are also an excellent way to connect with people. My relatives live far away, and due to the high cost of long - distance phone calls, we communicate with them via email. A large proportion (@NUM1 out of @NUM2) of people use email to contact distant friends and family. Friends can also interact through popular social networking sites like @CAPS3, @CAPS4, and @CAPS5. Social interaction is a basic human need, and the internet provides a great platform for it. Finally, computers are valuable for learning new information. If children need to gather information for a school project or essay, they can easily search the internet and find answers. Adults can also benefit from computers. For instance, most adults use an online dictionary to look up word definitions. Instead of going to the library and searching through books, they can find answers to their questions with just a few clicks. In conclusion, computers are truly beneficial to society. They keep us informed, help us connect with others, and enable us to learn new things, and these technological advancements are positive for human society.
1209	1212	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, Having home computers is a good thing for many reasons. One reason is that people can use computers to learn about other countries and cultures. For example, they can explore the unique traditions of Japan, such as the tea ceremony, or the rich history of Egypt. People can also use computers to type documents, which is much more efficient than writing by hand. When typing on a computer, you don't have to worry about messy handwriting or broken pencils. Moreover, computers can check your spelling and grammar, ensuring that your work is error - free. This saves both time and money, as you don't need to buy writing supplies like pencils and erasers. Additionally, computers can save paper. Instead of printing large textbooks, people can access digital versions on their computers. Another advantage is that computers have revolutionized communication. Before computers, communicating with people in other countries was expensive and time - consuming. Now, you can send instant emails to friends and family around the world, saving days of waiting for letters. You can also use webcams to have face - to - face conversations, which is much more personal. This not only saves money on postage stamps and phone calls but also allows for more frequent and meaningful interactions. In conclusion, a home computer is far better than not having one. It saves time when researching, money on communication and writing supplies, and helps preserve the environment by reducing paper usage.
1210	1213	1	3	In my opinion, I firmly agree that computers benefit society. Businesses rely on computers for various tasks. Workers use them for designing, whether it's creating fashionable clothing or developing engaging video games. They also use computers to file information, such as patient records in a medical business or client details in a marketing firm. Instead of using traditional filing cabinets, which have limited storage space, computers can hold vast amounts of data. Moreover, workers type papers and essays for business purposes. For example, news reporters need to type reports quickly for publication. If businesses want to operate efficiently, they must use computers for filing, typing, and designing. Fast - food restaurants and regular restaurants also depend on computers. Chains like @ORGANIZATION2 and @ORGANIZATION1 use advanced technology to take orders and process payments. In the past, cash registers were used, which were less secure and more cumbersome. Now, with computer - based systems, all transactions are more secure and streamlined. Every restaurant has at least a touch - screen computer to manage orders and payments, making computers essential for their survival in the modern world. Schools also need computers. Students use them to write reports for projects and classwork. Teachers rely on computers to file student names, grades, and other information, replacing the need for large filing cabinets. Teachers also create homework pages and print materials from word - processing software. In conclusion, I am convinced that computers benefit society. Businesses need them for work, design, and filing; restaurants use them to handle orders; and schools rely on them for educational purposes. These are clear indications of the positive impact computers have on society.
1211	1214	1	3	Dear @PERSON1, Computers are an indispensable part of our lives and bring numerous benefits to our community. They play a crucial role in making our daily lives much easier. In fact, there isn't a single day when we don't interact with a computer in some form. The advantages of computers are multifaceted. They connect us with others, disseminate news, and enable various everyday objects to function.  Computers offer a plethora of ways to connect people. In the business world, it's hard to imagine where companies would stand without computers. Most modern - day businesses rely heavily on computers for their operations. Business owners can now manage enterprises across the globe. For instance, a business in @LOCATION2 or other parts of @LOCATION4 can establish a seamless connection with a branch in @LOCATION1. They can engage in real - time video chats, facilitating efficient communication and collaboration. Even small businesses utilize computers to reach out to customers. Nowadays, online shopping has become extremely popular. This is a prime example of how stores connect with their clientele. Stores can showcase all their products and services, including store locations, which can attract more customers and boost business.  Computers also connect individuals on a personal level. Approximately @PERCENT1 of kids in my school own a computer. This widespread ownership has led to the rise of numerous social networking sites. Currently, @CAPS1 is the most popular one. Students can reconnect with old friends from different places and even other countries. They can have live chats on @CAPS1 or use @CAPS2 for instant messaging. With just a simple click, people can stay connected regardless of the distance between them.  Computers are also excellent news broadcasters. Without them, most of us would be in the dark about world events, such as the @LOCATION3 earthquake. Thanks to computers, the affected area in @LOCATION3 could receive much - needed donations. Moreover, computers have revolutionized the way we access national news. Almost all newspapers are now available both online and in print, and it won't be long before they are completely digital. This will make news accessible with just a click, reducing the time it takes to get information from days to minutes or even seconds.  Science has also benefited greatly from computers. Phones have evolved into mini - computers, offering features like personal web browsing, internet access, and messaging. Cars are also equipped with computers. The @CAPS3 in our cars are essentially computers, and we would be lost without them. Computers in cars control various functions, making driving safer and more efficient.  In conclusion, computers benefit us in countless ways. They connect us, deliver news, and are integrated into almost all of our technology. It's truly difficult to envision life without computers.
1212	1215	1	3	"Do you know that square box with a screen on @CAPS11? Or that rectangular - shaped object with letters on @CAPS11? Or that other rectangular box where you insert a disk or a USB and turn @CAPS11 on? All of these are components of a computer. Yes! @CAPS11 can be a lot of fun. You can play games, surf the internet, watch videos, and check your mail. Having a computer can make things easy, but there are also some drawbacks.  There are @NUM1 reasons why computers might not be ideal. If you have kids and they use the computer at home, @CAPS11 can cause addiction, display inappropriate content, and be quite expensive. Let me explain these reasons so you can make an informed decision.  The first reason why computers can be bad is that @CAPS11 can lead to addiction in your child. This is a significant problem because your child will constantly pester you, saying, ""@CAPS1 or @CAPS7, can I go on the computer, please?"" When you give in and let them use it, they'll be happy. But when it's time to turn off the computer, they'll plead, ""Can I stay on just for a little longer? I don't want to turn it off; I'm in the middle of a game."" Even after they finally turn it off, the next day they'll ask again. If you say no, they'll cry and throw a tantrum. The more you let them use it, the more they'll want to stay on. If you refuse, you'll face a difficult situation.  The second reason why having a computer can be a bad thing is that @CAPS11 can display inappropriate content. As your child grows up and explores the internet, they may come across things like nude pictures or videos. This kind of exposure can have a negative impact on your child and may even lead to premature sexual awareness. You'd be shocked to see what inappropriate content a computer can expose a child as young as @NUM2 to @NUM3 years old to.  Last but not least, computers are expensive. These days, a computer can cost about @MONEY1. If you buy a computer and it breaks down, getting it fixed or buying a new one will cost you a fortune. And kids may use it even more or accidentally damage it. Trust me, I've seen it happen.  These are the reasons why a computer isn't always a good thing. Now that you've heard my reasons, I hope you'll take this information into consideration and think carefully about whether you really want a computer. They are convenient, but they also have some negative side - effects. All the facts I've mentioned are true, and I've heard that about @NUM4 people in the world face issues related to computers every year. So, think hard. Do you still want a computer?"
1213	1216	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @ORGANIZATION1, Computers are an extremely useful tool in this modern era. They offer multiple benefits, such as teaching hand - eye coordination, enabling people to easily learn about far - away places and people, and allowing individuals to communicate online with others. Therefore, I firmly believe that computers have a positive impact on people.  Hand - eye coordination is a vital skill, especially for young children. Without it, they may have messy handwriting, struggle in sports, and face other difficulties. Computers help in teaching this skill because children need to use their fingers to press the keys they see on the screen. As they try to type faster, their fingers and eyes must work in harmony, which further enhances this coordination.  Computers also provide people with the ability to effortlessly learn about distant places, people, and various topics. In the past, individuals had to spend hours searching for a decent book on a particular subject and then sift through hundreds of pages to find the relevant information. Now, with just a few clicks, that information is readily available. For example, if you have a dripping faucet and don't want to hire a plumber, you can easily find step - by - step instructions on what to do using the computer. The possibilities are truly endless.  Finally, computers allow people to stay in touch with friends who live far away. It's more convenient than traveling by plane because you don't have to hold a device constantly. You can walk away and come back when you receive a message. This is also extremely useful for business people. They can communicate with multiple people simultaneously while still being able to complete other tasks. @PERSON1, the author of a business magazine, mentioned in an interview that it's nearly impossible to run a successful business without a computer.  I can't understand how some people claim that computers have a negative influence on society. I hope that you will publish this article in the paper to show them that computers are necessary in our lives.
1214	1217	1	3	I think having computers is a great advantage because they can be used to find places. Another reason is that you can communicate with your friends using a computer. You can play a wide variety of games, access pictures, and they are also very useful for doing homework. That's why computers are essential and we need them.  The first reason we need computers is that they can serve as a map. We can explore places we've never seen before. If you want to reach a specific destination, you can use the computer to get detailed directions. It provides us with a convenient way to navigate through the world, whether it's for a short trip around the neighborhood or a long - distance journey.  In addition to being a mapping tool, computers allow us to stay connected with friends. We can chat with them in real - time, share our daily experiences, and even plan meet - ups. Playing games on the computer is also a fun way to relax and unwind. There are countless games available, ranging from educational ones to action - packed adventures.  Computers are also a great resource for accessing pictures. We can view images from different parts of the world, learn about different cultures through visual content, and even create our own photo albums. When it comes to homework, computers are invaluable. We can research information, write papers, and use various software to complete our assignments more efficiently.  In conclusion, computers are an integral part of our lives. They offer us the ability to find places, connect with friends, have fun, and complete our academic tasks. We truly need computers in today's world.
1215	1218	1	3	There are over @NUM1 students at @ORGANIZATION2, and out of @NUM2 students have computers. Computers have a positive impact on people. Students who use computers are more skilled than those who don't as they learn various software and how to stay safe online.  Computers teach kids hand - eye coordination, which is extremely useful. When playing sports like baseball or basketball, hand - eye coordination is crucial. For example, if you're a catcher in baseball, you need to use your eyes to track the ball and your hands to catch it. Almost every sport requires this skill, and computers can help kids develop it. Hand - eye coordination is also beneficial for people in their jobs. If you work with computers, being familiar with the keyboard can lead to faster results. Most jobs, along with sports, demand hand - eye coordination. While some people are born with this ability, for others, practice on the computer is the best way to acquire it.  Learning about far - away places and people is always fascinating. On computers, towns can create webpages with pictures, information, and even help you plan a vacation. There's also @ORGANIZATION1, which can help you find any place and learn everything about it. Computers give you the ability to plan or visit a location by buying tickets online or simply reading about the place. You can even go to a translating site if you're in a place where you don't speak the language, like @LOCATION1.  Finally, computers enable people to talk with others. Social networking sites like Facebook, @CAPS1, and @CAPS2 make it easy to communicate. Personally, I have a Facebook account, an @CAPS1 profile, and an email. I often use Facebook to talk to my school friends and cousins who I don't get to see often. Talking online helps me interact with people I might not meet in school or around town, especially those who don't have a cell phone. It also helps me develop social skills that are essential for everyone.  In conclusion, computers have a positive effect on people. Almost everyone uses them, and they aren't difficult to operate. They teach hand - eye coordination, allow us to learn about far - away places and people, and provide a platform for online communication. Computers are truly one of the greatest inventions.
1216	1219	1	3	Dear editor, I have read your past article about how computers can take too much time out of some people's lives! Time that they could be using to exercise or engage in other productive activities. This is completely untrue and in many ways actually benefits society. The internet is a fast and simple way to shorten the time spent doing activities we would already do. Instead of sending a letter to someone to invite them to the movies, you could just email them. Letters can take weeks and can even get lost, while email sends it to them instantly. Also, what if the movie sells out or is canceled? Don't worry, with the internet you can reschedule and buy tickets online so that doesn't happen again. Suddenly your phone rings; it's a call from your best friend saying to turn on the news, but you have to leave to pick up your kids in three minutes. Instead of waiting for the reports to stop talking, you can check instantly on one of the many news websites and still be early. Have you been dying to talk to someone you haven't seen in a long time? Well, with one of the many free websites like Skype and Facebook, you can do that in a heartbeat. You can talk to that person and find many interesting things. Also, if you've been feeling lonely, like you can't find the right person, with dating sites you can find the perfect person and maybe go to the movies with them. Not only does it save time and connect you to other people, but it can help you physically. According to Dr. Smith at the Health Institute, people who use computers for at least 30 minutes a day have a 20% increase in hand-eye coordination, reaction time, and accuracy. Although some say it's bad for your eyes, that is a lie. It was proven by Dr. Johnson, the renowned ophthalmologist, who has 20 degrees in science and health. In conclusion, computers offer numerous benefits and the claims about their negative impacts are unfounded.
1217	1220	1	3	To whom it May concern: I will agree that computers have caused many people to spend less time outside. However, it has kept kids inside instead of being on the streets causing trouble. Computers have become a part of our everyday life. Some use it to stay connected with family or to reconnect with old friends. Experts say it's bad, but our school gives us a computer class in the computer lab. We learn keyboarding skills, presentation techniques, and how to research any topic. Our school, itself, has influenced computer use. If we could travel back in time, we would most likely see kids hanging around the streets. Now-a-days, kids spend a lot of time inside, on the computers. This isn't necessarily a bad thing. I bet you, or your parents, or maybe even your grandparents used to hear about gangs or fights going on in the streets. Now that computers have become an important item in many people's lives, you don't hear those types of things as much. I'm not saying they don't happen, but you don't hear your child come home and talk about gangs and fights. Therefore, being on the computer isn't that bad. In history, you probably learned about immigrants coming over to the United States to get away from their ruler. Well, not everyone was able to come. Some people have family in another country. Due to time difference, it is hard to stay in touch. My mother came over here when she was 18. The rest of her family still lives in Mexico. To stay in touch, they email or video chat. The five-hour time difference makes it difficult to know when to call. The invention of computers has made it easier to catch up with family! Most importantly, the use of computers is influenced in schools. My school, [School Name], has a computer class, where we learn how to skillfully type. We are also taught how to correctly cite and research work. This is helpful because if we don't know this information, we could plagiarize, and plagiarism is illegal. Frequently, teachers give us projects that ask for computer use. Either we have to look something up for specific, accurate information or we have to type a research document. As well as using the online textbook instead of taking it home. After reading all the facts, I'm sure you will agree that computers can benefit society. Students stay off the streets and only cause trouble with siblings at home. People won't feel like they've left or lost their family. Schools influence computer use to help us learn. Certainly, you cannot disagree with me as the advantages of computers are quite evident.
1218	1221	1	3	Dear Sir or Madam, Some people believe that computers are harmful to our society because people spend more time on such technology. I believe that this is not the reason our society is falling today, although I agree that people spend too much time on the computer. Computers are actually helpful in our society because it is an advance in communication. People have found ways to communicate with other people through plugging in a webcam and mic. Not only does the computer help communication, but it also helps us gain information on modern-day society like the news to stay up-to-date. This complicated device can also save files and documents by typing them in so that if it is lost, you could just reprint it out. One main thing that people of modern-day technology usually do is talk to faraway friends and family in their spare time. Legal websites allow people to be informed of a friend or family about events that have occurred like an incident or an upcoming event. Some experts like Dr. Brown, who specializes in the behavior of people, says that this is a number one cause of obesity and prevents people from meeting other people outside or even plain exercise. I would say this isn't completely true because before even talking to anyone online, people usually go for a jog around the neighborhood. Information is vital in our society and keeps us up-to-date on modern life. A computer can give us certain information like news and weather reports. These days, every smart person would go search information on a computer for not only missed news but for future forecasts on whether to plan a picnic. This would be a helpful tool to our society in order to keep up with the world and not miss the latest event. I believe this is an advance in our modern-day society because you could get the information you need. When you are in a rush to go to work, don't you end up losing papers and files just forgetting about them? The computer can send data to a computer to conveniently copy a file or document so you won't have to rush to work and worry about lost files. It has been known that thirty out of fifty people have saved themselves from losing a job because of a computer. The computer can also hold and store data for later use like a song or picture. You could send that file and listen to it on another computer. Now is the time to decide if you should support computers. The computer can help you talk to long-lost friends with one touch of a button. If you need certain information, then you could find it on a computer without ever leaving your comfortable home. Last and not least, you could hold important files and documents and save yourself the trouble from rushing to work. So go and type that letter to a representative to help people see that computers are good for our society as they bring so many conveniences.
1219	1222	1	3	Computers. First of all, I strongly believe that people should not use computers all the time. Staying up too late, like on a school day when you're tired. Your eyes look at black & white words that can make you more tired, forcing you to stay up, and drinking Red Bull, Monster, or any other energy drink when you're not supposed to. Second of all, almost the whole school uses the laptops and the computers, and about 80% of the students use them. The other 20% of the students and adults write on paper, and that has good hand - eye combination. The 80% is like all people go online, to Facebook, YouTube, play games, and use Google. The 20% is all people use to write on their paper and doodle on the background. Third of all, in other states, people don't have internet service, or they can't use a computer. People have to write their work on a piece of paper. Some kids, young adults, adults, and students sometimes have bad handwriting. I think all people should not rely too much on computers as there are many drawbacks associated with excessive computer use.
1220	1223	1	3	[Organization Name], In my opinion, computers are good for people. I believe this because many people get to see things that in their daily basis they wouldn't. I think that computers have a positive effect on people. I think that many people nowadays work a lot, so they might not have time to remember little things such as going to buy a newspaper or they might not even have time to watch the news on TV, but because of computers, they can read or see the same things but in less time. Some people have a job that includes computers, so they could also read the newspaper on their computer while also working. This benefits society in its own way. I believe computers are very useful to everyone. Computers can help people get in touch. They can keep in touch by using a webcam and other communication tools. It could also let them communicate effectively. Computers allow people to see each other from different places in the world. It gives people a chance to see the people they couldn't see from afar. In my opinion, people can also learn from computers. Computers have many positive effects that are very important. They give people a chance to learn new things. This can benefit society because the more knowledge people have, the better it is. It gives people who didn't get a chance to learn what they wanted to actually do so and learn it. Computers do benefit society. Let's take Dr. Green for example; he says that 70% of kids believe that computers have helped them in their own way. Many people can be bored at times, but because of computers and the fun things it has such as games, videos, etc., people get to actually spend some time doing something interesting. As Dr. Green stated, kids believe computers are helpful because by playing those games, it can give them hand - eye coordination and help them in different ways at the same time (it takes away boredom and lets them get good hand - eye coordination). Computers also benefit society by providing people with such technology. Many times, technology is needed in everyone's life. Technology has helped many people and still continues to. Computers are one of the technologies that help people. Technology can teach people things that they do not even know they could do. In conclusion, I believe computers have many great positive effects on people, and it also doesn't only benefit people that use this technology; it benefits others in a way too. It gives everyone a chance to learn about things and do them, so I believe computers are a great asset to have in our lives.
1221	1224	1	3	@ORGANIZATION1, just imagine @CAPS1 a world without computers. Where exactly would we get all of our information from? Would we have to rely on television or magazines, where the information can be easily changed? Or how would we ever manage to get any reports done for work or complete our homework? I know many people who don't write neatly, so how will anyone be able to read their work? Basically, computers affect our lives so much in a good way that it would be absolute chaos without them. Computers allow people to learn how to type, which can improve all - around skills such as hand - eye coordination. They let us connect with places we are not familiar with and see family members who are far away. Moreover, they allow people to have an online education, which can have a positive impact on the economy. Computers affect us in a very good way and they change our everyday lives. However, @CAPS2 it's quite concerning that children these days cannot type. A recent study done at @ORGANIZATION2 showed that @PERCENT1 of kids older than @NUM1 already know how to type on a keyboard. Computers have such a big effect on us with so many skills that people don't acknowledge enough. Because all of those kids know how to type, they can spell better too. I remember one time when I was in the middle of writing a report online. I came across @NUM2 a word I didn't know and had always had trouble spelling it. So I took my time and typed it out one letter at a time, and it was correct! This example shows that computers can affect everyone's lives, even younger kids. The way that we get information from computers is just like the way our hands get information from our brain to move. For example, when babies learn how to walk, they rely on their brains to show them how it's done. This is just like how when there is a natural disaster, such as the earthquake in @LOCATION1, we rely on our computers to show us and tell us what is going on and how something like this could happen. Computers can affect us this way because there are many things we might never know about our world without them. Computers affect families' everyday lives by giving them online educations. My @NUM3 - year - old cousin told me that she was happy her mom could go back to college from home because then they could spend more quality time together. I know you might think that computers can make families get further apart, but they actually bring them closer together. There is only one choice and that is that computers affect all of us in a good way. They can help us learn how to type, connect us with our world and bring families closer together. Without computers, we wouldn't be the same as we are today, and our lives would be much more difficult and limited.
1222	1225	1	3	Dear local Newspaper. I think we should keep improving technology on computers. Some people think that people spend too much time on the computer and not enough time outside. I personally think that the computer is important, as long as people don't use it non - stop. There are many reasons why the computer is important. First of all, there are many places in the world that not everyone can physically go to. The internet is an excellent way to find out detailed information about a place. Also, if you are planning to go on vacation and you would like to know a little about the vacation spot, you can simply look it up on the computer. You can learn about the local attractions, the best restaurants, and the cultural events happening there. Another reason is that the computer can help you study a place too. If you are writing a research paper for school, then you would probably want to find your information on the computer. You can access a vast amount of academic resources, articles, and books with just a few clicks. If you are disagreeing with someone, then you can find quick and easy information to support your point. All you do is look up something, and you can find it. And you can learn new things that you have no clue about. Most of the time, the internet is very helpful. One more reason is communication. On the computer, there are many ways you can communicate with other people. If you have friends or family far away, then you can keep in touch with them without leaving your house. You can have video calls, share photos and stories. Also, if you are not sure about your homework or something like that, you can just ask a friend to find out. And you can send pictures or videos to people in order to keep in touch. Sometimes people use that feature for bad or inappropriate things. But you can take measures to ensure that you don't get those bad things, such as using parental controls and privacy settings. The internet can help you a lot in your everyday life. You can learn about new places, you can do research, and you can communicate with friends or family. If we keep improving technology, you will be able to do a lot more than you can do now. The internet will be able to help you a lot more in your everyday life. Now you can see that the internet can help people, and it's not just about keeping people inside. That is why I think we should keep improving technology for a better and more connected life.
1223	1226	1	3	Dear Newspaper, I personally believe that new technology is a great thing. That’s why I think that computers have positive effects on our society. Some of these effects include developing skills to help people for the present or future, getting a better education, and helping people to become more social. Computers can help people in so many ways; you just have to realize it. So come and see why computers are a good choice to have and use. My first reason for why I feel computers have positive effects on people is because they can help develop skills that one may have and @MONTH1 not even realize. For example, a teenager @MONTH1 might say while typing a paper that she really likes to write. So, she @MONTH1 could go on the internet, start looking at different writing styles, reading successful articles, and maybe she could become a famous journalist. It's all from the skills she got by going online and searching for what she enjoys. Another situation could be that a man applies for a job, and then the employer says he has to know how to use different software. So he could go on the computer and look for a detailed tutorial on that specific software. He can learn at his own pace and practice until he masters it. A computer @MONTH1 can help people build skills now and for their own future. My second reason for why computers can have positive effects on people is that it can help them get a better education. Any adult who hasn't gone to college and wants to can take well - structured classes online and earn their degree that way. They can interact with professors and classmates from the comfort of their home. The education is not just for adults; kids can go online and research the history of different places they live in and want to go. They can find interesting facts, watch educational videos, and participate in online quizzes. The great thing is that you can find the information fast and easy. Computers help people learn more and get a better education for themselves. My final reason for why computers have positive effects is that they help people to be more social. There are so many ways to connect with family and friends. You can send an email to someone and wait for a thoughtful reply. Or now, you can even instant message somebody and talk to them like they're in the same room. There are also websites, such @CAPS1 as Facebook, where you can get together and talk with old friends, share memories, and plan meet - ups. As you can see, computers have so many positive effects on people. They can help you build social skills for now and for our future. They can also help people get a better education. Plus, it is a great way to connect with past and present friends. Hopefully, you can clearly see how a computer can have positive effects on so many people, enhancing our lives in multiple aspects.
1224	1227	1	3	"In today's society, many new technologies have been released. Such as the @NUM1 player, cell phones, video game consoles such as Xbox @NUM2, but probably the most popular and most used is the computer. The computer has the amazing ability to access and search information in just a couple of clicks. Some people are so enthralled with technology that they almost get addicted to it and use it every chance they get. The question is, is this good for people? Is what they're doing affecting their health and physical activity? Yes, people these days are affected by the internet greatly. There are certain websites where the addiction level is extremely high, such as Facebook, MySpace, and YouTube. These are probably the most addictive ones, especially when they're not being used for school - related purposes. In the @NUM3 years since Facebook was launched, the addiction level has increased dramatically, and so have the high - stress levels! Dr. @DR1 says, ""This online behavior must stop. People are getting addicted and gaining weight from the lack of physical activity."" As you can see, the online internet can be very useful, but it's not something that should be used non - stop. It can affect your health and bring other dangers, such as eye strain, sleep disorders, and social isolation. We need to find a balance between using the internet for its benefits and taking care of our physical and mental well - being."
1225	1228	1	3	Hi! I am writing to discuss whether computers are a bad thing or a good thing for the society. I think that computers are a good thing to have around. They help us in a lot of ways, and they also help us find new friends and get new updates. This is going to be my first opinion. I think that computers have effects on the society in a good way because people can find @CAPS1 a wealth of the latest updates on the weather, society, and countries. It helps the society in a good way because people don't have to look through an old newspaper. All they have to do is click a few buttons, and there they are, reading all the information and probably seeing pictures and other visual content of it. This is my second reason why computers are a good effect on the society. They help us in a lot of ways when it comes to meeting new people and staying in close contact with them. We can talk with them, share experiences, and send pictures of ourselves and the things around us. My last opinion on why computers are a good effect on society is that @CAPS2 if you have a business or anything, you can sell any of your merchandise, keep business plans organized, and also you can make a professional - looking website for your business. After a while, @CAPS1 a large number of people will know about it, and it would make a really big impact on your business. That was my three opinions on why computers are a good effect on the society, and I firmly believe that computers are really a good effect on the society. They enhance our access to information, improve our social connections, and boost business opportunities, making our lives more convenient and prosperous.
1226	1229	1	3	Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, @CAPS2, have you ever pondered whether computers have a positive or negative impact on people's lives? Well, if you think it is negative, I am going to show you why it is actually very positive. First, it teaches good hand - eye coordination. Second, it lets people communicate with other people. Third, it can help with school and work. As you can see, this is why I believe it is positive.  First, computers teach good hand - eye coordination. While you use computers, you are constantly improving your hand - eye coordination. One clear way is that when you are online and you spot something you like or want to view even bigger, you smoothly move the mouse and precisely click. This helps because you saw something and didn't need to consciously see where you were moving the mouse to click on it. Also, it helps because when you are typing a paper, you don't need to look at the keys to know what to type. You can look at the screen and move your fingers freely across the keyboard. As you can see, this is my first reason as to why I believe computers are positive.  Second, computers help people communicate with others. This can be extremely important if you need to talk to someone that lives far away. If someone lives too far away and there is something important to discuss, then the internet is great. You can send people emails or even instant - chat someone. It helps communication so much that you have choices on how you want to talk to someone.  Third, it helps people with school and sometimes work. It helps people because they could research projects. This can be helpful to learn about places you didn't even know existed. One time I was wondering what people from @LOCATION1 did to live and survive. Being curious, I just had to know. I went on the computer and in about a half - hour I knew exactly what and how @LOCATION1 people did to live and survive. This could also help at work because if your boss is counting on you to have work done, you can use the computer to quickly find the information you need.  In conclusion, I believe that computers are positive for three main reasons. First, they can help to improve hand - eye coordination. Second, they help people communicate with people from other areas. Third, it helps with school and work. So now that you have read this, I hope I have shown you that computers aren't bad for us at all. In fact, they are the best bet for a better future.
1227	1230	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2, have you ever wondered who really invented the ice cream cone while standing there, slowly licking one? Well, why don't you just pull out your BlackBerry and find out? That is the great thing about technology. You can talk to friends or family, get help, and it is there whenever you need it.  Have you ever had to move so far away from your best friend that you cried so much someone thought it was raining? Well, this is not necessary because you can now have a webcam in your computer and talk as much as possible. Of course, it's not the same as being there with the person, but it's pretty close. You can talk whenever, wherever, with the great invention of computers. One other way that a computer benefits talking with other people is that you and your friends can chat. If your parents are out and won't let you go out, you can still talk to your friends. Lastly, if you are older, you can use Facebook to find friends you have not seen in a long amount of time.  Another reason that the computer and technology are great is because you can get information when you need it. Schools practically rely on computers. Not only the students but teachers too. The teachers assign projects that include going on the computers and finding information all about your topic. Also, if you come across a word or a thing that you have never heard of before, you can go and find out about it. It is great because all you have to do is click a button and every bit of information is at your fingertips. This can come in handy when you are in a fight with your friend about who is a better @PERSON1. You can just look up who has gotten more home runs and there you go. You've got a winner!  Have you ever been at dinner and someone asks if you have the hockey game score and your friend, husband, or brother pulls out his phone and then says @NUM1 to @NUM2 about @NUM3 minutes after you asked? Well, that must mean they have internet on their phone. Phones such as BlackBerrys, @CAPS3, and iPhones all have internet built in. This means when they are in the airport waiting for their plane, they can just play a game or watch some television. To me, that is a pretty cool invention. Also, people in business and industry have phones with internet built in because they can just look something up at any time.  So this is why I think having technology is good in our society. Especially because you can talk to far - away friends and get whatever kind of information you need with a touch of a button. Also, you can have it in things such as your phone or in another technology - related thing. Technology truly enriches our lives and makes the world a smaller, more connected place.
1228	1231	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I think computers have good effects on people, such as letting people talk to family or friends that live far away. Computers also let you learn about different places and people around the world.  My first reason is that computers let you learn about different places and people around the world. This can be extremely helpful if you are going on vacation to a foreign country. You can learn where the best historical sights are and you can also learn where the best hotels are. For example, you can read reviews from other travelers and get an idea of what to expect. If you have a project due on a foreign country, you can search it up and it will give you all the data you need about it. You can find information on the country's culture, history, geography, and more.  My second reason is that computers let you talk to family or friends that live far away. This helps you keep in touch so it doesn't seem like you don't know them anymore. You can have real - time conversations through video calls, which makes it feel like you are in the same room. Computers can also let you talk to your friends that live far away and if you want to hang out, it would let you talk about which days are good for you and them. You can plan trips together or just catch up on each other's lives.  In conclusion, computers have a positive impact on people's lives. They provide a wealth of information about the world and help us stay connected with our loved ones. Whether it's for learning or for socializing, computers are an essential tool in today's society.
1229	1232	1	3	Advancements in technology are very practical and have a positive effect on those fortunate enough to have a computer. First, computers help people develop better hand - eye coordination. Secondly, computers make it simple to learn new information about many things such as people and places across the globe. Finally, computers allow people in different places to communicate instantly. For the reasons above, computers are very helpful to people all around the world.  One of the ways computers help people is through improving their hand - eye coordination. When a person learns to type and look at a screen at the same time, they will be able to do simple everyday tasks much better. If a person does not have good hand - eye coordination, they cannot even make out the words on a paper properly! This also helps with focus, and people with better focus excel in school, work, and their social lives. Hand - eye coordination is very important to learn and computers help to teach it to people.  The second reason that I think computers help people is to learn about new things. I myself have known many processes. I now realize how lucky I am to be able to access information, and the research is possible because of computers. Computers are educational. They can provide in - depth knowledge on various subjects, from history to science.  Finally, computers are handy because they are a great communication tool, similar to a telephone. One way of communication on computers is instant messaging. This is when they type and this is similar to a telephone conversation, but free of charge. The final and most popular way is video chat. Video chat is when the people use cameras connected to their computers and can talk to each other while seeing each other's face! All these ways of communicating with people around the world are very beneficial to many people, especially those with family or friends living in another town.  Without a doubt, computers benefit people in society in many ways. They teach them hand - eye coordination which is very important for simple, everyday tasks. They also help people everywhere in the world learn about things that they couldn't learn about with just books. Last but not least, computers allow people around the world to communicate with each other. In all these ways, computers help people everywhere and make our lives more convenient, connected, and informed.
1230	1233	1	3	Dear local Newspaper, I hear you are debating whether or not computers have a positive effect on people. In my opinion, I think that, yes, they do have a positive effect on people. I think this because, first, computers allow you to learn about foreign places and cultures. Second, computers are often helpful to those with special needs, and third, the computer allows you to connect with people who often live far away without having to travel to them.  I really enjoy learning about foreign places and culture. I know that from my own experience that the more knowledgeable you are about foreign places and culture, the more smart you become overall. Without the computer, many people would not be able to explore these places and learn about them. The computer is basically a big encyclopedia that supplies important information to those who are unable to travel across the world and visit these places. Without computers, people would be less educated about the people, cultures, and the world we live in. Places such as the pyramids in @LOCATION1, and other historical and cultural landmarks can be explored virtually. Don't you agree?  In my school, there are several students with special needs. I, personally, can't even begin to imagine how difficult it must be for them to learn. But one thing I do know is that the computer is a very helpful resource to them. The computer supplies pictures, sounds, and interactive activities that really help kids out. Since some of the kids in my school who have special needs have a hard time reading, the computer helps by reading it aloud to them. Where would those children be if they didn't have computers?  I love keeping in touch with my distant family and friends. Don't you? It used to be that it would take days and days to send and receive a letter from a relative. But because of the computer, this hard task can be done with a simple click of the mouse. But that's not all. Besides sending virtual emails to people, because of the computer, you can see them face to face! Some computers have webcams that allow you to see someone through the screen of your computer. Isn't that great?! So, why waste money flying to see someone to deliver a simple message when you can deliver it personally in almost less than @NUM4 seconds? Because of the computer, people talk more and are often brought closer together.  So, as you can see, there are many important positive effects that computers have on people. The reasons being that computers allow you to learn about foreign places and cultures, computers are often helpful to those with special needs, and computers allow you to connect with people who often live far away without having to travel to them. Thank you for listening, and I hope this helps you see the many benefits that computers bring to our lives.
1231	1234	1	3	More and more people use computers every day. Computers are an incredibly great help for various projects, sending and receiving emails, researching vacation spots, and so many other things. However, some scientists think people are spending an excessive amount of time on the computer instead of exercising regularly, or simply taking a leisurely walk. I think that computers are an important part of a person's life because the information found on a computer is extremely useful. It can be highly beneficial to you when you have a report coming up. What if your teacher tells you that a report is due tomorrow? What are you going to do? You don't have the time to go to the library. I would go on the computer and quickly get all the information I need. I would also use a computer to learn about far - off places, or even well - known famous people in history. I also could look up where I'm going on vacation and then I could learn more detailed information about it. Like, you could find where the best restaurant locations are, the top - rated hotels, and even the most popular tourist spots. Computers are also very helpful for chatting. My grandparents moved away so I don't talk to them that often anymore, but since I have a computer I can send a quick e - mail saying hi, or asking how they're doing. Also imagine going to work and not having a computer! That's a huge amount of work to write down! At some workplaces, the work mainly consists of emailing other work members about the problems they are having, and about meetings. By using a computer you can keep up - to - date on everything that's going on. Also computers are helpful because if you had a test to study for, and you forgot your notes at school, you can look up online what you are studying. Then you can study from the computer. So then the next day you won't fail the science test. Computers can be a nice little break after all your homework is done. If you want to go on the computer to talk to your friends, it should be an incentive to get all your homework done first. Sometimes people need some relaxation time after all their homework is over. Playing games on the computer can be a really nice way to unwind. Computers are a great help for reports, vacations, chatting, getting information to help you study for a test. Also to play games on. A lot of people use computers to do work on for their jobs. I think computers are an important part of a person's daily life as they bring so much convenience and knowledge into our lives.
1232	1236	1	3	In my own opinion, computers are a great addition to our world. Computers can effectively help people with schoolwork, enable seamless communication and entertain you in a safe and engaging way. Those are the key reasons why computers have far - reaching effects on people around the world. First of all, computers are extremely useful for a child's schoolwork. For instance, if a student is doing a research paper, the world - wide - web is a very helpful resource to easily obtain information that you can't find in regular books. In addition, if a student forgets, loses, or is missing homework, they can log on to the school website and quickly print the paper out. Also, most teachers expect an essay to be as neat as possible. That is quite difficult for some students, but typing it on a computer is always neat, and everyone can manage it. As you can clearly see, computers are very much needed when it comes to school work. Second, computers are an excellent way to communicate and keep in touch with other people. For example, if an employee wanted to speak with a boss, or send something to him, he could easily e - mail it to him. Also, if friends wanted to talk with one another, they could instant message each other. If a teacher and a parent of a student had to set up a conference, the teacher could e - mail the parent a suitable time and date. That is why computers offer great and easy communication. Lastly, computers provide a safe, fun way of entertainment. Many companies make kid - friendly websites that kids can enjoy. For instance, my six - year - old sister goes on a website that teaches things in a fun and interactive way. Studies show that a significant percentage of kindergartners who go on these websites do better in first grade compared to those who don't. Clearly, computers are a great way to spend your time. In conclusion, I believe that computers have a great and positive effect on people around the planet. They help with school work, provide easy communication, and offer safe educational activities. As you can see, computers are truly a great addition to our world.
1233	1237	1	3	Dear [Recipient], Some people think that computers are used too much, and are contributing to people becoming overweight, and even obese. This might be true to some extent, but computers also teach hand - eye coordination, give people the opportunity to learn about far - away places, and allow people to communicate through them! Overall, I think computers affect people in a positive way, and these are some reasons why. Computers help teach hand - eye coordination. I know you're probably thinking “huh? How do computers do that? All you're doing is staring at a screen.” But to your surprise, computers do teach hand - eye coordination. It does this because while playing games, people watch the screen and use their hands to click. They don't just stare at the mouse while they play these games. By doing so, it effectively teaches hand - eye coordination. Scientists have proven that people who own a computer and use it at least [Number] hours a week have better coordination than people who don't own a computer by [Percentage]! Just that statistic alone says a lot. Hand - eye coordination is an important skill. It helps you perform better in sports like baseball, and not only that but it is also beneficial for future jobs. As you can tell, [Recipient], without computers, our hand - eye coordination would be affected. People think that computers are only used for games, but in reality, they teach us many things about the world. Without computers, people would know very little about what's going on in other countries. For example, the other day, my mom was checking her email and came across the story of a young, starving child. That story changed her perspective on everyday life because she often takes food for granted. Without the computer, my mom would know less about what's happening in other countries. Because we live in the [Country], we are often unaware of what's going on in other countries. There are people who are less fortunate, but computers help remind and teach us what's going on in the world every day. One of the main advantages about computers is that they allow people to communicate through them. Even my grandmother said that, without computers, she wouldn't be as close to me as she is today. My grandmother and I use the website skype.com. This website allows you to not only talk to the other person but also to see them! Because of sites like these, I'm able to stay in contact and see my grandmother who lives far away. Without computers, this wouldn't be possible. Not only do computers let you talk to people far away, but also to those who are close. I often find myself asking friends over the computer what the homework is, or when the next test is, etc. Computers make it easier to connect to people near and far. In conclusion, computers help in all different ways. The world would be very different without them. They give people the ability to learn about far - away places and people, teach hand - eye coordination, and allow people to communicate with each other. Computers have some flaws, but they also have so many positive effects that they clearly outweigh all the minor flaws. Thank you.
1234	1238	1	3	Dear our local newspaper, Computers have a huge and negative effect on people. It could dramatically change their lifestyles. For example, people who sit there all day on the computers spend less of their valuable time exercising, enjoying the beauty of nature and socializing with friends and families. Therefore, computers affect us greatly. One of the reasons why computers can be horrible is that people spend an excessive amount of time on their computers and don't exercise. It's always crucial to stay fit and healthy. This could be one of the reasons why [Percentage] of people who live in the [Country] are obese. It could be a leading cause of obesity. I can relate to this because I had a relative who admitted that he gained at least five pounds just for being on the computer constantly and not exercising. Is it really worth sitting in front of the computer all day eating junk food? There are better forms of entertainment that are active and will keep us healthy and fit. Another reason is that people seem to be far more engrossed in technology. This will not improve your social abilities. You could lose self - confidence in yourself and not be as outgoing. No one likes to be a loner. The feeling could be really devastating. Moreover, this would make it very difficult to interact and make new friends. It's always a wonderful feeling to know that you have so many loving people around you. You could lose them in an instant by spending more time focused on the computer rather than your friends and family. Lastly, it could be extremely difficult to get through life without the support of your friends and family. In conclusion, people who spend too much time on their computer spend less of their time exercising, enjoying nature and interacting with friends and families. Instead of focusing on the most important things in life, people are becoming more focused on computers. Computers affect us in a negative way that can change the course of our life, and we should be more aware of their potential harm.
1235	1239	1	3	Dear editor of [Newspaper Name], [Location]'s society is being ruined, and it's clearly because of computers. They are so time - consuming that I'm really worried they are causing more people to be obese in [Location]. People are concerned that they are limiting themselves from interacting with others and spending time enjoying the wonders of nature. I feel exactly the same way and someone should definitely put a stop to this! An average American spends about [Number] hours a day on a computer. With the time spent going to work or school, and sleeping, there is only a little [Amount] of time left to go out and explore nature. The number of visitors to our national parks has been decreasing at a rapid rate. I visited Yellowstone last week to find out if as many people have been going. The man who works at the entrance was saying that “since the start of [Date] alone, about [Percentage] less people have been to [Park Name].” I believe that the reason for that is because of computers. They limit people from going to parks or to zoos by consuming the public's time with all the “new trends” or the newest game on miniclip.com. Also, I believe that the public is spending so much time on computers that they are not able to go out and exercise. With the newest “Sims game,” how are kids supposed to stay fit and healthy? I did a study on how many hours kids spend on their computers, and out of the people who said more than [Number] minutes, [Percentage] of them could be legally considered obese. Is that how we want our next generation to be, our future presidents, lawyers, and doctors? Of course not, we want them to live life to the fullest by taking care of themselves through exercise. Computers are getting kids so consumed that it's really not okay. Lastly, with computers, families and friends don't really talk to each other as often as they should, or interact with each other at all. I mean, sure, parents come home to their child on the computer and give them a kiss on the head. But is that enough? I do not believe it is. I asked a friend of mine's child about how much he interacts with his family and friends. He said that well since he got his new “[Computer Brand] [Model] with a [Number] gig hard drive,” he hadn't been talking to them very much. However, every day he went on “chat” “for a good [Number] hours” to talk to his online friends. And only occasionally would he get an [Email] or two from his parents asking how his day was. I do not believe that that is good for having good friends and a strong family life. That is what [Location] has come down to because of computers. They limit you from interacting with friends and family, give you less time to exercise and limit you from going out and exploring nature. Who knows, maybe in [Number] years, [Location] will be completely controlled by computers. Do we want that? We definitely don't, so let's take action to reduce the negative impact of computers now.
1236	1240	1	3	Dear editor, I believe that computers are a great and fun tool. They offer a wide range of capabilities that can enhance our lives. But I also believe people can spend too much time on them. The computer is excellent. People can use them to type papers or detailed reports, make accurate graphs, and perform other important tasks for us. Schools are using computers more and more now. Schools have well - designed websites for students to go to find out their homework, classwork, challenging projects, in - depth reports, and extra - credit opportunities. The school has even started doing something very new, allowing parents and kids to conveniently check the students' grades online. Not only do the schools help students, but also everyday people can benefit as well. If a student has a project but doesn't know how to start it, then he or she can quickly google their project and find various ways to start it. Computers can be really great and easy to use as you can see, especially for schoolwork. Computers are not only great for academic purposes, but also for leisure purposes. Before computers and the internet, there were only these limited ways to have fun during boring times in the day. One was watching TV, reading a book, or going outside, if you could. What do I mean by that last sentence? If you lived in a city, then it would be harder to go outside because maybe you lived in an apartment or somewhere not in a friendly community. Then you couldn't go out; and reading books can become boring after a while, and maybe there was nothing interesting on TV for you to watch. But when computers and the internet came out, people could play exciting games, watch entertaining videos, and talk to cousins or family who live far away. Computers are also good for social networks. Not all families live close, but they are a close - knit family. But in this economy, we can't always afford to visit them whenever we want. So by using computers, we can message them on Facebook, connect with them on MySpace, and even have video chats with them, which, as I said, is great for far - away family. But at times, people can become too obsessed with them. Some people spend all day on one website, particularly Facebook or YouTube. Do not get me wrong, these websites are fun and cool. But not cool enough to prevent us from going outside and having free, natural fun. I remember I logged into Facebook and saw a girl on. I logged off around an hour later and she was still on. Then I logged in again around 3 p.m. and the same girl was on! That is just too long to be on one website. Computers are a great tool for humans to use for business, education, and leisure. But too much use is not good. We should strike a balance between using computers and engaging in other activities.
1237	1241	1	3	Do you like computers? Do you use the internet to help you with your studies, work, or daily life? Do you use it every day? Well, if not, this article gives you information about all of this. First, a lot of people don't like computers because they say they're too confusing. Actually, computers aren't that hard to work with. You just have to be patient and take some time to get used to their functions. Also, computers can make things easier, like typing. Why should you write by hand when you have the option to use a computer which lets you write faster than you could on normal paper? Secondly, the internet is much easier than books. All you have to do is go to Google or any other search engine, type what you're looking for in, and in a split - second, you have all the information in the world on that topic. Also, if you're planning a vacation, the internet can help. You can purchase plane tickets online, and sometimes there are special discounts available on the web. Also, you can book hotels and look at live pictures with detailed descriptions. So when you book a vacation on the internet, you know it will be a good one. Finally, you can purchase anything with a click of a button. Almost every website has discounts. I remember the time when I bought $50 shoes for $30 online. Also, it usually ships to your house in a couple of days. Lastly, going on it a lot isn't bad. I go on the computer almost every day, but I also go outside too. I can do this because at night when no one can go outside, I go on the computer for school or for fun. Also, you can talk to your friends or family over the internet. What if your mom or dad went on a 2 - week business trip? You could use your webcam and talk to them and see them as if you were in the same room. So is going on the computer really so bad? I don't think so because it is that helpful and easy to work with. In conclusion, the computer and the internet offer numerous benefits, and with proper usage, they can greatly enhance our lives.
1238	1242	1	3	Dear newspaper company, More and more people use computers each day. But not everyone agrees that it benefits society. Some people say that the people who are on computers don't get enough exercise or play outside. Then when they get off the computer, their eyes hurt and they can't see as well. But with all that said, I agree that the benefits of computers, when well - used, are significant. The reasons why I agree that computers have benefits are that they give you hand - eye coordination and provide people with information on far - away places. They can also be used to rent hotels, movies, and games. You can even talk to people online from around the world! What if we didn't have computers though? Then, if a serious crime happened, we wouldn't be able to quickly find the criminal's name or his records! Some bad reasons for having computers are big issues, right? One is cyberbullying! Kids might get picked on, and they will feel bad. People get called names all the time online. Another big problem is that some people seem friendly online, but then they try to deceive others. There are two big problems with computers called plagiarism. Plagiarism is when you take someone else's work and put your name on it. It can also be when you steal an idea and say it's yours. The second problem is stealing music by getting it for free. By downloading from the internet like from LimeWire, then the artists don't get the money from the albums. That is why I agree that computers give you benefits, but they also give you bad ones. So be careful when you're on a computer. In summary, while computers bring many advantages, we need to be vigilant about the associated problems to make the most of this technology.
1239	1243	1	3	Dear all computer lovers, I do think you are all spending too much time on the computer. Yes, it is good to go on the computer and learn new facts, watch funny videos, and basically, everything is available on the computer these days. But most people spend too much time on the computer. You need to be doing three important things: enjoying nature, spending time with family and friends, and most importantly, exercising. In this letter, I will be explaining why you need these things, which you can't get on the computer. First, I will be explaining why it is important to enjoy nature. Sometimes, enjoying nature can be difficult, but if we all look closer, it can be really fun. Some examples of nature are tall trees, green grass, and the fresh, clean air. But I am sure all of my fellow teenagers would agree that just looking at these things is very boring. We would all rather sit and watch TV. Some examples of making nature fun are instead of looking at a boring tree, you can climb the tree and maybe explore its branches. You can also go outside and play fetch with your dog and then lay in the soft grass. One example of my favorite things to do in nature is when I stay up all night. I run outside very early in the morning, lay in the grass, breathe in the fresh air, and watch the beautiful sun come up. Secondly, it is very important that you get off the computer and spend time with family and friends. Family can do many wonderful things with you. I know that I am very happy when I am with family because they always make me laugh, and most importantly, my family loves to have exciting parties. Parties are always fun, especially when you are with family. Friends are also great to be with because they make you laugh, go on adventures, and are always there for you. In conclusion, we should limit our computer time and make more time for nature, family, and friends to lead a more balanced and fulfilling life.
1240	1244	1	3	Dear Newspaper, I think that the effects that computers are having on people is a negative thing because most people just sit at the computers all day long. In this letter, I am going to talk about the effects of computers on people, what we could be doing instead, and what people are doing on the computer. First thing is that computers are having a negative effect on people and their lives. Computers are making people just sit inside on their computers all day and do nothing productive. They just sit there playing games, and also about 70% of the people who are spending too much time on the computer are probably eating while they're on the computer, which is why some people may become fat. Most of the people who spend all of their time on the computer are people in their 20's and 30's, some are in their 40's or 50's. Just sitting there on the computer will get you nowhere in life. It will not give you a job or a good school education. By just sitting at the computer for a long while, you will not be able to do things outside. If so many people were not on the computer all the time, then they could be outside. Being outside, they can play various sports, ride bikes, swim, run, and more. They could also get a job and make some money or go to college. Kids who are on the computer too much could get out and go to the mall, hang out with friends, get some exercise, or just enjoy nature. There is no use for going on the computer and being there for more than 3 or 4 hours. The most you should be on the computer would be an hour to an hour and a half. Kids and teenagers should only go on the computer for homework, and the rest of the time, they should be doing something else. Well, all of the kids from kindergarten through 6th grade should go out and play with their toys, and people from 7th grade and up should hang out with friends and do things like go to the mall, see a movie, or just have a sleepover. Also, everyone in these grades should interact with their families more by seeing them more than 2 or 3 times a month, and they could have parties or just get together and hang out. So people should do some of the other things I said instead of just going on the computer all of the time. The last thing is the things that people are doing on the computers. For example, I sometimes go on Facebook. Other people go on Facebook, Google, play games, look up information, and more. They also have emails where they chat with other people. Another thing people go on is YouTube and listen to music and watch videos. So I don't think that the effect of the computers on people is a good thing. I think that people should be out doing things rather than just sitting at home on the computer. People who sit at home on computers could and probably will get too fat. So the effect of computers on people is negative. In conclusion, we should be more aware of the negative impacts of excessive computer use and take steps to lead a more active and balanced lifestyle.
1241	1245	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1, I have recently heard over @CAPS2 @NUM1 @CAPS3 that people believe computers have different effects on people. In the past, computers have caused various problems with the human body. Many @CAPS5 are becoming overly reliant on computers. So, in my view, I believe computers have a negative impact. First of all, computers have caused @CAPS5 to not exercise and become unhealthy. @NUM2 out of @NUM3 @CAPS5 have said that their @CAPS5 are spending too much time on the computer. @CAPS5 need to realize that sitting on a computer @CAPS4 is a clear danger to their health. You don't want your @CAPS5 to have eye problems in the future, do you? People tend to be on the computer too much, not just for work but also for playing games. I realize that I need to stop and go out and exercise to maintain well - balanced health. @PERSON1 says, ""@CAPS4 technology increases, the more and more people we have given glasses to."" @CAPS5 need to make changes to what they do during the day. So, @CAPS4, I oppose computers because @CAPS5 are becoming unhealthy. Moreover, people do not spend @CAPS4 much time with family and friends. In the past, my mom used to yell at me. @PERCENT1 of people believe family interaction is very important. Did you know that? Computers can even lead to relationship issues in families. People need to improve communication within families because excessive computer use decreases interaction. My last reason is that people are not enjoying nature. @NUM4 out of @NUM3 people are missing out on enjoying nature. It gives you a chance to express your thoughts. Many people need time to think about what is happening in their life, and they cannot do this with the constant distraction of the internet. In the past, I was stressed because I never had a moment to just relax and think about things while I was on the computer doing something or homework. @PERCENT2 of people who have too much going on in life believe that they need more time away from the computer. Do you now see that nature can be helpful? So, @CAPS4, you can see computers have a negative effect because people don't get enough time to enjoy nature. In conclusion, I believe computers have a huge negative effect on people. The reasons are that people would be less active, people will not interact @CAPS4 well, and people don't enjoy nature. So, I strongly urge you to vote against the idea that computers have a positive effect."
1242	1246	1	3	Dear @LOCATION1 Newspaper, @CAPS1, my name is @PERSON1. I'm going to @ORGANIZATION1 in @LOCATION1. I'm in @NUM1 grade. I'm writing this letter to you to tell you my opinion on whether technology has a positive effect on people. My opinion is that computers are good. Keep reading to see how they change people's lives in <@NUM2 @LOCATION1</@CAPS2>. My first reason is that computers teach you hand - eye coordination. For example, when I was in @NUM3 grade, I would regularly go to the library in my @ORGANIZATION1. The library had a website named @CAPS3 To learn. It was specifically designed to help you learn how to type without looking at the keyboard, which is a great skill to have. My second reason is that computers give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people. For example, when I was in @NUM4 grade in @CAPS4 @CAPS5, I had to write a detailed report about @CAPS6. And I went on @ORGANIZATION2. I found wonderful pictures of @CAPS7. And I saw how they live their daily lives. I watched a @CAPS8 special like @NUM5 weeks ago. It said @PERCENT1 of people would use @ORGANIZATION2 to look up people's numbers and more personal things. My third reason is that computers give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people. For example, when I want to talk to my cousin who lives in @LOCATION3, I would go on the internet and talk to them on webcam. I can clearly see and talk to them as if they were right in front of me. I read in an article like a month ago that @PERCENT1 of people use the computer to chat with people. In conclusion, some people might say some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on computers and less time exercising, enjoying friends and family. However, being on the computer can be a safer option in some cases than going outside. More kids or people would be safe. Next, you should post this in your newspaper so that more people can know about the positive effects of computers.
1243	1247	1	3	Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1, my opinion on computers is that I think they are the most helpful thing in our society and it benefits us greatly. Let's say if I wanted to see what the other side of the world looks like, or even what the surface of the moon, mars, venus, jupiter, etc. is like. I could just go onto a computer, open or download a program, and there it is right in front of me. Computers also help people express their creativity. There are programs available that allow you to draw or build virtual models. I bet it even helps young children become smarter by building things on the computer. Another thing computers do is open up lots of jobs. In a bad economy, people need all the help they can get. With a computer, you can keep people alive and breathing. In the medical field, it can help find broken bones or tumors. Architects can use it to build bridges and homes by making blueprints. The last thing computers help us do is the most important, and that is helps people learn. By creating simulations of the titanic, a space ships or floods. They help find information even if it's about people. You can see people on a computer with a camera, or save a life by finding where they crashed on their plane. That's why computers are the most helpful thing we have @DATE1 and we should keep learning and progressing to make us more advanced and smarter.
1244	1248	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I think that computers have a positive effect on people. You can do lots of stuff with computers such as help people learn new things almost about everything. Also, there are some programs on the computer where they allow you to talk to other people. Also, for adults, they can take care of some finances and bills online and some taxes. I think computers definitely have a positive effect on people. A large number of people use their computers to learn new stuff about other things and people. Nine out of ten people go on the computer at least more than once a month to learn about something new. Also, kids in school use computers all the time for school work and to learn about new things. Kids in school use computers in school all the time for projects and experiments and they learn new stuff about people and things in the world. Computers definitely have a positive effect on people when they learn new things. Another great thing about computers is that there are programs that allow you to talk to other people. Eight out of ten people talk to another person almost every day on the computer. This is a good thing because they're able to talk to friends and family from a long distance and enjoy themselves. It is also a good thing because if family moves away you can still talk to them from a computer. Another positive effect computers have for you is that adults can pay bills and finances on the computer also. Seven out of ten adults pay bills online at their computer. This is a good thing because instead of having to do it by hand, now they can just do it on the computer, which is definitely a positive effect on a person! I think computers definitely have a positive affect on people in many ways. They help people learn new stuff about things and people. Also, they allow you to talk to friends and family over the internet. And finally, they allow you to do finances and pay the bills online instead of by hand. There are many more ways still that computers have a positive affect on people, I've only stated just a few of them. I hope you take my side about my opinion about computers and that they definitely have a positive affect on people. In summary, computers are a valuable asset in our lives, enhancing learning, communication, and financial management.
1245	1249	1	3	"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1, do you keep in touch and @CAPS1 do computers affect your job? Some people are using computers too often and aren't able to enjoy the outside world. Some use computers for other things and sometimes just waste time. I believe computers have a strong positive affect on people. You can keep in touch. Not only can you keep in touch with relatives, but also people in different countries, or states, and even people like your friends who live next door. E - mail is a great and healthy way to communicate with others. There are also other websites like facebook and skype where you can actually post pictures up about yourself and family and be protected. @CAPS3, if you live miles and miles away, you can easily show your friends the things you've been doing or your new baby boy. @CAPS4 also shows things about your personal info. You can make friends with people and plan @CAPS1 what you're going to do and hang out this weekend. Yesterday my @CAPS2 emailed me a picture of a cub bear in a tree outside of his cabin he was playing in. He's over @NUM1 hours away and I can still email him back saying, ""@CAPS2, did you make a friend."" Within seconds he can respond saying, ""I even got a bear hug =)!"" @CAPS3, I talk to him while he's away and it's as if we're almost together. I bet you use email as much as we do to get a lot of information. @CAPS4's a fast and easy way to communicate. You can learn. Computers are a very big part in the learning experience. Teachers, students, parents, and grandparents learn everyday with computers. There are educational websites to learn about things. In our school yesterday on ""quiz.com."" @CAPS4's a website for schools where you can take quizzes instead of on paper. If you're a busy parent with kids, you can work online. You can get paid for the work you do with websites. You can also go to school online. People who are very busy and don't have time to go to college classes can take classes. They can learn and even interact with others. The computers teach you; they don't hurt you. Everything from security, jobs, bills, school, contacting, games, everything is made easier. Most people, schools, and businesses can't function without a computer. Computers protect you and help you grow. You can have fun with computers. A lot of people go online and play games on numerous websites. These games can pass the time and give the player some fun. @CAPS4 might not be physical activity, but it's fun. You can do @CAPS3 many things on the computer to have fun. You can play online games, download music, skype, browse, shop, and even meet people. Meeting people is a big thing. A lot of people these days are using this way to meet and interact with new and interesting people. My cousin is now @NUM2 and he used online dating and met this really sweet and pretty girl that lived nearby. @NUM3 years later they're married and are more in love than they ever imagined. See @CAPS3, love can be found on computers and it's a lot of fun too. You have read my reasons and you have realized what the computer does for the world. Most everyone owns a computer and almost everyone needs one. This is an easy way to communicate or keep in touch, you can learn from it, and you can have fun with the computer. There are many more things that are in good use. In conclusion, I have now convinced you that computers are very positive for people."
1246	1250	1	3	"Dear The @CAPS1 newspaper, sitting @CAPS2 in front of a @CAPS3 @CAPS1 after a long day at @CAPS1. Oh, how much you want to just relax in the natural free air, breathing in the fresh scent of the outdoors, but with all the advances in technology you feel it's your job to always be updated. I believe that advances in technology have had a negative affect on people. People aren't exercising, interacting with family and friends in person, or having the ability to enjoy nature. Exercising means getting your heart to pound, your body to sweat, and me because of endorphins that ultimately make you feel better. Sitting @CAPS2 in front of a @CAPS3 all day @CAPS1 does not support you with the natural urge to exercise. People who support advances in technology say, ""@CAPS3 are able to teach you hand - eye coordination."" However, coordination is important but your body as a whole should also be taken into account as well. @PERSON1, voted # @NUM1 cardiologist in the world says, ""more and more people are suffering from heart disease & attacks every year!"" He goes on to say, ""many links have been theorized to this ongoing problem, But none seem to stand up as well as my theory. I believe peoples lives have been overcome by technology. More and more cases have shown to the people being addicted to their computers. It's unbelievable but, @CAPS5 individuals have a @PERCENT2 higher chance of developing heart disease!! There are many healthier things you can immerse yourself in. Like tennis for example. In tennis you have to develop hand - eye coordination in order to hit the ball correctly. Tennis also increases your heart rate & burns fat cells, to help you lose weight. Statistics show that @NUM2 out of @NUM3 people say tennis have actually made them more confident. This is because when people are able to have the determination to lose weight and be healthier, they feel they can conquer the world. Isn't this the attitude everyone needs? Nature is all around and helps us even if @CAPS4 don't notice. Like trees, they take in @NUM4 and release oxygen. Oxygen is key to life. Trees also are home to many living organisms. Like the sapsucker woodpecker or even an owl. They all rely on trees to survive. But, if you are on the @CAPS3 @NUM5 hours a @CAPS1 @DATE1 you may not realize the beauty of nature. Nature is a beautiful thing that over @PERCENT3 of people say they enjoy relaxing outside, listening to birds singing morning songs or a deer minding their own business feeding with their young. But, advances in technology also ruin this peaceful time in nature. Technology needs a power source, google, for example states to the press that, ""our business surely enjoys nature but needs to also run their corporation"". They go on to say, ""we get our energy from oil and coal"". @CAPS5 according to scientists like Boy say that oil is the primary source for big corporations. It is, but they don't keep in mind the fact that over a million animals die each year because of it. And it depletes the protection we get from our ozone layer, speeding the development of climate change. ""Without advances in technology we would have a better and safer earth for generations to come. Oh sure, says Sue sarcastically. But since you're texting her you don't know what she's thinking and ask her out properly. If not for advances in technology people could make better decisions. @PERCENT4 of texters say they have misinterpreted others texts. This means bad decisions all across the world. @PERCENT1 also say have participated in some form of sexting like sending pictures in a language. Underage children are participating in illegal activity because of advances in technology. The chief of crimes in the police department in @ORGANIZATION1 says that ever since the invention of the cell phone with the ability to send pictures & text he has seen @NUM6 more cases on child pornography. @PERCENT5 of @CAPS5 people are under the age of without the advances of technology for cellphones this wouldn't even be possible for minors. Advances in cellular device has also kept families farther and farther apart. @PERCENT6 of parents say that their children have had less appreciation and respect that they had before they received cell phones. And @PERCENT1 of kids who have cell phones say they don't think they need their family interaction anymore. Do you believe this is the message to be sent to future generations? I thank you for reading this article and I hope you are now experiencing the other side of the debate. Children need to interact with their families more, enjoy nature and start exercising. This is impossible to do with the advances of technology."
1247	1251	1	3	There are all kinds of computers, but they all do the same fundamental thing. Computers help people with anything they need. Such as, you can go online and chat with people from all over the world, sharing ideas and experiences. You can buy and sell things with just a few clicks, saving you time and effort. You can go to college online, accessing courses and resources that were once out of reach. You can learn anything, from complex scientific theories to simple DIY projects, and it helps you type up your homework neatly, presenting it in a professional manner. I personally think that computers are very helpful and we are lucky to have them. Going online can give you so many opportunities for anything. From going to college online when you don't have the time to go in person to just talking to your friends in real - time. You can learn just about anything on the computer and it's just so much fun. The computer to most people I know is the greatest invention besides the obvious ones. Going to college online is so easy. There isn't a lot to it. A lot of people in the country study online for college. For instance, parents that want to go back but can't go in person or someone who has a lot of work but can't fit in the time to actually go to college. But they can go online and take classes on their free time, at their own pace. Also, talking to friends online is fun too. When you aren't at a friend's house you can chat with them online. Maybe you can go on @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 or @CAPS3 or even your email. There are many ways to do it on that fabulous computer. The computer is also jam - packed with loads of information that is helpful to anyone in the world. You can learn about different countries, their cultures, people, or even the recipe of apple pie. Who knows what you can learn. The computer has things for every person in the world. Since we are all different. Some of us like to buy or sell things on the computer or do our homework. Maybe even just a fun computer game is nice. Every person in the world is different, but we have one thing in common. The world knows we need computers and computers are the smartest thing since the calculator. Buying and selling things on the computer is easier than it looks. All you have to do is put what you want to sell online or look online what you want to buy. Then you buy it or sell it. There is more to the process like the @ORGANIZATION1 people bring or take it to or away from you. But that's just the basics. You can also do your homework neatly on the computer if you have messy handwriting. Therefore, the computer has so many things that can benefit you and the world with everything it has to offer.
1248	1252	1	3	To whom it may concern, @CAPS1. My name is @PERSON1. I have written in response to the letter sent to me on the topic of electronics. Computers, to be precise. To me, computers are helpful, yet extremely vile. These chunks of metal are expensive, unhealthy and degrading human learning capabilities. Computers have too many negative features for me to cope with. Dell, @ORGANIZATION1, and so many other computer companies sell computers at ridiculously expensive prices. You buy one on sale and when you need your computer, suddenly, it malfunctions and problems assault you. Now you have to call a repair man who will charge you even more money! Did you really spend your hard - earned cash on a faulty hunk of trash? This is ridiculous. I went onto my computer yesterday and what do you think happened? It crashed! My six - hundred - dollar computer crashed! Computers are too expensive to keep having to deal with. When I get rid of mine, I'm not getting another. Have you ever sat at your computer so long your eyes watered and your neck ached? It's horrible to endure, that's not the only problem your computer can cause. Your health is at stake! When you sit at your computer working or playing instead of going out for a jog or exercise, your health degrades. Gaining weight, pink eye from staring at the screen, back pain from poor posture, do I have to go on!? The very computer you may love can harm you. I say, get rid of that computer. Visit friends, family and acquaintances. Be active and stay healthy. Not for me, but for you. The next point I am about to say may shock, surprise, or scare you. Your computer is making you stupid. I can't say it nicely. Don't call me rude because it's true. I'll give you an example. A student receives a classic homework assignment. Define these three or four words. Easy right? Wrong, I'm afraid @NUM1 out of @NUM2 kids surveyed go home and use computers to retrieve the answers to homework. What if your child is cheating? What will happen to them then? They could drop out of school early and live their lives as people who can't learn for themselves. Is that the world we want for kids? No! We should reduce our reliance on computers. Thank you for reading my paper. It was a pleasure as always to write to you. Have a nice day.
1249	1253	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I think that computers are bad because you will be reluctant to do no homework because people are playing too much on computers and they are getting addicted to the computers. It is dangerous because you might be talking to people that you don't know on the computer and it is very risky because it is the same thing as having a MySpace on the computer. It is very dangerous because there are bad people that go on the computer and post bad stuff on the computer. These strangers could potentially harm you, either emotionally or even physically. You might share personal information without realizing the consequences. And all those hours spent on the computer could be better used for studying, spending time with family, or engaging in physical activities. So, we should be very cautious when using computers and limit our time on them to avoid these negative impacts.
1250	1254	1	3	I do not agree that computers benefit society. There are three big reasons why computers are bad. People are getting too attached and aren't spending time with their families. Others are gaining weight because they stay on the computer and don't exercise. Also, some people aren't getting fresh air and aren't going out for a walk in a park. Computers are making people shut out their families. When a girl wants to play with her big sister, the big sister will just shut out the little sister and continue emailing her friends on the computer. Families need to stick together but when a member of the family is glued to the computer, it can prevent them from participating in a family picnic or other family activities. Computers have addictive games that a person will play and ignore everyone. Sometimes a family member can go into depression because he or she is being ignored. Another reason computers are bad is because of health issues. People will get too addicted and become lazy. They will just sit in the computer chair and eat and drink unhealthy stuff all day. People would gain weight and might even get diabetes from the weight. If people don't get the exercise they need to stay healthy then they might have heart problems, and many more serious conditions. If your weight gets to an extreme level then you might not be able to lose weight because your body has gotten too used to all the weight and your heart may not be able to take it. At last but not least, people will stop going outside and not go and walk or talk with friends. People should at least go outside once a day to see nature and get fresh air. They should go to the beach to relax and relieve all the stress from computer games. Having too much stress is bad for your health and you might go into depression. Being on the computer way too much can be bad. If you sit in the dark not getting sunlight it can be bad for your eyes, causing vision problems in the long run. So as you can see there are a lot of bad things about computers. Most of the problems or issues all have to do something with someone's health. So this is why I think this is bad for the society's benefits. I hope that you will take these reasons to heart and encourage a more balanced use of computers. Thank you!
1251	1255	1	3	Dear Newspaper, I read an article in the paper on @DATE1 debating whether or not computers have a positive or negative effect on people. Even though I love my computer, I'm well - aware that computers can have a bad effect on people. Computers can cause people to have a lack of physical exercise, a shortage of quality time with family and friends, and a failure to enjoy the beauty of nature. Although computers can assist people in numerous ways, they can also exacerbate people's situations. In @LOCATION1, the obesity rate has reached an all - time high of @PERCENT1. Using a computer is a sedentary activity, so if you spend a lot of time on it, you get no exercise. One time, I got so engrossed in playing on the computer for two whole hours that I later found I had gained two pounds. Your health is of utmost importance. When you become overweight, you face the risks of diabetes, high cholesterol, heart failure, liver failure, and more. My uncle is overweight and was just diagnosed with diabetes. Now, he deeply regrets all the time he dedicated to his computer. Lastly, some people in @MONTH1 claim that computers create great hand - eye coordination. Computers might achieve that, but is the hand - eye coordination ever put to practical use? No, because that person is too occupied playing on the computer. Can you see how computers can affect your health? Eighty - eight percent of @CAPS1 voted that the most important thing in their life was their family and friends. The other twelve percent said that their computer or cell phone was their most important thing in life because they couldn't live without it. Not spending time with your family and friends is truly an awful thing. When my mom lost contact with one of her new friends, she regretted not spending more time with them. Also, if you don't spend time with people, it could lead to socializing problems. If the only interaction you have is talking to people on the computer, you may develop speech problems. My neighbor, whom I've never had a proper conversation with, never really came out of his house. He always seemed to be on his computer, and no one ever visited. One day, someone came over and they started talking outside. When I overheard a bit of their conversation, I could tell he had trouble saying words and didn't have a good vocabulary. Lastly, you can also develop relationship problems, being unable to experience a real - life relationship. That is why computers can have a negative effect not only on you but also on your family and friends. In our daily lives, we should observe nature and its beauty. Spending time on the computer instead of enjoying nature is a pity. For example, if I were to not go outside for a whole day and only spend my time on the computer, I would feel miserable. Nature is a precious gift that should be accessible to everyone. Also, the @CAPS3 fresh air is beneficial for your body. Without breathing @CAPS3 fresh air, you would be inhaling chemically - changed air, which is not good for your well - being. Lastly, everyone reads about @CAPS4 global warming on the internet, but why don't we take action? If you spend all your time on the computer, you won't be able to help nature. I remember when I read about @CAPS4 global warming on the computer. So, I took action and cleaned our local lakes. That is why computers have a negative effect on people. Computers can be great in many ways, but it's the amount of time you devote to your computer that can be harmful. That is why computers have a negative effect on our society.
1252	1256	1	3	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, In the @DATE1, the world has undergone a remarkable transformation for the better. Technology has advanced significantly, and there are now new cures for various diseases. Computers are one of these remarkable benefits. They enable you to communicate much more quickly. You can keep in touch with family members and old friends. You can also interact with different people who live in another state, country, or even on a different continent. There is a well - known quote that says ""communication is key."" I'll elaborate on this in more detail in my next paragraph. I remember one time long ago, when the only ways to communicate were by writing letters or physically walking to meet someone. Now, with computers, with just one click of an email or an instant message, someone can receive your message promptly. Sending a letter can take a considerable amount of time. Even if you call someone, they might not be home or answer the phone in @MONTH1. But you can receive emails and instant messages at any time. Moreover, it doesn't cost anything to send long - distance messages. This brings me to my next topic. A professor at @ORGANIZATION2 once said ""Computers are taking time."" But, if you think about it, what computers are actually doing is reconnecting you with family members and old friends. For example, you might move and not be able to see them again. Then, you get a new phone number and forget other people's numbers. If you have a computer, you can go on this great social networking site where you can look up the names of some old friends and distant relatives. You find out that it's really them, and then they introduce you to other family members. Before you know it, you're all connected again. Now, I'll move on to my @DATE1 topic. The world wide web is a vast place where people from all over the globe gather. On the world wide web, you can meet new people who don't live in your state or country. When you meet this person, they might be of a different race. That's okay because you can learn new things about a different culture. While you two might have something in common, you can also share other things you like to do and try them out. So, you're learning something new while having fun at the same time. Now, you can see that it's time you get a computer rather than never having this wonderful experience. With a computer, you can communicate more quickly, reconnect with distant relatives and old friends, and also talk to different people who share your interests."
1253	1257	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, As you know, computers are a major part of our society. Ever since the first computer was invented, they have been improved so much that now you don't even need a keyboard in some cases. Having computers benefits our society because it allows us to learn about technology and develop memorization skills when we start to type frequently. You have the opportunity to learn about things you're interested in. And as a plus, you can communicate with people from all over the world. Every day, you can learn something new! Teachers always say that learning a lot now will benefit you in the future. Well, computers can make that happen. You can learn about how a computer is made and the viruses it can encounter. Computers can also teach you in unexpected ways. When you sit at a computer and type, you start to memorize the positions of certain letters, numbers, and punctuation marks. Now, you might ask, what about the little kids? How do they learn from computers? There are millions of games available for kids to help them learn even before pre - school. In fact, @PERCENT1 of all kids who start off playing educational games before entering pre - school are ahead of their peers. How great is that? Both kids and adults use computers. For kids, when they go on computers, they're doing things they enjoy. For example, my brother is really into parkour. Parkour is when a group of people do flips off of buildings, walls, or any structures they can find. When he goes on the computer, he looks up different parkour tricks he can do or learn. For adults, they use it for work. They might have to look up information for a meeting they're going to have or a business they're dealing with. Using computers can be fun for some and a necessity for work for others. But either way, they're using computers in a way that can be beneficial in the long run. Communication is one of the main reasons people use computers. There are email, @CAPS3, Twitter, Facebook, MySpace, and so many more platforms. If you were to ask ten random people on the street if they have a Facebook account, @PERCENT2 of them will say yes. Communication is crucial when it comes to businesses and relationships. For relationships like family and friends, having a computer to talk to them when they're far away is wonderful. Even for businesses, using those internet communication tools allows you to inform people if you're going to be late. Computers have been and will always be a huge part of our society. They help us in various ways such as learning, communication, and work. Knowing that this technology can help us succeed is truly great.
1254	1258	1	3	Dear readers, On the current debate about the effects of computers, I firmly believe that they strongly benefit all people. For example, on some computers, business software can be installed, allowing a meeting to be held over the computer. Not only is it convenient, but it also saves money. Also, computers come with built - in programs that can help you keep track of your expenses. These programs are user - friendly and save a lot of time. Plus, computers also help you stay in touch with friends. Even if they are @NUM1 miles away, you can simply click a button and have a live video chat! First off, the business software on new computers is truly remarkable. You can create a brochure of sales and expenses with just a few easy clicks of the mouse. This is a more cost - effective and environmentally friendly way of presenting ideas. Furthermore, on the computer, you and all your clients can have a conference call. Doing this allows you to relax and multitask while your computer provides you with crystal - clear sound coverage of the call. Normally, you'd have to keep a phone glued to your ear, but now you're hands - free. Another situation where computers are extremely handy is at tax time. Tired of rummaging around your house to find your car bill from three months ago? Well, with a spreadsheet software like @ORGANIZATION1, taxes can be calculated along with their names. So, when you take the taxes to a tax consultant, everything is neatly organized. Using these tools reduces stress and leaves you less frustrated. And even better, you can buy a tax program for your computer, so you never have to leave your couch! Think about it, paying someone to calculate your taxes year after year when you can save a fortune and do it yourself. Above all, computers help you connect with old friends who have moved away or drifted apart earlier in life. Now, the internet contains many popular social networking sites, such as @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and @CAPS3, where you can reunite with lost pals. These networks also offer photo - sharing and chat features, so everyone can see how your family is doing and vice versa. Along with this is video chatting, where you can have a face - to - face conversation with someone even on the other side of the world. This is completely private, so it's not dangerous to mention the names of family members or their locations. The internet truly is an amazing tool! To conclude, the internet plays a very important role in our daily lives. Not only can we keep up with events like the @ORGANIZATION2 game, but it also has powerful interactive business softwares. Work will never be as difficult as it used to be. Also, the computer has programs to help you manage your expenses, keeping you on top of your financial situation. Finally, it is also extremely helpful for all the tools that can be used to interact with friends thousands of miles away. I believe the computer is essential for success and happiness in life. It's a new age, and we should adapt to it.
1255	1259	1	3	To whomever this may concern, Just imagine @CAPS1 your life without a laptop or a desktop computer. It would be chaotic, right? How would you keep up with your emails or type articles for this very newspaper? Even though some people might believe that computers are taking away from exercise, enjoying nature, and spending time with family and friends, computers actually have a positive effect on us. The list of reasons why is extensive, but three that stand out are that you can communicate with people in other states or countries more efficiently, it's more interesting to learn from a website than from a textbook, and eventually, @CAPS2 will be fully computerized. Am I right? Have your old teachers ever assigned you a pen pal in another state or country? If so, didn't you have to write letters and wait at least @NUM1 weeks before your pen pal wrote back? If you had used computers, you would've gotten a response within days. I know many parents and other adults might think that emails are a waste of time, but actually, they're much faster than letters will ever be. Has your daughter or son ever told you that reading from a textbook is boring? Whether your answer is yes or no, that's where computers come in. It's far more interesting to use the internet than to read from a book. I understand that some students can read from a book and retain all the facts they've learned. However, various students learn differently. If a student learns from the internet, they're more likely to remember the information because they won't be bored to sleep by a textbook. Many people have mentioned, and some statistics show that by at least @DATE1, @CAPS2 will be computerized. Do you seriously want to be the last one left behind? I wouldn't. I understand that you're a person who likes to keep up with current events, so why not use your computer more often? When they say @CAPS2, they mean every aspect of @CAPS2. They even have @CAPS3 advanced tools on the computer. So, I encourage you to take a survey of how many people find computers effective, and you'll be surprised by the results. Many people will share the same opinion as I do. The choice is yours. Which side are you on? Thank you for considering these points.
1256	1260	1	3	Dear local newspaper, my name is [Full Name] in the [Grade] grade in [School Name] in [Location]. I'm writing to you because I heard that more and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. In my opinion, I think it benefits society. If you keep reading, I will explain why it benefits society. My first reason is that computers have a positive effect on people. For example, when I see my older brother go on the computer, he looks much smarter using it. That [Number] out of [Total Number] members of my family learn things from the computer. My second reason is that it teaches hand - eye coordination. For example, when I play games on the computer, my hands are the ones doing everything for me. (For instance, when I watch the game, my hands are rotating). [X] of [Total Number] of humans play games on the computer and let their hands do everything. My third reason is that it gives people the ability to learn. For example, when I was using the computer, it used to teach me so much that I go on it most of the time. [Number] of [Total Number] students study on computers and they learn about things that they never knew. Also, they have the ability to learn more on the computer. Some people might say people are spending too much time on their computers. However, I say that computers help people learn about things that happen in the world. For example, they could learn about the war that is going on and how people are risking their lives for this cause. In conclusion, in my opinion, it benefits society. Computers have a positive effect, they teach hand - eye coordination, and they give people the ability to learn. I think you should put all your support behind this cause.
1257	1261	1	3	Have you ever had someone move away and you wanted to keep in touch? Well, having a computer allows this to happen. Moreover, it gives students the opportunity to learn about different places, people, and much more. But why do some people not embrace them? First, computers allow you to talk online with friends and family. For example, using email, instant messaging, and video chat. For instance, I have a friend who moved away and now we email back and forth to keep in touch. Instant messaging allows people to chat instantly and upload pictures and videos. For example, my [Relative] shares pictures of my baby cousins so people can see how they're growing up. Lastly, some businesses use a webcam to talk to other people. Say the boss is on a trip but wants to see how his employees are doing without being there. He could hook up a webcam and have a conversation with them. That is how computers allow people to stay connected. Additionally, computers enable people to learn about things. For example, if a student has to make a project on a topic, they could type the topic into a website like Bing or Google and they could find all the answers they needed to help them with their project. Also, if a family wanted to go on a vacation, they could search for it and find a hotel and sites they might want to see. That is how computers allow people to plan their trips. They also help with writing so that the reader can read their handwriting. Moreover, they help pay taxes. For example, TurboTax is an online program that allows people to pay taxes online and it remembers every tax you have paid. So if some company sends you a notice saying you haven't paid a bill, you can go on TurboTax and check. So, reader, these are some ways why people should enjoy computers. They allow people to talk to friends and family by email, instant messaging, and video chat by webcam. They also give people the ability to learn information about far - away places and people. Lastly, what is so bad about having a computer? They allow people to pay taxes online and type papers. Computers are needed in this day and age or else some people would not be able to survive without them. So, reader, these are some reasons why people should readily embrace computers.
1258	1262	1	3	Dear local newspaper, Have you ever noticed how a lot of people are always on their laptops or their computers? Well, when they're on the web, they don't get any exercise at all. I have three reasons why people should spend less time on their computers. People could get sick, probably forget a lot of stuff, and never have the future that they have always wanted. My first reason why people should spend less time on their computer is that people could get sick. For example, there are a lot of people who just eat and eat and only use their computers. Some people get obese by doing this. When they do, they go on the internet to find out how to lose weight, but they never actually do it. Some people go on the internet to look for a way to have a surgery because they're so fat. They think there is a cure for obesity on the internet, but the truth is that the only cure is by doing some exercise because that is the only cure they will get if they're not on their computer. When people are surfing the web, they forget a lot of stuff. Some people almost spend their whole day or even their life on their computer that they don't know what else to do but surf the web. What I have seen happen is that some people forget where they're at or who they even are. They also forget who their family is and never contact each other at all. This isn't good, people. My third and final reason is no future. Sure, some people apply for jobs at home from the computer, but the only problem is that they don't get enough exercise and aren't paid as well as the people who work outside their house. Some people wanted to do something about their lives and can't because they are addicted to their computers. Some people have to go to therapy so they can stop going on the internet. Do you want that? Getting sick, loss of memory, and no good future are three reasons why people should stop using computers and start getting some exercise. If I were addicted to my PC, I wouldn't get an education and I wouldn't be writing this letter right now. Get some exercise. Together we can make a change or find a cure for this computer - addiction problem.
1259	1263	1	3	Dear [Organization], I think that more people should start using computers. They can offer things that just writing things down on a piece of paper can't, like being able to learn about things that aren't taught in school, you can talk with friends online, and you can keep everything in one place. The first reason I think more people should use computers is that they can learn about things that aren't taught in school. Such as current events, the history of our nation, and how our government works. Now some people can argue that you can learn about current events on TV or a newspaper. But the computer can give you the news in an article and then show you it in a video. Also, in my opinion, the news from the internet is visually less condensed than on TV. Another reason I think more people should use computers is that you can talk with friends over the internet. This is great because there might be people you haven't seen in a while because they moved. I had a friend who moved to Pittsburgh when I was [Age] and when I got a [Social Media] account, I was able to find him and talk with him before his visit. Or you can just keep in touch with friends that go to a different school. The last reason I think people should use computers is that you can keep pictures, videos, documents, and contacts on your hard drive. This is important because I am not very well - organized when it comes to school. But I started using my laptop and started to do some of the work on the computer. This helped me be less cluttered and keep all my work in one place. It also means you can email that work to a teacher or share notes with a friend who might have missed school that day. So, in conclusion, these are the reasons why I think we should have more people use computers. They can help you learn, let you talk with friends, and let you keep everything in one place. That is why I think more people should use computers to enhance their daily lives.
1260	1264	1	3	Dear [Recipient], Computers do not have a positive effect on people. Thanks to computers, people aren't being active as much, enjoying nature, or interacting with family and friends. One reason this is true is because people are not exercising; they're too busy playing on the computers. People are gaining weight, which is already a problem in [Location] because of unnecessary technology. There are plenty of sports that could be done, such as soccer, baseball, football, and so many more. People seemed to manage fine without computers and were a lot more active before them. Another reason computers don't have a positive effect on people is because they don't go out and enjoy nature. People spend too much time looking up beautiful places and animals when they could easily go explore around outside! Take a walk by the forest or in a local park, even by the beach, and you'll see loads of animals. Not to mention, the immense amount of different plants and flowers they have never noticed right behind their very own home! Without computers, people could quickly start enjoying nature more often. Thirdly, a reason why computers aren't positive on people is because they're not interacting with other people. Some people are too busy on Facebook or MySpace, emailing or messaging each other. Sometimes they aren't even talking to who they believed they were. It's not only dangerous but unhealthy also. What's wrong with giving someone far away a call? You can actually hear their voice and know it's them on the other line! It's ridiculous how people will email a friend that's down the street. It would be much simpler and healthier to just walk over to their house. The two of you can chat and take a walk, or play a game, not just sit in front of a screen the whole day. Computers make interacting with other people, in person, a lot more difficult. With computers, people are not active enough, don't enjoy nature often, or interact with others as much. They simply are not a positive effect on people. You should also agree and let computers stay in the hands of professionals for work - related purposes rather than for excessive personal use.
1261	1265	1	3	Dear editors, I was planning on taking a trip to @LOCATION1. With just a simple click on my computer, I found detailed directions within a second. Computers are truly great, people - friendly pieces of equipment. However, as technology rapidly evolves, people are increasingly relying on their computers for entertainment. Some people in @MONTH1 might disagree, but there are numerous outdoor activities that are far healthier than sitting around on the computer all day. For instance, socializing with friends in person, enjoying the beauty of the great - outdoors, and participating in various sports. Familiar with @CAPS1, it is a well - known program for socializing, but there are significant dangers. Did you know that anybody can view your profile, which contains sensitive personal information? You don't always have to chat online. You can call up a friend and hang out at a local movie theatre. Many people, and I wholeheartedly agree, think seeing a movie with their pals is a lot more entertaining than playing online chess or any other virtual game with a friend. Are you a fan of movies? No problem! You can go on a walk or a bike ride, or even walk your dog while riding a bike! There are so many options. @ORGANIZATION1 park is an amazing place to spend your vacation. You can have camp - outs at @TIME1 and go biking during the day. It's a wonderful part of nature, and it's one of the best parks anywhere in the world! Camping out on the weekend is a great way to become closer with your family and friends. Hiking is a popular activity in parks and can be enjoyed by people of all ages. So, go out and spend a weekend in the great outdoors, away from the computer screen. Soccer, baseball, basketball, and lacrosse are just some of the many fun sports out there. Yes, they are certainly fun and healthy. Every town I know about has sports fields where kids and adults of all ages gather to play. It's also a great way to make friends! Get to know them in person and not over the internet. Daily exercise while having fun beats just having fun on a computer. What are you waiting for? Stop reading this article and go out and meet new friends. Visit a local park or play a sport for fun. If I were to name everything to do other than use a computer, it wouldn't fit in this entire newspaper. So, go explore and enjoy the real world!
1262	1266	1	3	Guess what! Do you like to use computers? Well, I do, and I think it benefits society for a couple of important reasons. It is extremely useful to use a computer to get information on various things, to meet new people, and to explore the vast expanse of the internet. If you keep on reading @CAPS1, I'll tell you why I think that. One reason I believe it benefits society is that in this fast - paced lifetime, you need to know what is going on in the world. Instead of always watching the news on TV or reading a newspaper, you can simply go on the internet and see what's happening from the comfort of your home. That's why I think it benefits society today. A second reason is that having a computer allows people to talk over the web and meet new people. You can communicate with family members and friends that you haven't seen or heard from in a long time. And if you don't have their phone number, you can still talk to them when they are online. A third reason is that if you have a computer and are constantly using it, you can explore the internet and get facts on people, things, and places that you never knew about. By going on the internet, you can learn more things that you never knew before. A fourth reason is that by having a computer, you can attend school on the internet. You don't have to leave your house because you can take classes from there. By doing that, most people could stay out of trouble as they are not leaving their homes. Unfortunately, I have to end this letter. But with all the reasons and details I've given you on why I think having a computer is a good idea, I hope you will agree with me on why I think that.
1263	1267	1	3	In my opinion, I think computers have a positive effect on people. Computers enable you to communicate with people from anywhere in the world with ease. You can learn about different places much faster than you would if you were to read a book. Also, many more jobs these days require people to have computer skills. Moreover, using a computer is both fun and educational. Can you imagine how much harder it would be to communicate with someone who lives in, let's say @LOCATION1? It would be a lot more difficult, don't you think? Well, thanks to computers, it is as easy as turning on your device. Many teachers enjoy doing activities with pen - pals. That would be a lot harder if you had to write letters. It would also cost a lot more money to call. Also, if you were looking for specific information about Florida, it is a lot easier on a computer. You just type in what it is you are looking for, rather than reading through tons of books, in which case you might not even find what you are looking for. Also, the computer has access to millions of pieces of information. The computer also has various pictures, which is also very helpful. Another good reason is that many more jobs these days want to hire someone who knows how to work with computers. You can do a lot more things on a computer that you can't do on a piece of paper. For example, you can make animated movies and video games. These things have evolved significantly over the years thanks to computers. Finally, my last reason is that it's not only educational but also fun. Sure, you can research information and do your homework on the computer, but you can also play games. Computers can do all sorts of different things. Computers can be programmed to have simulations for jobs like policemen, ambulance drivers, and doctors. These are all things that save lives. That is why I think computers have a positive effect on people. Without computers, our country probably wouldn't be as advanced and evolved as it is today.
1264	1268	1	3	People use computers every day. There are so many reasons why they're always on them. They could be talking to one of their family relatives, sharing stories and catching up on each other's lives. Also, they're probably looking for jobs, browsing through various job portals and submitting applications. There are many things people do on computers, and others shouldn't tell them what to do with their lives. Many people in @LOCATION1 use the computer to talk to one of their old friends and catch up on things. Also, they could be talking to one of their family relatives. There's a thing called a webcam, and people in @LOCATION1 use it so they can see one another, making the conversation more personal. Business people are always on the computer because they need to print out important documents and they probably have to send something to another country. Business people also do lots of work on the computer, such as creating presentations and analyzing data. They can still exercise in @TIME1 for a quick jog, but it's also their choice if they want to stay healthy or not. After all, they're busy people. On the other hand, people who go on the computer and are not business people, not talking to family members or old friends, are students and parents. Tons of students in @LOCATION1 have projects every day and they have to be on the computer to look up information for their projects. Parents, on the other hand, also help out their children with their studies and they also talk to their relatives or are looking for a new home or job. If all those people are busy, let them do the work they want or need to do. Once they're done, they could exercise, but if they don't want to and other people tell them to go for a walk or do something healthy, then it's their loss. We can't force them. They're just getting better at using the computer every day, and it's not affecting us; it's affecting them. However, if they want to be on the computer all the time, they're also likely to get bad eyesight because of too much exposure to the screen light.
1265	1269	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1 of the @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS2 has come to my attention that several people are concerned with the technology boom and computer overuse. I can assure you that technological upgrades are only harming our people. Email and @CAPS3 @CAPS4 have only led to a decrease in our already poor communication skills. Furthermore, we spend less and less time exercising outside because we are trapped in a technology revolution filled with inaccurate information. Why are we hurting ourselves instead of helping? @CAPS2 is very clear that our teens are growing up with no proper communication skills. I remember reading a persuasive essay and realizing that they used @CAPS3 @CAPS4 - based language. @CAPS2 is ridiculous that we are forgetting how to use the proper grammar of the @CAPS7 language. Furthermore, I have also observed that when my friends talk, they use slang terms like ""@CAPS8"" and ""@CAPS9"". I understand that computers offer a faster and much easier way to communicate, but we definitely can't forget the importance of proper language use. With the prevalence of computers, people who should be concerned about their health hope that they don't become a biggest loser contestant, say @CAPS2. But, if they continue to be glued to their computers, then they will join the millions of obese Americans. I think that when people sit at their computers, they tend to bring junk food with them. In contrast, spending these hours with @ORGANIZATION2 instead of just sitting in front of a screen, exercising and letting your creativity run wild, would be a much better choice. Would a citizen rather pay for a computer or enjoy the vast, free, and gorgeous nature? Furthermore, people are wasting their important attention. A fact is that over three - quarters of the information on the internet isn't reliable. Also, statistics show that nearly @PERCENT1 of students use unreliable online sources. These statistics also display that when students use these sites, they clearly will score lower than a student who did the seemingly ""daunting"" task of looking for the research in a textbook. What is so daunting about @CAPS2? Obviously, nothing is overwhelming. @CAPS2 is only a pleasure when the student will get a phenomenal grade and their surrounding classmates won't. Furthermore, I ask you why are people flooding their brains with unreliable information? In conclusion, the effects computers have on people are very negative. Due to this, many people have no communication skills. They are also more likely to become obese, and if that's not enough, they are hurting themselves because they are obsessed with inaccurate information. I urge people to dump @PERSON1 and @CAPS11. PC and start seeing @ORGANIZATION2 Nature! She's beautiful, and she offers so much more than a computer screen ever could."
1266	1270	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, I believe that computers have the coolest effect on people. They allow people to develop excellent hand - eye coordination, enabling them to precisely control the cursor on the screen and perform various tasks. Moreover, they let people learn about far - away people and cultures by accessing a vast amount of information on the internet. People can also communicate online through e - mail or instant messaging. All of these reasons prove to be positive incentives to use the computer. You will need computer skills in various jobs, and what better time to start learning than now. Hand - eye coordination is a crucial skill in life. You need it in jobs such as graphic design, where you have to accurately place elements on the screen, and in daily activities like typing. For example, in an office, you have to watch the keyboard while typing quickly and accurately. Online communication is very popular today. @CAPS6, @CAPS2, and @CAPS3 are only a few of many websites where people can communicate through instant messaging or e - mail. All of these sites allow you to find family members, friends, and many more. You can keep in touch with a friend that is out of state, or you can talk with a person from another country! Many people do this in their spare time to try and set up a reunion with people they knew from middle school through college. Tons of these people have not seen each other since @NUM1. So as you can see, contacting people through the internet is widely used by many people in our world today. So as you can see, I support the use of computers, and I feel they are critical to people's daily lives. Whether they are building hand - eye coordination, researching a country, or contacting family and friends through @CAPS3, @CAPS2, @CAPS6, the internet is highly valued, and I hope you feel the same way.
1267	1271	1	3	The computer is a great achievement of man. It is very useful for quickly finding information, and it has many other capabilities. Even though computers are a very useful tool in the modern world, they have a negative impact on people. People aren't getting enough exercise because they are always sitting in front of the computer. Along with that, they are becoming less socially active. The most significant and probably the most negative effect is the excessive amount of freedom people get on the internet. Exercise is one of the most important things for a long and healthy life. People should be taking at least a long walk every day. If people are sitting in front of a computer all day, there will be many more health problems. People should strive for a healthy lifestyle, not be surrounded by computers all the time. People are also losing the ability to interact face - to - face. Life is becoming dull. Everyone is either texting someone or chatting online. The biggest surprise is that there is online dating. This is horrible because you might be dating some crazy person. If someone thinks they're in love and when the couple meets, they don't know how to interact, then there is a real problem. Even when you are just on the computer, you could use that time to socialize with friends and family. Last is the enormous amount of freedom that anyone has with computers. There are lots of bullies, people who want to sell you stuff, and people who want your personal info. Many kids sign up for something like Facebook, but they're not careful. They put stuff like their address and don't pay attention to who is sending them friend requests. Computers have too many negative effects on people. It would be great if somehow the system could be improved, and people need to be more responsible. People should want to get out and interact. Take a walk. Just don't let computers control your life, as it's essential to maintain a balance between the virtual and real world.
1268	1272	1	3	Have you ever had a computer? I'm sure if you're around my age, you know how fun it is to explore the internet. It's like a vast brain that gives you information about everything. But, it's not good for you to just drop everything and go to your computer. Things like exercise, socializing, and homework matter a great deal. If you don't exercise, you begin to gain weight. If you don't socialize, you'll become a lonely person. Homework is the most important, because it'll help you succeed well through life. It's fine to go on the computer from time to time, but not for hours on end. Exercising will keep you in shape, and if you plan on playing sports, you should jog a couple of times a day. Some people make you feel bad if you're bigger than they are. For example, I knew someone who was a little big for his age, but people didn't like him and they always made fun of him. I would suggest that you should keep your mind on more important things than a computer. Do you have any friends? Or did all of them leave you because you wouldn't stop surfing the web on your computer. As a teenager, you should be socializing with your friends at the movies, arcades, and parties. Not in the house on the computer. Especially with your family, because you never know if they're going shopping for you. Ask me, that's selfishness. Every since you got your computer, have you been receiving bad grades? Education is the most important thing you need in your life. Without it, you can't be or do anything, because you wouldn't have a degree to get a job. If you don't have a job, how can you pay for the electricity bill for your computer? Education can take you anywhere, if you want it. If not, you could end up being a homeless person in the street holding a computer that doesn't work. Do you still think this has a positive effect on people? You should talk to parents about getting their child a computer. For example, tell the parent to put a password that only she/he knows, that way the child has to ask you to sign onto it every time they need it. Block off things that you think are inappropriate for your child, especially if your child is curious about certain adult - related content. That is why I don't think computers give people the right kind of effect they might need. We should all focus on the real - life aspects that matter most.
1269	1273	1	3	"Dear newspaper, imagine feeling @CAPS1 the fresh air that cools your skin and the wind blowing through your hair while you are running side by side next to your best friend. And then you think about the millions of people who spend their time chatting on the computer. You also wonder about the amount of exercise those people would get, and whether they would be able to interact with friends and family members effectively. Just think about your current lifestyle. Is it occupied with computers or is it free and full of outdoor activities? When you think about chatting to people, do you think of communicating in person or communicating by AIM? I have surveyed friends and found that five out of ten go home and chat to friends online. This upset me because this half mainly had kids that did not play sports but yet they were very talkative. So, there is a problem here that I still have yet to find out. I asked questions like ""what do you do at home?"", ""are you a computer geek?"". (@CAPS2 questions were only used to support my survey) The next time you are asked to chat online, please decline before you become obsessed with the computer. The amount of exercise a person gets depends on who it is. There are some who live on their computers, like the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 (a Comcast commercial), and some who don't know what a computer is (not making a judgment). I am here to teach about the benefits of exercising and not the unnatural ways of a computer. Did you know people can lose weight by exercising? If you just pick up that old curling weight, one curl is ten times as beneficial as a click of a computer mouse. Don't believe me? Try it. Interacting with people is a big part of our life. It's how we get information, give orders, and it's a much faster type of communication than sending an email. Without interacting with one another, we can suffer from depression. Depression can make people sick. For example, my father, when @CAPS5 was divorced, the depression affected his body and mind. At the age of @NUM1, @CAPS5 got a rip in his small intestine that grew infected and could have ended his life. I believe this was due to a lack of communication, and this happens every day to many people. Just open your eyes and realize what a computer can do to a man or woman. (@CAPS5 was remarried to Bonnie and now carries a scar on his belly). This is a movement that should change the opinion of many. Do people spend too much time on computers? Just get outside and talk to your neighbor and see what they think. Let's all make a change and reduce our computer time for a healthier and more social life."
1270	1274	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2, some people do spend most of the day on the computers, but not everyone. Oh, let me start by saying no. Not all people take advantage of the computer. For instance, scientists rely on computers to conduct complex research and analyze data. Banks use computers to manage accounts and ensure secure transactions. Schools use them to provide educational resources and conduct online classes. These types of computer applications help us through life. Without these computers, we would still be clueless about a lot of things. But, there are people out there who do misuse the computers. They engage in unforgivable acts like child porn. One of our main problems in the world is child porn, and it is often associated with kidnapping. In rare cases, the parents are the cause of it. So, there are a lot of changes that need to be made. If we can address these issues and clear up the negative aspects, then the computer world will be peaceful once again. We should all work together to ensure that the power of computers is used for good and not for harm.
1271	1275	1	3	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I understand that some experts are saying people are spending too much time on computers, and I couldn't agree more. I'm writing to you today to tell you my opinion on the effects computers have on people in terms of their time usage, what they are doing, and the concept of ""computer dead."" If you will please continue reading, I would like to share with you my thoughts. Computers today are consuming our world. People are spending way too much time on the computer. I believe they should set a timer on how long they are on the computer. Let's say they set a @NUM1 - hour limit, then once it's up, they have to get off. I think this would help because if we're spending too much time inside, we're not going to be able to get enough exercise, which isn't good for our health. Please continue reading to learn about how we should use the computer. Parents have to set a good example for kids. If parents use the computer @NUM2 hours a day, then their child will think it's okay to do so. If the child then starts spending all their time on the computer, then they won't be spending any time with their friends. Kids today need to spend more time outside than playing games on the computer. Also, the parents and child need to spend time together. If they are both on the computer, they can't spend quality time together. Please read on to learn about how we can avoid going ""computer dead."" ""Computer dead"" is a term I use when all we want to do is use the computer. We need to be healthy about our computer usage. If we aren't, then we could start to get withdrawals from the computer and then will spend even more time on it. If you go ""computer dead,"" then it will slowly start to take over our lives. I think if this does happen, it will be hard to get over it and stop using the computer. Please read on to finish reading my letter. Thank you for reading about how we need to manage our time issues, how we use the computer, and the concept of ""computer dead."" I hope you will consider my thoughts. Thank you again for your time spent reading this."
1272	1276	1	3	Dear editor, I agree that people do spend too much time on their computers. And if you read this, you would see my reasons why. One of them will be about exercising. The other two will be about your friends and family. So read my reasons, and by the end, I hope I made my point. All right, like I said, first we will talk about the lack of exercise because of always being on the computer. Did you know that from being on the computer all the time, you lose focus on exercising anymore? If you're eating an unhealthy diet and not exercising because you're worried about the computer, the weight that you put on just doesn't burn off by itself. So by you not burning off that fat, you just keep gaining and gaining. By the time you know it, you'll be overweight and wish you didn't spend all that time on that computer. Now that I'm explaining about your lack of exercise, we're going to talk about your relationship with your family when you're on the computer all the time. For example, your family would want to go out, but you say no because of that computer. Parents would be disappointed because of your lack of communication with the family. I've got my two reasons across; let me get my third. If you're being on that computer, you've become addicted. But you not only lose contact with family but also with friends. You loving that computer so much, you probably quit all your sports teams like the basketball, softball, and more because you thought it took too much of your computer time. In the end, you would lose probably a lot of friendships. Even your boyfriend or girlfriend would dump you. So now that you read this, I hope I got my point out to you about what a computer can do to you in the end. In conclusion, it's clear that excessive computer use can have detrimental effects on our health, relationships, and social life. We should be more mindful of our computer usage to avoid these negative consequences.
1273	1277	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I am writing you this letter to inform you that computers do benefit society. Computers benefit society because we can learn about places we want to go. For instance, we can explore different cultures, attractions, and local customs of those places. It also benefits society because in a couple of years, everything will be computer - based. For example, our daily transactions, work, and entertainment will rely heavily on computers. However, computers benefit society because they make life easier nowadays. My opinion is that computers do benefit society. Computers help everyone a lot. First, we can learn about the places we want to go to. We want to learn about the places so we can travel there. However, when we know a lot about that place, we might want to buy our plane tickets through the computer site. Then after you get the plane tickets, you can go and discover the place. Second, in a couple of years, everything will be through computers. For example, our shopping, banking, and education will be conducted via a computer site (world - wide web). We will get our education online, and there will be various educational games online to enhance our learning. Computers do benefit society. Lastly, computers make life easier. They make life easier because instead of picking up a phone to call your friends or family, you can go online to talk. They also make life easier because instead of going to your family or friends' house, you can go on to AIM or whatever chat site you have and chat through instant messaging. In conclusion, computers do benefit society. First, you can learn about places you want to go to. Second, everything will be through computers in a couple of years. Lastly, computers make life easier. We should embrace the benefits of computers while also being aware of potential drawbacks.
1274	1278	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, my opinion on the effects computers have on people is that I think the computer is good for people, not great, but it's good for many reasons. For now, I have three reasons why it's good. My reasons are searching for new places and meeting new people, having something to do when people are bored, and dealing with teenagers who can't be without the computer. My first reason is about searching new places and meeting new people. People that have computers can go on Google and search for a place they want to go. There, they can join online forums or groups related to that place and meet new people. That way, they don't have to be on the computer that much as they will be too busy with their new friends. My second reason is when people have nothing to do. If people have nothing to do, they can always invite friends over and on the computer, they can watch movies without going to the movie theater and they don't have to pay. All you could do is download it from legal movie - sharing websites. And also, there are many websites that offer a wide variety of movies. My last reason is about how teenagers can't be without the computer. Teenagers are teenagers; they must have technology. If you take the computer away from them, they won't do anything else. That will be even worse because if you tell them to go outside, they won't do it. Maybe what you can do is let them use the computer but they can use it outside only if it's a laptop. This is my opinion on the effects computers have on people. In conclusion, while computers have their drawbacks, they also offer several benefits in terms of socializing, entertainment, and keeping teenagers engaged in a positive way.
1275	1279	1	3	"Computers benefit society. People can socialize online with anyone. You can use the internet to communicate with people all over the world. I talk with my pen - pal from @LOCATION2 almost all the time with video chat. The most popular websites today are social. For example, Facebook, MySpace, and Twitter. These days, @PERCENT1 of people have an account on at least one of these websites, and that number grows every day. Modern life has made video games a lot more social. @NUM1 in @NUM2 kids are playing with a friend they know while playing @CAPS1. By using computers, your hand - eye coordination will increase significantly. Key hand - eye coordination is used in a lot of sports. ""I don't know if I'd be as good of a tennis player without using a computer to boost my hand - eye coordination."" - @PERSON1. You can use hand - eye coordination to do stuff faster. I can copy notes so much faster because I can write and look at the board at the same time. Whether you realize it or not, hand - eye coordination is very important. Computers can improve hand - eye coordination by @PERCENT2. People can use computers to learn online. When you go on the internet, you can learn about cool places and plan vacations. For @DATE1 break, me and my dad used the internet to learn about @LOCATION1. We then decided to go there and bought tickets. You can learn about interesting people in history. There are over ten billion articles about famous people in history. On the internet, you can also learn new recipes if you are a cook. ""As an @ORGANIZATION1, I learned most of my cooking online."" - @ORGANIZATION1. Online, you can also learn how to improve your technique in sports. Before I joined the swim team, I looked up on the internet how to improve your swim technique. And that's how I qualified to go to @CAPS3 with my team because the internet improved my time by two seconds, which was enough for me to go. I believe the computer is an amazing invention that has tremendously impacted society. In conclusion, computers offer numerous benefits in terms of socializing, skill - building, and learning. We should continue to make the most of this powerful tool while also being cautious of its potential negative impacts."
1276	1280	1	3	Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, I firmly believe that computers bring immense benefits to society. The reasons for this belief stem from @NUM1 key aspects: Computers are an inexhaustible source of knowledge, there are numerous websites with active online communities, and using them is simply enjoyable. As we all know, computers offer a boundless well of knowledge. Adults often have to work on various tasks. For instance, when they need to research information for a project at work, a computer becomes an indispensable tool. Even school - going kids can utilize the computer's internet for school projects or homework. We all know that kids and teens especially love interacting with their friends. That's why most people sign up for online community websites. Although I'm well - aware of the threat of online pedophiles, we can mitigate this risk by only inviting real - life friends to join these platforms. Lastly, computers are a great source of fun. After a long and tiring day at school, kids like me enjoy coming home and relaxing by playing a nice game on the computer. It might seem like a lazy activity, but it serves as a pleasant distraction from daily stress. In conclusion, the endless knowledge, the vibrant online communities, and the pure fun that computers offer clearly demonstrate their positive impact on society.
1277	1281	1	3	"Do Computers benefit the society? Undoubtedly, computers bring significant benefits to the society. Computers offer kids a wealth of knowledge about things that would be difficult or impossible to experience in real life. Moreover, computers provide kids with positive self - esteem and entertainment. They also enable kids to interact with each other, just like on platforms such as Facebook or @CAPS1. There are numerous reasons why computers are beneficial to the society. When kids encounter a question they can't answer, they can turn to Google. This often helps them solve various problems. On Google or any other ""@CAPS2 @CAPS3"" search engine, kids can look up almost anything and are likely to get a reasonable answer. They can search for facts about other countries, famous people, and even different types of pets. Another advantage of computers is that they offer entertainment for kids, which can boost their self - confidence. Just because kids aren't going outside doesn't mean they can't have fun indoors. Parents always hope to see their kids socializing. With platforms like Facebook, @CAPS1, or @CAPS5, kids can make new friends in their town or even from other @CAPS6. The internet has the potential to achieve all these things. In conclusion, computers do benefit the society as they provide knowledge, facilitate new friendships, and allow kids to have a fulfilling childhood."
1278	1282	1	3	Dear newspaper editor, @PERCENT1 of @CAPS1 own and use computers on a daily basis. However, this widespread use of computers is having a detrimental impact on our nation, and we must put an end to this computer abuse. Millions of parents and kids spend at least @NUM1 minutes a day on the computer, either working or playing. There are many @CAPS2 games and other game types available on the internet, which kids use for entertainment. But it is completely unacceptable for an @NUM2 - year - old child to play games involving guns. Kids often get so engrossed in these addictive games that they forget about playing sports or going outside. As a result, they miss out on much - needed exercise and fresh air, which can lead to obesity or other weight - related issues. @PERCENT2 of @CAPS1 are already obese, so there's no reason to keep these harmful games available. @LOCATION1 definitely doesn't need more overweight kids. There are two ways to use a computer: for good and for bad. Good uses include planning a vacation, working at a job, or checking a child's grades online. Unfortunately, many kids and parents don't use computers for these positive purposes. Kids have been caught looking at porn, buying illegal drugs, hacking into systems, and engaging in other criminal activities. The computer allows people to do things they shouldn't while hiding their identity. For example, when I sign up for a website subscription to play a game, it asks for personal information like my name, address, phone number, etc. My mother has taught me to use false information to prevent computer hackers or fraud sites from stealing my personal details. We can't be sure that people don't use similar tactics with illegal programs. Computers pose a threat to @LOCATION1's well - being. In addition to obesity, there have been reported cases of children or parents having seizures, having game images imprinted in their eyes because they don't take their eyes off the screen, and even a child going mad and killing his/her parents in a fit of rage. Computers can turn kids and parents into unruly individuals. Parents often try to get their children to stop playing certain games. Sometimes, they destroy a website account or take away the computer for a while. These actions have led to kids going mentally unstable, with reported cases of smashing computers, performing poorly in school, killing parents, and even suicide. In conclusion, computers are a source of health, behavioral, and mental issues. If we want @LOCATION1 to regain its well - being, we, the people, must put an end to this computer addiction.
1279	1283	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1, in a recent poll, it was found that @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2 have used or come into contact with computers. @PERCENT2 of those @CAPS2 use computers daily, and not just for work. This extensive use of technology is causing a decline in their exercise habits. As a result, they also enjoy nature far less. Moreover, people are spending less time interacting with their family and friends, which is having a damaging effect on our society. Health professor @PERSON1 says, ""The biggest reason why people don't exercise is that they simply don't have the time."" This problem can be directly linked to the fact that, on average, @CAPS2 spend @NUM1 and a half hours a day on the computer. One might argue that they could be learning new things or expanding their knowledge. However, none of these activities help them stay healthy and in shape. Sitting in front of a computer all day does nothing good for the body. You might click on a link and see a beautiful hummingbird on your desktop screen. You can clearly see its beauty, but you can't feel the wonder or smell the fresh air it flies through. The computer can only show you nature; you have to log off and experience it firsthand to truly appreciate it. By watching nature on a screen, society is missing out on the real - world splendor. Computer enthusiasts claim that computers help you connect with people around the world. But what about the people right next to you? Computers may enable global communication, but they create a distance between you and the people at your job, school, or home. As human beings, we need real - life contact. Why limit ourselves to typing when we can have face - to - face conversations? In conclusion, extensive computer use does not benefit society. People will be less active, they will experience nature through a screen rather than in person, and they will communicate less with their loved ones in real life. It's time to take a stand and recognize that computers pose a threat to society."
1280	1284	1	3	I firmly believe that the technological advancements of the computer are more beneficial than harmful. For example, if you're struggling at school and need urgent help, you can rely on a computer. Or, if a dear friend moved to Florida a week ago, you can use the computer to stay in touch. Also, if you're eager to learn about the world, a simple Google search can provide you with a wealth of information. These are just a few reasons why the computer is a valuable tool. School is often a challenging activity for many students, but the internet can be a great help. For instance, if you're having trouble with geometry, you can visit @PERSON1 academy for informative videos. If you're a third - grade teacher dealing with energetic kids, you can go to @LOCATION1, an educational and fun website. You can also plug in earphones and listen to math help while relaxing. These are just a few ways the internet supports schooling. On a rainy day, when you're in the mood to learn about far - away places, the internet is the perfect solution. Think of the computer as a large, easily accessible library. Just type something into a search engine, and the information will appear. If you're in Germany and can't understand the @CAPS2 language because you're hungry, you can open your laptop for an easy translation. All these examples show that the internet makes it easy to learn about foreign places. Communication is also made incredibly easy with the internet. There are emails, Skype, chatrooms, etc. It's almost as if communication is the middle name of the internet. In case of an emergency when your phone is lost, you can use email to get in touch. If a burglar cuts the phone lines, you can still use email @NUM1. You can even use the internet to remind @PERSON2 to bring the red bull as they leave. In conclusion, the internet is excellent for communication, helps in learning about far - away places, and supports schooling. These are the reasons why I believe the internet is highly valuable in today's world.
1281	1285	1	3	The effects that I have on computers are good. I will be talking about things that help human nature with one technology, computers. For instance, how people can learn about far - away places, how it helps them with schoolwork and taxes, and how to communicate with those not around. Then, I'll draw a conclusion based on these three reasons. The effects of computers on me are very good. Because they help people learn about far - away places. Let's say a family is planning a vacation to @LOCATION1. And they don't know anything about it, so they go on a computer and can not only book a reservation for a hotel but also check out local attractions and reviews. My second opinion on computers is that if you have a project for school and need the right information that's not in books, you can go on a computer. Let's say you have to do taxes online because you're crippled (@CAPS1), so you might want to visit @NUM1 www.turbotax.com and have your taxes sorted right in front of your eyes. My overall opinion on computers is that if you have a friend or family member you lost contact with, go on the computer and find them. Then you guys can plan a day to catch up. Also, @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 guardians have issues about their child, they can confront the situation regarding the child. And finally, my last conclusion. That's what I feel about computers. We need them to communicate with other people, to do assignments for a job or school, or to learn about places we've never been to or would like to vacation to. And the reason why I feel like that is because I have a passion for computers. And I hope you like what I wrote. I hope I've persuaded you to like computers more.
1282	1286	1	3	Dear newspaper, Have you ever grabbed a nice cold cake and sat at your computer desk? I firmly believe I have, and computers do benefit society. One way computers benefit society is that it saves people from standing around a bookstore or library for hours at a time. Another way computers benefit society is by allowing people to chat with others all over the world. The last way that computers benefit society is that it teaches people hand - eye coordination. If you have ever been to a bookstore or library, you surely know how hard it is to find the book you're looking for. Instead of spending hours on your feet searching, you can go sit at your computer for ten minutes or less. On the computer, you can get information about anywhere or anything. For example, getting one book about @LOCATION1 is much easier online. Going to the library, experts say it helps people, and they've done many tests. People who use computers have better hand - eye coordination than those who don't. A doctor in a health magazine said that people who don't use computers aren't as coordinated. Being able to use a computer is a skill that helps your mind. As you can see, computers benefit society by helping people's hand - eye coordination, and they are truly a valuable asset to our daily lives.
1283	1287	1	3	To begin with, the learning ability people get from computers has improved. The vast digital source is very helpful to many people. The communication via computers is much easier than talking on the phone. I believe that computers benefit the society in many different ways. First of all, children and people at home and at school use computers for learning purposes. In some grades at school, there is a special typing program that helps improve typing skills. There are also hard - drive discs that you can play with to enhance your reading skills. It is just a way to make learning fun for young kids. Another great way to learn online is going to websites that have sample math problems and printing the sheets out to practice. They are excellent ways to aid learning. Secondly, the computer has many more ways to benefit someone. They are helpful for getting your local weather. In the winter, you can see if your school has cancelled in seconds. Often I get projects where it requires me to do research on a specific topic, and it is very easy to look up simple information. The computer also has different links that are helpful for writing a paper, making a PowerPoint presentation, and creating an Excel spreadsheet. All of those resources can either help graphing results for science class or even typing up a paper for @CAPS2. They are useful ways to make life easier. Lastly, computers tend to make communication a little easier. For me, when I'm out sick from school, I like to tell my teachers by emailing them and even asking if I can make up any work. Using Facebook, AIM, MySpace, and Skype are all fun and fast ways to communicate with friends. All of the websites pretty much do the same thing, but different people like different sites that their friends are on. You can email friends and family who live far away and even those nearby. It's a way to keep in touch. In conclusion, you have heard the different ideas, and I consider computers as a great benefit. It helps with learning, communication, and most of all, it enables us to do the important things that we need in our daily lives.
1284	1288	1	3	I believe that computers have a positive effect on people. The three reasons I think this are because computers enhance our hand - eye coordination, they give us the ability to research and find out information about a certain topic, and they also allow us to communicate with people who we are not able to see very often. Computers, in fact, increase our hand - eye coordination. The usage of both the screen and the keyboard allows us to look only at the screen while typing on the keyboard. Hand - eye coordination is an important skill to have when exercising by playing sports or working out, which is also important and very good for our bodies. If you want to apply for a job in, for example, an office, and you start stumbling and acting clumsy, then you would be looked at differently compared to if you were organized and knew what you were doing. This is why hand - eye coordination is important to people. Computers also have the amazing ability to search the world wide web. This gives us the ability to make millions of searches for any given topic. For example, in fifth grade, I did a research project on @LOCATION2. Without all the useful information I found on the computer, I would have never been able to learn everything I did. As most of the world already knows, there was a devastating earthquake in the small country of @LOCATION4. Computers were one of the ways that helped spread the word and get everyone to start helping and sending supplies and food to the victims. Also, if a family is thinking about going somewhere for a vacation, they can take care of most of the arrangements on the computer. They could buy flight tickets, book a room at the hotel, and even get a rental car for when they land. This is what my family did on our vacation to @LOCATION1, and everything turned out perfectly, all thanks to the computer and being able to do everything online. This is how the computer can help you research any topic. Lastly, you can use the computer to communicate with people that live far away and you rarely ever see. For example, my grandparents live in @LOCATION3, so I use video chat to talk to them since I only get the chance to see them once every two or three years. Also, when my dad goes on business trips to other states or even out of the country, we use instant messaging or video chat to keep in touch. Lastly, if you have friends or family who are fighting for America in @LOCATION5 right now, you can also use a video chat to communicate with them. So these are all my reasons why I believe computers have a positive effect on people. They help with hand - eye coordination, they give us the ability to research and find information on any topic through the internet, and lastly, they allow us to communicate with people who we are not able to see very often. These are my reasons, and I hope you agree with me that computers have a positive effect on people today.
1285	1289	1	3	The effect is that people shouldn't be on the computers that much because you need exercise to keep healthy. You won't learn anything if you play games on it all day. Your brain will focus more on the computer than on school. You'd be a bored kid or adult if you keep doing this. It would be sad if you throw your life away just because of a computer. The effect on people who don't know technology is that some people think that technology is dumb because they believe you should rely on your brain rather than a computer. Some people are poor and have never had a computer or even heard of technology. In some countries, some people don't even have access to electricity, so they can't use computers. The effect of not knowing technology means they miss out on finding locations, having a cellphone to call friends, going online to listen to music, play games, chat with friends and family, play games together, and watch movies. Another effect is learning about computers and how to use them. Step one is to turn it on. Then click on Internet Explorer and search for a website to visit. It's kind of hard to use the keyboard and type fast at first. The last effect is talking to people you don't know online. For example, when playing a game with a different player, you can chat with that person. Conclusion: These are all my reasons why I agree that the computer has positive reasons for a lot of people. This is why I agree with the effect of the computer, as it has both positive aspects when used properly and things to be cautious about.
1286	1290	1	3	"Personally I think computers have a good influence on people. They are one of the greatest inventions. With computers, you can listen to music or watch high - quality videos, research things for your school or work projects, or just have a good time. Computers help people create, listen to, watch and make music and engaging videos. When you have a computer, you can get influenced by other talented musicians to create your own unique music. And where does the process of enhancing that music need to go? Into a computer to add beats and different vocals. You can also watch various shows on there! Not exactly just one type of video but whatever show you'd like to see. Some people even create movies on special programs. That's not all though. A lot of questions can be answered on the computer by doing research. Cures for different diseases like cancer can potentially be found. Even small research projects like ""Who founded the famous city of @CAPS2"" can easily be found with one quick Google search. Yeah, we might be getting a bit lazy, but it makes people's lives simpler. For instance, instead of reading through dozens of thick books, you could just search it on the internet for the answers. You can even take online classes. Not impressed? Another great effect of people using computers is socializing and having fun. Socializing over computers may not be as effective as socializing in person, but it gives the quieter people, like me, a chance to say what's on their mind. Plus, there won't be any of those awkward silence moments like there usually seems to be on the phone. Oh, did I mention Facebook? I love Facebook. I get to keep in touch with my family and friends I no longer see. I used to have a very close friend, but after we switched schools, I never heard from her. Until I found her on Facebook. Same with many other people. And for the younger ones, they'll be entertained with the billions of interesting games online. How could you go wrong? Sounds to me like computers have a positive effect on people. But what do you guys think. Can one big negative outweigh a ton of positives? I think not. Computers are truly a boon for modern - day living."
1287	1291	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 of my local newspaper: Can you believe this garbage that the so - called experts are saying about computers? I sure hope you don't! They are saying that computers are health risks because too many people are on them and not exercising. Well, if you ask me, the users should know when to stop. And when it comes to interacting with family, the parents should set clear limits. Also, computers are very convenient. If you need information on a topic right away, they can provide it quickly. So far, I think computers are not the ones at fault in this development. Exercising is something a person should have the ambition to do. Although some people don't have this motivation and spend their day on the computer, they claim it's not their fault. The computer is a tool; it's up to you to use it properly. I read just last week that someone actually told her press that it is not her fault she is overweight. That's ridiculous! So the only person at full fault for not getting exercise is the gamer. As for family interaction, it's all up to the parents. The parents are in control over their child, and if they notice that their kid doesn't spend enough time interacting with the family, they should act. The operator should have the will - power to know when enough is enough and lay down the rules and set limits! If we didn't have computers at home, it would be a hassle. Kids rely on computers to get them quick, accurate information. Without them, the parents would have to take their child to and from the library, which takes a lot of time. And let's not forget how easy the internet makes things. So in conclusion, computers are the way to go. They are not the cause of a lack of exercise or family issues. It's not the computers' fault that families have problems. And they are just so convenient. So clearly, computers are good to have! I truly hope by reading this letter you agree with my opinion.
1288	1292	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I have some arguments to tell you how computers aren't all bad. One, you can use them to get detailed information for a project, talk to your long - lost friends, or learn about something you have never known before. My first argument is that most people use their computer to get information for a project they have to do for class. For example, they could need in - depth information for a country like the beautiful @LOCATION2, the historical @LOCATION3, or the vibrant @LOCATION1. There are many ways you can get this information. So if you didn't have a computer, where could you get all this information? If you get it from a single book, it might not have what you are looking for for your project. The computer has a bigger range of knowledge than a single book can have. My second example is that you can talk to your friends you haven't seen or talked to in a long time. There are many ways you can do this, like on the popular @CAPS1, the reliable @CAPS2, Twitter, or Yahoo. You could always make new friends too because it is always better to expand your social circle. Even better, you can connect with a family member. I know it is a lot better to talk to a family member because they already know you well. Finally, it is always better to find out something you never knew before or something you have been wondering about. But you could always go on Google, Ask, or Wikipedia. They can all help you find what you have been looking for. But that doesn't mean you can't find it in a book either. Books are chalk - full of answers and ideas that can help you. My conclusion is that you can always find ways to get the answer you need. But that also doesn't mean that you should be sitting on the computer when you could be going outside, or playing with your friends. And nothing is better than spending your time outside. So use the time on the computer wisely. Then go outside and enjoy the outdoors, as it enriches your life in many ways.
1289	1293	1	3	Dear local newspapers, I'm writing to tell you that people using the computer is not a bad thing. Would you enjoy being bored? Or would you rather be entertained while learning something? Being on the computer helps with hand - eye coordination. You can learn about amazing places around the world, and even talk to friends. Hand - eye coordination is good because it is extremely useful. It can save millions of people in war. For example, my grandpa went into the @ORGANIZATION1, and @NUM1 people were firing at him, but he had good hand - eye coordination from using the computer, and it saved his life. Also, having good hand - eye coordination means less people will get hurt, like getting your hand jammed in the car door. There would be more safety and less accidents. Another thing just as important as hand - eye coordination is learning! On the internet, you can learn about anything and everything. If you learn about far - away places, you will be able to widen your conversation topics. People will think you're smarter, and you'll feel good. Not only what other people think, but you'll truly get smarter. Most importantly, you can talk to friends! If you are chatting with your friends, it can build up your self - esteem. And when you go to school, you'll be more social. Did you know @PERCENT1 of people do better in school if they communicate online? Don't you wish every day you could be proud of yourself? Well, talking online helps! This is why I'm writing to you to share all my ideas and concerns. I hope you consider them and share them with the rest of the world. The computer is clearly a valuable tool in many aspects of our lives.
1290	1294	1	3	"Imagine our beautiful town filled with unhealthy, lazy, non - interacting and addicted people. The issue to grapple with is should you, the local people, spend more time on computers or not. I believe @PERCENT1 that we should not spend all of our time on computers. It can ruin your eyesight. You don't enjoy nature while interacting with people, and most importantly, it makes you very unhealthy. Can you picture an @CAPS1 person in your town blind and having to wear thick glasses or even going to the @CAPS1 eye doctor on @DATE1? Just ask eye expert @PERSON1, ""@CAPS1 year, I get more and more people coming to the eye doctor. You might say that it is good for me, but it is not good for you. When you are always on the computer, it gradually erodes your eyesight over time."" As @CAPS2, many people wear glasses now more than ever. On @DATE1 in the local newspaper, they had a chart that showed how many people ruined their eyesight over the years from using computers. It went up almost @PERCENT2 from @DATE1 year and @PERCENT3 from the year before. Almost everyone that has a computer and is addicted to it has glasses. Have you looked outside lately? Have you noticed that @DATE2 is coming and there are colorful leaves on the trees now? If you were one of the people that is glued to the monitor of your computer, then I doubt you were aware. Computers and technology ruin your time with your family. Many jobs on the computer are sedentary. In that time, you could be spending quality time with your precious little girl or even your best friend outside in nature, having fun. @DATE1 year, I wanted to play catch with my dad, but he was on his old computer doing what he usually does. I didn't want to play alone, so I just stayed inside and went on my computer for the day. Do you want that to happen to an @CAPS1 person every day? I wouldn't. Yes, people would rather be a couch potato and chat online, eating a big bag of junk food chips instead of going out and interacting while staying fit. But now it is important that you do. Just picture lazy, obese people sitting on their couch all day with their eyes blood - shot from staring at the monitor for hours. But why do they do this, you may ask? It is because they never step outside. They never go for a jog or eat healthy foods. That is very unhealthy and can increase your chances of getting different cancers. Just ask @PERSON2 from the hospital, ""@DATE1, one guy was rushed to the hospital because of a very common cancer that you get from an unhealthy lifestyle. He passed away @NUM2 days later. It was very sad."" I strongly believe that being on the computer for too long is a very bad idea. It can ruin your eyesight, you never get to see nature and interact. But most importantly, it is very unhealthy. It is now or never. You would never know if you can be that man in the hospital with that cancer. The issue to grapple with is should you take that risk or stay fit, healthy and happy? So take a jog, eat a healthy snack, and limit your time on the computer to lead a better and more fulfilling life."
1291	1295	1	3	More and more people use computers. They love computers because they can connect with places that are far away or access the news easily. Computers are beneficial for everyone in this world. No one can live without computers. There are others who don't like computers at all. I know that there are families or friends who have computers, and they write to each other. Just like on MySpace, you could have friends from everywhere or keep in touch with family members. However, people are spending too much time on their computers. We should strike a balance between using computers and engaging in other real - life activities to make the most of both worlds.
1292	1296	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I have some opinions on where technology is going these days and about how many people shun the idea of further advancement. They have understandable reasons, such as technology taking people away from family and drawing people's attention away from the rest of the world. I do see their point, but I'd like to make a point myself. While statistics show a @PERCENT1 decline in recreational activities, people also find more things to do. Now that the world is more concerned for the environment, you will probably see people coming outside again. Maybe they heard about some new environmental activist group to join or they watched a movie that makes fun of live - action role - playing and decide to give it a try. My point is that you never know what you're going to discover in the media, and it's better than sitting outside all day with no inspiration, waiting for your parents to get home and give you information from outside your tiny world. The other item I will mention is the music industry and how it is revolutionized with more advanced and different ways of listening to it. In fact, the only problem in music today are the artists and how they take advantage of recording studios and, on occasion, one another just to gain fame! Without doing anything but sit back and lip - sync. But the technology of the day gives us the ability to listen to music; it's the golden age of music now. So why not advance and invest in the music industry? It will provide entertainment and fun for years to come. Advancing technology in the music industry is actually probably good for the economy as well. I mean, if we didn't have new @CAPS3 to sell to people every year, that would be a huge decline in stock - market prices. Not that we're not in a crash right now, but it wouldn't be any better. That goes for cell phones too and any other piece of hardware that gets frequently upgraded; it's just good for business. You see, I believe that the point of life is joy, so what's better than settling down with maybe a date, some candlelight, and a romance or thriller on the @CAPS4.V? Most people will enjoy just sitting down and watching the telly; it's easy to relate to. The television has evolved in many good ways. It's a way to lay down and unwind, learn about so many different things, maybe watch a show on @LOCATION1. It makes you feel like being there without actually being there. It helps us get updated on current events, shows things that we want to do, and shows us how to do it. I, for example, have learned so much from these technological advancements, and we should embrace them for a better future.
1293	1297	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 - republican, @CAPS2 do benefit society in a positive way, but they also have a negative effect. Computers allow people to chat, voice - chat, or video - chat with family members in other countries. Making such calls over the phone would be very expensive or even impossible. They also provide learning experiences with many resources at your fingertips. One positive effect of computers is that they allow you to connect with people around the world. Programs like Skype enable you to video/voice - chat with people around the world at no cost. Doing the same over the phone would be very costly. It gives you the opportunity to see family members you rarely see. Another positive effect of using computers is the resources and information it provides. The internet has just about every piece of information possible. When doing a research paper, you can go to Wikipedia and find information on various topics. The internet can prove to be extremely helpful. The @CAPS2 offers you many good mind - puzzle games that you couldn't ordinarily play. There are a lot of good things on the internet, many things that help get your mind flowing. Can't afford the newspaper? You can read articles and stories right on the internet. The last reason I believe @CAPS2 have a positive effect on people is that it replaces many traditional activities. Many people, instead of going to the @CAPS3, will go to the @CAPS2. No matter what you're doing, you are usually doing more on the @CAPS2 than on the @ORGANIZATION1. That is why I think computers make a positive effect on people. Computers are sure to be our future. You can play games, voice/video - chat, and even read the newspaper, making our lives more convenient and enriched.
1294	1298	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1, I have recently discovered that you are debating the impact computers have on people. In my opinion, I would think they have a neutral effect on people. In this day and age, computers are used for many things, such as research and communication. Maybe the reason young people spend so much time on the computer is because they have a lot of homework on it. ""@CAPS2 this"", ""@CAPS2 that"", people don't realize that to pass, we have to go on the computer. And for adults, when you work with big companies, you work with people all around the world. Instead of traveling to all these meetings, you can simply do it over webcam. Yes, I see your concern that people spend too much time inside on their computer, but what about people who love to read or play music? They could spend hours upon hours practicing or reading. What's the difference? And you never know, maybe being on the computer for someone is like a sport for another. Computers are just about everywhere, in houses, schools, and even crime & medical labs. Computers are a prime source of the database, of @CAPS4, criminal records, and so much more. Without computers, how could we catch the bad guy or detect cancer before it's too late? Computers are key in many things. In the end, you could debate all day about the pros & cons of computers. But they are so crucial in major aspects today that the pros outweigh the cons, and we should make good use of them while being aware of their potential drawbacks."
1295	1299	1	3	"Dear @PERSON2, Have you ever noticed how different our society is today, even from just ten years ago? That's because of computers. Yes, it is true that computers give us advantages like messaging and information, but they also take away from some of the greater aspects of life: staying fit, enjoying nature, and spending time with family and friends. Without those, life would be horribly unbeneficial. While surfing the web @MONTH1 can be fun, it has been proven unhealthy. ""If a person was to spend more than two and a half hours on the computer every @TIME1 for about a month, they would see a sudden increase in their weight gain. And if they kept the behavior up, they could gain up to one - third their initial body weight until medical help was provided,"" says @PERSON3, a specialist in obesity at @ORGANIZATION1. Also, @PERCENT1 of all computer users snack while online, which only increases weight gain even more. Unfortunately, those that spend a lot of time on the computer are not usually keen on exercising either. Instead of setting aside just a half - an hour out of their computer time to play with the dog, take a jog, or try some aerobics, computer lovers usually just stay in front of the screen. That's too bad, because it causes health problems for them and maybe even the generations after them. Nature is being ignored @CAPS1 more than ever. @PERSON1 can recall the time when the trails @CAPS2 runs were overrun with people. ""@CAPS1"" @CAPS2 says, ""They're being overrun with woods and undergrowth. Those are harder to get rid of than people."" But it's like the trails and nature areas that should be fuller; the number of nature lovers is decreasing. Because of today's new technologies, especially computers, the beauty of nature is being almost completely passed by. Some worry if it will fade entirely, and instead of trying to maintain what's left, we'll just let it do so. Hopefully, though, the next generation of people will recognize this horrible mistake. Doctors, @CAPS3, and all people alike are seeing more and more how computers affect family life. How often do you eat dinner with the whole family? When you don't, where are you most of the time? At the computer? That's what I thought. When computers and other technologies are available, there is much less of a chance that you will actually interact with family and friends. Mrs @PERSON4, an @NUM1 grade teacher in @LOCATION1, noticed that her family spent less time together than ever before when each family member got a laptop. She believes this is pulling her family apart. Do you? As you can conclude, computers have an awful influence on society: people do not take the time to stay fit, nature is being completely ignored, and family - interaction rates are poor. We should take action now, like setting a little time aside daily to observe these aspects of life. This way, life with computers can still be beneficial while we don't lose the important things in life."
1296	1300	1	3	I do not believe that computers benefit society. Kids can indeed learn more through computers, but they end up spending an excessive amount of time online. When kids talk to people online, they have no way of knowing if it is really someone they know. There are technical problems with computers that can delete files. For these reasons, computers do not benefit society. Kids spend too much time glued to their computers. While computers can teach you many things, they also offer a plethora of games. Children tend to spend most of their time playing games rather than studying. Children can become aggressive due to a lack of exercise. That's what is happening today. Kids are losing out on exercise and are getting heavier. They can even lose interest in other activities. All they want to do is go on the computer. When kids talk to people online, how can they know who they really are? People can create a fake email address and make a false account on @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 - space. These people are after children's personal information. Also, if you are talking to someone with a name of someone you know, the person might not be who they claim to be. Like me, I was talking to @CAPS2 cousin on @CAPS1 (the account said his name), but it turned out to be his wife. That is why you need to be careful about what you say and who you are really talking to. Computers are prone to viruses. When computers get viruses, they can delete the files you want to save. If you had a video on the news that you want to keep and you put it under favorites, then you get a virus that deletes the file. The video is then gone from the website. Sometimes your computer doesn't take you directly to the web - page anymore. You then have to click on a lot of places to get there. For these reasons, computers are not beneficial to society. Kids spend too much time on computers. Kids can talk to people they don't know on them. Computers have technical problems that delete files. Just remember there are many, many more reasons why computers are not beneficial to society, and we should be cautious about their over - use.
1297	1301	1	3	Dear local newspaper, it has come to my attention that those who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people, while others are disagreeing with this comment. In my point of view, I believe that computers are affecting some people today, and people are spending a huge amount of time on computers. The time spent on computers is truly outrageous! Many people are just sitting at home, staying on their computers, and simply playing games. Although the computer can be a great way to pay bills and come in contact with others far away, people are taking advantage of computers and even bullying others online. Since you're not right in front of the person or nearby, the computer is a tool for many people to say threatening things without anyone else knowing, which could cause fights or other terrible things. The computer can also be very dangerous in many ways. For example, sites like MySpace and Twitter can be dangerous for teens because of predators. Some random person could just start talking to you and ask you to meet them somewhere, which could be extremely dangerous. The computer is also dangerous because you could have inappropriate pictures posted on websites of you and not even know it! The last reason why computers and laptops affect people is because of hacking. This is a big issue, especially if you have a webcam. Some people know how to hack your webcam and can watch what you're doing without you knowing. People can also hack into your computer and look at all your documents. I think computers have a big impact on people today, and this impact should be addressed and solved to ensure a safer digital environment.
1298	1302	1	3	Dear Newspaper, I believe that computers have both positive and negative effects on people. However, I believe that there are more positive effects than negative ones. Some of these positive effects would be that they are essential for education, a very useful place to communicate, and they can be fun. My first reason for supporting computers would be that they are very educational. For example, you can research almost anything. If you are doing your homework and you forget an answer, you can quickly look it up. Another reason why the computer is educational is because you can type your paper on it so your teacher can actually read your handwriting if it is messy. On the subject, you can work from home if you are sick or on vacation. But how do you get your work to your boss? Email, of course! Which brings me to my next subject; communication. Another resourceful thing about computers is communication. There are so many different ways to communicate; it's unbelievable. Take instant messaging for an example. You can send messages to people's cellphones. You can chat with other people that are online or you can just post on some websites such as Facebook, Twitter, and tons more. You can also video - chat with people on things like Skype. Those are just a few ways of communicating on the computer. Finally, I would like to tell you about the fun things you can do on computers. First, you can buy games from a store and download them onto your computer. Personally, The Sims are my favorite. I understand that computer games can be a negative thing because they are addictive, but if you don't go on for hours and hours, then I don't see what the problem is. Also, they have educational games so learning can be both fun and educational. Another thing you could do is play free games or download the game from the internet to your computer so they are both fast and easy. To conclude, computers can be both negative and positive, but I chose to look at things through a positive eye and I think you should too. After all, computers can be educational, a social network, and fun. So, with my positive outlook, you won't be sorry to embrace the many benefits of computers.
1299	1303	1	3	"Dear Local Newspaper, on the subject of computers; their pros and cons, I would have to say that both sides provide very important reasons why you should and shouldn't use computers. I think that computers are very important to many students just like me. First of all, computers help me and my fellow classmates with many assignments. Some of us simply don't have the time to go to a library and look for a book that might not even possess the information needed. On the internet, you can find the same amount of valuable information or more! It also helps to develop your hand - eye coordination. Some people say ""you can learn hand - eye coordination outside too?"" Although that is true, typing is very fast and neat. As you can see, my handwriting is not the best, but I type very fast and make few mistakes, so I do not need the neatest handwriting ever. The way I see it, computers are the fastest way of doing a lot of things. So, if you spend time writing neatly, you might not even be able to go outside and see nature. My dad is an environmentalist, and he uses computers. Sometimes the easy way isn't always the best way, which is why we must have balance. Do not inform people to stop using computers but to balance their time with them. Everything is good if it's balanced. For example, caffeine; in large amounts, it is rather unhealthy, but when you need a small boost, you turn to caffeine, and it helps, same with computers. Besides, computers are now made everywhere, and trying to get rid of them is simply unreasonable. We are already in a recession; we don't need more trouble. I prefer to talk with my friends eye to eye; however, if you cannot do that, a computer is a perfect alternative. So, you see, computers are very helpful, but balance is the key to making the most of their benefits while avoiding their drawbacks."
1300	1304	1	3	Would you like to discover new things and explore amazing mysteries around the world? Do you love to have friends overseas? Do you want to relax and do something fun after a long day at @ORGANIZATION1? Advanced technology today allows you to do almost everything that would have been considered impossible several decades ago. We need to decide whether computers have a positive or negative effect on people. I firmly believe computers give society many benefits and opportunities. Who would disagree that computers are devoted to educational purposes? Computer experts have invented countless programs that make schoolwork easier for kids. For example, @CAPS1 helps you with essays and reports. With her program, teachers wouldn't strain their eyes trying to read sloppy hand - written compositions from students. @ORGANIZATION2 helps you organize and calculate complex data, @ORGANIZATION3 gives you the ability to create dynamic presentations. Many schools have a computer lab for students to complete their school tasks. The school has also acquired convenient - sized laptops to help students do their projects and take tests. That saves a lot of paper and, in turn, a lot of trees! Furthermore, many colleges offer their courses online. You can obtain a college degree right at your house without going anywhere. Education has never been so easy, thanks to our advanced network and computers. It is very important to mention the entertainment benefits of computers. I have noticed many teens play cool games on the net. They seem to greatly enjoy this opportunity. It is an ideal way to relax after a stressful day. Getting on the computer and listening to the newest songs is a great way to unwind. Some websites offer downloadable songs for free, so you don't need to worry about the financial part. Moreover, you can watch movies online anytime, from a wide selection such as horror, romance, comedy, fantasy, or even children's films. No more movie tickets, no more driving to the theater. Without a doubt, computers can put a smile on everyone's face with its entertainment benefits. Many people feel that computers isolate both kids and adults from their social life, but actually, computers give them a chance to communicate with other people around the world. Ten years ago, who would have thought that they could chat and talk directly with someone a thousand miles away, with no mail or telephone or whatever? I came to the @LOCATION1 last year. I am extremely grateful to computers because I can keep in touch with my friends and relatives. I can just send them pictures of the snowy winter sceneries here in just a minute. How much easier could it get? Computers definitely improve communication and bring people closer. Let's not wait any longer. Computers have endless positive effects and should be popularized. They help you learn, have fun, and communicate with people far away. Above and beyond all that, new technology makes the earth a greener place by saving paper and trees. Don't sit here and wait; educate people about the numerous benefits of computers today so that more can enjoy their advantages.
1301	1305	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1: A @CAPS2. Can you truly believe that this minuscule piece of technology is so significantly influencing our everyday life? The question on many people's minds is, do computers have a positive or negative effect on people? In my opinion, although computers assist with certain aspects of everyday life, I firmly think that it brings about negative effects. I have numerous reasons for this belief, but the three most crucial ones are going to be stated. First of all, people are so engrossed in their computers that they spend less time on real - world activities. People are also so preoccupied with their computers that they spend less and less time enjoying the beauty of nature. Last but most importantly, people are so caught up with technology that they barely spend quality time with friends and family. So, in my opinion, I think people should strike a balance between technology and the real world. Have you ever walked down the street and seen someone extremely overweight? Well, it isn't a pleasant sight, is it? My point is, that can happen to anyone in the world. Nowadays, people are spending less and less time exercising, but instead sitting at home in front of the computer, or slouched on the couch with a laptop. People are ignoring their health and instead staying glued to the computer. I for one, know how hard it is to resist the allure of playing on the computer, but you shouldn't let a tiny @CAPS2 take over your mind and your future. Nature. The most wonderful thing in the world, I'd say the second most wonderful after technology. Have you ever turned on the TV and seen the beauty of nature? Well, you can blame pollution and global warming for the harm it's facing. When people use computers, they are burning fuel which harms our environment. People are so focused on technology that they don't care about their surroundings. If I were nature, I would say, ""@CAPS3 less computers and @CAPS3 more green!"" @CAPS4..... it's a luxury to have a family. Family and friends are the most important things. Due to computers, many people are neglecting their family and friends. For example: @CAPS5: @CAPS6 want to go ride bikes? John: @CAPS7. I want to play my computer. Kids and adults are being single - handedly affected. In my opinion, family is the most important, unlike a piece of metal that has a screen. In conclusion, I think that computers have a rather negative effect on people's lives. People are spending less time taking care of their health and exercising due to the advance in technology. They are also spending less time at the park or simply just enjoying nature's beauty. Most importantly, there is less interaction with friends and family. But, this is just my opinion, and it won't mean anything if you don't agree. I hope you'll give it some consideration."
1302	1306	1	3	"Dear editor, I think that computers are an excellent thing to have in the house. They're extremely helpful and highly entertaining. For example, they make it incredibly easy to keep in touch with far - away friends and family, they help you learn new things or stay informed about the important news, and they're also very entertaining to people of all age groups. This is why computers are one of the most valuable possessions to have in your home. One of the many things a computer can help you with is maintaining contact with family members or friends that live at a great distance. Computers can serve this purpose because someone can use popular platforms like Facebook, Twitter, or Skype when using one. ""I love Facebook, because I can keep in close touch with my family members in the @LOCATION1,"" says @PERSON2. Also, researchers say that people who have Facebook, Skype, or Twitter accounts become much closer to their families than those who don't. A computer can be used for educational purposes as well. Many people like to use engaging educational computer games to prepare their elementary - schoolers for school. ""@CAPS1's really fun and gets my son well - prepared!"" says a local mother as she talks about a computer game. Studies show that computer games are @PERCENT1 better at preparing a child for school than traditional textbooks and worksheets. One of everyone's favorite reasons for keeping a computer in the house is for entertainment. When on a computer, anyone can play classic games like cards, chess, pinball or visit game websites like addictinggames.com, go on youtube.com to watch interesting videos, or do much much more. ""I like to spend some of my free time on addictinggames.com,"" says @PERSON1. Also, after taking a poll, I found out that @PERCENT2 of kids and teens prefer online games to board games. As you can see, there are many reasons why having a computer in the house is important. There are also many more than what I've listed. However, I think the main ones are to keep in touch with friends and family, to use the computer for educational purposes, and for entertainment. I'm very grateful for the computer in my house because I use it every day for those purposes, and so does everyone else in my family. A computer is truly one of the most important things in the average home."
1303	1307	1	3	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1's position on the computer controversy issue is that computers are good and extremely vital in today's everyday world. Computers are an excellent way to communicate. You can chat with your friends, email your peers, and now there are websites you can visit where you can talk to your friends or even a stranger. Being human, I do sometimes forget @CAPS1's homework or school assignments. In that situation, I would just go on @CAPS1's computer and message a friend asking them for the assignment. It's quick, easy, and it works. There are also websites where you can talk and connect with other people who share the same interests as you. It's a great way to make online friends. The computer goes beyond just allowing you to talk; it enables you to connect with people no matter where they are located. Do you ever have a question that you need an answer to instantly? Just go to ""Google"" or ""@CAPS4"", type in your question and receive an immediate response. Have a research paper due on @PERSON1? You can do all of your research online. There are thousands of websites loaded with information on anything and everything. You can enter your topic into a search engine and find hundreds of sources that way. You can easily find information on any subject you want, or find the name of that song you just heard on the radio using your computer. Computers are used in the business environment too. Computers are used for sending messages to different people in the company. They are also used to create and present professional presentations for marketing campaigns and new product ideas. Also, many companies use the internet as a source of advertising and need the publicity to sell their products. So the computer is necessary for businesses to function as well. So in conclusion, computers are not over - used; they are just used for so many things that at some point everyone will need one. They are a good way to communicate, an important and main source of information, and they are also used in business environments too."
1304	1308	1	3	I think that computers have a positive effect on people because you can communicate with different places around the world, store things on them, and use them for entertainment. Computers have a positive effect because you can communicate with other people around the globe. This is good because instead of making expensive long - distance phone calls, you can go on the computer and talk to them for free. Long - distance phone calls can cost a fortune. But if you can just go on your computer and talk to them, there's going to be no charge. Being able to talk to other people over the internet is very useful and fun. If there wasn't a computer, people wouldn't be talking to as many people, and their social life would be dull, making their life less exciting. This is one reason why I think that computers have a positive effect on people. Another reason why computers have a positive effect on people is that if you have a lot of paperwork that is just lying around and getting in the way, well, if you have a computer, there are features that allow you to store things and become much more organized. Being more organized, there is less stress, and you start to feel better about not losing things and being able to find them easily. This is why I think that computers are very great and useful. The last reason why I think that computers have a positive effect on people is that people can use it for entertainment. Computers can do many things like play games, listen to music, watch videos, and chat with your friends. Being able to play games for free on your computer is awesome. If you can't afford to get a game system, then you are able to go on your computer and play pretty much whatever game or a game close to the one you want to play. A computer can also play music. You can have a music library and download music to it or go to websites that have music on them. Also, you can do video chats with your friends if they live far away. I hope that I've convinced you to like computers more and think that they are great and have a positive effect on people. Being able to play games, store things, and chat with other people is truly amazing.
1305	1309	1	3	Dear newspaper editor, @CAPS1, do you have a computer? Do your kids spend all of their time on it talking to people or going on Facebook or MySpace? Well, that's fun and all for a few hours, but some people spend a great deal of time on it. They don't go out and get exercise or interact with their family and friends. Also, they often end up getting in trouble in school or at home. If you spend all of your time on the computer doing whatever you're doing, you won't have time to go out and exercise. Not only will it be unappealing, but it could be dangerous for your health after a while. All your time gets sucked into the computer, and when you're on it, you feel like you're not on for a long time, and it ends up being like a few hours. It even happens to adults. My mom was on the computer for about an hour, and she felt like it was only a few minutes. When you're on your computer for several hours, you tend to get sucked in and not interact with anyone. I know this from personal experience. A few months ago, I spent about a whole month just coming home from school and being on the computer for several hours. This affected my life a lot. I stopped going out on weekends with my friends; I always wanted to stay home when my family went out. Then my mom confronted me about it, and I realized that all of my time on the computer wasn't good. I was missing out on a lot of things. Kids often also get in trouble at home or at school if they are on the computer for a long time. They often don't do their homework and end up failing a class and then having to repeat a grade. Statistics show that @PERCENT1 of the kids that stay on the computer for a long time end up either failing a class or repeating a grade. They also often get in trouble at home because they don't do their chores because they're busy on the computer, and neither the child nor the parents like getting into fights with one another. Now I know in a way it's good to have computers and be able to use them so we can look up information, and it's nice to sometimes talk to people on the computer for a little while. But being on the computer for too long can really mess up you and your social life. So all I'm trying to prove is that computers are an amazing invention, but we should just use them a little less and get out and exercise, and have fun with our family and friends, and do well in school and at home so we can still get to spend some time on the computer. I hope you see it my way now.
1306	1310	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I am writing to you about how technology affects people. My argument is that some people think that computers are taking too much of people's time. I will tell you how technology keeps people from exercising and gaining life experiences. Now I will explain in further details. My first reason for saying computers affect people is that they can't get exercise when their face is glued to a computer screen all day. And especially with the large number of kids playing video games or using the computer, the childhood obesity rate will slowly rise due to them not getting exercise, or they will just get very weak. That is why computers have a negative affect on people by not letting them get the exercise they need. My second reason for saying computers have a negative affect on people is that they won't be able to gain life experience. I say this because when someone asks you ""@CAPS3, what did you do today?"", your only answer could be ""@CAPS4, can we change the question to what did I not do today?"" @CAPS5 when you're on the computer all day, you won't be able to explore and observe nature. Well, maybe you could do that on a @CAPS6 server, but it isn't the same. And even when parents ask if you want to go for a walk, you should do it. You could learn something or see something you wouldn't be able to see on a daily basis. That is why computers have a negative affect on people when their face is glued to a computer. So now I am going to close this letter and I hope you see that exercise and gaining life experiences will change your life forever. By reducing computer time, people can lead a more balanced and fulfilling life."
1307	1311	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3: @CAPS4 people are skeptic on whether or not computers benefit people. I strongly believe that computers do indeed benefit humanity for it allows people to talk online with loved ones and friends across the globe, and learn about those foreign places. Computers don't take away from lives, but show it through fascinating synthetics. Computers allow people of all ages to interact with others over the world - wide web. Sometimes it's better to meet with people in person, but that isn't always possible. What if you have relatives or friends in a different country? The internet is the best way to contact those people. Also, what if you are in a band or a group, and need to contact them while you are out of town? Social sites like Facebook or MySpace allow the group members to talk and discuss matters at the hotel or wherever they may be. In addition to both of these reasons, students can obtain missing work and email the teacher from their household. This allows the pupil to obtain their lesson and catch up on anything he or she has missed. The technological breakthrough of the @DATE1 known as computers allow interaction with other people as well as learn of distant lands. @CAPS4 people including myself, want some culture in their lives, and wander about this lively planet we call earth and find out what's out there, but cannot achieve said goal. The computer saves us time and money to do these things. All we have to do is open a search bar, type in a word, and boom, we are looking at @LOCATION2, @LOCATION3, or even the fields of @LOCATION1. Any place you want is at your fingertips. In addition to this, if a new tourist attraction comes to be, whether it is an amusement park, a monument, or a historical find, the internet can show us this. We can see things we would be seeing if we were present at the place, but instead on a monitor in your home. The computer allows you to do @CAPS4 things without actually encountering their happenings. In conclusion, computers are helpful for they allow us to perform things we could not do under certain circumstances, like talking to people over the internet, or learning of foreign countries. Not everyone can do these things, but everyone who has a computer can, making the world a more connected and knowledgeable place.
1308	1312	1	3	Imagine how people felt back then when there weren't any great technology. What if you didn't see your best friend in years and you lived long distance? Well now there's this advanced machine called a computer. It's very great and it's a well - hands - on activity that helps you with eye coordination. However, @CAPS1 is going to tell you some things about this device and how it affects humans' daily life. Moreover, the categories are having a great relationship, online courses, and being on the best local websites. Did you know that about @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2 have a successful life with online - dating? There's tons of people who struggle with relationships. For example, one day my mom and dad got into a series of arguments. She felt that the relationship wasn't good enough and she needed to meet a better man. On the other hand, she decided to live a better life and find dates (over the computer) and live a new life. These are the fantastic things you can do on the computer to have a better relationship. You're a high - school dropout because you can't keep up with the class. You don't turn in your homework and fail every test. Also, you feel that there is nothing you can do to fix it. Well not so fast my son! Now you can take online courses to boost up your grade and make you feel comfortable. Imagine sitting at the computer, completing every assignment and doing every homework there is. Watching your teacher teach to you through a webcam. There's nothing like it. In fact, you get the homework faxed to you. Someone in this world is living this life, it could be you. There are new websites all around the world today. However, there is no better website with all your friends on it. For example, MySpace, Facebook, and Twitter. All websites that can help you stay in contact with your best friends. Another option that can be even more interesting is webcam. It's live from home footage, face to face on the computer. How cool is seeing your friend when you're not together? Third of all, communication makes the world go around, that's why more and more people meet new friends. In sum, as you can see there's a lot of fun things you can do on a computer. It affects humans' lives because more and more people are interested in this device, enhancing various aspects of their daily existence.
1309	1313	1	3	"Dear local Newspaper, why waste your time learning at home when that's what schools are for? People are concerned that too many people are spending too much time on their computers. They spend less time outdoors, exercising, and enjoying nature! People need more time to interact with their family. People are concerned. They are concerned there is way too much computer time. One time my mom had just bought a new computer and I stayed up all night on the internet. When I woke up the next morning I was so tired and I didn't want to go to school. I think you should consider less computer time. The more time people use their computers the less time they are enjoying the outdoors. Instead of talking to a friend on MySpace, you could be right down the street at the park with them. @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people in @CAPS2 use a lot of computer time. Interacting outdoors is a nice way to enjoy nature and have fun. Family activities are a nice, fun and enjoyable way to spend your time. You can go to the park when it's nice outdoor weather, go swimming, play sports. In the wintertime you can possibly go to the movies, go to the mall, have fun with the family. Don't waste your time on the internet. In conclusion, there is too much computer time and you as the newspaper editor, I advise you to make computers more expensive so people can spend their money on something more useful because there is too much computer time. My mom says that ""the more people use their computers, the less they put their feet in their shoes and walk outside!"" @CAPS3 people in @LOCATION1, @CAPS2 think the same. Please consider my opinions the right way. Thank you. By reducing computer usage, people can lead a more active and family - oriented life."
1310	1314	1	3	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, Have you ever truly marveled at the computers in our generation today? Have you seen all the interesting and amazing things that computers allow us to explore? Computers have been thought to advance our society because of its ability to show websites containing vast and diverse research. However, let me ask you this - have you ever wondered if computers actually ruin the life someone has? Well, people who use computers are drawn into them, and they ignore the necessary physical activities one can get from being outside. Also, people who spend their time in front of a computer screen don't interact as much with friends and family as they normally would. Also, one major threat that teens and children face while on the internet are people who try to talk to them online and could become a danger to the children. In order to help the well - being of people, we need to realize the negative effects of computers! If you were to talk in the park or even visit a field, you would most likely see someone enjoying the outdoors. When I say that @CAPS1 mean like playing soccer or football, or playing frisbee. People who do this rather than sit inside staring at a computer, help their body stay healthy. When you are on the computer, no healthy activity is involved. Would you rather see yourself healthy and active or lazy and sluggish? Well, when the summertime comes, my friends and I usually go to the field to play a game of soccer. Also, we sometimes go to the beach and enjoy the cool, refreshing water in the pool. Not to mention, we even find activities to do in the cold, freezing winter such as sledding and snowboarding. People need to get out, pry their eyes from the computer screen and go out and smell the fresh air. The feeling of being outside will raise your spirits and shift you from a person in a trance to a person that feels alive! Also, have you ever gone home and just retreat to your room for some quiet? Then you decide to go on the computer to get away from your troubles. ""Dinner is ready,"" a family member informs you; however, you don't respond because you enjoy the computer so much. Computers interfere with your connection to family members and friends. In addition, many people sit in a trance - like state while at the computer, blocking out any outside communication. Computers do not help families come together, they separate them. This creates an unhealthy family, which is bad because people need to have a strong connection with family. Studies show that the average time a person spends on the computer is five hours! This pretty much takes up a lot of time, so families can't spend time with one another. One important problem that children and teens face on the internet are people known as ""child predators."" These people usually seek to hurt a child by getting information out of them and meeting them. Research shows that @PERCENT1 of children encounter these ""child predators."" Would you want to see your child be hurt by these horrible people? Computers are the reason, along with the internet, for these occurrences. Children and teens need to be protected from this major threat! In conclusion, computers have negative effects on people and their lives. First, they don't allow people to be active and go outside. Second, they disrupt family and social relationships. And third, they expose children and teens to dangerous predators. We should be more aware of these issues and take steps to limit computer use for a healthier and safer life."
1311	1315	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2, has this ever happened to you? ""@PERSON3, did you do your thorough research?"" ""@CAPS3, unfortunately, my computer crashed."" ""@PERSON1, did you practice typing diligently @TIME1?"" "" @CAPS3, my computer crashed."" "" @CAPS5, why weren't you online @TIME1? I really urgently needed that sales report!"" ""I'm sorry @PERSON2, my computer crashed."" @CAPS6 it @CAPS2, you have surely realized that computers do greatly benefit people. Whether it's working on a class project, practicing for a computer class, or exchanging business ideas, computers are a huge help to society. First of all, computers are extremely useful when it comes to a computer class at your school. There might be a specific speed that a person needs to type to pass the class, and the teacher could assign regular practice on your own home computer. It is a fact that @PERCENT1 of kids that have some kind of personal computer at home get @CAPS7 A's in their computer class. I can back that up as well. In my computer class, our teacher strongly stresses the importance of practicing at home to get your typing speed a bit higher. Every @TIME1 I would practice, but one @TIME1 my computer crashed, and I could not practice for the whole week before the final exam @CAPS2 on @DATE1. Instead of getting a @CAPS8 or A, I got a @CAPS9+. I blame that grade on not having a reliable computer at home. Secondly, computers can be used for learning @MONTH1 different things as well. Maybe on a class report you needed to write something about the traditions of @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1. Instead of rushing over to the library and wasting your precious time with a book, you could just open up your laptop and look it up on the internet. Not only does it save a lot of time, but @CAPS6 you look it up on the internet, you will get far more search results than @CAPS6 you search on a library directory. In addition, by using computers, you can look up the customers of a foreign country, or look up programs that could help you learn a new language. On computers, you can not only learn about your own country but also learn about foreign ones. Thirdly, computers can enhance many skills that are needed in the modern business world, such as socialization skills, communication skills, and even learning about the younger generation. @CAPS6 someone had not gone on an instant messaging program or a video chatting program, they would not succeed in the world of today. People need to learn to interact with each other and solve problems. @CAPS6 someone is not used to interacting with people, they @MONTH1 not make a good businessperson. People must be able to communicate as well. @CAPS6 people do not communicate with each other, we will all end up lost in the headlights. We will all be lost and will not be able to run businesses or hold meetings. For example, I needed to plan a meeting for my project group to work on a project, and so I went on my computer hoping they were online. Basically, they never showed up, and so I could not work with my partners at all. I ended up doing all their work. In conclusion, I hope you have thoroughly considered my opinion about the positive impact computers have on people. As I said, computers can be very helpful when it comes to computer classes, researching foreign affairs, and even communicating with others. Thanks again for even reading this letter."
1312	1316	1	3	Dear local newspaper, Those who do support advances in technology firmly believe that computers have a positive effect on people. I, for one, whole - heartedly agree with them. Computers are truly wonderful devices that allow people of all ages to explore and learn about the world and its diverse people. It enables people to have meaningful conversations with family members who live far away, friends, or sometimes business associates. Technology also provides a vast array of educational opportunities. Don't you think socializing and learning are two extremely important aspects of an ordinary person's life? Learning new things can only be truly engaging if you can actually visualize them. Books can be helpful, depending on when they were published. Internet websites can offer picture uploads almost every week. Therefore, you can decide where you want to book your next visit. Yes, books can provide a great deal of information, but not as much as the thousands of websites available right at this moment. Want to learn how to speak Spanish? Look it up, quickly and easily on the internet. No need to search through hundreds of books just to get one tiny fact. Throughout your daily activities, chatting with friends is a great way to relax and have a good time. Whether it's a close friend or a co - worker, there are now several convenient ways to talk to friends, such as phones, texting, instant messaging, and even video chat! Yes, it @MONTH1 take some time away from family, but you can easily say goodbye to the friend and talk to them later. Finally, learning is a crucial aspect for people today. Well, with this advanced technology, we have found fun ways to educate students. Websites that are colorful and engaging can teach kids how to multiply and read. About @PERCENT1 of children are more attracted to colorful objects than books filled with words. So, to all parents and guardians, computers aren't all that bad; they're actually very beneficial. In conclusion, computers offer so many advantages in terms of socializing and learning, and they should be embraced as valuable tools in our lives.
1313	1317	1	3	"Dear local Newspaper, @CAPS1 you love computers but are worried that you or your loved ones spend way too much time on them? If so, then maybe we should @CAPS1 take some action. Too many people have issues with their vision due to staring at computers for too long. Also, people miss out on a lot of other outdoor activities. Finally, if people are working off of computers for their job, then they are missing out on some of the other important things in life, such as interacting with family and friends, enjoying the beautiful outdoors, or just simply spending quality time with their close ones. Now, are you for or against this situation of people getting ""hooked"" on computers? In my opinion, people should be enjoying life's pleasures and not spend most of their time glued to computers. Since people are so dependent on computers, sometimes working on one can severely hurt your vision. The bright white computer screen filled with all those endless e - mails can really have a negative impact on your vision. I know my dad always gets terrible headaches, and his vision isn't in the best condition when it comes to him working on a computer all day long. Being indoors and on a computer all day long makes you really miss out on the wonderful outdoor activities that exist. Things such as playing sports, exploring nature, riding a bike, and many other activities are missed because of being on a computer all day. Only energetic and fun - loving people get out and get active. Last but not least, @CAPS1 you enjoy spending time with the ones you love but seem to be too busy because you're on the computer all day? If so, then get up and go have some real fun! Take the wife and kids on a nice hike or go and ride a bike. It's great exercise for you, your family, and friends, and it's actually very enjoyable! So, it's now or never. @CAPS1 you want to be at home on a computer all day, or @CAPS1 you want to be full of energy and spending quality time with family and friends? Most importantly, @CAPS1 you want to be energetic and healthy with no vision problems and stop those awful headaches? Well, without a doubt, if you get up and get active, it will be the best decision you'll ever make! So, get up, grab the kids, and start your new, energized, pain - free life. In conclusion, breaking away from excessive computer use and embracing an active lifestyle is essential for our well - being."
1314	1318	1	3	Dear editor, I wholeheartedly agree with having computers in our homes. I think that computers are excellent because of these reasons. The computer has a vast amount of information that you can look up. Also, the computer can save a great deal of important things you need. Then you can communicate with people far away. I think that a computer is a really great thing because you can look up various things. For example, you can look up something about someone's life that was significant. You can look up a website that tells you about a word or a car that you need to learn about for school or work. You can look up an event that happened a long time ago, like @NUM1 or @DATE1. Then you could look up your family tree and find out who you are related to, someone who was part of your family in the past. You could also look up your bank account or your e - mail on the computer. So, this is one reason that I think a computer is useful for. Another reason why I would think that a computer is a great thing for anyone is that it can save a lot of important things. You could save important memories from your past. Also, you need to save your reports for your school or work. Then you can save pictures from special occasions. You could add your favorite websites to your favorites so you can access it any time you want to. This is another reason why I think computers are a good thing. One last reason why I think that computers are a good thing is because you can communicate with people far away. You can have family members who have just moved away, and you can keep in touch with them through your e - mail, MySpace, Facebook, etc. You could video chat with your friends or family that lives in a different place. You could participate in chats with your co - workers or your boss for a meeting. This is another reason why I think computers are a good thing. So, as you can see, this is why I think computers are a good thing because you can look up things, save important things, and communicate with your friends. In conclusion, computers offer so many benefits in terms of information access, storage, and communication, making them an indispensable part of our lives.
1315	1319	1	3	Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 opinion on the effect of computers is that it depends on how much you use the computer. But I firmly think the computer has a positive effect on people. Why? Because it has made our kids' homework much easier to do, and there are fun sites you can check out. Even for adults, when they need to look up something important, they can quickly find it on the computer. First reason why I think the computer has a positive effect on people is because it makes @CAPS1 homework a breeze. Instead of getting information from a book, I can get it from @CAPS1 computer. Trust me, it's far easier than reading all those thick books when you have a computer at your disposal. Then you can just type in what you want, and it would automatically pop up for you. For example, when you have an essay to write about @PERSON1 @LOCATION1, all you have to do is go to @CAPS2.com, and all types of past @CAPS2 would show up. Then you go to the search bar and put in @LOCATION1, and all this @CAPS2 information about him comes out. So you get the right information, which is an easy A+ for you. Second reason why I think the computer has a positive effect on people is all the great sites you can go on. You can play games, go on YouTube, or MySpace. There are so many things you can do on a computer to have some fun. For example, say you don't @CAPS3 want to play your game console, watch @CAPS3.V, or go outside. What do you do? Get on your computer. So you can check your MySpace page, watch funny videos, or maybe talk to some of your friends online. Think about it, you can't @CAPS3 do any of those things on your @CAPS3.V or your game console, and especially not outside. So that's why I think a computer has a positive effect on people. Lastly, I think the computer has a positive effect on people because even adults like to use computers. Half of every adult's job involves using a computer, whether it's to cash a check on a computer, for teachers to put in grades, or for scientists to look up different experiments. For example, a teacher always has to use their computer to put in grades, see what us kids need help on, or how far we've progressed and how far behind we are. So it makes it very convenient for adults as well. In conclusion, those were the reasons why I firmly believe that computers have a positive effect on people, making our lives easier, more fun, and more productive.
1316	1320	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1 of the @LOCATION1, @CAPS2, a significant majority of the @ORGANIZATION1 population will use any type of computer at least once a day. Our modern society has been surrounded by computers so frequently that some people will find it extremely hard to even live without them. Computers have truly become something that people heavily depend on. This, however, is something to take as a serious concern. When people are overly dependent on computers, they lose valuable skills that they once possessed, such as manual calculation and map - reading. They also spend less time outside exercising while also losing touch with family and friends. It has become evident that computers have become an integral part of people's lives. Computers possess the ability to perform certain human tasks that seem difficult for us to do. Before the computer age, it was a great deal more difficult to find information on a topic or place. We used to have to laboriously use encyclopedias or painstakingly find books on those topics. Sometimes we would even have to travel to a place and learn about it on - site. Today, however, people readily use technology to find this information. You @MONTH1 be thinking, "" @CAPS3, how is this a bad thing?"". The reason it is a problem is because people have begun to lose the ability to use books like encyclopedias and atlases or even simple maps. Once, most of the population could skillfully use these tools to help find their way through information or a place. I know from personal experience that I can barely look at a map and find where I am. We have become too dependent on @CAPS4's and computers, which in turn makes us forget valuable information. What would happen if someone got lost and they didn't have a working @CAPS4 or signal on their phones? They would get lost and not know how to read a map. As you can see, the human population has become too dependent on computers. Additionally, people all around the world have become addicted to the internet. Facebook, @CAPS6 and even @CAPS7 baseball have become an addicting activity that people consume all of their free time with. When people begin to spend the majority of their time on these websites, they will in turn get less exercise, and become more distant from family and friends. Mostly teenagers have this problem. If you took a survey of the number of students who have a facebook account or @CAPS6, you would probably get the majority. Having an account like this is said to be highly addicting. Students, parents and everyone in between will face troubles later on because of this. America is one of the leading nations with obesity. Has anyone stopped to think that maybe people spend too much time on these websites to get any exercise? If the internet wasn't such a big thing as it is now, I bet you there would be less overweight people. But not only do people become overweight, they will end up more and more distant from family and friends. My own sister spends so much time on her laptop that my parents had to take it away. Once, the only way for us to really talk to her was through facebook. As you can see, computers can be a dangerous thing. Think of all the people who you know that spend multiple hours on the computer. You can probably think of quite a few. Computers are an addicting thing that can cause less exercising and less communication which is proven to support a healthy lifestyle. Also when people use computers too much, they lose valuable skills. Remember this next time you or someone you know sits down at a computer for a long time. You can help them break this cycle and lead a more balanced life."
1317	1321	1	3	"Dear newspaper readers, @CAPS1 this! Picture yourself sitting at home on the comfortable couch, munching on a bag of delicious potato chips. The @CAPS2 shows a beautiful picture of the @LOCATION1; you can almost vividly feel the gentle rain falling on you, and you really have a strong desire to learn more about it. All of a sudden, you watch the remote fall to the ground. Your hand - eye coordination is so poor that you totally miss it when you try to grab it. On top of that, you suddenly remember you were supposed to meet your sister today, whom you haven't seen for years, but you can't! If you had a computer, you would be able to learn about more places and people, it would significantly improve your hand - eye coordination, and you could interact with people without having the time to meet them in person! Computers definitely have good effects on people! First, computers help to improve hand - eye coordination. It is a well - established fact that people who own one or more computers in a household have better hand - eye coordination than people without computers! Don't you want good hand - eye coordination too? As a matter of fact, my friend @PERSON4 had the worst hand - eye coordination in our school. Now that her parents have bought her a computer, she is a lot quicker and definitely has much better hand - eye coordination. She said that just looking at the screen and moving the cursor where she wanted to go helped a lot. Also, a research on computer time states that computers have been proven to improve hand - eye coordination in the course of a year. That sounds pretty simple and achievable to me! Next, computers also allow people to learn about other faraway places and people. Local middle school teacher, @PERSON2, uses computers to teach her students about the @CAPS3 culture and geography in an engaging way. That sounds a lot more interesting than just talking in a mundane way! My cousins saw an article about @LOCATION3 once and they were completely amazed. They learned a great deal about the culture there and actually took a trip there! Furthermore, vacations.com says that computers are the #@NUM1 cause of people traveling, because they see captivating pictures and detailed articles about places. You can learn about any place you want on a computer. Doesn't that sound really nice? I'm sure there is one place you've always been eager to learn about! Finally, computers allow people to interact with other people around the world. You can talk with your long - lost friend who lives in @LOCATION2 just by the simple click of the mouse (send). In a recent study, over @PERCENT1 of people just talk online to their friends rather than going out to meet them. How incredibly convenient! Also, expert computer teacher, @PERSON1, says, ""Computers are great if you can't meet someone, you just talk online"". Have you ever needed to cancel a meeting? Computers are really beneficial to busy people. Now readers, @CAPS1, imagine you're sitting on that same couch. You look at the @CAPS2 to see @LOCATION1, you quickly type it into your laptop and an interesting article appears right in front of you. You read more about it, learning something new in every paragraph. All of a sudden, you lose your grip on the laptop, but you catch it just in time. What great hand - eye coordination! Then you remember you were supposed to meet your sister @PERSON3, but you have a hair appointment. You quickly tell her via computer that you can't meet her. She says it's alright and you guys keep chatting. It all worked out so smoothly! It's so simple! Computers teach hand - eye coordination, let you learn about more places, and interact with more people. So what are you waiting for, readers? Get out there and get a computer."
1318	1322	1	3	"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1, what do you feel about the advantages and disadvantages of owning a computer? I think that computers help in many different ways. Computers teach hand - eye coordination, help us learn, and we can even talk online with friends and family. Do you ever think about how a computer can help you physically? Many parents often state that, ""@CAPS2 spend too much time on the computer!"" but what they don't know is that the computer is actually teaching them hand - eye coordination. Parents argue that kids gain more weight because they sit inside on the computer. But if they implement certain measures to limit the @CAPS2's computer time, like only allowing them to go on certain educational games, limiting their time on the computer, or making them play outside the same amount of time they were on the computer, the kids could be learning while still staying fit. This is why a computer could be an extremely important part of a child's life if used properly. What is your method of learning? Maybe you read books, go to school or even watch @CAPS3. But what if you aren't at school, or don't have any books around? What if your @CAPS3 isn't telling you what you need to know? Well, with a computer, you can look up almost anything with just a few clicks of a button. If you don't have time to take a trip to your local library to get a book, how would you learn? As a teen who attends school, I know that I would not be able to do a lot of my school work and projects without my computer. A lot of the at - home jobs today require computers, and without the computers, the job would not be getting done efficiently. This is why I think computers benefit our society and knowledge. Does everyone you know live in one area? Probably not. This is why websites like @CAPS5 and @CAPS6 are getting more and more members each day. The internet helps us keep in touch with relatives, friends and even helps us meet new people. I know that the internet helps me keep in touch with old friends. In conclusion, computers, when used correctly, can be a valuable asset in our lives, enhancing our learning, physical skills and social connections."
1319	1323	1	3	Dear, @CAPS1 - @ORGANIZATION1, Computers... they are sometimes bad and sometimes good; they're like people. Computers are helpful in finding information, making your work much less difficult. But at the same time, they're not so healthy for you and your family. Computers have so much information that the newspaper in the future will no longer be well - known. Newspapers will no longer be thrown at your front porch. Because of computers, instead of getting information of what happened yesterday in the area you live, with the computer you can find out what interesting things happened yesterday in the whole world. But thanks to computers, life is one step easier. If someone had a science project, about, as an example, cells. With that computer, it will help a lot more than you might initially think. No need to write all sloppily; just type about cells, which you can find easily on the internet, print it out, and it's done. It just makes life way easier than just writing, drawing and finding information of cells in a book, which would waste good time that could be spent going outside and playing with friends and family. Computers, like I said, are sometimes bad, like people, and it's also like a drug. Because look at computers when people go on websites like MySpace, Twitter, Facebook, communication websites or game websites; there are way too many to name. It's a drug because it causes you to stay on it day to night. You'll get stuck to it and can't get enough of it, and some people won't stop. It hurts their family, friends and especially their health, just like drugs, which cause all the same negative effects. In conclusion, we should be aware of both the positive and negative aspects of computers. We need to use them properly to enjoy their benefits while minimizing the harm they can bring.
1320	1324	1	3	Dear local Newspaper, I think people using a computer has a positive effect. Using a computer can help people in many ways. You can talk to people worldwide, it helps you stay organized, and you can create very useful things like a brochure or a power - point using a computer. Talking to people worldwide can be a very useful thing. Say that you have family members that live in @LOCATION1 or @LOCATION2. You can keep in touch with them by e - mail or video chat. Also, if there is a national emergency and a governor needs to talk to other governors around the world for advice and help, he can do that quickly and easily. Using a computer can also help you stay organized. For example, my uncle, who works in file - keeping, uses a computer to make sure all of the files get saved and they are in the right places. Imagine all of the papers and the large amount of space he would use if he had to do it by hand or didn't use a computer. Computers also help teachers. Teachers enter grades, e - mail parents, and even create tests or quizzes. They know it will be nice and neatly organized in the computer files instead of in paper files on their desks. Speaking of quizzes that teachers make on the computer, they can also make a lot of other things like power - points. Power - points can help them put a large amount of information on the screen and it helps the students learn more effectively, which is a positive effect. If you had a small business that just started out, you can make a well - designed brochure to help with advertising. Lastly, you can go on Microsoft Excel and make a detailed schedule that can help your employees know who has to work when, or students can know what class they have to be in at what time. In conclusion, computers are very helpful in everyday life for a lot of different people. Talking to people worldwide can help you stay in touch, so you don't lose connection with your loved ones. They also have a positive effect as they help business people stay organized. Lastly, they can help teachers create tests or power - points which helps kids learn. So in all, I would have to agree that computers have a positive effect on society. Also, doesn't typing your newspaper articles make it more organized and quicker to print them? This clearly shows that computers are an essential part of our modern life and bring numerous benefits.
1321	1325	1	3	"Dear Local Newspaper, the topic of @ORGANIZATION1 has been a hot - button discussion around the @LOCATION1 for decades now. People remain deeply divided on whether computers are a great privilege to society or if they're gradually dragging it down year after year. I firmly believe that computers do have a positive effect on people. This is because they teach hand - eye coordination, offer in - depth knowledge about cultures around the world, and enable people to communicate with one another effectively. Do you think the downsides really outweigh these numerous positives?  Hand - eye coordination is not an innate ability. You acquire it as you grow older and gain practice. Computers play a crucial role in achieving this goal. ""@PERCENT1 of people who go on the @ORGANIZATION1 frequently were horrible at catching a baseball before using the @ORGANIZATION1, and after, they caught every time,"" says biologist @PERSON1. And it's not just about baseball; it also helps with other sports such as juggling, golf, or tennis. If you become very skilled at these sports, you can play them for fun or even pursue a professional career. Who would have thought that playing on the @ORGANIZATION1 could open so many doors in life?  Did you know that, according to ""Time"" magazine, people who use the @ORGANIZATION1 are better able to focus on tasks, like schoolwork, because it makes your hands and eyes work in harmony? And everyone knows that if you get good grades in school, you'll be qualified for almost any job. Then, you can earn a good income and live your dream life!  ""Oh, great, another @NUM1 - hour day of school. Hhmm. What do I have first block? @LOCATION3 history. What? Yes! We're doing a culture project! That means I can easily go on the @ORGANIZATION1 and find out great things about the place I'm assigned."" That's another advantage of computers: easy access to tons of useful information. I have cheerleading every day after school until @NUM2. If I have a project, I don't have hours to search through books to find what I need. Computers allow me to do my sport and still get a good grade in school. @PERCENT2 of people use computers to do their informational work about far - away places. It's faster and more accurate. You could search through your bookshelf for an almanac. But once you find it, you need to check the copyright. Hopefully, it's recent. If not, you're in trouble. Would you really want to rummage through more shelves to be accurate?  Facebook, @CAPS1, @CAPS2. All are new ways to communicate with people. It's just another useful effect on people. Forgot to write down your homework? Hopefully, your friend didn't, and you can just ask them. ""@PERCENT3 of people don't chat with others online,"" says the @LOCATION2 @ORGANIZATION1 expert. Most of these chats are for various reasons, such as homework, what happened that day, or how they haven't seen each other in a long time. Don't you chat with people online? Trust me, it can save your grades. Maybe this will help you conclude that computers have a positive effect on society because of hand - eye coordination, access to information, and communication. What would we do without them?"
1322	1326	1	3	"Dear trained readers, @CAPS1't you agree that more and more people are using computers these days? Well, I @CAPS2 because they offer us the information we want to access. Recently, it has come to my attention that some people, including those who @CAPS3 themselves, don't really use computers. Without a doubt, I firmly believe that people who don't use computers should start to do so. However, I can understand why some people don't use them. Maybe they don't know how to use one, have better things to @CAPS2, or can't afford one.  First of @CAPS5, some people don't know how to use a computer. I remember when my friend came over and I was on a computer. He @CAPS4, ""@CAPS2 you know that some people don't know how to use a computer?"" And I @CAPS4, ""@CAPS3 who?"" Then he @CAPS4, ""@CAPS3 me, I don't know how to use one."" I @CAPS4, ""Well, I'll teach you."" Since then, all my friend does is go on the computer. One day, he said to me that because of this, he wants to work with computers. This is one of the reasons why some people don't use computers.  Second of @CAPS5, some people claim to have better things to @CAPS2. For example, someone might have a game scheduled. In my case, I usually don't have much time to go on the computer. I often have a basketball game or practice. When I get home from practice, I feel exhausted. All I want to @CAPS2 is go to @CAPS6. Parents might also feel the same way, not wanting to @CAPS2 anything. I'll tell you why. Because they've been busy @CAPS2 all day. This is another reason why some people don't use computers.  Third of @CAPS5, some people can't afford a computer. Some families don't have a lot of money to buy a computer. They have to save it to be able to afford a house. When their children ask for something, parents shouldn't always buy it, but they do so to avoid hurting their children's feelings. When I'm a @CAPS7, I'm going to make sure I have enough money to buy a computer. If not, then that child might be out of luck. So, don't go around bragging about your computer because some people can't afford one. This is my last reason why some people don't use computers.  This is why some people don't use computers nowadays. They either don't know how to use one, have something better to @CAPS2, or can't afford one. By the way, @PERCENT1 of the pupils of @ORGANIZATION1 don't have computers. In conclusion, although computers offer many benefits, these barriers prevent some people from using them, but solutions can be found to help them join the digital world."
1323	1327	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1, I am writing to express my opinion on the impact of computers on society. While I believe that computers are very useful tools for learning and communication, people today are overusing them. You know what I mean, @NUM1 gamers, @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 addicts, or those who will do anything just to spend time on the computer. People like the @CAPS4 don't spend enough time with family members or friends. They don't get enough exercise, and frankly, abusing computers is not good for your life, either physically or socially.  Some people work long hours, leaving early in the morning and getting back late, so they rarely spend time with their loved ones. But if you're hooked on the computer, as so many of us are, you @MONTH1 just not spend enough quality time with family and friends. Using a computer isn't exactly a social activity. It's just one person with a mouse, a keyboard, and a monitor. You @MONTH1 say, ""@CAPS5, but there are also online social networks."" True, but how often do you actually see those people in real life? Computers can steal precious time from you that you could be sharing with your family and friends. That definitely doesn't benefit society.  A major drawback of computers is that you usually have to be indoors. So, you can't be online chatting, playing a game, or checking your email while enjoying the beauty of the outdoors. Sure, you could use a laptop outside, but are you really immersing yourself in the outdoors? Computers and the outdoors don't mix well, just like chocolate milk and fillet mignon. That's why pine trees don't have outlets (although you never know what they'll come up with next).  Another side - effect, related to the issue of computers and the outdoors, is the lack of exercise. It's quite difficult to use a computer and jump rope at the same time. When you live like a computer vegetable, you're not getting enough exercise as you could or should. This is yet another reason why computers can lower your quality of life.  Now, if you use the computer sparingly, only when you need to or when it's necessary, you won't experience these ""side - effects."" But face it, the truth is, computers can be addictive. Whether you're waiting for a friend to come online or trying to reach level @NUM2 of ""@CAPS7 @CAPS8"", they can get you hooked.  The idea of this article is not to stop you from using computers but to ensure that you use them in moderation, just like you'd eat double - fudge brownies with walnuts and cream cheese frosting - sparingly. So, now you know that when computers are used excessively, at obsessive amounts, they're similar to drugs in terms of their addictiveness. As long as you use them correctly, they are a very valuable tool. In conclusion, be mindful of your computer usage to maintain a healthy and balanced life."
1324	1328	1	3	I believe computers are a good thing for several compelling reasons. Three key reasons why computers are beneficial are that they allow you to communicate with other people, help you meet new people, and are useful for planning.  My first reason why computers are good is that they enable you to communicate with other people. My parents use e - mail constantly. They talk to my grandparents, their friends, and even use it to arrange events with other people. I've seen them use it when someone is ill, and I know some people use it to learn about magazine subscriptions and other things to buy. My favorite thing is that my parents use e - mail to discuss my birthday presents with my grandparents.  My second reason why computers are a great asset is that you can use them to meet new people. I'm aware that there are a lot of websites that match you with someone based on your interests and activities. You can also use e - mail to chat with friends, and they @MONTH1 want to meet you again, allowing you to make new acquaintances this way. There are thousands of ways to meet new people online, such as using chat websites or platforms like Facebook or MySpace.  My third and final reason why computers are good is that you can use them to plan a vacation or make dining reservations. For example, my family and I went on vacation to @LOCATION1, and my mom made all the reservations from our computer at home. My parents aren't the only ones. Many people travel during vacations, and probably @NUM1 out of every @NUM2 people use a computer to reserve hotels.  Let's consider the other side, without computers. If we didn't have computers, we'd have to send mail through the post office, and by the time it reaches your house, something significant like a new baby being born could have occurred. Plus, we'd have to do bills and taxes without the help of computer software. My parents' lives and mine would be extremely chaotic if we didn't have computers.  Once again, I believe computers are good, and more than half of America uses them. I believe this because you can use them to talk to family members who @MONTH1 be far away. You can meet new people through online dating services. Then there's the always - helpful planning aspect, where you can go online and reserve a hotel or a dinner at a restaurant. Plus, if we didn't have computers, we'd have to do bills and taxes the old - fashioned way, where you add, subtract, and divide by hand. It's much more efficient to use a computer. In conclusion, computers have become an indispensable part of our lives, offering numerous benefits in communication, socializing, and planning.
1325	1329	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I believe computers don't benefit society. I feel this way due to the lack of social skills, no exercise, and their addictive nature. Read on for further explanation.  Firstly, spending long hours on the computer gives you virtually no social skills. When you're online, you can think before you reply, and most people talk or write very differently online than in person. People can even pretend to be someone else. Online, you can erase what you've written, but in real - life conversations, you can't. That's why spending all this time talking online won't help you develop social skills.  Next, you get no exercise. On a beautiful @DATE1, you'll be inside on the computer when you could be outside getting some exercise. Sitting online, doing nothing but talking, makes you lazy. When you're older, you'll need to engage in physical activities. You can't just spend all these long hours sitting in front of the computer. Furthermore, you should allocate time for both computer use and exercise.  Finally, computers are addictive. Some people can spend hours and hours on the computer looking up videos. Seven out of ten teenagers would rather be inside on the computer talking to people than meeting new people elsewhere. I think parents should limit their children's time on computers. All this time spent having fun on the computer could be used for studying or doing something that will benefit you in the future.  In conclusion, I firmly believe computers don't benefit society. I feel this way because of the lack of social skills, no exercise, and their addictive nature. I think some people should restrict their time on the computer and spend more time doing something important. By being more mindful of our computer usage, we can lead healthier and more well - rounded lives.
1326	1330	1	3	Dear editor of the @LOCATION1, @CAPS1, did you know that @PERCENT1 of people in @LOCATION3 own computers! It's truly astonishing when you think about it. Could you even begin to imagine a life without them? Computers truly do benefit society in numerous ways. I can't even remember the last time I went a single day without using a computer. All of this talk about computers being bad for society really got me thinking. There's absolutely no way possible that computers are bad. For example, computers are excellent for developing motor skills. And what about schoolwork? Computers are incredibly helpful when you forget your homework log at school. And lastly, let's talk about sociability! I don't know about you, but I simply couldn't live without computers! Computers teach hand - eye coordination, which we all know is essential for playing sports! Also, with all the typing you do, there's definitely some exercise for your wrists! I should know because I injured both my wrists at the same time. When I went to rehab, they told me I should try getting my wrists back to normal by typing and having an adequate amount of calcium, but that's another story. Computers are also great for school. Say you forget your homework log at school, so you don't know what you had for homework. Well, you could call a friend, but wouldn't it be so much easier to go online to the teacher's webpage? Teachers always have their homeworks listed on a school web page. And then, you realize you forgot your mathbook too! Have no fear, the online textbook is here! And that's a lot easier than going back to the school to get it! Don't you think? Lastly, when you have a big project, you can do research on anything and everything in the world! From ants to @LOCATION2, it's all there. Here's a big benefit to society for you. On all of the social networking sites such as Facebook, MySpace, and so many more, aren't you able to leave comments on friends' profiles or even chat with them! Which brings me to my next topic, chatting on the computer! There is @CAPS2, and like I said before, you can even chat on social networking sites. And let's say that you aren't able to watch the news. Can't you go online and check that too! There are so many social things to do on the computer, and those are just some of them. So I hope those @PERCENT1 of people and even people that don't own computers are on my side. So we can prove that computers are good for motor skills, school work, and even social networking. So please be on my side so we can show the public that computers are indeed social and beneficial.
1327	1331	1	3	Computers were built to help people make tasks easier and quicker. Since their inception, they have been updated over and over again until what they are today. Computers are a part of most people's everyday lives and are essential to most businesses. But the common question in our society is, are computers really benefitting us? My answer is a resounding yes. Computers do many wonderful things for us. They teach us hand - eye coordination, give us the ability to research effectively, and recently, have become a great way of communication. @CAPS1's are definitely benefitting us. One reason why computers help us is by teaching hand - eye coordination. In a well - known magazine I read, one expert, (@PERSON1), said that learning to type without looking is a great way of improving reflexes. The speed at which you type is improved with consistent practice. Another way it improves hand - eye coordination is by learning to click and react to different things effectively. I'm often amused by playing games on the computer. These games usually are quite challenging, but with my improving hand - eye coordination, I'm learning how to play these games well. My father always tells me to learn my way through a computer because they are our future. Soon, mostly everything will be done by them. With the improving technology, it's impossible for it not to be beneficial to our society. Our home computers have been great at teaching me things like hand - eye coordination. Another reason why computers are great is by making that tough history paper just a click away. My grandfather always tells me how easy I have it. Instead of going to the @CAPS2 and having to painstakingly pick out a book, I just go to Google and have an entire search engine in front of me. When we go into high school, we will need a computer to succeed. To keep our essays organized, our research effective, and the clear - to - read typing right in front of us. My brother tells me that having a computer is the best investment he's ever made. Last year, we had a science assignment to figure out how our heart beats faster. This was very easy considering I typed it in and had hundreds of ways to increase my pulse rate. Computers have truly changed the way we research and finish schoolwork. The last reason why computers are fantastic is because they make communication just a click away. A couple of weeks ago, my coach emailed us that our game time has changed. This doesn't seem like a big thing, but without his @CAPS1, we would've missed the game. My cousin @CAPS3 is from @LOCATION1. I miss my family a lot since I live by myself. With the internet, I can talk to my family whenever I want. My brother tells me that having a computer is the best investment he's ever made. Computers have changed the way we research and finish schoolwork. The last reason why computers are fantastic is because they make communication just a click away. A couple of weeks ago, my coach emailed us that our game time has changed. This doesn't seem like a big thing, but without his @CAPS1, we would've missed the game. My cousin @CAPS3 is from @LOCATION1. Me and him meet only once a year. With that limited time, we can't really get out what we need to. Recently, I bought a webcam and have been chatting with him on it every week. It's almost like he's with me. All the girls in our school can't get enough of me. So I get home after sports, go on, and there's always enough of me to go around. Webcamming is a great way of communication. With all the new computer advancements going on sale and new appliances coming, no one knows when it will stop. Well, the question still lingers, are computers beneficial to our society? The answer @MONTH1 may never come about clearly, but at least for me, improving hand - eye coordination, making research a breeze, and having communication just a click away is a pretty sweet deal. So for now, I firmly stand by the opinion that computers are great and extremely useful to everyone.
1328	1332	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1, I am writing to you to let you know my opinion on computers and technologies. Computers have now become an integral part of our society and culture, and they are very important for the following reasons. First, computers let you surf online anytime you want. Second, computers allow people to talk online. First reason why computers are so critical in our culture is that computers let you surf online anywhere and anytime you want. This is incredibly convenient. Imagine if you live far away from the nearest library and you have to write a research paper. Jane lives @NUM1 miles away from her town library. Her mother could drive her there, but what if she isn't at home or is driving someone else to a doctor's appointment? This is when computers come in extremely handy. Jane can simply go online and do the research! Not only that, but also, ""www.internetsocool.gov"" states that the information you can find in a regular library is about @NUM2 of the information you can find online. Secondly, computers let you talk with people both far - away and nearby online and video - chat. This is very useful for me. Since I live by myself in @LOCATION1, I miss my family a great deal. Although with the internet, I can talk to my family whenever I want! Also, you can video chat with your lab partner to discuss how you can make the lab report better! @PERSON1, the author of ""@CAPS2 @CAPS3"", also states in his book that over @NUM3 million people use the internet to video - chat for educational purposes. In conclusion, video - chatting @MONTH1 might sound like something to do for fun, but it is actually used for many good purposes. On the other hand, some people say that computers are bad. Some say that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising and spending time with their family. Although, ""The @DATE1 survey of what people do"" states that @PERCENT1 of people who use computers are healthy both physically and emotionally. Just because we use computers to make our life easier, it does not mean that we don't value spending time with family. In conclusion, computers are very crucial in our culture because they can let you surf online and help you interact with people who live far away. We should embrace their benefits while also being mindful of how we use them."
1329	1333	1	3	"Do you think computers are handy? I firmly believe they are very handy. Computers offer many great things like online shopping, @CAPS1, and even @CAPS2.V. Online shopping can be extremely helpful. Say you don't have a car. Well, you can go online and buy whatever you need at the store. There's a function that @CAPS3 and @CAPS4 offer where you order your @CAPS5 online, and they drop it off at your doorstep. Say you need clothes, shoes, or maybe even games. You can go online, find what you want, click ""buy"", and choose your shipping option. That's why I think computers are so helpful when it comes to shopping. Chatting on the computer is also great. Now, Facebook, @CAPS6, and @CAPS7 are the social networking sites that rate at the top. On @CAPS6, you can follow famous people like @PERSON1, the @CAPS9 @CAPS10 @CAPS11 receiver. Facebook has fan pages for famous people. @CAPS7 might actually have famous people's accounts. Chatting has become something that almost @PERCENT1 of the @CAPS13 uses. You might believe it's pointless, but almost the whole @CAPS13 uses it. You can also use webcam @CAPS1, where you can actually see the person you're talking to, and they can see you too. @CAPS1 is also good if you're always on the go and you can't talk on the phone. Then you can send messages in @CAPS1. This is why I find @CAPS1 to be such a necessity. @CAPS17 is a new thing that has recently hit the @CAPS13 @CAPS11 @CAPS15. There are sites such as @LOCATION1 or @CAPS16 @CAPS17. Also, you can buy @ORGANIZATION1 league @CAPS18 or @ORGANIZATION2 @CAPS17, and you can watch live sports games from your computer. This is also very convenient when maybe you're in the car for a long road trip. Then you turn on your laptop and watch any show you might want. @CAPS17 on the go is technology at its highest point. That's why computers are so convenient in so many aspects of our lives. So now you have read how helpful, how it's a necessity, and how the computer is convenient. Now, one day if you need one of these things, remember this and check out the hottest sites on the @CAPS15. Computers truly are a remarkable invention that enriches our daily lives."
1330	1334	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, Computers are an amazing piece of technology. They were built to make our tasks easier and more efficient. Since their creation, they have been continuously updated and improved to what they are today. But some people are beginning to abuse the @CAPS2. There are numerous benefits to having a computer. In my opinion, I think that computers help people out a great deal, such as looking up directions or even chatting with some old friends. But many people are abusing the @CAPS2 and don't know when to get off. The @CAPS2 is a very fun thing to be on, but when you're on it for too long, you miss out on family activities, hanging out with friends, etc. I think that there should be a reasonable time limit for everyone on the computer. If we had something that would shut off the computer but save everything you were doing, people would go out more and be more active. Even though people might be learning about things on the computer, you have to know when to step away. Now, on the @CAPS2, there are websites where you can watch exercise videos or if you even want to buy some exercise equipment, etc. The @CAPS2 can be a very handy thing, but you don't want to be on it for long periods of time. I believe that having a computer can be a very cool and useful thing when you need it. However, there should be time limits for how long people stay on the computer. By setting these limits, we can ensure that we enjoy the benefits of computers while also maintaining a healthy balance in our lives.
1331	1335	1	3	Dear Local news paper, my name is @PERSON1, I'm part of the middle - class community. I read in the local newspaper that lots of people use computers, and not everyone agrees that this benefits society. In my opinion, this benefits society in many ways because you can work anywhere you want. Nowadays, a cellphone and iPods come with internet access and many of the tools you need to work, just like those on a computer. We also have laptops that are portable and can be taken anywhere. You can also connect with family. There are many programs on a computer to connect with family in other states or cities, such as in @LOCATION2, @LOCATION3, @CAPS2, @CAPS3, and @LOCATION1. Last, it gives you the ability to learn about other places and people through photos, information, and websites. For example, when it comes to knowing the strategies that have happened in other states, like the one that happened in @LOCATION4. This is my opinion on why computers are beneficial for society. Thanks for reading this, and have a nice day.
1332	1336	1	3	"Dear local newspaper, A question that recently came to my attention is whether people are spending too much time on the computer, and if this is a good thing. I believe that computers are a good electronic item to have. I think this because it helps people learn. Also, people can keep in touch with their friends even if they live in a different country. In addition, it can help people or students be more efficient. Please consider this in our newspaper. Would you like students/people to have internet and searches that can help them learn? The answer is ""yes"". Having computers can help students learn. They can go onto @LOCATION2 and type in any question they want to be answered. Picture this: a child has a question that she wants answered, but she is embarrassed to ask her parents. She can simply type the question in on her computer and get hundreds of answers. There is nobody in the world that knows everything, but there are computers that can provide a vast amount of information. When my mom was little, she didn't have access to a computer all the time. So, when she had a question, she would have to ask somebody she knew. If they didn't know the answer, then she couldn't find out. If more people had computers, then they would get answers to questions. Computers are a good way to keep in touch with people. There are programs such as @CAPS2, @CAPS3, AIM, etc. My dad owns a business and needs to be in touch with people throughout the day. So, he uses his iPhone to talk to them by email. It helps my dad know when papers are due and who is asking about what. I asked ten adults if they think everyone should have access to a computer, and ten out of ten said ""yes"". Many people think that friends and family are important and should stay in touch every now and then. I have a friend who lives in @LOCATION1, but I can't contact her with my phone because our plans don't allow us to talk. So, we talk on @CAPS2 all the time. Even if people don't own phones, they can still stay in contact with computers if they are far away. Do you have perfect handwriting? The answer is probably no. People use @ORGANIZATION1 all the time because their handwriting isn't perfect. Computers help people stay organized. Computers have numerous folders and programs to store information you need. This all stays neatly organized on the computer. My friend just got a computer for her office. Before she got it, she had everything in a mess on her desk, filled with papers. But after she got a computer, she typed everything neatly and kept all her papers in the folders of her computer. She was so organized and clean that she got promoted. My friend's mom changed because she got a computer. She became more organized and cleaner. Picture this: you are overwhelmed by all the papers on your desk. You don't know what paper is what. Well, if you had a computer, you could type everything and keep them in your computer files. Also, @PERCENT1 of adults think staying organized is good. I know you, the local newspaper, have a very hard job and decision to make. I believe that computers are good and helpful. Because they can help people find information they need. Also, they can keep people in touch with business workers, friends, students, family, etc. In addition, computers can help people get organized. Please consider putting my essay in the newspaper."
1333	1337	1	3	Are people today spending too much time on computers? If so, how does it affect them? In our modern - day, people spend too much time on computers. Both I and others think that this is affecting people in many different ways. Some of the ways it affects them are in terms of health, social life, and education. Spending too much time on a PC can affect your health in many ways. For example, when people spend all their time sitting in a chair, they have a chance of gaining weight. Also, when you are focused on the computer, you might not go to the grocery store to get the fruits and veggies you need. You might just want to stay in front of the computer. Regarding social life, if you are constantly on the computer, you could miss out on interactions with the people around you. You might also gradually lose touch with them. Another big problem is education. If you are on the computer all day, you might not be interested in anything that is not on the computer. Those are some of the reasons why I think people shouldn't spend too much time on the computer. In conclusion, it's important for people to balance their computer use to maintain good health, a rich social life, and a proper education.
1334	1338	1	3	"Dear @LOCATION1 Newspaper: I am writing to you about my opinion on the effects computers have on people. Computers have a positive affect on people because they help students as well as many others study, they allow you to access stores by shopping online, and computers allow people to communicate. After reading this letter, I assure you that you will agree with me. The first reason why computers have a positive affect on people is because they help students as well as many other people study. If you have a test or quiz in @CAPS1, you can go on your computer and print out @CAPS1 practice sheets. Or if you have a vocabulary exam, you can find the definitions fast and easy on the computer. In the times of @ORGANIZATION1, a statistic shows that @PERCENT2 of students in the @ORGANIZATION2 find computers their best studying tool. They find it effective and fast to use. Last night, I had a test on the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 and I went online, typed in ""The @CAPS3 @CAPS4"", and found @MONTH1 helpful sites on it. It was useful and did not waste my time. Using a computer for studying is a very good reason why it positively affects people and makes them happier, but there is an even greater one. Secondly, computers have a positive affect on people because it saves people time by shopping online. So many stores now allow you to purchase stock online. It is easy, with a click of a button, and saves you time driving to the stores. In @ORGANIZATION1, it shows that @PERCENT1 of @ORGANIZATION1 across the @ORGANIZATION2 said shopping online improved their lives by making it less hectic from driving from store to store. Shopping online creates a positive, less - hectic life for many people around the world. Online shopping having a positive affect on people by making their lives less busy is a great reason, but there is one last even greater one. The last most important reason why computers have a positive impact on people is because it allows people to communicate with each other. Communication through computers is extremely popular. With instant messaging, email, or even Blackboard, a new teacher - student communication site, computers are often being used for communication. I surveyed @NUM1 kids and @NUM2 said that computers are their main source of communication. Communication through computers has a positive affect on people in many ways, like making it easier to communicate for work, to talk to your best friend on email who just moved to @LOCATION2, or to simply send out invitations for a party to all your friends. Computers have made life easier for many through communication, making a positive effect on them. This is why communication having a positive affect on people is the most important reason. To conclude, computers have a positive effect on people because it allows them to study easier, saves people time by shopping online, and allows people to communicate. With all the ways computers help us, there is no reason why they would negatively affect us. I know that you will take this into consideration. Computers are making our lives easier day by day, and who knows what they will be able to do in the future."
1335	1339	1	3	"Would you rather read six books to get that one recipe, or would you rather look it up in less than ten minutes? I think computers have a positive effect on people. You can learn about places you want to visit this @DATE1, you can find what you need in minutes, and you can talk to your friends online. Computers have a positive effect on people because you can learn about places you want to visit this @DATE1. For example, @PERSON5 wanted to visit @LOCATION2 this @DATE1, but when he looked online, he saw how @LOCATION2 just had an earthquake, so he changed his plans for this @DATE1. Similarly, @PERSON2 said, ""I wanted to go to @LOCATION3 this @DATE1, but I didn't know much about it. So, I searched on Google and decided that this @DATE1 I will go to @LOCATION3."" That is one positive way computers affect people because you can learn about places you want to visit in the @DATE1. Computers have a positive effect on people because you can quickly find what you need in minutes. For example, @PERSON3 was looking for a cake recipe. He was looking through many cookbooks but couldn't find it. So, he took out his laptop and found it in under five minutes. Computer expert @PERSON1 said, ""Instead of rummaging through books and books for information you need, why not go to the computer? Trust me, it's much faster."" Also, computers have a good effect on people because you can talk to your friends online. For example, @PERSON6 said, ""I moved from @CAPS4 to @LOCATION1 and I was sad to leave my best - friend, but now I know how I can talk to her on @CAPS5."" Moreover, @PERSON4 was in bed sick and couldn't go outside to visit his friends, so he kept in touch with them on @CAPS7. Computers have a positive effect on people because you can learn about places you want to visit this @DATE1, you can find what you need in minutes, and you can talk to your friends online. Just remember, as computer expert @PERSON1 said, ""It's much easier."" In conclusion, computers clearly bring many positive aspects to our lives, making our @DATE1 more convenient and connected."
1336	1340	1	3	Computers are an incredibly important part of many people's lifestyles. They can give us wonderful facts and news that would otherwise be hard to obtain. For instance, through various search engines and reliable news platforms, we can access in - depth information on a wide range of topics. Computers also allow people an easy way to communicate with friends and family without using a phone. You can simply log in to social media platforms or messaging apps to start a conversation. Lastly, computers are an incredibly useful tool for writing. One of the most beneficial parts of computers is that you can find out what's happening anywhere in the world. For example, I could use a search engine to look up recent disasters and find hundreds of articles on @CAPS1 and other recent news. However, you could also find out interesting facts like how many people have chosen to sail around the world in the past ten years. But this is just one of the many uses a computer has. Critics @MONTH1 think that the use of computers interferes with spending time with your friends and family. But computers can actually do the opposite. There are many websites that allow you to talk safely to people. Some of those well - known websites are Facebook and Chatme.com. Did you know that you can even video chat with people? It's just like you're right there with them. Incredibly, unlike calling people and using a phone, using these websites is free and open to anyone. This brings me to the last point. Computers are great writing tools. They allow you to write efficiently and neatly. Also, programs like Microsoft Word allow you to spell - check your work. However, one of the most useful qualities of a program like Word is that it allows you to change your work and add sentences or words wherever you want. As you can see, computers are a useful and beneficial part of society. They allow people to easily stay informed on world news. Secondly, computers allow easy and safe communication between people, and lastly, they are useful for writing papers such as writing prompts. I hope that by reading this, you can now see some of the many uses of computers and appreciate their value in our daily lives.
1337	1341	1	3	"Today, wherever you go, there is technology being used. The most common, computers are widely used by a majority of people, but are computers really beneficial to society? Computers are beneficial to society because it is a way to connect with the world, a way to increase responsibility, and helpful for education. Computers are beneficial because they help people connect with the world. You can use a computer to find anything that is on the web, so you can find detailed information about places that interest you or places that you would like to visit. You can explore virtual tours, read travel blogs, and view high - quality images. According to the @ORGANIZATION1, @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people check the internet for places to @ORGANIZATION1 to before they actually go. Moreover, it is a way to connect with faraway friends. One of my friends moved to @LOCATION1 when we were in @NUM3 grade, but we still e - mail each other regularly, sharing our daily lives and are still good friends. The computer is also one of the fastest ways you can learn about current events. All you have to do is go to a well - known news website. All of these connections will widen people's views of the world. Computers are a way to increase responsibility, too. When people use the computer, there are many choices that they have to make, like what reliable websites to go to and what safe content to download or watch. Having these individual chances will help people think of what the right choice is. Even if you choose the wrong choice, you will learn from your mistake. Second, the computer is a very fragile machine and it takes a lot of care to handle. For example, you can't have any liquid nearby and must not throw objects near or on the computer. Thinking of this and making sure not to damage the computer are ways to increase responsibility. Lastly, computers are beneficial because they help education. Teachers can use the computer to make lessons more interesting. For example, they can create engaging points and presentations to provide a better learning experience. Students can review what they learned at school. Additionally, you can make online resources for the students, which provide them with their homework and information about the classes. One of my friends once said ""@CAPS2 the I would definitely be failing"". Nobody wants to talk and a great way to present this. Lastly, if you want information on a particular school, you can just search it online and find its website. School websites have detailed information about classes, events, and clubs. They provide the information that you need to think about going to that school in an easy, convenient way. While finding the website for the school takes no more than @NUM2 minutes, actually going to that school for information can take more than just @NUM2 minutes, and even hours. According to @ORGANIZATION2, @NUM1 out of @NUM2 students choose what college to go to first by checking its website. The computer is an easy, convenient way to get information. Now, no one should be doubting the benefits of a computer. They are a connection to the world, like places, and people. They increase responsibility by giving you many choices. They help education by providing information about and for schools. This is why computers are an indispensable part of our society."
1338	1342	1	3	Do you think people spend too much time on the computer? I think that kids and adults spend too much time gaming, tweeting, doing Facebook and MySpace. My reasons include that people should go outside more, play with real people, and spend time with family. Most kids should go outside more. For example, my friend @PERSON3 spent @NUM1 hours a day! on his computer and hardly ever went outside. He became pale and lacked the energy that outdoor activities could bring. Another example is my neighbor @PERSON2. He spent all day! in his basement playing on his computer and never went outside. Since he never went outside, he is terribly afraid of the sun and he is now @NUM2 years old and still doesn't go outside. It was because he spent too much time on the computer. Secondly, people should play with real people. For example, there was a kid named @CAPS2 and he always played with virtual people and friends and never real people. Now he is so shy around real people that he won't even say one word. Another example is @CAPS3. He only had virtual friends and never a real one. He is so depressed because he never had a best friend to share his joys and sorrows with in person. Thirdly, you should spend time with your family. There was a person named @CAPS4 and he never spent time with his family because he was too busy writing emails. @PERSON1 says that kids who don't interact with their family won't have the same benefits as kids who do. Another example, there was a family who were too busy with the computer that the kids never met the grandparents. When the grandparents passed away, the kids never met them because they would rather play on their computers. In conclusion, people should go outside more, play with real people, and visit their family. Then, if you want to play on your computer, you can do so after balancing your real - life interactions. By doing this, you can lead a more fulfilling and well - rounded life.
1339	1343	1	3	"Many people use computers. Some people agree that it benefits the society and others disagree. Some experts think people are spending too much time on the computers, and less time exercising, playing outside, and having family time. I think differently. Computers help us with hand - eye coordination for jobs, stay in touch with family members and friends, and computers also help us learn about different things. Computers help us with many things but the most important is jobs. Many jobs, such as graphic design, programming, and data analysis, use computers extensively. In order to get a job using computers, you need good hand - eye coordination which computers teach us. When you type on the keyboard, move the mouse, or interact with touch - screen devices, you are improving this skill. Computers prepare us with skills we are going to need when we get jobs. They are very helpful in enhancing our employability. Computers also help us stay in touch with our family members and friends. @PERSON2 @CAPS1 of @LOCATION1 says that if we didn't have computers, @CAPS2 wouldn't have been able to see her niece and nephew open their Christmas presents @CAPS2 got them. Through video calls, @CAPS2 could share that special moment with them. @CAPS2 also wouldn't have seen her nephew take his first steps. ""Technology is wonderful"" @CAPS2 explained to me. @CAPS2 loves staying in touch with her family through computers. Computers are also helpful for young children to old adults to learn new things. Computers hold a vast amount of information. Many people learn things they have never heard of on the internet. My younger sister @PERSON1 learned how to read on the computer. She used interactive reading apps and educational websites. @CAPS2 is in the highest reading level you can be in, in first grade. Computers are very helpful at learning new things. Computers can do many things. They help us with getting jobs by teaching us hand - eye coordination. They can also help us keep in touch with our loved ones. Computers teach us about interesting things like faraway places and people. Computers are a wonderful thing to have in our society. Experts, there is no reason whatsoever you should be concerned with more and more people using computers. It's a good thing that enriches our lives in multiple ways."
1340	1344	1	3	In the world we live in now, everything is getting technological. In my own opinion, it's a good thing. Using computers has been very helpful to our society. They give people the opportunity to research things fast and easily, they save trees, and they're a wonderful way to communicate with people. First, computers are great to use for research instead of books that waste trees. A few years ago, kids would get a school project on a certain country and the first thing that would come to mind is the library. They would have to search through numerous shelves to find relevant books. But, nowadays it's computers. Sure, of course books are very helpful, but so is the internet. Plus, it's much faster and easier to find the information you're looking for. You can learn about a place before visiting it with a click of a button and learn about places far away. You can access travel guides, historical facts, and local insights. It really is magical. Next, using computers saves trees. With a computer, we don't have to keep cutting down so many trees for books and paper. Many publishers can now sell their books online and people are able to read them right on their devices. Honestly, there really is no reason to keep making a large number of printed books. Even students can do their homework, tests, and quizzes online! I think it's a miracle and it's so amazing to see how much our world has changed in only about @NUM1 years. Finally, computers are great to communicate with people far away. Some people have family in the war who they don't see for months or maybe years. With a computer, you can get emails that get delivered to the person right after being sent. Or you can even webcam and actually see the person face to face! It must be hard not being able to see your loved ones everyday, which is why a computer is very helpful. Even to those who have a family member away on a business trip or that live in another state/country. Computers are very helpful, especially today with everything going on in our world. With computers, we can do online research, save trees, and communicate with people far away. So, in my opinion, computers are an essential part of our society that bring numerous benefits and make our lives more convenient and connected.
1341	1345	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I whole - heartedly agree with the people that support advances in technology. I firmly believe computers have a truly positive effect on people because they can be used to learn, communicate, and entertain. My first reason why computers have a positive effect on people is because they are highly educational. Many narrow - minded people believe computers are good for nothing. However, they can be used for numerous things like in - depth research! For example, if you are a student in a month like June and you need to do a project, computers would be far easier for you to collect comprehensive research than a traditional book. Another reason why computers are educational is because you can use them to read. You can conveniently buy virtual books that you can read right on your computer screen. Not only is that educational but that also helps the environment because you would be saving large amounts of paper. Sometimes you in a particular month might simply be curious about something, and your computer will be right there for you to use. Computers also have another positive effect on people; they can be used for seamless communication. Nobody likes a distant family, but with a computer, you can communicate with family and friends from all over the world! This effect is positive because it helps everyone stay closely in touch. Many people have very busy lives and don't have time to write a letter or make a long - distance phone call. So, instead, those people could just quickly and easily send an email or an instant message to whoever they need to talk to. Some experts are concerned that people spend too much time on the computer and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with both friends and family. These experts don't realize that you can use a computer to interact with friends and family. A computer offers many family - friendly things. You can watch a movie as a family or play multiplayer games together on the computer. Using a computer in this way is a positive effect because while doing activities on the computer as a family, you are in a safe environment. For example, using a computer to be entertained is safer than doing something entertaining outdoors where you and your family would be exposed to many dangers. There are various reasons why I believe computers have a positive effect on people. Computers can be used to learn, communicate, and entertain. Those are only my main reasons; there are many more. And that is why I whole - heartedly support advances in technology and believe computers have a positive effect on people.
1342	1346	1	3	Dear local newspaper from my point of view, computers are extremely beneficial to society and to the people because they help you communicate with people in far - off places or with your family or friends or even meet with people from other countries and you can become good friends. They are also great because they help to develop excellent coordination between your hand and your eye, and they are very helpful because you can easily buy things online. First of all, I think that people who know how to use a computer can effectively communicate with their family in another country or meet new people who then become good friends with you and you can even meet them in person after you know them very well. You can even have real - time conversations with your family through the computers and you won't spend a fortune on expensive international phone calls. Secondly, the computers are very helpful because they help you coordinate your hand and your eye precisely. This helps you because if you are a kid with a big project, you will be able to finish it on time with great efficiency. From your perspective, you can actually see where I'm going because after you finish the project, you can go play with your friends and family on the patio or in the backyard. The hand - eye coordination can help you develop mental sharpness. Thirdly, using computers is good because it helps you buy things online. The computer can help you buy things like stylish clothes, comfortable shoes, reliable cars, beautiful houses, and many other items. Anything you need, you can buy it online with just a few clicks. In conclusion, I think people should seriously consider using computers more often either to buy things, to meet people, or to improve body coordination. Don't you agree with me?
1343	1347	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, People are using computers constantly, and computers assist us all the time in highly positive ways. Computers help us look up useful information, talk to people around the vast world, and buy stuff conveniently from our own houses. In this technological age, the possibilities are truly endless. I have a cousin in @LOCATION1 and I talk to him through a high - quality webcam. There are more people who talk to their relatives elsewhere. In fact, almost every soldier talks to someone back home. Doctors even say that talking to someone back home gives a soldier more inner strength and willpower to survive. Everyone goes to school, so that means everyone has projects. During projects, a kid wants to know everything, so a great way to get detailed information is to go on the computer and search for what you're looking for. The computer has trillions of websites that people can explore. You can find anything from how mankind started to the latest scientific discoveries. If you're a sports enthusiast and everyone likes to get sports news for free online, there are websites like @CAPS5 and @CAPS6 so you can stay updated. If you like a particular song, go on @CAPS7, @ORGANIZATION2, Limewire, or any other store to and download it to your @NUM1 or @CAPS8. In this time, I hope you have learned more about the computer and have changed your negative view. Even though there are bad people and bad websites, it doesn't mean the computer itself is bad. Computers are overall a wonderful tool that brings a lot of good to our lives.
1344	1348	1	3	Who would have thought computers can have such a profound effect on people? People all over the world learn new things on the computer each and every day. Of course, everybody learns and reads new and interesting things because of the computer. There is even a lot of fun stuff to do on the computer. You can pick from a wide variety of different music videos and music. And there are many ways to chat with people, similar to how you would over the phone on a cell phone. But with computers too, there are numerous ways to communicate with friends and family. Also, there is MySpace, Facebook, and @CAPS2. Those are popular websites that you can go on to talk to family and friends, but there are also other websites that you can visit. But I would also like to comment something about the computer. I understand the computer is a lot of fun. Sometimes you need a break; you can't stay on the computer all the time. You must remember that you need exercise too. You must go out and enjoy the beautiful nature. You should take a walk or ride your bike. You must understand computers are great for learning but not for every single aspect of daily life. The computer is good for learning, but you should also go out and get some fresh air to maintain a balanced lifestyle.
1345	1349	1	3	To the Newspaper, Computers are obviously essential in society. They can be used as an extremely valuable learning tool, help with seamless communication, and teach skills that will be used throughout life. Students like myself often use computers for many valid reasons. Our teachers also strongly encourage us to use computers. All projects require in - depth research. For example, last week in social studies, I researched the amendments to the constitution. I went to @ORGANIZATION1 on the internet and found a vast storage of information on the @NUM1 for my project on whether capital punishment is cruel and unusual. I found from this reliable database that not only is it allowed for that reason but the @LOCATION1 got approval from the international council of human rights for allowing it. Without the internet, which instantly provides the newest, most recent information, I would have had nowhere to go to find books published recently enough to carry this significant fact. It would have been more costly and taken over two hours just to find the same information that I got in five minutes using a computer. The internet can access millions of websites and photos on a wide variety of topics faster than any other method. As well as for research, schools use computers to type papers. This makes it much easier for the teacher to read and provides useful tools like spell - check. Also, using the internet, you can access all of the communication benefits of using computers. E - mail, @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and @CAPS3 are just a few of the commonly used websites on computers. They make talking to friends and family easier and faster than ever before. Last @DATE1, my friend was on a business trip that lasted for @NUM3 weeks. I missed him a lot. My mom let me use the computer, and I was able to have a video call with him instead of a simple telephone call. It consoled me for the @NUM4 days I wasn't able to see him while still being amazingly quick. Computers allow people to interact with other people at once even when they can't be with that person for whatever reason. This communication element is very important, just like how they will help for the future. Many jobs involve the usage of a computer. Mastering how to use the computer before it is needed has many advantages. If we already know how to use them, we don't need to worry about learning it later in life. Also, in the near future, computers will be used in high school and college for helping with paper - writing and research. It will be faster and easier for us if we have knowledge of how to do these things. Eventually, if we can recognize the benefits, the rewards are countless. As you can see, computers and the internet can bring many benefits to our society. Schools can use them for many projects and learning. People can talk to others virtually when it is not possible face - to - face. Finally, it can help shape the future. In conclusion, the use of computers should be whole - heartedly encouraged.
1346	1350	1	3	Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, With computers being extremely popular these days, it's quite easy to think that they are highly helpful and have a very positive effect on the people who use them. However, I truly believe that computers have more harmful effects than good ones on the individuals they are used by. I believe this for @NUM1 reasons. One, they take away from spending quality time with real people, they make people get less exercise, and also they are very distracting and waste a significant amount of time. One reason why I don't think computers have a positive effect on people is that the time spent on the computer could be put to much better use by engaging in activities with family and friends. Nowadays, people are frequently using social networking sites like @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 to talk with people far away. People can spend hours communicating with someone they will never meet in person and completely ignore the people who care for and love them right in front of them. Also, communication with people online can be extremely dangerous because the person who you are messaging might not be who they claim to be. Overall, going out and actually spending time with real people creates memories that you will cherish for the rest of your life. This kind of fulfilling feeling can never occur through the cold and impersonal internet. Another reason why I think that computers have a bad effect on their users is that constant computer use has resulted in a severe lack of exercise for many people. People who use computers for many hours are just sitting still, not being active at all. The only movement that occurs while on a computer is the tiny flick of a finger as it clicks the mouse button. This is clearly not enough exercise that is required to maintain a healthy and happy lifestyle. Studies have shown that since the invention of computers, young people especially have been getting less and less physical activity. I'm sure that this situation will continue to get worse if people continue spending a majority of their time on their computers. A third reason why I think computers are having a negative effect on people is because they are highly distracting and they waste a great deal of time. An example of this is that once when I was online doing research for a school project, I saw an advertisement for a website that looked really interesting. When I clicked on it, I was brought to a site full of funny stories and pictures. I spent the next half - an hour reading entries on that website and completely forgot about my project. When I realized what I had done, I rushed to finish my research and ended up getting a poorer grade than I'm sure I would have gotten if I had not been distracted by other things to do on the computer. This is why I think computers do not have a good effect on the people who use them. They take away from spending time with family and friends, they result in less exercise, and they waste time and are distractions. In conclusion, while computers have become an integral part of our lives, their negative impacts on our social, physical, and academic well - being cannot be ignored. We should be more mindful of how we use them to avoid these detrimental effects.
1347	1351	1	3	Dear local @CAPS1, For many years, @CAPS2 people have been relying on computers. But is it actually good for their health? We often don't think about the power that teens have with the internet. If you need information, we have a vast collection of great books at our disposal. If we need to communicate, we have phones that are simple and convenient. We need to go outside and engage in physical exercise. Is the computer another reason why America is becoming obese? First, teens can engage in harmful activities on the internet, either to themselves or to others. People have invented platforms like Facebook and MySpace. Almost every teen in America has a Facebook account. Did you know that there is now a serious issue of cyberbullying? People have publicly humiliated others on the internet. How can we be sure that the person we're talking to is who he/she says he/she is? Teens often give away too much information about themselves, and some have even gone missing because of such actions. The internet is a powerful weapon, but can teens handle this kind of power? Next, although the computer is a convenient device, is it not true that we have something called books? We can't believe everything that is said on the computer. We can obtain all that we need and even more from books. People lived in the Middle Ages without computers, but they had books. Why can't we do the same? Have we grown so lazy that we can't even get up and look through a book? Finally, if communication is what we seek, then why not send a simple text or make a call? We go through all the trouble of turning on the computer and opening multiple pages just to chat online. We have become lazy because of devices that have everything we need right in our homes. Sure, it's a good thing in some ways, but it's also a bad one. It seems like the computer is another reason for America growing obese. We need to get up, take a walk, hang out with friends, and do sports. But how can we do that when we're addicted to computers? It's like a powerful drug that holds us captive. To conclude, I think computers are not good for us. Teens have the power of Facebook, which can be misused. There is fake and dangerous information when we have reliable books. And lastly, our own health is at stake. At this point, I ask you, is the computer worth everything we think it is? No, it is not. We should find a better balance between our digital and real - world lives.
1348	1352	1	3	Dear Newspaper, Over the years, the streets have become noticeably less crowded with people interacting, exercising, and enjoying nature. Is this a positive or negative development? Technology has advanced to such an extent that it might seem better to stay home and be on the computer than to take a walk in the park. Computers do have a positive effect on people because they feature advertisements that encourage exercise, advertisements that encourage travel and enjoying nature, and computers allow people to interact from anywhere in the world. Firstly, computers are filled with excellent advertisements. Some advertisements promote joining a gym and engaging in regular exercise. Studies show that <@PERCENT1@NUM1> of kids without computers do not get enough exercise, whereas only @PERCENT1 of kids with computers do not get enough exercise. These statistics clearly show that computers are better for people's health than they are commonly thought to be. Next, computers have even more advertisements that inspire people to travel around the world. By doing this, people's knowledge and intelligence will increase because they will learn new and interesting facts about new places. Also, people will be happier because they generally enjoy traveling and experiencing new cultures. Lastly, people's jobs will benefit if their business depends on the advertisements they post on the internet. Finally, the advanced technology used in computers today allows people to talk to friends from nearly anywhere in the world on a computer. Social sites such as Facebook allow people to see pictures from where their friends have traveled. Webcams enable people to talk face - to - face up close about the new gym they joined. <@PERCENT1@NUM2> of people say they have a better social life online than out in the open when their friends might not be there to talk. In conclusion, computers have a positive effect on people because they have advertisements that encourage people to exercise, encourage travel, and computers allow people to talk from anywhere in the world. Technology is there to make the world a happier, healthier, and more social place. That is why computers have a very positive effect on people around the world, helping us stay connected, informed, and active in different ways.
1349	1353	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, With our main forest growing back, services that take only a few seconds, and being able to find practically any answer to any question, what could be the cause of this phenomenon? The answer is computers. These electronic wonders help us and our planet in so many ways because they are eco - friendly, efficient, and loaded with information. You might be asking yourself how computers are eco - friendly. Well, for starters, they help reduce the waste of paper. Did you know that the @LOCATION1 cuts down approximately @NUM1 million trees a year for books? Computers help prevent this in several ways. For example, instead of sending a short letter to the police chief asking about what the new driving law is, you could send an email and save the paper. Also, if you wanted the newspaper staff to interview the people that survived the power plant explosion, you could send them all an e - mail with instructions to the survivors' house instead of giving out maps individually. So now you can clearly see how eco - friendly computers are. My next reason was their efficiency. My Dell laptop at home takes about @NUM1 min to load, @NUM3 sec to get on the internet, and @NUM4 sec to get to another webpage. So say that I want to know how many legs a centipede has (parents don't know either). Without a computer, it would take @NUM5 min to get to the library, @NUM6 min to find a parking spot, and @NUM4 min to find a book about centipedes. In total, that's at least @NUM8 mins, but my computer would only take @NUM1 min @NUM10 sec or so. Also, if you wanted to ask a friend what she is doing on @DATE1, it would only take a few seconds to send an email and she would answer quickly back because she is most likely on the computer already. My third reason was because computers are loaded with information. In a @CAPS3 library, I might find @NUM4 books on a subject, but on a computer, I might find thousands. Once I was doing a report on monarch butterflies. In the @CAPS3 library, I found @NUM12 books about them. On the internet, I found @NUM13 websites on them! Also, books have general information like just the @CAPS5 life, but the internet has specific information about the @CAPS5 part in the environment. As you now know, computers help not only humans but also the environment. This is because they are eco - friendly, efficient, and loaded with information. In conclusion, computers are truly remarkable tools that offer numerous benefits in terms of environmental conservation, time - saving, and access to knowledge.
1350	1354	1	3	Dear Newspaper, I firmly believe that computers have a positive impact on society. I believe this because they help us learn about faraway places, they assist us in communicating with friends and family all over the world, and they help entertain people. The computer has a positive effect on society because on it, you can learn about faraway places, their rich history, and you can learn about their unique landscapes. By learning these things, you can do a lot of useful things such as plan a well - thought - out vacation. This information can also be extremely helpful for you on a school report. Moreover, this information can help you learn about your heritage and your culture. Also, computers have a positive effect and are beneficial to society because they help you communicate with friends and family all over the world! You can communicate with anyone you know. Nowadays, almost everyone uses the computer as their main form of communication. In a study, it showed that @PERCENT1 of people in the world has a computer as a communication tool. Lastly, computers are beneficial to society because they entertain us. On a computer, you can do many things to never get bored. You can play a wide variety of games, surf the vast web, or you can watch interesting videos on networks such as YouTube. So on a computer, you'll never be bored. The computer is beneficial and has a positive effect on society. The computer helps us learn about faraway places, it lets us communicate with friends and family all over the globe, and lastly, the computer entertains us. In conclusion, computers have become an indispensable part of our society, enhancing our learning, communication, and entertainment experiences. Their positive influence on our lives is undeniable, making the world a more connected and enjoyable place.
1351	1355	1	3	"I don't think computers benefit the society as much as everyone thinks. When people spend most of their waking hours glued to computers, they're left with little to no time to spend quality moments with their family. Moreover, physical inactivity sets in when people are constantly on computers. Lack of exercise is a major culprit, causing many to become obese. Additionally, there's a real risk when you arrange to meet up somewhere with a bad person you've met on Facebook or MySpace. These are the main reasons computers don't benefit society. The number one reason computers aren't beneficial is that family time is crucial. But when you're on computers round - the - clock, you have absolutely no time with your family and friends. I believe that families should sit down to eat dinner together and have at least one hour of quality interaction. Some good ways to spend time with your family are to play board games together, take a leisurely walk in the park, or even go for a bike ride around the neighborhood. Did you know that computers have a medium - sized effect on how people become obese? If you're at school from seven till three - thirty and then spend seven hours on your computer after school, you're bound to gain weight because you'll have absolutely no time to exercise. When you just eat and don't exercise, your body won't burn off all the fat you've consumed. When you're on a computer, you're probably logging onto Facebook or MySpace. On these chatting websites, you can make arrangements to meet someone you don't even know. If you meet up with them, they could be a killer, a kidnapper, or a rapist. So, you could literally die or get hurt because of your computer. That's why email is the absolute safest way to chat online if you were to have a computer. These are the main reasons why computers are not beneficial to the society. Also, you often don't spend enough time with family or friends, you can become obese because you don't have ""time"" to exercise, and you can be kidnapped by someone you don't even know through Facebook or MySpace. How would you like it if you had no time with your family, you were obese, and you got kidnapped because you met up with someone who seemed nice through Facebook or even MySpace? In conclusion, the supposed benefits of computers are overshadowed by these significant drawbacks, and we should be more cautious about our computer usage."
1352	1356	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, Computers are a very unique and advanced device. They offer entertainment, pleasure, and knowledge for some people. However, I do not agree with the fact that computers are an entirely good part of society. Although you do need computers in some aspects of modern life, there are reasons for my stance. Typing is faster than handwriting and it's neater. With all the different websites, you can advertise and buy important things at the internet and talk to people from around the world. With all of these good reasons, there should be an instant choice of whether they're good or bad. But there is a main reason that tips the scale. It's a reason that shows they are bad. Computers are supposed to serve people, but some people have become so dependent that they can't write a hand - written report or drive to the store to buy something. If computers never existed, the world would no doubt be a better all - around place. There are a lot of reasons in which computers are bad. They hold information which can be hacked by somebody that you don't want to know something. Cyberbullying is a serious issue related to computers. Another big problem is those addictive online games. People get hooked on them, then they become lazy and eventually obese. So, as I said before, computers are not an unmitigated positive part of society and should be used with caution. This would be of good importance to me if you took my letter into consideration. Remember that computers can take advantage of your life and make you into someone you're not. Make that decision wisely. I hope that you live a full life and enjoy reading my letter. P.S. Try not to get involved with any online games as they are becoming a nationwide problem, almost like a disease. In essence, we need to be aware of the negative impacts of computers and not let them control our lives.
1353	1357	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 editor, I have recently seen on the channel @NUM1 news that you want to know about the impact computers have on people. In the past, everyone has embraced computers and gets knowledge from them. @PERCENT1 of the @CAPS3 surveyed at the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 agree that computers are helpful to us. In my opinion, computers have a positive effect on people. The first reason is that computers teach hand - eye coordination. Without this coordination, people would face difficulties in many daily tasks and might not thrive as well. The users' experience would be over very quickly if they lacked this skill. The computer makes us use these muscles so we can live happily. @PERCENT1 of the @CAPS3 recently took a survey at the @CAPS3 @CAPS4, and they agree that computers are the main source of hand - eye coordination. Dr. @DR1, an expert in the relationship between computers and humans, said, ""People without computers can't do what others can. They are unable to have fast reaction time."" To sum it up, computers help with hand - eye coordination. The second reason is that computers allow us to learn about far - away places. When you can't look up and learn about places, you're in the dark about them. You're lucky if you even know where in the world they are. Computers allow you to look up those places. You can look into going there for vacation or doing a report. @PERCENT2 of the adults who were surveyed at the public library said the computers help. They are full of so much more information than books. To sum it up, computers allow you to learn about far - away places. The third reason is that computers allow you to talk online to people. This extends your friendships with people. You can talk on the computer, not just at school. It also allows you to meet new and different people. You can talk to people in @LOCATION1 that you couldn't talk to without computers. Computers allow you to open up the world to all people. @PERCENT1 of parents who took a poll in @ORGANIZATION1 say they want their children to learn about different cultures. They need the computer for that task. To sum it up, computers allow you to talk online to people. In conclusion, computers have a positive effect on people. The reasons are to teach hand - eye coordination, learn about far - away places, and talk to people online. I strongly urge you to look at any point of view closely. This decision is now up to you. We should recognize and embrace the positive contributions that computers make to our lives."
1354	1358	1	3	@CITY1 @CAPS1, Computers are very helpful devices. Life would be very hard without them. Not only are they helpful, but they are fun and easy to use! I believe that computers have a great effect on people because you can keep in touch with family and friends, go to school websites, and use search engines. Friends and family are extremely important in people's lives. Computers can help you keep in touch with them! The @NUM1 applications that I mostly use are @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS2, and @CAPS3. @ORGANIZATION1 is a free online application that you can download to your computer, add your friends, and have video chats! Using this, I keep in touch with my @CAPS4, my friend who moved to a different city, and even a friend from @LOCATION2! @CAPS2 (@ORGANIZATION3 instant messenger) is where you can send messages to friends and get instant replies! It is just like text messaging, only through computers. Lastly, @CAPS3 is a website where you can add friends from all around the world! I am friends with tons of family that I don't get to see very often, a friend who moved to @LOCATION3, and many other people that have moved! @CAPS3, @CAPS2, and @ORGANIZATION1 are great ways to keep in touch with other people! When you are home sick from school and need to make up school work, instead of calling a friend from each of your classes, go to the school's webpage! All teachers should have their own website that you can access from there. On their pages, they should have posted homework, quizzes/tests schedule, favorite links, projects, and their e - mail address. I find this very helpful because even if you don't understand your homework, you can e - mail your teacher! Not only do school websites have teachers' pages, but they also have lunch menus, events coming up, the school address and phone number, and many more! School could be a lot more difficult without a website. Do you ever have a question but nobody has the answer to it? www.Google.com has the answer to everything! You can find webpages, videos, pictures, translators, etc. Google is not the only search engine on the internet; there is also @CAPS6, @ORGANIZATION2!, @LOCATION4, @CAPS7, @LOCATION1, etc. These can all help you find answers, pictures, videos, and many more! I often use these to find pictures for a school project, webpages for research, translators to check my Spanish homework, and videos to show my friends! If we did not have search engines, life would be a lot harder. Computers, as you can tell, are extremely helpful, easy, and fun to use. People love them and use them all the time. I hope that you agree with computers having a great effect on people! Staying in touch with family and friends, having a good education, and finding answers within a click is the easiest way to go. In short, computers have become an indispensable part of our lives, enhancing our social, educational, and informational experiences.
1355	1359	1	3	Dear Newspaper, Computers have a huge effect on society. Can you even imagine where we would be without them? They are great for communication, learning, and shopping. Computers have a large effect on people. Without computers, communication with co - workers, family, and friends would be nearly impossible. Social networking sites, such as @CAPS1, @CAPS2, @CAPS3, and @CAPS4 - In play a huge role in everyday life. These are the sites you use from accessing information from others to making plans for the weekend. Do you think that your children use the internet too much? Nowadays, that is their way to communicate with their peers. It makes them more social, which is a great quality to have in life. Also, I don't know about you, but I have talked to many people around the world using the internet. It gives you the chance to experience other cultures. Communication was absolutely not as easy before having computers. It may seem hard to believe, but you can learn tremendous amounts of things from the internet. This may include learning about people. How would you video chat with someone without @CAPS5 or @ORGANIZATION2? You can learn a lot about a person from talking to them face - to - face, a thing that can't be done on a phone. Also, research for school could not be done without the internet. In a recent survey, @NUM1 out of @NUM2 teenagers said that they use a search engine site, such as @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS6, or @ORGANIZATION3 at least once a day. @CAPS7 out of those @NUM1 said that it is for school. If it weren't for these search engines, children wouldn't be doing too great in school. Clearly, the computer provides ample ways to research and learn on a daily basis. It may sound ridiculous, but in @DATE2, @PERCENT1 of shopping was done on the internet. If someone wants to start a business, their first stop is usually the internet. People are making money every year with the help of computers. People find it easiest to buy something with the click of a mouse. It is easier than the hassle of crowded malls and long lines. Also, do you remember when @CAPS8 @DATE1 was the time to put the alarm clock on for @NUM4 @CAPS9? Well, now that people do online shopping, there are hundreds, even thousands of sites that offer great sales. Now think about how purchasing items would be if it weren't for the internet. It's not a great image, is it? As you can tell, computers have affected our lives in a great way. Communication, learning, and even shopping have become much simpler. Many may think that computers have some negative aspects, but the good far overshadows those aspects. In conclusion, we should whole - heartedly embrace the positive changes that computers have brought to our lives and continue to make the most of their capabilities.
1356	1360	1	3	I support the advance in technology, especially in computers. Using the computer can effectively teach hand - eye coordination. When you're using a computer, whether it's playing a simple game or doing precise graphic design work, your eyes watch the screen while your hands operate the mouse or keyboard. This constant interaction between the eyes and hands hones the hand - eye coordination skill. It also gives you the ability to learn about faraway places or people. With just a few clicks, you can explore the unique cultures of remote tribes in the Amazon rainforest or the historical architecture of ancient cities in Europe. Moreover, it gives you the opportunity to talk online with other people. Hand - eye coordination is a very important skill to have. It quickens reflexes during everyday life. Hand - eye coordination is needed especially for sports like baseball, where you need to accurately time your swing based on the incoming ball; football, when you're catching a pass; or basketball, while shooting a free - throw. Without computers, many people would lack hand - eye coordination. If you are driving a car on the highway, and suddenly a car swerves onto the wrong side of the road and is heading toward you, you need to react fast. Without proper hand - eye coordination, you could die. Using computers could possibly save your life one day. If somebody wants to go to a foreign country but doesn't know anything about it, they could look it up on the internet. The internet is a major part of having computers. Without it, people probably wouldn't be able to research a country with ease or learn about other people. Some people think that using the computer too much restricts people from getting exercise, which is true in some cases. But the computer is very useful to have if you want to know about something. Like who won the election, or who won the sports championship. The computer is almost a necessity in every home. The computer gives people the opportunity to chat online with other people. Some they know in real life, or some they met online. It expands people's interactive life, helping them make new friends. Though this is a great thing to have access to, it is still important to socialize with people in person, rather than socializing online. Some people have trouble talking to people in person and are more comfortable chatting over the computer. Maybe this person could make a friend and one day meet them in real life. This can be dangerous for younger people, so be careful. I support the advancement in computer technology because it gives people greater reflexes, gives people the opportunity to research faraway places, and gives people access to the internet to chat with people online. These are three huge advantages that using computers give people.
1357	1361	1	3	"In modern society, it is rare that you come across someone who doesn't know how to basically operate a computer. According to the statistics project known on YouTube as ""Shift Happens"", most children in the United States, 90% in fact, have used a computer by age four. While it can be debated that computers are bad, I firmly disagree. Computers are one of the best technological advances the human race has made. They have helped education, reconnecting with old friends, and are even at times good for the environment. I wonder why people disagree, and I hope that after reading this, you will too. At my school, there are three computer labs, each with about twenty - five computers, a library with twenty computers, and each teacher has two computers in their classroom. When I look at these amounts and add it to what I know about computers in other American schools, it is clear to me that computers have helped the education system. Many teachers can have students research projects with the click of a button. There are websites where students who were out from school can get their assignments for the next day. Also, teachers can put their grade books in their hard drive. This saves paper and ensures accuracy in the final grade. As a student, I think that computers have greatly improved schools in many ways, but mostly in those above. At one point or another in life, we are all older and want to reconnect with our old friends. Thanks to computers, the process of reconnecting is much easier. There are social networks such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, that are valuable for finding your friend from summer camp. Let's say you have been connected with someone, and you've just found out that you got a promotion. You want to call, but you don't know the phone number, but you know the email address. Email messages send instantly to anywhere. (And while you're at it, ask for a phone number!) It's always great to talk with old friends. Computers have helped the United States make that easier. My friend recently purchased a Sony laptop. She liked not only the features, but that it was an Energy Star, or eco - friendly. Nowadays, computers have been made green in the battle for the environment. Paper is saved with online encyclopedias, newspapers, journals, etc. Not only that but computers are needing less and less electricity. You save money and are helping the environment! Today's society is helping mother nature not only in our actions, but in computers too. In my opinion, computers are helping the United States, not hurting it. They have assisted education, social reconnecting, and the environment. We must look kindly upon the advancement and miracle invention known as the computer."
1358	1362	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, Don't you agree that computers should be limited or often not used? Recently, it has been brought to my attention that computers have a negative effect on society. Without a doubt, I firmly believe that computers should be a hobby not an addiction. People spend too much time on their computers and less time exercising and interacting with family and friends. Most teenagers are involved with cyber - bullying which takes place on computers. People spend too much time on their computers and less time exercising. I can remember when my step - mom, Lisa, was a size six in the waist. Lisa would exercise every day after work for two hours. This all changed when my dad bought her a lime green, Dell Inspiron laptop for her birthday. She quickly became addicted to World of Warcraft and began to cut down on her exercising routines. Six months later, when she went to a doctor's appointment she found out that she gained more than ten pounds. Lisa is now a size fourteen in the waist. Studies show that 60% of people gain weight because they cut down on exercising so they can have more computer time. Most people spend too much time on their computers and less time interacting with family and friends. This reminds me of my step - dad, Tom. When Tom gets home from work he usually goes straight to the computer instead of having a conversation with the rest of the family. He gets angry when Billy (8 years old) bothers him because he wants to play. Tom is usually online from three o'clock till ten o'clock playing chess with strangers from all over. What he doesn't know is that while he is building relationships with strangers he is breaking the bond between him and his loved ones. 80% of teenagers are involved with cyber - bullying. This reminds me of my cousin, Sarah. Last summer, Sarah became a member of Instagram. Trouble quickly began to find her. In other words, girls from ages thirteen to twenty began to send her threatening messages. No later than a day when Sarah was walking down the street a gang of girls jumped her. However, she survived the brutal attack and deleted her Instagram account. In conclusion, without a doubt, I firmly believe that people shouldn't spend too much time on computers. My three arguments are cyber - bullying, less exercise, and less interaction with family and friends. I urge you to take my suggestion seriously and limit computer usage.
1359	1363	1	3	"Dear local Newspaper, It has come to my attention that we are debating on whether or not computers benefit society. Well if you ask me, I think it does. For one, computers help with entertainment. Second of all, they're very informational. Lastly, computers make life less stressful. In the following paragraphs I will explain my reasoning. Firstly, computers give entertainment. Now I can see why people say we should go outside more and exercise, but what are we supposed to do on a rainy day? Well, you could go on the computer! Plus, computers give children enjoyment and make them happy, instead of being bored sometimes. Another reason why computers are good is they can give children motivation. Say your child really wants to play a new game on his favorite website, but his homework isn't done. You could tell him if he gets his homework done he can play on the computer. Also, you could give him a time limit on it too. Lastly, for a teenager or older they are more social than little children. They go on things like Twitter, Facebook, and MySpace. Computers are probably their first or second way they communicate. Unfortunately, some people abuse these rights and people get in trouble. But the good thing is you can customize your page so that won't happen. Anyway, children become more social. Secondly, computers are informational. They can tell you a lot by just the touch of a keypad and the click of a mouse. You can search someone or something across the whole world. If you want to know the method and how to prepare for a particular event, just look it up and do what you have to. Also, if you find out something new tell people, you can spread the knowledge. Thirdly, computers make things less stressful. Which would you rather do, type or write 20 pages? Well, I'd type! Computers make things more organized so it's easier to find things. It also makes it easier to find things, like files because you can just go to ""My Documents"" and find it. As you can see, computers are an important part of our lives. Can you imagine a world without computers? I sure couldn't! So far I've said computers are entertaining, informational, and make things less stressful. I hope you take my letter into consideration."
1360	1364	1	3	I agree with the many people that computers benefit society. Computers can be used as a learning tool, allow communication with distant family and friends. Lastly, computers give you something to do in your free time, such as playing games. First of all, I know many people think that others waste their time on computers. But most computer users use the computer as a tool to learn and get work done. There are many educational websites that people can go to to learn about any subject they want. If you want to know more about different cultures such as Japanese culture. There are websites to tell you everything you would want to know. Computers also help get work done. There are multiple programs designed to make writing papers or presenting information much easier. People use these programs to get ahead in their work and present facts easier. By using these programs, it is very hard to lose any work that you do because it is all saved into the computer. Next, computers are a great way for many people to pass some free time. Many websites are designed for this reason. Some allow you to play games and other websites let you watch videos made by other people. While some people may spend too much time on this, many others know moderation and spread their time evenly. Other websites have videos that are used to portray important issues. For example, the president has given many speeches through YouTube videos because more often people are on their computers and not watching television. Lastly, computers are a great way to communicate with distant friends and family. There are so many ways to do this, such as email, or many of the social networking websites. My family being immigrants from another country, my family thinks this is a valuable tool for talking with our family, and I am sure that there are many others who use the computer this way as well. People also make and keep in touch with great friends through the internet. I use Gmail as a way to keep in touch with many of my friends that I haven't seen in years. My parents have also found long - lost friends that they had before we moved through Facebook. It also allows people to communicate important ideas faster than a letter could. Many scientists use the internet to publish ideas and experiments. Finally, I agree with people who say computers benefit society. Computers help by being a tool to learn and get work done, pass free time and see important information, and lastly, computers allow communication with very far and distant family members.
1361	1365	1	3	Dear Newspaper, I think that when kids or even adults get computers, then they often won't use it for good causes. When people get computers, they tend to spend more time inside and glued to them. They really need to get outside and get some exercise. Even for little things like, if you're going to your friend's house, then take a jog there instead of riding your bike. When people spend more time on their computers than talking to their friends, then they will be lacking in socializing and, after a while, won't know how to communicate with people properly. All they would have to do is set a reasonable time limit on their computer and only use it for work otherwise. Computers could also be used for good things. If you have a project for school and need to type it up neatly on the computer or find relevant pictures on the internet, then the computer would be a great resource. If you have a job that involves working with computers or fixing them, then you would naturally spend a lot of time on your computer. It also allows you to interact with people on the other side of the world easily. You can also learn about interesting facts or places conveniently. However, computers could also be used for bad reasons. When people use it, they might just use it to play this cool new video game they got. This can lead them into becoming obese. They can also use it for sexual harassment or stalking people. People can also use it for horrible things like selling or buying drugs or other illegal things. So as you can see, computers aren't safe in a lot of ways. I hope you can read and understand all the important facts explaining my reasons and consider them. Thank you and have a good day.
1362	1366	1	3	Dear Local newspaper, I think that computers have a bad effect on people because they will end up having no time to exercise, less time with friends and family, and it could give a younger child a bad influence. Here are my detailed reasons. The most important reason why computers have a bad effect on people is that the time they spend sitting in front of the computer could be used for exercising to stay healthy. For example, my mom runs @NUM1 miles every single day and still manages to have time to go on the computer. If you use the computer excessively, it's really bad, but if you use it in moderation, then it's a little better. For instance, my mom lets me go on the computer, but she firmly makes me go outside and run around. Nowadays, people are always talking about obesity, and computers are one of the ways it's happening to kids and adults. They just sit there on the computer and do nothing while on the other hand, they could be outside enjoying the fresh air. Here is my second reason. The next most important thing is that kids and adults won't have enough time to spend time with their families and share precious memories with them. My mom always tells me the best part of your childhood is making memories with the people you love. My friends and I love to be outside and go to playgrounds and act like little kids, but it makes us laugh heartily and people say that laughing keeps you happy and healthy. Here is my last reason. The last most important reason is it can give a younger child the wrong ideas. For example, I have @NUM1 younger sisters and they love to go on the computer, and some websites are definitely not good for younger kids. One website could be @CAPS2 because bad people post inappropriate videos and the little children could see them and get the wrong idea. In conclusion, I think computers have a bad effect on people because they spend less time staying healthy, less time with friends and family, and it gives kids the wrong idea. I hope I got my point across that they are bad and that people will be more cautious about computer use.
1363	1367	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, I would like to inform the public that using computers isn't so bad. The first reason I think makes computers good is because of the various people we can meet via @CAPS2, yahoo, @ORGANIZATION1 or gmail. For instance, we could meet someone from @LOCATION1 and learn in - depth about his or her culture or beliefs. Through these platforms, we can have conversations that broaden our horizons and understanding of different ways of life. My second reason I think computers help people is because what if someone didn't have a TV or the newspaper, he or she could get the latest news via nbc.com or fox.com and will be able to still find out what's going on in the world. This way, people can stay informed and up - to - date with current events no matter where they are. In conclusion, computers offer great opportunities for social interaction and access to information, making them a valuable tool in our lives.
1364	1368	1	3	Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 percentage of people all over the world do you think have a computer and think that it has a positive effect on them? Well, about @PERCENT1 of the world says that computers are a great way to communicate with friends, family, and different people around the world. They also mentioned that it's a good hands - on - eye coordination exercise for adults and students. It's a wonderful educational source to use in schools, jobs, etc. First off, the reason why I say that it's a great way to communicate is because of the programs that computers have stored in them. These programs use unique codes, which are like little numbers all around the universe, to connect with your friends, family, and people around the earth. For example, like yahoo, facebook, twitter, myspace, etc. These are all popular types of ways to communicate with people and make us more social, which is a healthy way in life. More than half the world has these communication sources because, one, it's easier and it allows you to express more of your thoughts. Another reason why they especially @MONTH1 have these connections is probably because it's a better way to see one another if you live in different parts of the earth. The reason why I said that it's another way of seeing people around the world is because right now I'm living in @LOCATION1 and in order to see the ones I love and care about, I rely on my myspace and facebook. Through these platforms, I'm able to see my family and friends that live in different locations from me like @LOCATION2, @LOCATION4, @LOCATION3, etc. Another reason is because it's a good hands - on eye coordination activity for adults and students. In conclusion, computers bring many positive aspects such as easy communication and skill - building, making them an important part of our modern lives.
1365	1369	1	3	When you use a computer, you have the ability to do virtually anything. The internet has millions of users and it truly makes life a lot easier. You have access to talk with people who are all the way across the world! You can search any topic and learn more about it in great detail. The internet even encourages you to get outside and see things for yourself. In the @DATE1, it's just as easy to contact someone in @LOCATION1 as it is to contact someone at the other side of town. As long as you have an internet connection, you can stay in touch with a friend who's moved away on a business trip, or anyone! Some @MONTH1 say that you should just use a phone, but you could use video chat on the internet. You can see someone who's thousands of miles away, as if they were right in front of you. These days, it's harder to not stay in touch than it is to stay in touch. @NUM1 or @NUM2 years ago, any information you needed came from a book. You would have to go all the way to the library, search through the shelves to find the right book, and then read it carefully. If you were lucky, you could find a bit of what you were looking for. These days, you simply type it into a search browser and you instantly get thousands of websites on that topic. The internet allows you to learn about any subject you'd like. You can spend time consulting experts or gain knowledge from various sources. Some people say that some people spend too much time on their computers. However, seeing all those great places and beautiful pictures on the internet encourages many people to get outside and see it for themselves. On a recent poll, @PERCENT1 of people went on a hike after seeing a youtube video about how great it is to get outside. The internet has a massive effect on us. It can also bring families together. For example, at dinner, you can get a great recipe off the internet. In fact, you can get millions of great recipes. The internet was an amazing idea. Many would argue that it was the greatest invention ever. Yes, it can be dangerous, but with proper education on it, the internet is a good source of information and an excellent past - time, if not abused. Being able to see and talk to others so far away was seemingly impossible a few decades ago. Getting information has never been so easy. We are really lucky to live in an age where the internet is right at our fingertips.
1366	1370	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 post, I know that people are spending way too much time on computers instead of being outside enjoying the fresh air and natural surroundings. People are becoming addicted to computers, losing touch with the real world around them. People are spending way too much time on computers because they're addicted to the endless entertainment and information, which leads to them being overweight and not getting any exercise. I am telling you we need to address this matter urgently. People have become so addicted to computers that it's become a real problem in our society. @PERSON1 says that in @DATE1 there were @NUM1 people using computers, and in @DATE2 there are nearly @NUM2 million people using computers, that’s a big increase in the last couple of years. People are becoming more addicted because of social media platforms like facebook, twitter, and many other computer sites that keep them glued to the screen. Yale says that in @DATE3 the number of people on facebook was only @NUM3 thousand, and in @DATE4 there is over @NUM4 million people using facebook. I don’t know about you, but that seems like an addiction to computers to me. People are getting tremendously overweight. One major cause of this is addiction to computers. People just sit in front of their computers and eat and eat and eat until they're overweight and unhealthy. Dr. @PERSON2 says that in the last @NUM5 years the average weight of a person has gone up @NUM3 pounds due to them sitting in front of their computers and eating. Doctors say they can't do anything about people's weight unless they turn off all of their computers, which they don't think is possible. People are just getting too fat from sitting and doing nothing all day. Exercise is a key part of staying healthy. And by sitting in front of a computer eating, you're not getting the exercise that is needed, so people are getting fat. Dr. @PERSON3 says that people need to be aware of this problem. Dr. @PERSON3 also says that in the last @NUM7 years the amount of exercise people are getting has decreased @PERCENT1. That’s why people are getting fat. He also says that it’s due to sitting in front of the computer and eating. People are getting no exercise due to computers. I'm telling you this is a huge problem that we need to address. People are becoming addicted to computers, they're getting overweight, and getting no exercise. Please @CAPS1 post listen, it’s a problem, but it is your decision. We must take action to change this situation for the better.
1367	1371	1	3	"Dear Local Newspaper, I feel that the negative effects of computers on people are much greater than the positive effects. Computers have caused a massive amount of obesity in the @LOCATION1, and that number is growing every single day. Computers can also be extremely time - consuming, and people could spend hours and even days on a computer without doing anything else productive. Lastly, computers can be dangerous to many kids and could even end up in tragic consequences like death. I feel that computers are too harmful for society and should be regulated or at least used with more caution. Obesity is one of the biggest problems in the @LOCATION1 and is growing bigger every day. Over @PERCENT1 of the @LOCATION1 population is obese, and computers have been a major contributor. Put yourself in the mind of a computer addict. It is dinner time and you are hungry, but you don't want to lose too much time off of your computer. You hurry down to the nearest fast - food store and buy yourself a cheeseburger, fries, and a soda. You then go back to your house and eat the food while on your computer. Not only is the fast - food bad for you, but you don't even give your body a chance to burn off those calories and carbohydrates that you just ate by exercising. Computer addicts do this almost every day, and before they know it, they are @NUM1 pounds! In addition, people can improve their hand - eye coordination in many other ways than just going on a computer. Computers contribute to a large portion of the obese population, but they also can be extremely time - consuming. People on computers waste a huge amount of their time. These people stay on their computers for hours, and sometimes they don't even realize it. They say ""Let me check my email. Look, I received a message! Let me just change my social media account."" One thing after another, and in a matter of a moment, @NUM2 or @NUM3 hours have already passed by. People who stay on computers all day waste precious time that could be spent with family, exercising, or finding a true love. Time is so precious in our lives, and we must not waste it staying on a computer all day. Not only can they be time - consuming, computers can also be dangerous. Kids around the country are being killed, raped, and bullied because of computers. They show their pictures on chat sites, give away too much information, and before they know it, they have a dangerous situation knocking on their front door. Also, those who have been cyberbullied may be so affected that they make bad decisions, including suicide, and perform poorly in school. In addition, there can be explicit content on the internet, including pictures and videos that can harm a child's young mind. The danger of computers is so great that they should be used with more supervision. In conclusion, computers are too risky for society, which is why they should be used more carefully. We need to find a balance to protect the well - being of the @LOCATION1."
1368	1372	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 Local newspaper, I heard that you were concerned about people and how they use the computer too much. I think that computers are a good thing to have because many people use computers for school, work, and various other important tasks. I think that computers are of great use. Many people use them for research and accessing valuable resources. It is easier to use them when you are going on vacation because you can check out how much hotels cost, where restaurants are located, and what interesting places there are to visit, instead of calling around or driving aimlessly to find information. Computers are good for school because I think books are often harder and take longer to use than computers. Also, for questions, you can go to one of the many websites, and many other people might answer the question you're looking for. They are also useful for work. Most people use computers for work - related tasks. They can store their taxes and important documents on their computers. Computers can be used just for fun too. There are chat rooms, facebook, and various games. I think that computers are useful for many things, but I also think that some people spend too much time on them. Computers are great, but you should also use other things too like maps and books. Many people can spend @NUM1 hours on the computer facebooking and gaming. I think that it's important for people to go outside and hang out with friends. A lot of people spend their time on the computer during @DATE1 because it's cold and sometimes snowing. I don't think that they should spend their whole time on the computer though because you don't just want to depend on electronics every time. I think that computers should be used less in the @DATE2 because I think hanging out with friends and family is important, and also the weather is nice. I think that computers can be very useful for getting directions, for work, and for schoolwork, but you shouldn't spend a lot of time on them. Electronics aren't everything in life. Thank you for taking your time reading this, and I hope you do agree with me. We should make the most of computers while also living a balanced life.
1369	1373	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I think computers are beneficial to society even though some people don't think so. They give us a means of communication, computers give us the ability to learn about foreign people or places, and computers help businesses in so many ways. Computers are a must - have in a society. Computers give us a means of communication such as @CAPS4, @CAPS5, @CAPS6 - mail, and so much more. Without the computer, families who live far away from each other can talk with just a push of a button. @CAPS5 lets us talk to our friends after school and plan what we are going to do that night. Long - distance calls cost money, and it is not worth @MONEY1 a call if you call every couple of days. Communication has evolved so much in the past @NUM1 years. Computers are just the beginning. That is why computers are beneficial to communication. Computers give us the ability to look up facts about foreign places and people in a matter of minutes. We could look up who was the @CAPS7 of @LOCATION1, and we would get multiple sites on the topic. Computers help us expand our learning capabilities and give us a chance to learn things that normally we wouldn't. That is another reason why computers are very beneficial to the society. The last reason that supports the fact that computers are beneficial to the society is because computers help keep a large amount of data. They store work data and help @PERCENT1 of businesses file reports and communicate with other branches of that company. I learned in class that in the past, jobs were much more difficult than they are today because of technology. Some people think that using computers deprives people of going out and exercising. However, it only takes @NUM2 minutes to check your @CAPS6 - mail or look up something. Computers are beneficial to society because without computers, our lives would be much more complicated. We should embrace the advantages that computers bring while also being mindful of a balanced lifestyle.
1370	1374	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I think we should have computers for great purposes. One reason is because there is a vast amount of information on the internet. Another reason is because there is a wealth of history on many different websites. My last reason is because you can send messages to a far - away place by using e - mail. My first reason states that there is a lot more information on the internet. For example, if you don't have the newspaper with you, but you have your laptop, you can get information that way. Did you know, over @NUM1, @NUM2 people use their laptops for information and not games. Another example is if we get the newspaper every day but it doesn't have the article that we are looking for, we can use the internet. When we look for information on the internet, we can use search engines like yahoo, google, and other informational websites that we need. My second reason states that there is some history on many different websites. For instance, you can go on a website and learn about history every day, instead of going to a museum about history every day! One day, I had to make a project about the @CAPS4 and I had four days to do it. You know what I did? I went on a historical website about the @CAPS4. I got an A+ for my project. When people need history, it's always readily available all around them on the internet. My very last reason states that instead of texting people from far - away places, why not just use an e - mail address. For example, you don't have to pay for an e - mail address. It's actually free, and did you know, more than @NUM3 million people around the world use an e - mail address instead of texting other people. When you don't have an e - mail address, it's very quick to make one. You don't have to waste money to text someone halfway around the globe. In conclusion, I think that we should have computers. One reason is that we have a lot more information on the internet. Another reason is because there is some history on some websites. And my last reason is because you can send messages to a far - away place by using e - mail. These benefits clearly show that computers are an important part of our lives, and we should continue to make good use of them. Thank you for reading this article.
1371	1375	1	3	"New @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 computers are truly a remarkable benefit to society. Most people might not think so, but there are numerous compelling reasons why they are. People will always have something engaging to do when they're bored. There's a vast ocean of knowledge to explore, and it helps you stay well - organized. After reading this paper, you'll surely agree with me that computers are a boon. Do you ever find yourself bored and with nothing to occupy your time? Well, if you have a computer nearby, there are endless activities to keep you busy. People can have in - depth conversations with their friends and maintain close contact with them, no matter how far away they move. There are countless websites that offer a wide variety of games. Every type of game you can imagine is available on the computer. You @MONTH1 be thinking, ""I might get addicted to a game and never want to take my eyes off the screen."" Well, in that case, you can always set a timer on it to allocate a specific amount of time. Don't worry, it will give you a warning before it shuts down. The computer isn't just about fun and games, though. It's brimming with knowledge, like the collective wisdom of @NUM1 scientists and mathematicians. If you have a school assignment to write a paper on someone famous, you can quickly research them on the computer to gather information. There will be plenty of detailed websites about that person. Also, every day there are fresh news updates about what's happening around the world. You never have to worry about being in the dark. Do you like to stay organized? I personally think it's much easier to navigate through life when you know where things are and stay well - organized. The computer is an excellent and effortless way to achieve that. There are many useful programs that you can use to write documents, create graphs, and do whatever tasks you need. About <@PERCENT1@NUM2> of working people rely on the computer to do their jobs and keep track of everything. @PERCENT1 of the working population is a significant amount. So, think about it. If computers weren't invented, that <@PERCENT1@NUM2> of people would either not have jobs or would have to record everything on paper, which @MONTH1 be a disaster. After a while, you @MONTH1 want to back up all your important data by copying your photos, files, music, etc., to a @CAPS4 so that you don't lose everything if your computer malfunctions. After reading this, don't you agree with me that computers are a great benefit to society? There are many more reasons, but this paper has covered a lot. I hope you've realized that without computers, the world wouldn't be as advanced as it is today. Thank you for your time."
1372	1376	1	3	Dear @PERSON1, I'm writing this letter to discuss the fact that computers have a negative impact on the average American. Here are my reasons: people are spending less time outdoors, they lack exercise, and they don't interact with their families as much. Spending little time outside can have a significant effect on nature. For instance, they may start to care less about our beautiful planet and not be concerned about polluting. If they took the time to go outside instead of constantly running the air - conditioner, they could save money and go out to be with their friends. Lack of exercise can be extremely harmful to your health. Sitting in front of the computer all day isn't exercise; it's just plain laziness. When you exercise, you feel great about yourself. Your adrenaline starts pumping, you can stay in shape, and you won't have to worry about being unhealthy if you step away from the computer. When family members don't interact and instead, one person is on the computer while the others are watching @CAPS1, you might end up arguing with your family a lot. Don't you want to have a healthy family relationship? So, why not encourage your family to sit down at the table and talk about how their day went? I've stated my reasons for believing that computers have a negative effect on people. I hope that you agree with my points so that we can find a way to help everyone use their computers moderately and get more active. In conclusion, it's clear that the over - use of computers is causing harm, and we need to take steps to address this issue.
1373	1377	1	3	Wouldn't you love to find a @NUM1 - star hotel or restaurant with just a click of a button? I know I would. So, the question is, should we keep using computers for the betterment of our society, or should we put them aside to get more exercise? Computers are incredibly helpful to us. They can do work that requires precision and neatness. It also allows us to access and surf the internet to discover a wealth of useful information. A computer is highly intelligent and doesn't just come in a boring, heavy, box - shaped form. Computers are also integrated into some electronics. If you go on vacation and forget to turn off the lights at home, you can use your handy handheld computer to switch them off. Communication is a breeze on a computer. All you need is, of course, a computer, a microphone or headset, some speakers, and a special software. Once you have all these, you can connect with the rest of the world! You can talk to your loved ones or family members through your computer. If you want, you can also get a webcam, a video camera specifically designed for use on your computer. Then you can have face - to - face conversations with others! If you don't have all the equipment I just mentioned, there's still texting. You can simply use your computer keyboard to type and send a message. Your computer can do a whole lot more. You can play various mindless video games, but your computer must meet the right specifications to run them smoothly. Sure, it might cost a bit to get the appropriate setup. In conclusion, computers offer numerous benefits in terms of convenience, communication, and entertainment, and while exercise is important, we can find a balance to enjoy the advantages of both.
1374	1378	1	3	Dear newspaper, @CAPS1 you have a computer? Of course you @CAPS1, because that's where you source all the information you need. Computers are truly wonderful, and everyone should own one. The computers enable you to learn new things and search for any information you desire. It also allows you to communicate with your family, friends, or other people you need to interact with. Moreover, it can let you stay informed about disasters in other countries and teach you about the world. Computers are beneficial and help a large number of people in these ways. Computers can allow you to learn new things and conduct in - depth research. If you're in school and need to @CAPS1 research, well, there you have it, a computer to assist you. This is also highly useful for jobs. Anyone can use them and acquire new knowledge simultaneously. It lets you @CAPS1 work efficiently, learn new things, and it's quick and easy to @CAPS1. You don't have to @CAPS1 the arduous task of searching for a book and spending hours looking for the information you need. Computers are amazing, and you should make full use of them. Another great aspect is that you can communicate using them. If you have family or friends living far away or in another country, you can communicate with them via computers. You can easily have a webcam session with them or send an email. This is very convenient, and it helps you stay close to them. This is also great if you @CAPS1 business online. You can @CAPS1 your job and interact with the people you need to. If you ever have to arrange an emergency meeting and don't have time to call everyone, simply send them an email, and you're all set for the meeting the next day, and so are they. This is a perfect solution for communication and business. My final reason for advocating computers is that they are ideal for learning about disasters in other countries. If you ever miss the news and really want to catch up, you can go on your computer to watch the news, learn new things, and see what unfortunate events have occurred. Also, if you're living away from your hometown, you can go online to see what's happening there and plan to visit for any special occasions. You can learn a great deal about other countries. Additionally, you can learn about new places if you ever consider moving to another country. You can check out hotels or anything you need if you want to go on vacation. This is a great way to plan your trips and learn about other places. In conclusion, based on all these facts, computers are excellent. It allows you to learn new things and @CAPS1 research effectively. Also, it facilitates communication with others. In short, computers are an indispensable part of modern life, and their benefits far outweigh any minor drawbacks.
1375	1379	1	3	"Dear @LOCATION1, @CAPS1 has come to my attention that more and more people are spending excessive amounts of time on computers. A recent study confirmed this, reporting that ""@PERCENT1 of @LOCATION2's population uses a computer for more than @NUM1 hours a day"". This means that people have less time to exercise, enjoy nature, and socialize. I firmly believe that the benefits of computers are greatly overshadowed by the problems they bring. In summary, computers limit a person's health - both physical and social - and do more harm than good to society. Spending too much time on computers can deteriorate a person's health by preventing them from exercising. Take, for example, @LOCATION3, who goes on the computer at least five times a week, for about four hours each time. @LOCATION3 has stopped playing soccer because she prefers to spend time on Facebook. Instead of getting six hours of exercise a week, she now only gets one hour. This has led to @LOCATION3 gaining weight and losing her fitness. The problem is that there are millions of children like @LOCATION3 who aren't getting enough exercise and instead choose to spend too much time on their computers. Another issue is that people spend less time enjoying nature. Now, they opt to surf the web instead. This results in people caring less about our planet and its animals. Nature is extremely important and can be a lot of fun, so this is truly a pity. Furthermore, those who spend an overwhelming amount of time on computers tend to interact less with their family members. Most children no longer help with cooking, cleaning, or doing chores, nor do they spend time with their siblings. One mother says, ""Ever since my daughter got her new laptop, she hasn't once gone to play with her baby brother or friends."" Unfortunately, the same situation holds true for most teens today. Computers have reduced the amount of time families spend together. In conclusion, computers are causing harm to society. They keep people confined to their rooms instead of getting exercise, enjoying nature, or having a good time with their families and friends. In doing so, computers have become a burden to society. Therefore, @CAPS1 is essential that people who spend more than an hour a day on computers use that time to exercise, socialize, or even just relax. Overall, it's clear that computers are no longer a net benefit to society, and we need to find a better balance."
1376	1380	1	3	"Dear local newspaper, it has come to my attention that many of us disagree on whether computers have a negative or positive effect on people. I firmly believe that computers do not benefit society. In today's modern world, many people spend far too much time on the computer when they could be engaging in activities like exercising, spending quality time with family and friends, and enjoying the beauty of nature. Read on, and I am sure you will agree.  First of all, computers are becoming a significant problem in society because they interfere with our physical well - being. The obesity rate in the @LOCATION1 is continuously growing. It's not the population that's expanding but the size of our people! According to a recent survey, @NUM1 out of every @NUM2 people in the @LOCATION1 are overweight or obese. ""The main culprit of the @ORGANIZATION2's high percentage of obesity is not overeating; it is actually electronics! Especially things like computers,"" said @PERSON1, a surgeon at @ORGANIZATION1, after dealing with a severe case of obesity. Obesity is not an insurmountable problem. All we have to do is instead of sitting for hours staring at a screen. America needs to get outside! It can be as simple as riding a bike or taking your dog for a walk. Whatever you do, just get off your computer and go outside or to the gym for exercise!  Secondly, computers interfere with family and friends. I know from personal experience that parents are frustrated when their kids miss family dinner or won't go out with their friends because they ""need"" to finish the next level on their game or they ""need"" to look something up on the internet. Family and friends should be very important in your life, but unfortunately, for most people, it is not. Psychologist @PERSON2 has discovered that overall, having family and friends that you can count on beside you will make you a much happier and more enjoyable person. By eliminating computers from our lives, we will create a happy and more pleasant society for the people of the @LOCATION1, doing everyone a favor.  Furthermore, if we cut back on our hours on the computer, we will have a better chance to experience the wonders that mother nature has to offer us. Most people don't realize how much they are missing by not going outside. There are amazing things, right in your own backyard, that you will probably never get to experience because you are too addicted to playing on the computer. @NUM3 years ago, people were able to function fine without computers, so we should be able to too. @PERCENT1 of people have never even been camping! So next time you feel like spending another @NUM4 hours on the computer, take a walk, and I'm sure you will be amazed at what you find outdoors.  In conclusion, computers do not benefit society. They just keep people away from going outside, enjoying nature, and spending time with family and friends. I hope I have convinced you to see my side of the argument, and thank you for your time."
1377	1381	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, I firmly think that computers have a negative effect on people. One clear reason I hold this view is that people need regular exercise. They shouldn't be sitting at a desk all day, glued to their screens, playing games on the computer. Especially kids, who are in their growing years, should be outside, running around, playing sports, and getting fresh air. More and more people will become obese if all they do is sit at a computer all day and munch on junk food. If more people exercise, they will also start making better food choices. As a result, many people will be much healthier and lead happier, more active lives.  My second reason for believing that computers are negative is that some kids, especially during @MONTH1, get cyberbullied. This is when someone gets bullied online. Kids do this because they don't have to say it in person, and they can say anything they want, and the other person might not even know who it is. Another concerning aspect is that kids might meet someone they don't know and think is nice, but in reality, you don't know who that person really is. That person could trick you into doing things that you normally wouldn't do because you think they're your age or that they like you. Sadly, many girls have gotten into dangerous situations because of this.  My last reason is that people could miss out on fun activities with family or friends, like going swimming in the @DATE1 or sledding in the winter. If you're at home, sitting in front of the computer, you can't participate in these fun outdoor activities and get exercise while doing them.  These are my reasons for thinking that computers have a negative effect on people. We should be more aware of these issues and encourage a more balanced lifestyle.
1378	1382	1	3	"Dear The @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I firmly believe that computers offer a lot more pros than they do cons. Computers provide another excellent way to learn about the world. They can also act as a powerful research tool. If a child, or anyone, is spending what a family member thinks is an unreasonable amount of time on the computer, that seems to be just an issue between the person and his or her family.  Many people might argue and say, ""Look in the encyclopedia to learn about the world,"" but a computer is faster, easier, and more time - efficient to use. In fact, most people in the newest generation of families probably don't even have an encyclopedia set. For example, if I were to want to learn more about @LOCATION1, instead of searching in a dictionary or encyclopedia, I could go on the computer, type in @LOCATION1, and a whole slew of links and opportunities would be found right at my fingertips. Some people might prefer the old ways, but personally, I like the freedom and easiness that a computer offers.  Have you ever had to research for a project or report? Many people, either in school or in the work field, will most likely need to research something to gain a better understanding. Yes, a dictionary is helpful. Yes, a thesaurus is helpful, but they are separate tools. Compared to a computer, those classic research tools are still useful, but they can be a hassle. My point is that a computer has a dictionary, thesaurus, encyclopedia... etc., all in one! So next time you have to research something, try reaching for the keyboard instead of the bookshelf!  To me, the problem of someone being on the computer too much sounds more like a family problem than a social problem. Technology has changed our world! Ever since computers were invented, not only have they become smaller in size, but they have also become more and more useful. The computer has opened more doors for our society. Without computers, space travel, for example, would not be as common as it seems to be in this generation.  All I'm trying to say is that I don't think computers hurt our society; instead, they are pretty much the building blocks for our world. While reading this paper, I hope you noticed the pros of having computers in this world. A computer is a great learning tool, the king of all research tools, and a big part of our society today. If you could learn one thing from reading this paper, I would want you to think, ""Where would we, as a world, be without computers?"
1379	1383	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 register, I am writing to you to strongly urge you that the effect computers have on people is highly beneficial. The reasons I say that computers are helpful are that they assist in giving directions, aid in improving the economy, and offer a useful means of instant messaging. Read on, and I'll explain how and why these aspects of computers are so helpful.  Let me clarify what I meant when I said computers help give directions. You know when you need to travel somewhere far and you don't have a GPS in your car and have no idea how to get there? Well, then the computer becomes your only reliable option. For example, when I was traveling down south on @DATE1, we didn't have a @CAPS4.P.S, and we were completely lost. So, we logged on to Google and quickly found our directions. This shows how useful computers can be in such situations.  Now, let's talk about how computers are helping our economy. Given the current state of our economy, which is quite challenging, one way computers are beneficial is that instead of people driving to pay their bills, they can pay online. This not only saves money for individuals but also helps the state. The state won't have to pay for as much gas for the cars or deal with frequent car repairs. For instance, there's a gas station near my house that is getting re - built because something went wrong with the pipes. This repair is costing us all about @MONEY1. This clearly shows that this is a way we can save the economy.  Finally, here's another great reason how computers are helpful: instant messaging. This is extremely useful if you don't have a house phone or a cellphone and you need to tell a family member or friend that something really bad has happened. You can use instant messaging (@CAPS5) because they will surely receive it. Like one time, my friend didn't have a house phone or a cellphone, and someone was trying to break into her house. She instant - messaged me to let me know, and it was sent to my cellphone. I immediately called her mom to inform her. Before I knew it, another message came through saying ""@CAPS6 you.""  After reading about how computers are helpful by providing directions, saving the economy, and enabling instant messaging, can you agree with me that computers are truly helpful? It's still your opinion, but you've read my thoughts, so think about what you've read and decide if it isn't true. We should embrace the benefits that computers bring to our lives."
1380	1384	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, In my own opinion, computers do not have a positive effect on people. Online, you can access any website and engage in conversations with people. Most of the time, you might not even know who it is you're speaking with. Additionally, not all the information you might find online is true. Computers also steal time that could be spent on something productive, like playing outside. In the next few paragraphs, I'll elaborate on my point.  First off, online websites offer numerous ways to contact people, such as chat rooms, blogs, and email. But, seriously, do you really know if the people you're talking to are who they claim to be? Back then, it was rare for someone to get caught when trying to kidnap a child by pretending to be someone online. However, these days, more and more such cases are being uncovered. You might think this won't happen to your child, but my friend was being stalked online by someone who they haven't caught yet. We never thought something like that would happen, but it did. Also, once information is posted online, it never truly goes away. So, be very careful about what you put online because there is always some way to find what you had posted, even after it's been deleted.  Moreover, not every bit of information found online is true. Professionals say that @PERCENT1 of kids have researched a project online and then used a print source only to find that the online information was false. On websites like Wikipedia, anyone has the ability to change what is written on the page. Most websites, about @PERCENT2, give the same ability to anyone. Also, posts and pictures on the internet might not always be appropriate. There are certain things we keep children from seeing for a good reason.  Lastly, computers keep you from doing anything productive. While it might teach some hand - eye coordination, it does not keep you fit and healthy. Already, @PERCENT3 of @CAPS4 alone are overweight, and that's a significant number of people. Dr. @DR1 says that online games keep kids from getting the much - needed exercise and fresh air that every growing child requires.  In conclusion, the internet keeps children from going outside to play. Also, not everything found online is true or right. Lastly, not everyone you meet online is the person they portray themselves to be. This is why I firmly believe that computers aren't positive for society. We should be more cautious about our and our children's use of computers.
1381	1385	1	3	"Did you know that in a recent poll in the @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @PERCENT1 of @CAPS3 use computers every single day? Computers have a truly very positive effect on people. They are like a well - informed friend, informing them on news, traffic, and weather right away. They also serve as a bridge for interacting with others and a vast library for learning new facts. Can you even begin to imagine how difficult life would be without computers? They are a daily tool that millions of people rely on positively. One way that people use computers positively is by using them to stay informed about news, traffic, and weather. For example, say there are clear signs of a powerful hurricane going to hit near their homes. They would know right away just by a simple click on the internet. Another example is if there was a shooting nearby. People would be well - aware of all the detailed facts by reading an in - depth article online. Computers help by informing people about danger so they and their families are not harmed. Not only do computers help inform people about any danger through news and weather, but they also enhance their daily lifestyle. My father drives into work every morning, and he is always looking online for any real - time traffic updates so he can avoid congested areas and get to work on time and safely. Without computers, people would be unable to know directly the harms and difficulties they @MONTH1 face. Another positive effect computers have on people is letting them interact with others, such as video chatting and instant messaging. @PERCENT2 of the world regularly video chats and instant messages. It helps to make people more social, by chatting with their friends. Another example is, say you haven't seen a close family member or friend in a long time. Video chatting and instant messaging will help you catch up and develop a stronger relationship. Nobody wants to waste time in life not speaking for a long period of time to a close friend or family member, right? Computers help people by interacting with others throughout their daily lifestyle. A third positive effect computers have on people is teaching them new things. Students' main source for education is through the computer on the internet. @PERSON1 from @ORGANIZATION1 said, ""Computers are what helps my students grow. I have them use computers every day for reports and to extend their learning."" They are extremely helpful to students because the internet now contains digital textbooks they use in class. That way, they won't need to lug around heavy books and stress out for forgetting them. Moreover, if the student doesn't understand material learned in class, they can look online for extra help and guidance, making their knowledge grow further. Without computers, lives wouldn't be the same in a negative way. Computers help people know news, traffic, weather directly, interact with people, and learn new things. Therefore, computers are very positive. Since @PERCENT1 of @CAPS3 use them now positively, there's no reason to stop."
1382	1386	1	3	"Dear @LOCATION1 harold, More and more people are using computers these days, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. Those who support advancements in technology firmly believe that computers have a positive effect on people. However, computers can also be a bad thing. They can deprive children of the joys of exercising, enjoying nature, and spending quality time with family and friends. First of all, computers can stop children from exercising. ""@CAPS1 I can never get outside after school because I'm constantly checking my email,"" said a @CAPS2 high - school student. A recent study shows that @PERCENT1 of students at a middle school, as soon as they come home, go right on to the computer. This shows that almost half of the students at just the middle school are glued to the computer. This is why computers can be a bad thing. Secondly, some children spend far more time in the comfort of the indoors than in the great outdoors. ""I spend most of my time breathing in air - conditioning (or heat) rather than fresh air,"" lamented a @CAPS2 middle - school student. Imagine, a child is sitting there, staring at a computer screen playing a game or on Facebook, while outside it's a beautiful sunny day in the middle of @DATE1. @NUM1 out of @NUM2 students admitted that they spend more time indoors than out. Computers can be a bad influence in a child's life. Finally, computers can interfere with a child's time spent with family or friends. ""I @CAPS1 spend an entire evening at a family party on this computer,"" a @CAPS3 elementary student confessed. @NUM3 out of @NUM4 homes have a computer and it is being used frequently by children. This shows that little @PERSON1 of the @PERSON2's household is ever outside playing with friends. Computers can do more harm than good in a household. It can stop children from exercising, enjoying the outdoors, and spending time with family. I earnestly ask you to tell your children or grandchildren, nieces, and nephews to cut down on computer time. In conclusion, it's crucial to find a balance to ensure children lead healthy and well - rounded lives."
1383	1387	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 as we all know, more and more people are using computers. Some believe that this would be a concern because it affects people's health. I firmly believe that with the advances in technology, it would bring positive effects on people. Here are three solid reasons why. First would be that with advances in tech, it would teach us to be more intelligent. Second would be that it would give us the ability to have access to interesting things we can't easily get at the library, like detailed biographies. And finally, it provides access to communicate online. My first reason, @CAPS2 as I mentioned before, was that it would give us intelligence. If we have questions about something we don't know, we can quickly search on the computer and find our answer. We would learn this new knowledge and would be able to teach others. The computer can offer us a lot of useful information that can benefit us in the future. My second reason is that the advance in tech would help us because it gives us access to helpful websites that teach us. Not all information is found in the library. The computer has access to biographies, educational websites, and most importantly, the access to educational advances. For example, online tutoring is available for students with difficulties in school. My third and final reason why the advance in tech would and could benefit us is that it gives us access to online communication. Some people have e - mail for good reasons. For example, teachers have e - mail for educational purposes. If a student is having problems with their work, the student can simply send the teacher an e - mail explaining what the student's difficulty is and what the student can do. In conclusion, the benefits of technological advancement with computers are clear, and I hope you will seriously consider these advantages.
1384	1388	1	3	Computers have a positive effect on people's lives. They are truly big helpers. They teach you essential skills you need in life. The remarkable technology abilities of computers help us with various tasks every single day. Finally, they help people to keep in touch and meet new people. I firmly think that computers have a very positive effect on our lives. Computers teach us many things. First of all, just learning how to use the computer is a vital skill you need in life. At most jobs, you have to know how to work a computer. Today, computers are an essential part of most work environments. Hand - eye coordination is another skill the computer teaches you. Computers actually help you with sports in a way. To catch a ball, you need good hand - eye coordination. The technology the computer offers helps us a great deal in life. If you need directions, you can quickly look it up on the computer. If you couldn't, you would have to call the restaurant for directions. Without the computer's help, we would all have to painstakingly write all of our papers out. For students, it would be a nightmare to have to do reports without a computer. We would have to read so many books to get the information. The world would be a much different place without computers. Sometimes, people who we love have to move far away from us. It's hard to keep in touch on the phone when that happens. The computer can keep you in touch. With popular programs like Facebook, Twitter, and @ORGANIZATION1, it's entirely possible. You can chat with them and share pictures of how they're doing. You could even keep in touch with them from @LOCATION1. Computers make almost anything possible. In conclusion, computers are great machines. They teach us life - long lessons. They help us when we need something or have to do a report. Computers even keep people in touch so their relationships don't fall apart. I don't know about you, but I truly think computers keep the world up and running smoothly.
1385	1389	1	3	"Dear Local Newspaper, There are so many people who are addicted to computers. They think that the computer can help them, and yes, to others, it helps them with their work and education. However, most children are addicted to computer games. There are @PERCENT1 of children who are addicted to computers. For some reason, computers have a lot of effects on people. It might affect children's education, or it might be the cause why your electricity bills have gone higher. The worst part of having a computer at home is that it can be a reason for millions of teenagers who have been killed for always talking online with people they don't know. Computers are sometimes dangerous for people. Do people still need a computer? Having a computer at home is not good, especially for children. This is because computers can affect their education. Parents don't want that to happen to their children. There are a lot of uneducated children who stay home or do drugs in the street. Yes, the computer can help them with their studies or projects, but other children are on the computer just because they want to play games. That's why a lot of them don't learn anything at school but learn a lot in computer games. They should stop playing computer games. Also, having computers at home can be the cause of people's electricity bills going higher than they were @DATE1 when they didn't have computers. Other people think that computers can't give you any problems, but computers run on electricity, and you have to pay for the electricity bills. If you had @MONEY1 for your electricity bill @DATE1 year when you didn't have a computer, it might go up to @MONEY2 for your bill now that you have the computer. It's a big problem for you. Nevertheless, computers are dangerous. Computers can be good or bad. Without a doubt, @PERCENT2 of teenagers have been killed because of talking online with strangers. Most websites like @CAPS2 are now in danger. @DATE1 @DATE1 months, a husband and wife got killed because of @CAPS2. The husband killed his wife because of her being ""single"" in her relationship status on her @CAPS2. She got shot by her husband. However, her husband then killed himself. They were both shot! Talking online and meeting up with strangers you don't know can be the reason for your misfortune. Parents should not have computers at home unless they will use it, and it needs to be in their room where children can't use it. Now is the time to take action! We don't need computers at home, and yes, we can live without the computer. We can do various activities with our family, exercise for our health, go on a picnic with friends, or have fun going on vacation with the whole family. Local newspaper, I want you to tell the people to stop over - relying on the computer and tell them to go out with their family and have fun doing activities or go on vacation. In conclusion, it's time to break free from the potential harms of computer addiction and embrace a more balanced and healthy lifestyle."
1386	1390	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 of the newspaper, I understand you think computers don’t have an effect on people. However, computers do have a notable impact on people. For one reason, the computer helps people find out information about anything in a convenient and efficient manner. Also, it significantly aids people in doing work, streamlining various tasks. Plus, you can communicate with anyone you want, regardless of geographical distances. Don’t make any decisions before carefully thinking about these effects on people.  First of all, computers help people find information quickly. To find information, everybody commonly uses either Google or Ask and many more search engines. The information that people find would probably help them locate where a store is or obtain a number for a restaurant. Not just that, but you can also find out how much something costs at a store and if it is on sale or not. These are just some of the great effects computers have on people.  However, work is a really large area where computers have a significant effect. For example, computers would really help someone if they are looking for a job because there are numerous stores and job opportunities you get to choose from online. To go along with that, adults and children use the computer to type something on Word, whether it's for a report for work or an essay in school. Maybe you have used the computer to type information for your newspaper, making the process much easier and faster.  Yet, one thing kids love to do on the computer is communicate with their friends. Most kids either use Facebook, @CAPS2, or Oovoo to communicate. Having these programs helps kids stay in touch with friends that moved away. Plus, one good thing about these programs is that if you have family that lives very far away from you, you can always talk to them at any time, seeing their faces and sharing moments as if they were right there with you.  I understand why you might think computers don’t have an effect on people. But in reality, computers do have many effects on people. That’s not all; computers help people find what they’re looking for. It also helps you with your work, making it more productive. Nevertheless, computers are a great way to communicate with friends or family, strengthening relationships. Think long and hard about what decision that you want to make, as the influence of computers on people is undeniable.
1387	1391	1	3	I think that computers have a good effect on people. When people are on the computer, they are not on for very long periods. I also think computers have a good effect on people because of the new and innovative technology. Computers are positive and they can help you when you are stuck or need to look something up, providing quick and reliable solutions.  To me, computers are positive. When people go on the computer, they are not on for @NUM1 hours straight. Sure, they might be on @NUM1 hours in a day, but they do other important things in between, like going to school, having meals, and participating in various activities. Some people need computers for their @CAPS1. News @CAPS2 companies need computers for editing and printing out the paper. They also put the news on their website, reaching a wider audience. What would most people do without a computer? It has become an essential tool in many aspects of life.  Computers are positive because of the new technology! The new technology is helping people interact over the internet. If you have a long - distance friend or family member, there are numerous ways to talk to them. You could use @CAPS3, Skype, Oovoo, @CAPS4, or even email. When I go on the computer, I don’t just sit and watch @CAPS5 @CAPS6 or @CAPS7 online. I interact with my friends. @PERCENT1 of the US population between the ages @NUM3 have a @CAPS3. @PERCENT2 have Skype or Oovoo and talk to people that are too far away to visit, bridging the gap of distance.  Computers are positive because they can help you with school. If there is something you don't know, just go on the internet and look it up. If you need to translate @CAPS8 to @CAPS9, just go on the computer and translate it. @PERCENT3 of people learned a dictionary on their own using the internet. If there is a word you want to know and isn't in the dictionary, look it up and it will be online, expanding your knowledge.  Computers have a positive effect on people. Nobody spends so much time on the computer that they can't go outside or hang out with their friends. People actually need the computer for their @CAPS1. The new technology that is coming out is letting people interact with people across the world. They are positive to have for school work, definitions, and even translation. Computers are not negative and they don't take away what you should do in life. Instead, they enhance our capabilities and connections, making our lives more convenient and fulfilling.
1388	1392	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1 Newspaper, do you remember @CAPS2 when you were a kid? There weren't any computers or other electronics except the telephone. The computer is very advanced and helps people in many different ways, such as improving hand - eye coordination, facilitating learning, and enabling online communication. These things benefit society and prove the advancement in technology.  The computer teaches hand - eye coordination when people don't even realize it. Through typing, whether typing an email or an essay, your hands are working in tandem with your eyes, helping you develop this important skill. The hand - eye coordination that people learn on a computer can be used for sports. @PERSON3, a @NUM1 years old tennis player, said, ""I used to go on the computer every day and play tennis later, and eventually the computer helped me with my favorite sport."" Hand - eye coordination is very useful for many things. We surveyed @NUM2 people and @NUM3 of these people say that hand - eye coordination is a very important skill and that everyday activities, such as using the computer, help them improve it.  Typing is very commonly used while sending emails because they are fast, fun, and let you communicate effectively. When talking on a computer, there are many new and popular ways that are fast, such as email, AIM, Facebook, and many more. It is nice to be able to talk to friends and family online because other options are more expensive. For example, many live on @LOCATION1 and her sister, @PERSON4, whom she is very close to, lives in @LOCATION3. They can't talk to each other a lot because neither of their calling plans allow them to call without charging hundreds of more dollars. They also can't fly to see each other because plane tickets are expensive these days. Also, the economy isn't doing that great, so they couldn't stay in - touch until webcams came out. Now, they see each other almost every week. Many said, ""I was considering flying to @LOCATION3, but now the webcams and email are useful and save us both a lot of money.""  People sometimes argue that you can just send letters to each other, but you can't send your baby boy's first steps that you just video - taped, or a YouTube video that is really cute. Also, you can meet new people online that you might not have seen normally, and when you can stay in touch, you can stay much closer to each other.  Even though computers are great for fun, working and learning are much easier online. When online, everything that can be learned is amazing, whether it's what a certain word means or the details of the earthquake in @LOCATION4. Being able to keep track of everything in one computer is amazing. @PERSON2, a @NUM4 @CAPS3 teacher at @LOCATION2, says, ""@CAPS4, we are trying to make more things electronic to protect the planet, so we don't waste paper and cut down trees."" It is true. About @PERCENT1 of the homework of @NUM5 graders is online, whether it is to look up the equation for photosynthesis or to find out what year @CAPS6 died. It gives more chances for kids to learn more things faster, like @NUM6 graders have a math class online on Hey Math. It gives people more information coming from more people. Online, you can read a scientist's experiment or a paparazzi's take on @PERSON1's new boyfriend.  The computer has changed society a lot, for the better. Now, in the @DATE1, computers are part of the everyday lives of people in which they benefit. With better hand - eye coordination, being able to talk to your friends, and being able to learn, the computer clearly benefits society, making our lives more connected, informed, and efficient."
1389	1393	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, In my opinion, computers take time away from exercising. Also, no one has enough time to enjoy nature because of the allure of the computer. Of course, when it comes to family and friends, the time spent with them is stifled by the computer. If more people get off @CAPS1 and @CAPS2, I'm positive all these issues would be resolved.  I'm sure that the computer is affecting everyone negatively. Obesity is a huge problem in @LOCATION1. One in five children are obese. I feel the computer is contributing to the problem. I remember times when I wanted to go outside and exercise, but the computer dragged me away with all the fun games and interesting videos on the internet. Sure, the computer is fine in moderation, but many people abuse their privileges, spending excessive hours in front of the screen.  Obesity leads to many health problems, such as clogged arteries or strokes. No parent wants to see their child go through such health issues at a young age. But if the computer is taking away so much time from physical activity, how can we fix it? Taking away the computer might seem difficult for many, as it has become so integrated into our lives. Everybody these days is so caught up in the digital world. People have put so much effort into making the computer a central part of their lives. I'm sure I would have had more quality time if I had gone outside more. People have probably missed out on a lot of good times because of the computer.  The computer also takes time away from family. Family time is being sacrificed as people are glued to their screens. In conclusion, I feel the computer is an addiction. Millions of people who spend a lot of time on the computer gain weight. Also, it takes time away from the opportunity to enjoy nature, but the computer is blocking the way. Another thing is that the computer puts family and friends on hold. Memories are being stolen by the awful device that is the computer. So, we should be more aware of how bad the computer can be when used in excess and take steps to limit its negative impact on our lives.
1390	1394	1	3	"Dear Newspaper, I think that computers have a negative impact on society. I say this because it allows kids to be bullied at all hours of the day, constantly invading their sense of safety. It takes away from their exercise, leading to a more sedentary lifestyle. And it gives them less time to study and do school work, affecting their academic performance.  Overall, I think that talking is the main use for computers. But, sometimes it is used in the wrong way, @CAPS1. Experts say that @NUM1 out of every @NUM2 kids have things to use to talk online, but they also say that @NUM3 in @NUM4 of those kids are bullied online. Also, every year you hear about someone being affected by this, well, most of the time it is because of @CAPS1. In fact, I heard on the news that half of the kids were bullied online. And because you can go on at all hours of the day, kids can get bullied at any time. Some children say that they are happy when they go home because they can't be bullied at school, but unfortunately, they can still be bullied at their safe place, their home.  Another bad thing about the computer is that it replaces exercise. A text A and @CAPS2 football scout said ""every year there are less and less people who play sports because of video games or computers."" As a result, the obesity rate of kids has gone up in America and many agree that the cause is computers taking the place of exercise. Also, people think that you get better hand - eye coordination, but most leaders agree that you don't because it is not your hand that is moving in a natural way, it is your mouse.  Lastly, now grades are lower than ever for students. Most teachers say that @NUM3 in @NUM6 students get good grades and they say that all @NUM7 that don't spend too much time on the computer. I was watching the Discovery Channel and it said that most kids are spending @NUM4 hours on the computer and less than @NUM3 hour on studying or homework. The computer was made for storing information and learning. How did we let it go from that to a tool used for @CAPS1, making lazy kids, and for anti - learning! We need to be more aware of the negative impacts of computers and take steps to ensure that they are used in a more beneficial way, so that our society, especially our children, can thrive."
1391	1395	1	3	@CAPS1 “Dinners ready.” “Okay mom, one second.” Click, click, click. Are you hearing this from your children more than usual? Well, if you are, then you need to listen to this upcoming message. We, the @ORGANIZATION1, believe our children and adults are spending too much time on their laptops or computers. They're not out exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with their family. These problems could lead to bigger problems that @MONTH1 have already taken effect, like: @CAPS2, financial problems, and then to depression. So, keep reading and think about what you hear that could or has happened to you. @CAPS2 is a huge thing to worry about. Kids all over @LOCATION1 are on their computers rather than outside. Every day I see my nephew on his computer. I see him getting fatter and fatter every day. Studies have shown that children and adults who own a Facebook or MySpace account gain about @NUM1 pounds every @NUM2 months. If they're even on @NUM3 to @NUM2 hours a day, they'll gain @NUM5 pounds every month. Sooner or later, the state is going to have the @CAPS2 level rise from @PERCENT1 to @PERCENT2 among @ORGANIZATION1 people who are obese. This could lead to loss of @ORGANIZATION1 jobs and laziness. When people spend most of @ORGANIZATION1 their time on Facebook and MySpace, they could lose their jobs. More than @PERCENT3 of @ORGANIZATION1 the state citizens own a Facebook or MySpace. So, when people are addicted to them, they spend more time on that than the stuff they have to do for their jobs. So, then they'll get fired, can't pay bills, loans, and mortgages. This then will all lead to depression. Depression is all over the state, even the country. People are losing jobs left and right because of their computers and the internet. People are even committing crimes like murder and even attempting @ORGANIZATION1 suicide because of the loss of @ORGANIZATION1 jobs or family members. Some people are even so addicted to the internet that they neglect their new - born family members. This depression needs to stop. So, fight for the right to stop the addiction to internet use and live a great life. Drop the computer and pick up a book, meet up with friends and family, keep your jobs. Don't let these reasons come between you and your life.
1392	1396	1	3	@CAPS2 people think the invention of the computer and the internet is a terrifying thing, but truly @CAPS6 is a terrible time - consumer. The local newspaper is doing a survey about people's opinion about technology. People spend way too much time on computers while they could be outside, enjoying nature, exercising, or interacting with people in person. The advancements in technology are just wasting your time. When the weather is nice, people should be outside enjoying @CAPS6 instead of wasting the whole day on the @CAPS1. The sun can be very harmful to your skin, but seen as the sun can help and boost your energy, the carbon dioxide in buildings causes people to become sleepy. @PERCENT1 of people surveyed by @ORGANIZATION1 said they feel better when they go outside. @CAPS2 people are becoming obese while they could be exercising. Obesity is a problem as people sit at the computer all day. @CAPS6 contributes to the @CAPS2 issue. Kids have stopped participating in outdoor activities because of the computer. @PERCENT2 of people surveyed by the @CAPS3 said that computer - people spend less time with friends they see in person. People will forget their manners because they are not used to interacting online. People who support computer usage might say that there are ways to talk, like @CAPS3, @CAPS4, etc. But online chatting isn't always safe. Just because someone is on your buddy list on @CAPS6 doesn't mean they're your real friends unless you can see their face. Computers have become too much of a distraction to society. Computers have caused people to forget how to use manners and communicate in the real world. Now is the time to get on your feet and find something else to do! Responsible townspeople are realizing these issues and should take action.
1393	1397	1	3	My view is that people should go only on the computer if they really have to do something such as type a report, check your e - mail, etc. What's the point of going on the computer if all you're going to do is play games? That gets boring to me. I go on the computer to talk to my friends and check email and stuff, and then I go outside to play. You should only be on the computer for @NUM1 minutes a day and then go get some exercise. If you stay on the computer all day, you will smell bad, get fat, get lazy, and no one wants these things. These are the things you should avoid. You can play basketball, go on a bike ride with some friends, go swimming. I do this type of stuff every day and I am in good shape because of it. I stay healthy and fit. I don't sit on the computer all day on a sunny day. You become more social if you go outside more. It gives you a chance to hang out with some neighborhood kids. When I get home every day, I do my homework then I go outside and play. Then later I go on the computer for @NUM1 minutes, then I'm done and I go to bed, and I do the same thing the next day. So, everyone should agree with me because you know I am right. By following this simple routine, you can lead a balanced and healthy life.
1394	1398	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, Some people say that computers are fun, smart, and do no harm. Is that true though? Do computers cause harm? Well, for one thing, I know that computers can take up a lot of people's time. For example, many people don't go outside as much. This is because most people are usually on their computers. What are they doing on the computer, you ask? Well, let's find out. There are many things a person can do on a computer. It can be fun chatting, educational, or hard - working. A lot of people use a computer for fun. For example, many people use the computer to chat with their friends. There are many sites to chat with friends. That can usually take up a lot of people's time. A lot of people can talk for hours on the computer, and that is what takes up their time instead of going outside. Another example is the games that people are playing. To me, the computer games are one of the biggest problems. This is because a lot of the games can be so much fun that it's easy to find a game and play it all the time. This can not only take up their time outside, but it can ruin their life. The game can be so addictive that kids and adults might not get their work done. That can cause failure in school or getting fired at work. On the other side though, a lot of people use a computer for work and school. Besides internet chatting and computer games, many people use computers for school and at work. People type their work up or they send work to their e - mail to bring home. This is a good thing about computers, but also a bad thing. It is a good thing because now people can get their work done faster. This is a bad thing because it is another reason to stay inside. For work, people depend on computers. They save work on them and they use computers to build things. For example, people use a computer to program a robot. Although they use computers for a good reason, people should make time for outside. A lot of people need to take breaks off the computer because computers can do harm. This is because if they spend all their time on the computer, they can get sick. Going outside, exercising, and getting fresh air is very important. So, people out there, get off your computer. Stop chatting, pause your game, take a break from your work, and go outside. Enjoy the nature. Most of your day should not be on the computer. Thank you for your time. By making a conscious effort to balance computer use and outdoor activities, we can lead healthier and more fulfilling lives.
1395	1399	1	3	Do you feel that computers affect you in a positive way? Well, I don't. I feel that computers have a negative effect on people. I feel this way because you won't be getting enough exercise in your life, you'll have a high light bill, and it'll begin to interfere in your everyday life. Now that I've shown my reasons, let me define them in detailed sentences. To start my essay, I feel that people won't be getting enough exercise. I feel this because if you're on the computer all day and you don't go outside to talk, ride your bike, then you won't be burning any calories. You'll become a couch potato, which down the line can become fatal to your health. As you get older, you can possibly become afflicted with a list of items that can be wrong with you such as diabetes, high cholesterol, and heart problems. Also, I feel that if you are constantly sitting in front of a computer for @NUM1 hours, then you can possibly injure your back, which can add on to the list of problems with your health due to not enough exercise. Next, I feel that if you're constantly on the computer, then your parents will have an extremely high light bill. Your parents will be angry with you and can possibly be in debt to the light company. If you're always on the computer non - stop, before you know it, the bill will be so high that you won't be able to pay it. You'll have a high light bill and can possibly be without light in your house. My personal opinion is that I don't feel computers are worth a family being in debt and without light. Finally, I feel that computers will interfere with your day - to - day life. I feel this way if you're always on the computers and you're never outside, then your friends will think you don't want to be bothered. They'll feel like you're ignoring them, and you'll begin to lose friends who have been there for you and helped you when you needed it most. Also, computers can affect your everyday life by ruining your social life. You'll always be inside while you're missing opportunities to meet new people and build your social skills. To conclude this essay, I've brought to you my ideas and opinions about computers. I've explained to you my reasons, which are you won't be getting enough exercise, you'll have a high light bill, and it'll interfere with your everyday life. I've provided you with facts and details about the consequences of computers. Now you decide whether computers have a positive or negative effect on people. It's important to weigh these factors and make a conscious choice about our computer usage.
1396	1400	1	3	Would you like to be glued to the computer @NUM1 and throw away your precious life? Well, some people already are recklessly throwing their lives away. @CAPS1 you spend excessive time on the computer, you can easily become obese, can gradually lose the ability of interacting with friends and family, and can even completely lose the ability of exploring the wonderful @ORGANIZATION1!!! It's now or never to decide @CAPS1 you want to waste your life over a computer. @CAPS1 you use your computer too much, you can be at a high risk of becoming obese. You can become obese for @NUM2 reasons. First, you aren't exercising while you are sitting idly. Since you are sitting there not doing anything else, you start to munch on a lot of snacks. Finally, @NUM2, is that you can lose the ability to walk as well because you aren't using your legs at all and the obesity makes it extremely hard to walk anymore. The time has come to decide. Also, @CAPS1 you waste your valuable time on the computer, you can lose the ability to interact with your family and friends. @CAPS1 you have children, you can lose the precious opportunity to watch them grow up to adults and can even inadvertently push them away. Also, you can lose your friends because they won't want to hang out with someone who is always on the computer. All that you will have will be your computer. Finally, you'll be all alone because @CAPS6 one will be there when you are finally trying to interact with your family. It's now or never to choose what you want to do with your life. Finally, while you're on the computer checking your MySpace or your Facebook, there's a bunch of amazing things happening around the @ORGANIZATION1. Instead of looking through your hard drive, you should be looking over the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 or looking at the magnificent @CAPS4 tower in @LOCATION2 or finally even going to @ORGANIZATION1 in @LOCATION1 with your family. The time has come to decide. As a conclusion, wasting your life on the computer is bad and can hurt your life in many ways. It can make you obese and take the ability to walk away from you. It could prevent you from spending quality time with family and friends and can even push them away. Finally, you can waste your time at home and not explore the @ORGANIZATION1. The time has come to decide @CAPS1 you want to waste your time or not. My opinion is @CAPS6!!!
1397	1401	1	3	"Dear local newspaper, I'm sure you love kicking back and leisurely surfing the web. After all, the internet is truly an amazing invention. However, the truth of the matter is that some people spend way too much time on the computer. We miss out on all the other important things in life, just because of too much time spent on our laptops. Excessive use of the internet can lead to not enough exercise. It can cause us to be anti - social. And lastly, it doesn't allow us to enjoy the beautiful nature that surrounds us. Do you know what a very high cause of obesity is? Electronics. Kids sit on the computer all day long, while they should be out exercising and keeping fit. Sure, it is still okay to surf the web. You just have to keep the time to a minimum. We could ensure this rule by having a time limit set at home. I myself love to use the computer, but I make sure to get off after about an hour. The whole idea of the ""internet"" is such a broad topic. That leaves us with so much to explore, but we just have to keep an eye on the clock. There are so many forms of chat on the internet; @CAPS1, @ORGANIZATION1, etc. Many people are always on one of those, instead of talking in person. We can eventually become anti - social due to so much time spent on the computer. Although yes, you can be talking over the internet, it is necessary to be talking to people face to face. It is as if we become glued to the computer. Websites such as @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 are also causes of this. People get addicted and are on them constantly. @CAPS4 ""@CAPS5"" websites actually take away time that could be spent with friends. So instead of having a chat over the computer screen, plan a meeting in person. Don't allow the computer to let you lose the social skills that you have built up. I love going outside each season to see the beautiful nature that surrounds us. If you spend too much time on the computer, you won't have time to enjoy it. There are so many things that you would be missing out on. Take time out of your day that you would normally spend on the computer to take a walk outside. Things outdoors are so much prettier than your computer screen, trust me. Once you cut down your computer time little - by - little, you will realize all the other things that are more worth your time. So the next time you think about going to surf the web or play that new computer game, I hope you think about my opinions I presented to you. Too much time on the computer causes us to not get enough exercise, and we can become anti - social. We won't be able to enjoy the nature around us. Computer time is fine in moderation, you just have to be aware of how much time you spend on it. Hopefully, my supported reasons have given you another view on surfing the web."
1398	1402	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, I think that computers are both a good and a bad thing. Computers allow us to play a wide range of games and learn about almost anything under the sun. But computers cannot simulate the feeling of fresh air and the benefits of exercise. Computers allow people to play a wide variety of games. People can play classic games like chess, solitaire, and a great deal of other similar games. Computers also allow us to play a very wide variety of online games. I can think of at least three different well - known sites that have online games. Each site having at least @NUM1 different games! Hundreds of thousands of people play online games every single day! What would they do if we didn't have the computer to play those games? We can also search any topic from a computer anywhere in the world. This is an amazing thing to be able to do. Imagine if nobody had a computer. How would we research so much of our knowledge? Yes, there are other ways, but using a computer is so much faster. Plus, you can print things out on a computer. With a book, you have to painstakingly copy important information down. But you can highlight the important parts on a computer. How much time could be saved? No matter how much fun computers are, kids are getting bigger and bigger all because they spend long hours on them. Computers are amazing and society benefits from them by a lot. But just like everything, computers have their downside. So please inform adults and kids about the goodness of computers, but also warn them about the bad things that could happen if you spend too much time on the computer and not enough time outside.
1399	1403	1	3	"Have you ever gone on the computer? Have you ever sat there on the computer for a long, unproductive time? I am writing you because I am concerned with the health of the town. Many people have computers and go on them daily. It may be fun, but it could also endanger your health. Computers can be addicting and cause us to play for hours on end. Many people do not exercise at all anymore. Most are too busy on their computers. You should have at least @NUM1 minutes of exercise each day. ""@CAPS1 kids should have anywhere from @NUM2 min of exercise on average per day. A lot of kids are now playing video games on the computers for that time instead of exercising,"" says @CAPS2. Sereno. Many kids don't go outside enough either. Did you know you should have a minimum of @NUM3 min in sunlight each day? You get most of your vitamins from the sun. When was the last time you took a bike ride, went camping, or went to the beach? All are very fun things to do that you could be missing out on while learning on the computer. I know I absolutely love going to the beach. Hearing the waves crashing, laughing in the ocean waters, and feeling its coolness is just heaven. If I was on the computers all the time, I would not be able to enjoy it. My most important question to you is, do you like having fun or going out with your family? I think computer interactions don't compare to being with the person. Can you imagine never actually seeing or hearing the person you're talking to? That's how it is with online communication. @PERCENT1 of communication on the billions of people who have access to the internet. Don't you rather talk to the person on the phone or talk face to face? I feel people should spend time exercising, going outdoors, and spending time with friends and family. Remember @NUM1 minutes of exercise, @NUM3 minutes in the sun each day to stay really healthy. Please consider this and write an article to improve the town's social & overall health. It's up to you!"
1400	1404	1	3	Readers, imagine a world without computers. Communication would be extremely difficult, schoolwork would be far more arduous and we'd definitely lose a source that generates tons of fun. Do you really want a world like that? The pros of computers definitely outweigh the cons. For example, computers make world communication way better thanks to tools like email, instant messaging, and video conferencing. Computers also make learning for school easier and allow you to work more efficiently. Lastly, computers make the world a much more interesting and fun place thanks to YouTube, news platforms, and online movies/tv shows. The effect of computers is definitely positive on society. With one click, a message can be sent to anywhere in the world. How great is that? Because of computers, people not only email to each other but we can even have live chat, either through text or videos. Online communication is a great help in my life, and the lives of my peers. For example, whenever I forget homework or have questions about schoolworks, I can reach my peers and get help in a matter of minutes. Not only can I seek help from others on my computer but I can stay in touch with my friends and family. So those who think computers cause us to spend less time with family and friends are mistaken. Computers link the world together and greatly advance communication positively. Aside from communication, computers also greatly improve study and learning in many ways. For example, they make it so that projects and assignments can be done faster and easier thanks to software like Microsoft Word. It's proven that @NUM1 students who use computers for schoolwork find that they make learning easier as well. Online encyclopedias like Wikipedia and Britannica help students all over the world with schoolwork or just learning for fun at home. Another way that computers improve education is through online tutors and help sites. They've made it so you're basically always within minutes of a teacher. I can't imagine completing any assignment without a computer on my desk. Computers are not only practical for school and communication but they're also a great way to spend time having fun. One source of fun on the computer is online movies and tv shows. Thanks to them, you can always stay caught up with the latest episodes of your favorite show. Online gaming also brings joy to people all over the world. You can spend hours playing live with others in detailed @NUM2 - D world! Computers also enable you to kick back and laugh at historical videos on YouTube. Lastly, computers make browsing all the latest news a breeze. You will always know what's going on in the world, thanks to your computers. So whether you enjoy chilling and watching videos, playing games, or reading up on the news, you will always find a way to have fun online! What's not to like? With such a positive affect on the world, computers are definitely amazing technology. You can communicate with friends or family online in an instant, work on your school assignment, learn something new, or simply have a great time! We see how you, computers make life better and much easier.
1401	1405	1	3	"Dear Local Newspaper, I have heard that some people do not agree that computers benefit our society. Well, in this letter, I am going to give you three reasons how computers do benefit our society. Those reasons are: People have friends and family in other states; some people use them to stay organized; and computers help you learn more. I hope that by the end of this letter, you will see that computers do benefit our society.  First of all, I think that computers benefit our society because the internet lets people stay in contact with family and friends in other states. It's true that you could use the phone and call them, but you have to pay for long - distance. You don't have to pay anything to email somebody. I know from experience because I have friends and family in a lot of states in the United States. ""Computers help me stay in contact with my family all over,"" says John (Tech Enthusiast). Many people use the computer to contact their loved ones every day. Some people even use them to stay in touch with family members at war.  Next, I believe that computers benefit society because they keep people organized. I know this may not seem like a big deal, but a lot of people use computers to keep things organized so they know how everything is. What would happen if we didn't have computers to manage all of the appointments? Well, I will tell you what would happen. All the appointments would get messed up, and you might end up getting things you already got. ""I rely on my computers,"" says Sarah.  And, I strongly believe that computers benefit our society because they help people learn more. Yes, it's right that not everybody goes on the computers to learn, but that doesn't mean they don't learn. Here are a couple of examples: YouTube - it lets you learn song lyrics, dance moves and more; Twitter - it lets you learn what other people like, don't like and so on. Then there is Facebook, which lets you see what people are doing that day. ""People learn everything from the computer,"" says Mark.  Now, if you still think that computers don't benefit our society, that is your opinion. I hope you see what I see now and recognize the many ways computers are a boon to our society."
1402	1406	1	3	Dear local Newspaper, In my opinion, computers have a good effect on people because people can communicate with each other, learn on the computer, and mostly, people can shop online. Overall, I think computers have a positive effect on people.  Wow! Finally got to chat with my cousin from California. Communicating on the computer is great because you save money since you don't have to pay a phone bill. Also, most companies use email to chat between co - workers. Dr. Smith, a scientist, says co - workers who communicate via computer are actually safer because they don't have to travel anywhere and they can stay home. Today, there are so many social networking sites that people can improve their mental health and boost their self - esteem by talking to people on a daily basis. Lastly, all this communicating is great because you don't have to travel to communicate with someone, and the world is more eco - friendly as a result.  Wow! There are over a thousand information sites on the computer. On the computer, you can also use programs to make graphs and tables to show data. Mrs. Can says if you present information on the computer like using graphs, you will increase how much you know by 30%. Another great thing is that in order to learn, you don't have to read books, which saves paper. And most of the databases with information are free, so you save money and also it takes only seconds to find the information you want. On average, it takes 5 seconds to find information. Finally, the computer is a great place to find information and enlighten yourself.  Shopping on the computer, that must be impossible. Not with today's computers. Shopping on the computer is great because you save time not having to travel to the store. Consumer Reports says you can save 20% of the cost of the product if you buy online because over 500 stores have online sales. With the technology we have today, you can compare prices of an item by just clicking a button, then you don't have to spend extra time going to both stores. Online product reviews have become very popular because you can hear other people's opinions about the product. In the end, online shopping is great because you can save money, compare prices, and get many great things.  In conclusion, computers have helped a lot of people because you can shop online, communicate, and learn. Overall, computers have really changed lives for most citizens, making daily tasks more convenient and accessible.
1403	1407	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, Computers are a great invention! They allow you to do so many different things. They have a lot of positive effects on people. Computers deal with all sorts of things, from hand - eye coordination, learning about faraway places and people, to talking online with anyone. Come on in to the wonderful world of computers.  Computers have a super positive effect on people. They help teach hand - eye coordination. You can look at the screen without having to look down at your hand to move the mouse. You can see where it's going just by looking at the screen. Doing this helps everyday skills like playing sports. If you can use your eyes and your hands at the same time, you can hit a baseball or even play tennis. Computers teach hand - eye coordination by enabling you to do two things at once.  Would it be amazing if you could just find a recipe and go to the kitchen? Well, you can. A computer helps people discover different things. It's also easy to learn about different cultures, people, and places. Let's say you're interested in Japan and you want to know more. A computer gives you any information you need to learn something.  Computers are used almost every day. They give you various platforms. For instance, instant messaging is a great way to talk to people. You can chat with people by typing. Further, there are sites like MySpace, Instagram, or TikTok where you have your own page to post your own opinions. You also have access to your friends' pages to see how they are doing. These sites give people a chance to reconnect with old friends.  Webcam is becoming a huge sensation! Sites like FaceTime or Skype let you see and talk to the other person. They allow you to talk to people that you miss and feel that they are there with you.  Computers benefit people all over the world. But that doesn't mean they are taking over. Computers help people physically by enabling them to learn new things, and with the ability to communicate, computers aren't taking over; they are only helping them lead more connected and informed lives.
1404	1408	1	3	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 is a place full of a lot of technology, including the biggest hit, the computer. I say that computers have a more positive effect on people. Some reasons include that computers teach hand - eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about far - away places, and even give you the ability to talk online with other people. Where would we be without computers?  First of all, computers teach hand - eye coordination. People that type slower usually have poorer hand - eye coordination. Of course, with faster typers, they have better hand - eye coordination. 80% of people, including teachers, agree with this. Is this why @CAPS1 is offering typing ""lessons"" in computer classes in elementary school? The answer is most likely going to be a yes.  Second of all, computers give people the ability to learn about far - away places. Computers give you more resources than a book. Using the computer to go on multiple websites is actually easier. Using these websites, people can have a higher education. One teacher said, ""using websites is so much easier for everyone. Using them for homework and having the students take notes is a lot less difficult."" And to that, I agree entirely.  Finally, computers give people the ability to talk to other people online. Using things like WhatsApp, Messenger, email, and video chat. All of these, and more, give you the opportunity to chat with friends living far away. That way, friendships are never really lost. People never want to lose relationships. Losing one can be very sad. I know this from personal experience.  In conclusion, this is why I think that computers are a positive effect on people. From learning to chatting, computers are a great way to chat with friends and even do homework. Hand - eye coordination is also improved. All of these are positive effects, don't you think? I think so, and this is why I believe that computers have a more positive effect than a negative effect on people, enhancing our lives in numerous ways."
1405	1409	1	3	I believe that computers make everyday work easier to do. Computers allow someone from a far - away place to talk to another person who they can't see in person. They allow you to get work done in a quicker manner and get a college education without leaving your home.  Imagine that you have a relative who lives a great deal of miles away from you and it's too expensive to call or fly over there. Computers enable us to communicate with them through email or video chat without the hefty price. Because of computers, talking to your far - away family is just a few clicks away.  Getting work done can sometimes feel like another chore. Computers only make doing your work easier and faster. Would you rather sit and write out a term paper for hours or type it up and email it to your professor in half the amount of time? College students find that computers get their work done more efficiently than writing by hand. Computers are a great way to reduce the burdens of work.  Education is an important need for all, but what if the college that you want to attend is too far from home and you can't afford to move in? Thankfully, online college courses are available. If it wasn't for this source of technology, you would be left in a difficult situation. Online courses allow an eager student to learn without breaking their bank or leaving their child if they are parents. Without computers, everyone would not be able to get the education that they have a right to.  Computers have allowed us to communicate with our family that live somewhere we can't afford to travel to. These technological devices have enabled us to get our work done in a timely manner to receive the grade that we deserve. Computers have allowed over 100,000 citizens to get their education right in their home at a price they can afford. Without this gadget, we would not be able to live the life we have today, a life that can get us to where we need to be, making our daily tasks, social connections, and educational pursuits more accessible and convenient.
1406	1410	1	3	Dear @PERSON1, The use of computers is not beneficial to our society. I fear that many kids will suffer from childhood obesity, and this is because so many teenagers of my age lead inactive lifestyles. They could be enjoying life outdoors, running around in parks, playing sports, and staying active, but instead, they choose to sit in front of a screen all day, every day. Researchers have proven that inactivity is prevalent among many Facebook, MySpace, and Twitter users. These websites are nothing but trouble. Other than being unhealthy, teenagers all over are being cyberbullied to the verge of suicide. Many are not aware of the numerous pedophiles and creeps these sites carry, which can lead to abduction, rape, or worse. By staying active and being outdoors with your friends, you can save yourself from these dangers. Go outside and run a little; you would be amazed at how much a little exercise can help you. Also, I firmly believe time should be spent with your family, doing family activities like going on hikes or having board game nights and eating dinner with your parents. By doing this, you become closer as a family, and it could help you make healthier choices and keep exercising. I believe by following these simple steps, staying active, staying off the computer, and spending time with the family, is much more beneficial than learning how to type or talking to your friends. Using the computer leads to cyberbullying and dangerous people, and living a healthy life is the way to be.
1407	1411	1	3	"Dear Newspaper, What do you feel about computers? I know that I think they are great, and we are lucky to have them. They have to be used in moderation though, because exercise and staying healthy are essential for a well - rounded life. I hope you will share my opinions in your next article to help persuade readers of my view of computers. What I believe is the best thing about computers is that it is a great source to learn. The internet can connect us all over the world, and you can learn about other cultures in great detail. You can know everything about that country without ever visiting! Or you can use it to find out about your family's history. Many record - keeping systems are switching to computers now. When we took a field trip to @LOCATION1, they had databases there that had every name of the people that went through there. Studies show that @NUM1 people find the internet easy to use and quicker than any other method. Another thing about computers is they help you in the workplace. Let's say you had a job designing houses to be built. In old times, you would have to draw it out by hand using numerous instruments and tools, but now you could make the design using just one tool, the computer. It is a much more efficient way to do your job, and it assists the customers because before, if they wanted the house to be different, you would have to draw it all over again. Now you just have to make an adjustment on the computer, and in seconds, it's done with the new design. These days, if not @PERCENT2, then @PERCENT1 of house designers use computers. Computers also play a social role. On the internet, you can connect and chat with friends. Also, you could share pictures of both of you at a baseball game @DATE1 to keep memories. Or you can send them a website with a really funny video of someone getting hit with a soccer ball. Experts did a study, and it showed that @NUM2 times the reason a teen goes on the internet is to connect with friends. ""@CAPS2 @PERSON1 (computer expert and developer), what do you think the number one reason teens use computers is?"" @CAPS3, ""I would have to say to chat with friends. I don't see why they wouldn't; it's simple and almost instantaneous."" Computers are a great advancement in our technology. They assist us in everyday life and make difficult tasks simple. They should not be overused, though, and you need to keep a healthy mind and body. All of the things we could learn from them, however, help in the argument that they are valuable. To me, the computer is the same step forward as the light bulb was. Computer use is found @PERCENT3 in @LOCATION2, and I believe they will be in all of our homes. Some families find them extremely useful and have more than one in the household. They can come in all shapes and sizes to fit your wants and needs and can connect you to anything in the world."
1408	1412	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 Readers, Some of you might think people over - use computers. They don't act outside enough or interact with family or pets. You also might think that they are not getting enough exercise. Well, you are right, but I am going to explain why you're wrong. You can do things like learn, socialize, and actually become healthy. The first thing you could do is learn. While you are on the internet, you can go to learning websites. Some of those websites can teach you about faraway places like @LOCATION1, with its unique architecture and vibrant festivals, @ORGANIZATION1, and @LOCATION2 and many more. You can also learn about people and their cultures. Take @CAPS3 @CAPS4 for example; you could learn their culture and the festivals they celebrate and why. Another thing you could do is take online classes if you are having trouble in school. Another thing you can do on the computer is socialize. You might think or say that when you are on the computer, you can't socialize with family and friends. Well, you can. There are websites like @CAPS6 and Facebook where all you do is talk to family and friends. Now you can webcam people. When you webcam, you can see the person whom you are talking to, you can hear them, and they can hear you through a microphone on the webcam. Lastly, you could go into chatrooms like @CAPS7 (AOL Instant Message) and talk to people while you are on that site. The last thing you can do is become more healthy. Is it not surprising? Yes, you can go onto websites that teach you day by day how to eat right and exercise. Websites like @PERSON1 esang.com can give you a nightly eating schedule right for your body type. After that website, you could go out and get the food you will need. Another thing that the computer offers is hand - eye coordination. While you are looking at the screen, your hand is controlling the ""mouse,"" while the mouse controls where you go on the worldwide web. Lastly, you will eventually want to go outside after visiting websites that show you beautiful moments and gardens of this world. So now, hopefully, you agree with me that computers do actually benefit some things in life. I have showed you what you can learn about, how to talk to people and socialize, and lastly, how it can help you with your health."
1409	1413	1	3	Computers have definitely had an impact on society that changed the world. People and life are now smarter, quicker, faster, and easier. People who live on opposite sides of the world can communicate in an instant, for free. But what effect does this have on people? Something this big and having such a long history can't be good for some people. I don't think it is for some people. To start with the basics, some people get too obsessed with computers. If they have life problems, then they might seek the solitude and privacy of the unfiltered and limitless internet. Even if you use a computer to chat with people, it still is no replacement for the real thing. In fact, studies show that non - personal ways of communicating such as text messaging, email, or chat rooms can severely restrict a person's way of connecting with other people. Don't get me wrong here. I do use sites such as Facebook to talk to people. So, I'm not going to state that online talk is bad. I think it's a very good way of keeping in touch with people you can't talk to in real life. And, it's a good way to help friends and be there for them. It's done in moderation, though. Getting information from the computer is very debatable. Some could say that the people being informed is a good thing, which I agree with. Some others could say that knowing too much will make our egos so big that we will be ignorant. I also agree with that. I would also say knowing some things are good, but be careful of knowing too much. One area where I find computers to be great is in originality. In a world where we are often raised to kill creativity, I find computers to be part - artistic. In a way, it's personally helped me to discover what kind of music, drawings, creations, etc. that I like. I can also share what I've made so everyone can see it, listen to it, or try it for themselves. In conclusion, I think computers are a great tool for use in moderation. For some people who are obsessed, it can be problematic. However, I think they are a great addition to society as long as we use them responsibly.
1410	1414	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. I support advantages in technology and believe that computers have a positive effect on people. Computers give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people. You can use Google.com and look up different cultures and find out how the things they do are different from us and what kind of unique cuisines they eat. For example, in @LOCATION1, they sit on the floor when they eat, while we get to sit at a table in our dining rooms or kitchens. @PERCENT1 of people in @LOCATION1 have this dining habit. Surely, computers allow you to connect with my cousin on the computer. It is also important to note that on computers, you can play games that can help you with your school - work. You can go on sites that are educational. They can show you how your body works, for example, with detailed 3D models, and tell you about the Revolutionary War for history lessons. These sites are not boring; it's a whole lot of fun! Whoever thought that learning would be fun? I sure didn't. The time is now! Just because some people think that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends, it doesn't mean it has to be that way. No matter what, people will always have time for those important things if they manage their time well.
1411	1415	1	3	Dear computer experts, @CAPS1 this: A family of four is sitting in a small, dimly - lit dark room. There's an eerie silence; they're not talking, not laughing. They're just sitting lazily in their old, worn - out chairs, hunched over, looking utterly bored. They aren’t communicating with any of their friends, and aren’t really doing anything at all. They sit there like lumps of clay. This would happen @CAPS5 we banned computers! Computers definitely have a positive effect on people because they feed you a constant stream of knowledge. They keep your mind sharp and informed. They also develop good hand - eye coordination, which is essential for many tasks in life. And they enable the people who use them to communicate with others across the globe. Clearly, they are a positive addition to our world. To begin, computers bring you a constant stream of knowledge. My close friend @PERSON1 told me recently that she is sometimes sitting at home, trying to complete her challenging homework, and she needs to look up something. She simply grabs her sleek computer, and the information is delivered to her with the click of a button. @CAPS5 she didn’t have a computer, she'd never obtain such knowledge. Second, in a survey of @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @ORGANIZATION1, @PERCENT1 of total computer usage is looking up information and gaining knowledge. This statistic shows that computers definitely help them when looking for information. Also, a recent @ORGANIZATION3 article on computer usage states that @CAPS5 people didn't have computers, half of the world’s discoveries would not be around today. You can tell that the amount of knowledge that computers give us is very important! Next, using computers builds hand - eye coordination as well. Children’s specialist @PERSON3 says, “@CAPS4 need to be able to play video games, even though they are usually discouraged on the computer. They build fantastic hand - eye coordination and help with many things including @ORGANIZATION1 & sports.” @CAPS5 there were no computers, this hand - eye coordination could never be developed! Also, at @ORGANIZATION2 in @LOCATION1, they limited computer use, and as a result of it, the sports teams there all got losing records. Could this be because of the lack of hand - eye coordination of those students? Additionally, at @ORGANIZATION1, after a recent survey, it was discovered that @NUM1 students who play video games on their computers do better in gym class because of the added hand - eye coordination. Clearly, computers greatly build hand - eye coordination. Lastly, using a computer allows people to communicate with each other through email & other social networks. After a poll from www.@CAPS6.com, we have discovered that millions of users use the computer & @CAPS6 to communicate every day. We wouldn’t want to deny them of this, would we? Secondly, a friend of mine, @PERSON2, who goes to @ORGANIZATION4, says that the main way that she communicates with her friends & makes plans with them is by computer. @CAPS5 she didn’t have one, none of this could be done. Furthermore, a recent article by @PERSON4, a teen specialist at @ORGANIZATION5, says that when people don’t have computers & can’t communicate or talk to the outside world, they are more prone to diseases & sickness like depression or anorexia. When they don’t talk as much with their friends, these sicknesses are more prone to occur. This definitely shows that communicating with computers is very important. Now, @CAPS1 this. The same family as before is sitting in a bright, sunny room, their computer screens flashing merrily. One of the boys calls out, “hey, look at this!” and the rest of his family rushes to his side. Their faces aglow with this @ORGANIZATION3 information. You can see that computers have a positive effect on people because they bring @ORGANIZATION3 information, they build hand - eye coordination, and they allow you to communicate with others. So, computer specialists, what are you waiting for? Go to your computers right now & learn some @ORGANIZATION3 things!
1412	1416	1	3	The advancements of technology have developed so much that it has become commonly known to us as a normal household item. We use it every day at work, home, schools, and businesses. It has become a commonly used item in everyday life. Whether it's sending emails, researching complex topics, or answering questions about the world around us, technology is indispensable. It is required at almost every job application, in school, and in everything in between. It's the - @DATE1 - complete age of technology. Computers are an everyday thing. For example, email is something that we don't have to worry about in terms of long - distance communication. Also, they are used to file a tax return accurately and efficiently. Moreover, it is used to make detailed reports for people. Computers have also become a commonly used thing in school. We use them for writing reports, conducting in - depth studies, and even completing some homework. Also, businesses use it to communicate with corporate offices. @LOCATION1 uses a wide range of technology; they recently got a whole bunch of Apple devices. Last but not least, computers are required at most jobs. I'm going to list a few: state institutions rely on them for data management, schools use them for teaching and administrative tasks, the military defence uses them for missile systems and satellite communication. In case of an emergency like a terrorist attack similar to the twin towers incident, they are crucial for tracking and shutting down all communications including cell phones and on planes. They are also used for tracking trucks and their routes. And the rest of the information I know about computers is classified. And this is why computers are needed in this society to be used every day. They are commonly used and are required for the smooth functioning of our modern world.
1413	1417	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1, Technology has made great improvements in the past years. Computers have now found a home in almost every business and home in @LOCATION1! Everyone thinks computers are so wonderful and can only positively affect you. But do they really consider both sides? Most likely not. That is why I am here. Computers discourage exercise, cut down the number of @ORGANIZATION1 hours spent bonding with your family, and are a waste of @ORGANIZATION1 money and space. I believe computers should be re - examined, and people should stop depending on them so much. Which country has more than @NUM1 million fast - food restaurants currently functioning? Name the fattest country in the world. Who spends the most on unhealthy food? The answer to all of @ORGANIZATION1 those questions is the @LOCATION2. With over @PERCENT1 of @ORGANIZATION1 the population being obese, something needs to be changed. According to studies done by the @ORGANIZATION1 (@CAPS2), @PERCENT2 of @ORGANIZATION1 people spend over @NUM2 hours a day on the computer. Of @ORGANIZATION1 those @PERCENT2, @PERCENT3 are overweight or obese. There is an obvious pattern. Exercising makes your muscles stronger, improves lung function, and helps burn off unnecessary calories. People most definitely need to get off the computer and exercise more. They might even like it. Spending time with your family can be great fun, as I recently discovered. Playing outdoors in team games brings out your competitive side, while board games challenge your mind. ""@CAPS3 who spend time with their family are @PERCENT4 more likely to do better in school,"" @CAPS4 @PERSON2 points out. So what's stopping them? Computers. Kids now find many interesting internet sites online more appealing than hanging out with family and friends. We need to turn off @ORGANIZATION1 the computers, bring out the board games, and keep @CAPS5 families together! ""In this economy, people cannot afford to waste money they don't have,"" says @CAPS4 economist @PERSON1. And she is absolutely right! But what are @PERCENT5 of @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS6 wasting money on? You guessed it; computers. The average bill per month is @MONEY2. In a whole year, you're paying @MONEY1 for something you don't really need! Computers also waste space. Along with needing a place to house your large monitor, you have to find room to cram a printer, the hard - drive, AND all those messy wires. Who can find enough room? I certainly can't. Although technology, namely computers, can be a wonderful thing, we need to look at the downside. @CAPS6 continue to gain weight, families fall apart, and the economy collapses, all because of @ORGANIZATION1 computers. We need to stop these problems and turn off the computers to restore a healthier and more balanced lifestyle."
1414	1418	1	3	Dear Newspaper, I am writing to you @DATE1 because I think computers really affect people in a bad way. I say this because @CAPS1 you go on the internet, you do not get that much exercise. You also don't get good grades at all! That's a bad thing. Plus, when you're on a computer, there are some really weird people. I really want you guys to hear out my story. Go outside! @CAPS3 mom, I'm on the computer! @CAPS1 you're on the computer too much, you won't get the exercise you need. @CAPS1 you don't get exercise, you won't be healthy! You'll want to get exercise. Also, you will become obese, and you don't want that! For instance, when you're in gym class, you want to be healthy so you can and will get a good grade. Do you want bad grades? That sums it up. You got an @CAPS2! On your report card? When you spend a lot of your time on a computer, then you will get addicted. @CAPS1 you get addicted, then you will not do your homework, and then your grades will drop. You will get bad grades in school. Then you have a possibility to stay back. Plus, then the parents will flip out. This is one of my reasons why computers affect people in a bad way! When you go on the computer, you have @CAPS3 clue who you are talking to unless they're your friends. There has been very many cases where kids have been stolen because of Facebook and MySpace. @CAPS1 your kid goes on those websites, then your kids are always in danger! There are cyber - predators, and they could find out where you live and other information about you. For instance, there was a case on MySpace where a kid thought she was talking to a @NUM1 - year - old boy, but she was really talking to a @NUM2 - something - year - old guy. Then the girl went missing for about weeks. That was really scary. So you can never trust a computer. When you take a real good look at computers, you will see they are just @CAPS3 good. All my reasons before show that you will not get nearly the amount of exercise you are supposed to. Your grades will plummet down @CAPS1 you stay on the computer, and they can trick you. So even though you can communicate with your friends, it's just not worth it. In conclusion, the negative impacts of computers on health and academic performance far outweigh the limited benefits of online communication.
1415	1419	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I have reason to believe that computers and other similar modern technologies are breaking up the world we once knew. Things such as computers are a main cause of @CAPS3 lacking exercise, interaction with family and friends, and are also a possible danger to one's mental health. The leading cause of obesity and an outrageous amount of overweight people in @LOCATION1 is the fact that people spend way too much time on computers and not exercising. I have recently found out that in the @DATE1's, the average family had one computer (sometimes none). Nowadays, the average family has up to @NUM1, @NUM2, or even more! Furthermore, the percentage of obese people has sky - rocketed since then because people are almost always on the computer rather than exercising like they should be. A major reason that modern technology has hurt our nation is that there is an immense lack of communication and interaction between families. Families are fighting/arguing more often, and spouses are getting divorced because they never get to spend quality time together. Studies have shown that nowadays @NUM3 of @NUM1 marriages ends in a divorce, whereas in @DATE2, it was @NUM3 of @NUM6. Advances in technology have astoundingly increased since then, and people are on the computer/phones/other @CAPS4 devices, which is separating families everywhere. When impressionable children are trying to grow and expand their minds, all they are doing is sitting on the computer and not getting the mental stimulation they need. The students in schools today are the future leaders of the world. Now, the parents should be thinking that if they want their children to do well or exceed their expectations in life, then they should not be sitting on the computer all day filling their heads with nonsense. Now, computers do have the ability to be educationally useful, but do children use them that way? The answer is no, and, ""@PERCENT1 of the time, neither do adults"", states @PERSON1 from the @ORGANIZATION1. I hope you can agree on the fact that computers are causing more bad than good in families all around the world. People are not getting the amount of exercise they need, aren't interacting with family enough, and these computers can become harmful to the mental health of future generations. If families can minimize the amounts of computer - drawn activities, then I think parents all over the world can take better care of their children's health and well - being, restoring a more balanced and healthy family environment."
1416	1420	1	3	Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, it has recently come to my attention that there is a massive increase in people using computers in society. The widespread use of computers can have its positive effect on people, but too much of it isn't a good thing. This is why I want to tell everyone about the negative effects of the computer on people. We all know using computers helps people with all different kinds of things. They can assist with business operations, facilitate interacting with family and friends far away, and you could even just use it for entertainment like watching movies or playing games. Some negative effects that some people don't know, or maybe just ignore, are things like they can keep you from exercising regularly, exploring the beauty of nature, and you could spend so much time on your computer, that you could easily get addicted. There should be some way of telling the people that this is happening and is a concern. So I think that we should try to combine what people like to do on computers, with what they should be doing more often, like exercising. Maybe we could tell people that they can use their computers to contact people like friends and family to go out and make plans to exercise and have fun outside so they're not stuck on the computer all day. We all know that computers can be a good and bad thing. They teach hand - eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about diverse places and unique people in the world, and so much more. They also have bad effects, but that doesn't mean we should take them away from people. And you shouldn't be outside all the time, for the whole day. So I think there should be a limit on how many hours people spend on the computers per day. This way, people get what they want, and they have some time off of it, too. Obviously as a result there should be something done about this computer concern. I hope I have persuaded you with my well - thought out thoughts and ideas. And hopefully they will lead you to an idea that will end in a helpful change in society, making our lives more balanced and healthy.
1417	1421	1	3	How does the computer affect people? Undoubtedly, there are ways that computers can be really bad and really good. They're good because people who don't like writing usually just have a computer to type on. However, people rarely use it just for that. Parents and kids stay on the computer, not caring about anything else but the screen. The kids stay up all night knowing they have school the next day, and they don't even do their homework. I have solid proof; my friends' experiences, research findings, and my mother also agrees. I suggest that you will agree with my opinion. A significant @PERCENT1 of my friends agree with me because they have been through this tough situation, and they wouldn't wake up to go to school due to late - night computer use. Dr @PERSON1 of @ORGANIZATION1 researched how parents hardly spend time with their family. For example, fathers are basically always on the computer, either working on important projects or looking up random stuff. My mom says that when she was younger, she loved the internet so much that she never wanted to get off. I hope you've enjoyed my opinion. Thanks for even taking this time to read it. Thanks again, and I hope we can all be more aware of the proper use of computers.
1418	1422	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, what is your opinion on computers? Are they good or bad? Computers have not been around that long, but it is controversial whether it has a positive or negative effect. True, they do help people research certain topics efficiently, but they are also hazardous. I believe computers are not a necessity to people. Computers are unneeded because people spend way too much time on them. Then we begin to lack exercise, and they become hazardous to everyone. First, computers are not a necessity because people spend way too much time on them. Once you are on a computer for over an hour to an hour - and - a - half, the computer will start to affect you in negative ways. For one, your eyes will begin to hurt severely. If you stay on longer than that, you will start to get a headache. Soon your headache will turn so bad you can't bear it. It will pound and feel as if it's on fire. This happens because your brain cannot take in the brightness of the computer screen and the information you're reading or seeing at the same time. Most of the time, this happens and eventually you will lock yourself in a darkroom to rest. Sometimes you don't get off till you have a stomach - ache too. After you get off and feel better, you go back on to repeat the process. This is why computers are an obstruction to us. Next, people begin to lose exercise. After being on the computer for so long, all they have time to do is eat, sleep, and go to work or school. Computers have deprived everyone of the outside world. They don't want to go out and get exercise and play around. Living in those conditions can only lead to one thing, obesity. Soon you will become fat. Life will become tough. And being fat also has a negative effect. For one, you cannot run very long, you become weak, and for kids, you stop growing properly. But the worst is you will not live as long as you would if you were healthy. So you see computers are a nuisance to our society. Finally, computers are hazardous to the environment. There are @NUM1 billion people in the world. At any time, about @NUM2 billion are on some sort of electronic device. When you are on a computer, have you ever noticed the hot air blowing out of the fan? Now, have you ever thought where this heat goes? Well, it makes holes in the ozone layer and causes global warming. The ozone layer is the only thing keeping the sun's ultra - violet rays from scorching us. Now if every time someone turns on a computer, @NUM3 of the ozone layer disappears and @NUM2 billion people are on, that would be @NUM2 billion mm gone from our atmosphere. Now think about global warming. If the ozone layer is like a bubble, the heat is trapped inside. So this heat will eventually heat up the earth. This will cause the @CAPS3 to melt and then the sea will rise. The @CAPS3 has enough water in it to flood the earth. Do you really want that? Eventually, we would drown and life would cease to exist. As you can see, computers are a nuisance. They hypnotize the young children and adults. They can be helpful, but they are more hazardous. Sometimes we don't even realize this. Computers are bad because people spend too much time on them, people lose exercise, and they are hazardous to us. We must take action to reduce our computer usage and protect our health and the environment.
1419	1423	1	3	People often say that computers and technology are bad for you, but yet I think they have helped our society out very well. Computers help people through their troubles. Computers make our lives easier. For instance, when you buy things now, there are computers adding and subtracting your amounts accurately and quickly. They help people find out where to go precisely, and last but not least, they help friends and family stay in touch with each other conveniently. Without computers, we would have to wait in longer lines for what we want to buy. For example, at Stop & Shop, they have computers to check out people, and the lines are already long enough. If we had no computers, the lines would be even longer because then the people would have to add up the money by hand, which is time - consuming and prone to errors. Also, without computers, you would not be able to weigh your goods as fast as we do now in grocery stores; we would have to hand - weigh it, which is inefficient. Without computers, days at the grocery stores would be very long and tiring. Without computers, you would not have @CAPS1 and places online that give you detailed and real - time directions. You would have to use the big maps while driving to places. Those maps could get lost while you are driving. You can lose your spot, and sometimes you might mark out the wrong spots on your map. With computers, you can have @CAPS1, online directions that can tell you the fastest and easiest way to get to your place, saving you time and energy. Also, with computers, it saves papers on maps, and we do not waste as much trees, which is beneficial for the environment. Have you ever been in the situation where you want to go visit your family member out of state but you just don't have the money? Well, many people have, and now instead of wasting the money they don't have, they can video chat, talk, look at people's pictures, and keep updated with them on the computer. You do not need to spend tons of money on it; it is all free on social networking sites that people use to keep in touch with family and friends. Those sites you have to use on the computer, so without computers, you would have to travel in a car, waste money on fuel, and pollute the air with your car emissions. In conclusion, I think computers have helped out our society out very well, making our daily lives more convenient, efficient, and environmentally friendly.
1420	1424	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, I believe that computers benefit the people of today. The invention of the computer has helped people to send messages and information to each other, helped students with school, and allows children to have something to do when they can't go outside. Let me explain. The computer has created an easier way for people to send messages and information to one another. Before the invention of the computer, the only way to pass on information was by mail, which was slow, or phone, which had limitations. The computer sped up this process significantly. In fact, people have received information about @PERCENT1 faster with the invention of the computer. I was once able to send my friend an email about getting the homework faster than writing him a letter, which could take days to reach him. Clearly, computers made it easier for people to communicate with each other, no matter the distance. Also, computers help students with school. Before the computer, a student had to use a typewriter to type their papers. Using a typewriter, when they made mistakes, which was quite common, they had to start all over. It's a completely different story now. In fact, a study done by the board of ed. shows students write papers so much faster and better with a computer rather than a typewriter. I remember my grandfather told me about how he typed papers. It took him about an hour and a half to write a paper on a typewriter, while the longest it took him was a half an hour on a computer. He also said that the quality of the paper was much higher on the computer due to easy editing. As you can see, computers have helped students all across the country to improve their academic performance. Lastly, computers supply kids with things to do while they can't go outside to enjoy nature. Many people would assume that kids would go on their computer when they were able to go outside. A study done by the @CAPS2 - obesity shows that @PERCENT2 of kids would rather be outside playing and exercising than in their house on their computer. But sometimes, during certain weather conditions like heavy rain or extreme cold, kids aren't able to go outside, so they might entertain themselves indoors. A study done by @ORGANIZATION1 shows that merely @PERCENT3 of kids go on their computer when they can't be outside. If suddenly those kids lost their computer privileges, many of them will have little to entertain themselves with. Clearly, the computer occupies the time of kids who can't go outside in a positive way. In conclusion, the computer has enormous benefits on society. It allows people to send messages and information faster, helps students with school, and gives kids something to do when they can't be outside. I hope that this letter has convinced you of the numerous benefits of computers, and we should continue to embrace and make good use of this wonderful invention.
1421	1425	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 post, Computers have been an integral part of our lives for quite some time now. Taking them away would be like erasing all the remarkable progress we've made in technology. In fact, computers are ubiquitous. On my street, seven out of ten families own at least one computer in their household. So, why on earth would we want to take them away? Computers are incredibly useful. They are not only a source of fun but also highly resourceful. Whenever someone has a question, they can easily hop on a computer, research it on google.com, and find the answer they were looking for within just a few minutes. I recall when I had a strange - looking cut on my arm, my mom, who wasn't sure how to heal the wound, used the computer. She researched it and found out how to make the mark go away. The computer only brings benefits. Imagine you're planning a trip and in two weeks, you arrive at the place you'll be staying and realize they don't have a pool! You could have easily checked that online. Lastly, without computers, we would have no means of communicating with new or different people. Computers are excellent for communication. People can communicate through twitter, @CAPS2, and even youtube. These sites all help people make new friends online, almost like having pen - pals on the internet. Also, if the majority of your family lived in @LOCATION1 and you were stuck in @CAPS3, you could effortlessly talk to them through email or an instant messenger. Hopefully, now you have a much better understanding of how much of a lifesaver the computer is. Maybe you could even make next @STATE1 about how resourceful, beneficial, and social computers are!
1422	1426	1	3	To whom it may @MONTH1 concern, The @NUM1's were truly the beginning of a new age. Computers had just emerged and were mesmerizing people with their intelligence. However, now more and more people think it's a waste of time. I, for one, do not think this. Within these lines, you will see my opinion take shape for the following reasons. It's an information high that allows artists to expand their craft. Engineers are now able to plan buildings and bridges on their @CAPS1. Thanks to the internet, students and people are gaining knowledge each day. The internet is essential for people writing an essay. In fact, the superintendent of schools in @LOCATION1 has stated that over @PERCENT1 of students will use the internet to assist them in writing an essay. We no longer have to go to the library anywhere to do research because we have a whole library of information right at our home (the computer). Another significant aspect is that people are now able to communicate all over the world, which enables us to learn about other cultures straight from the source. Artists are now able to do things that were previously unimaginable. Now, a new art form of video games has emerged. Artists, do you like to express yourself? Music mixing has become a popular activity. You can sometimes add additional tracks and layer other tracks. They don't have to use a typing machine anymore. They can just jump on the computer and type on a keyboard. You can use spell - check and edit or undo instead of having to throw away an idea that you didn't like. Artists have been greatly influenced by computers. And lastly, engineers are able to plan out how a building or bridge might look, which also ties in with video game making. @CAPS2 can design the house of their dreams. When you plan buildings and bridges on a computer, you can analyze which makes them stronger, before you even start building them. With the new software available today, you can determine how certain structures will fare under natural disasters so they can pick the design that has the ability to withstand them. I hope you can see things from my perspective and agree that computers are truly an amazing invention that provides access to information and also offers great assistance.
1423	1427	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2, did you know that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 students in @NUM3 grade go on the computer each night to complete homework and to connect with friends and family? I firmly believe that the effects computers have on people are beneficial for everyone who uses one. A computer can be utilized for communication, education, and for accessing important information quickly, such as the local news. Now, let me explain why computers are excellent for communication. When I was in elementary school, I had a very close friend. I was an important part of his life and vice - versa. Unfortunately, he had to move away. But I still wanted to maintain our friendship and communicate with him from time to time. A convenient way to do this was by using a computer. The computer allows you to easily reach out to an old friend so that you can continuously stay in touch. Different types of communication on the computer include e - mail, instant - messaging, video chat, online chat groups... etc. This helps people stay connected. That's why I think communication is the most significant effect on people due to the use of a computer. However, a computer can also be used for learning. At school or work, both kids and adults need access to the right information about research projects, vacation spots, learning about animals, food, cultures, and sometimes things as complex as scientific chemicals. For example, when my class researched different aspects of the @CAPS3 @CAPS4, our primary source of information was the internet on our computers. We delved into the customs, the foods, the way of dressing, the traditional holidays, and their way of entertainment. Also, kids come home from school and upload their essay and continue to type it. This is teaching them hand - eye coordination and how to type efficiently. The computer is not solely used for just communication. It's a great way to educate everyone. Moreover, the internet can be used to pass along important local and global information. ""@CAPS6 and adults often check their e - mail and homepage every day for the latest news on other countries, our country, the government, and the economy,"" says expert @PERSON1. I think that the internet gives citizens a fast and easy way to access information about what's going on in our town, state, country, and world. For example, it can inform us about the series of shootings going on throughout @LOCATION1 or the many house robberies in our town. We, @CAPS7 citizens, want to know everything... to stay safe and be notified of the latest events. Another example is that I logged on the computer three days ago and it notified me about the earthquake in @LOCATION2. But there are so many benefits of a computer. The effects computers have on people are clearly beneficial. It allows people to stay in touch, learn about places and people, and to stay up - to - date with the latest local and global news. I sincerely hope you take my ideas into consideration and publish them for everyone."
1424	1428	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I firmly believe that computers do benefit society because computers can perform a multitude of tasks, like teaching you new skills. Computers are extremely helpful these days. In fact, almost everything gets done on them. The computer teaches good eye - hand coordination, how to focus intently, and shows you things you were previously unaware of. Without a computer, it's really difficult to get anything done or prepared. A computer can be useful for many things such as filling out job applications or doing taxes. At a grocery store register, the use of computers streamlines the process. Typing and using the computer is a form of exercise, not for your body but for your hands and your brain. When you're on a computer, you're exercising your hand's dexterity and your mental faculties. Without computers, we'd be at a significant disadvantage as mostly everything we do in life has some connection with a computer. I think that the people who say they shouldn't be on the computer are wrong. With a computer, you can interact with your family members who are far away. You can also enjoy nature by just taking a virtual look; you don't have to physically walk out. That's why I firmly believe that computers are positive and helpful, and they play an indispensable role in our lives.
1425	1429	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, I wholeheartedly believe that computers have a positive effect on people. Three key reasons why I think computers have a positive effect on people are that you have the ability to talk to your friends and family, also talk to other people around the world, and you can even shop online. It's truly sad to have no contact with your loved ones. If you want to talk to them, you can simply email them to see how they are doing. With emailing, you can send messages to your friends in any part of the world. One example of this is if you have a friend in @LOCATION1 and you want to see if he's doing @CAPS2, you can quickly send him a message. Talking to people on the web is really enjoyable because you can see what others are up to or play games with them. If you are on facebook or myspace, you can add people as your friends and expand your circle of friends. Shopping online is much faster and more convenient than shopping at a physical store. For instance, if you're shopping for clothes and there's a long line at the store, you'll start to get frustrated. That's why there is online shopping so that we can avoid such hassles. You can browse through a wide variety of products from the comfort of your home. In conclusion, the computer is a very useful thing. You can talk to your relatives from @LOCATION2 and you can do your shopping without having to wait in line. You can also talk to other people from all over the world, which enriches our social and shopping experiences.
1426	1430	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, Do you think computers have a positive or negative effect on people? In my opinion, I would say that computers have negative effects on us. This is because we would get less exercise, have less time to enjoy nature, and have less interaction with family and friends. If you're on the computer most of the time at home, how would you get your exercise? You wouldn't because the whole time you would be stuck sitting down at the desktop. This is also a problem because this is how obesity can occur from no exercise, and just sitting all day. Or people who have heart problems and need exercise can worsen by being distracted by the computer. Being home on the computer does not let you enjoy nature. Instead of going outside in the warm weather, having fun, people are staying home. This is not good because they should be out having fun, not on the computer all day. Missing time with family and friends is unacceptable when you're on the computer. This is because you're supposed to keep your family and friends company and not daze off on what you're doing on the computer. Also, you miss family gatherings or leave your friends lonely. That's because you're too busy on the computer and not paying attention to anyone around you. This is why I think computers have a negative effect on people. In conclusion, due to less exercise, less time to enjoy nature, and less interaction with family and friends, it's clear that the negative impacts of computers on people are significant.
1427	1431	1	3	Dear Local newspaper, Technology is an ever - evolving thing, and more and more people are using it. As more people make use of computers, the more technology will benefit our society. Through the use of computers, people will be taught hand - eye coordination, be presented with the ability to become educated on distant places, and also be allowed to talk online with other people. Through the use of computers, people will be taught hand - eye coordination. An effective skill to learn would be hand - eye coordination, and the benefits of this would be outstanding. Having great coordination would mean that a person would exceed past anybody who does not use computers. Advanced coordination would mean that the person would be able to accomplish more things like fast typing. For instance, in a typing test, a person with good hand - eye coordination can type more accurately and quickly. Finally, better hand - eye coordination means that the person will be more likely to obtain a job in a field that needs good coordination, such as graphic design or video game development. In conclusion, computers offer multiple benefits, and the improvement of hand - eye coordination is just one of the many ways they positively impact people and contribute to the betterment of society.
1428	1432	1	3	The @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 Newspaper just found out that there is a big argument going on saying that computers are not benefiting society. The other side, those who support advances in technology, believe that computers have a positive effect on people. Well, the @ORGANIZATION1 had to choose a side, and the side that they have chosen is that computers have a positive affect on people. You know why we pick this side? There are three reasons why computers are good. Like number one, they teach people about far - away places and people. Also, computers are a good source of entertainment, and last but not least, computers are a good chat room. When @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 are finished telling you why these three reasons are good, the people's view of computers will win this war! First reason: Do you like wasting time walking through the library looking for information about places or @ORGANIZATION1 people? Well, if you have a computer, you do not have to deal with this. All you have to do is go to search and put the person or place name, and you will see that in less than a minute you have information that will take hours to find in a library. I know this because it happened to me when I was looking for a book that talks about the @CAPS2 calendars. I could not find it, so I had to go on a computer for the information. Second reason: Computers are a good source of entertainment. You know, if you get bored and you have a computer, you can easily just go on it and play so many fun games like @CAPS3 @CAPS4, dragonwars, or any fun game that you can find on a computer. There are so many games to choose from that you will never get bored. For example, you can play strategy games to improve your thinking skills or action games for an adrenaline rush. Third reason: The computer is a fun way of talking to friends or family. There are so many sites that you can choose to talk to friends or family like @CAPS5, @CAPS6 or even @ORGANIZATION2. Also, did you know you can send videos or even pictures of stuff to friends or family. So go on a computer and talk to your friend, and even send that person a picture or something. In conclusion, I hope you take what I said to heart and choose what the newspaper has as a decision, as the positive aspects of computers clearly outweigh any potential drawbacks.
1429	1433	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I think that the effects that computers have on people are that some people become very addictive to them. This is because some people spend a lot of time on the computer doing nothing but just spending their money buying things that they don't need. For example, they might impulse - buy trendy items that end up collecting dust. I also think that computers affect people in the way that they don't spend a lot of time with their family. The effects that computers have on people are that some people can't stop using them even if they want to. People become very addictive to computers because they spend almost all their time on them. People don't exercise anymore because they spend all their time on the computer, shopping for things that they don't need. They just buy them because they like them. The effects that computers have on people are that some people just want to be talking to their friends on MySpace, Facebook, and other websites that are not always good for them. For instance, there could be inappropriate content or time - wasting distractions. I think that the effects that computers have on people are that they take away people's time because some people spend a lot of time on the computers, leaving their families alone without spending time with them. Computers take away people's time because they don't spend time exercising or playing outside with friends or brothers or going to a park to spend some time with their family or having contact with family and inviting some friends to come over to have some good time instead of being in the computer all day without doing anything productive. Computer's take away time or love for your family and they make you spend the time that you don't have. The effects that computers have on people are bad because people can't stop using them even if they wanted to because they are already addictive to them. People can't stop using them because on the computers you could do lots of things like shopping, talking to friends, and visiting websites that have very interesting things from other countries that are very beautiful. But some people can't stop using them because they go to play games or because they are downloading music from websites that they don't have to. In conclusion, the negative effects of computer addiction are evident. It leads to less family time, a sedentary lifestyle, and a waste of resources, clearly showing that the impact of computers on some people is very bad.
1430	1434	1	3	Did you know that @PERCENT1 @LOCATION1 people use their computers extremely often? Not many people don't have a computer these days, and sometimes it's hard to get away from it. I think most people can control themselves. Though it may seem like I'm on the computer a lot, I believe that computers are very important and also have a positive effect on people. I use the computer to talk with friends and family, to help with my homework, and I am still active. I spend quite a bit @LOCATION1 time on the computer, yet I am still a very active person. I take dance lessons twice a week and when I can, I ride my bike, play outside, or run on the treadmill. For example, on weekends, I make sure to go for a bike ride in the park. I would say that I am a very healthy person. It may seem like I am on the computer a lot, but really I have a purpose. Also, all my friends are on the computer, and some @LOCATION1 them are more active than me. Most people spend lots @LOCATION1 time on the computer and are still healthy and busy with other activities. I would definitely say that I interact with my family quite a bit. In a family @LOCATION1 it is kind @LOCATION1 hard not to. Also, I hang out with my friends every chance I get. I interact a lot, but the computer lets me talk to them when they're not around. Most @LOCATION1 my extended family lives in @LOCATION1. The computer lets me communicate with them and even exchange digital pictures. Sometimes, my friends and I are too busy to get together or it's snowing and my parents can't drive. We still got to talk and have a nice conversation. Some people have to be on the computer all day. My mom keeps the books and manages many things for a company. She spends a lot @LOCATION1 time on the computer whether she likes it or not. This really cannot be helped. Sometimes it is just necessary. Also, teachers use it to help them teach classes and prepare materials for it. As a result, I use it for homework. I may need to check my homework, research a topic, or use it for help. In conclusion, as long as one gets equal amounts @LOCATION1 fresh air and family interaction, it's clear that computers are a helpful and irreplaceable piece @LOCATION1 technology that have a very positive impact on people's lives.
1431	1435	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, A recent comprehensive survey indicated that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 doctors firmly believe that the remarkable advances we have achieved with technology and computers are significantly helping us rather than causing harm. I whole - heartedly agree that computers are having an overwhelmingly positive impact on us. These technological advances are enabling us to become more efficient in our daily lives and professional work. Computers also grant us the unique ability to research various places and things that we @MONTH1 would never realistically get the opportunity to see in person. We are also fortunate enough to be able to engage in online conversations with other people who we might have never met under normal circumstances. The most crucial aspect, though, is our continuous progress in technology. Recently on the news, I saw an in - depth segment about how at @ORGANIZATION2, they are ingeniously using robots to make surgery more precise and efficient. This also implies that there are smaller incisions being made, which directly means a faster recovery for patients. Another area of society that has been experiencing significant advancement is crime - solving. Before the advent of computers, there was no sophisticated blood testing, no accurate fingerprinting, and most likely no detailed x - rays. Computers have made these processes much easier for law - enforcement agencies to accomplish. Computers are also highly useful for allowing us to research far - away places or other topics that they @MONTH1 simply have. Some people @MONTH1 never have the chance to visit places like @LOCATION4 or @LOCATION3, but with the help of computers, it's almost as if they have been there in person. Or maybe someone is interested in @CAPS1, but @CAPS1 isn't a very popular sport in @LOCATION2. Then they can go on their computer and discover that there is a rugby event in @LOCATION1. Then their problem is neatly solved. When you travel to a new country, you indeed get the opportunity to meet new people. But with computers and online platforms like @CAPS2, @CAPS3, you can talk to virtually anyone in the world. I could be sitting comfortably in a chair at my home in @LOCATION2, and be having a lively conversation with someone across the country, or maybe even across the ocean! Or possibly you could be chatting with some of your really close friends who live just across town. Either way, the computer is a convenient place to go and have a meaningful talk with someone. I firmly believe that computers are doing us more good than harm. Our advances in technology have helped us immensely with things like high - tech games and life - saving robotic surgery. They also give us the ability to search for topics we want to know more about or a far - away place we've never been to. Finally, we are able to talk online with people that @MONTH1 could just be across town or across the ocean. I hope that my reasoning helps you understand my point of view clearly.
1432	1436	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1, you sit down at the computer, carefully placing a glass of cool water and a delicious after - school snack, perhaps an energy - boosting after - work snack, beside you. You log on to your many accounts, patiently open some chat boxes with your friends, and then start diligently researching for your project. As more and more people immerse themselves in technology, developers seem to constantly come up with new and exciting things for computers. However, some people are missing out on the potential drawbacks and don't see the negatives, like failing social relationships, chronic procrastination, lack of real - world learning, and more! Beep! One new @CAPS2 message arrives. On the computer, you can easily talk to your friends and family, but sometimes people are so engrossed that their real - life relationships start to crumble. You can't simply type a @ORGANIZATION1 message or hide your true feelings behind a screen. Also, for kids as they grow older, many jobs require excellent customer service skills. If you're only good at talking to people on the computer, it won't be of much help in the real world. Whatever you say on the internet can be read, shared, and posted anywhere, on any site, at any time, whereas in real life, it's truly you having a face - to - face conversation. School and learning are very important too, but sometimes I know I have homework but end up procrastinating and saying ""@CAPS3 @CAPS4, I'll do it later, I need to check this out!"" This effectively puts my learning on hold. Some people don't like school, but it's extremely important in a person's life. If you want to be successful, you need to balance school, learning, computer time, and don't forget about exercise and possibly work! Computers can be helpful with research and guides, but getting lost in platforms like Facebook or Twitter is going to slow you down. So, buckle down and start that research! Chatrooms, @ORGANIZATION2, email, and other online features can be harmful to you. There are many predators out there who are just waiting for unsuspecting people to log on. It's very dangerous, and someone can easily pretend to be someone they're not. Also, spending all day on the computer with no exercise can lead to obesity, and sometimes your hand posture can give you carpal tunnel syndrome. There are many bad things that result from excessive computer use. Many times in your life, you'll need to find a proper balance. Don't overlook the negative aspects or you could get hurt. Computers are nice to have, but be careful not to waste all of your precious time on them."
1433	1437	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I am writing to you on @DATE1 because of the growing concern regarding people who own computers. You are worried that people with computers aren't spending enough time either exercising, enjoying the beauty of nature, or interacting with their family. I whole - heartedly agree with the fact that once @CAPS5 people have computers, they tend to become lazy and don't engage in any meaningful activities. I was in @CAPS1 one day and conducted a small survey to find out how many people agree that many individuals, because of computers, aren't interacting in any activities. @PERCENT1 of the people I asked said they agree, but of course, the others didn't seem to care much. Many people @MONTH1 think it's normal behavior, but I checked a well - known website that specializes in weight management and how to get active and lose weight easily. That website is @CAPS3.com. I read an in - depth article on the web page, and in paragraph @NUM1, section @NUM2, it clearly states that the rising obesity rate in the @LOCATION1 is caused by either excessive computer use and/or general laziness. Of course, some people might disagree, but at the same time, those people who disagree are usually big - time athletes who manage to do both. I had a friendly chat with @PERSON1, a professional @CAPS4 player. He said, ""@CAPS5 when I was a kid, we didn't have those things. We were either doing our homework or playing outside with our friends."" Even big - time athletes can see the negative impact. Well, in conclusion, I firmly agree with the fact that because people have computers, it makes them lazy and they do not interact with their family as they should. We need to be more aware of this issue and encourage a healthier balance between computer use and real - life activities."
1434	1438	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Isn't it about time we start thinking more deeply about the digital age? Computers have contributed so much to society for many years, and up to this point, I don't believe the world would be able to function smoothly without them. Some people say that computers aren't good for society, but do they really understand that computers gave us the internet, email, and that most jobs depend on the internet? There are also games and many other benefits. Let me explain in detail. First of all, without computers, there would be no internet, and without the internet, many jobs would simply fail. Most jobs need the internet to operate effectively. For example, architects need the computer to design complex buildings and houses with precision. Almost every office has computers for a multitude of different reasons, such as data management and communication. Writers need the computers to write books. If they were hand - written, some people might not be able to read the messy handwriting clearly. So, if there were no computers, thousands of people would lose their jobs. My mother works on a computer, and she would definitely lose her job. Not only that, but we also need computers for school. If I had to write a paper on a person, it would be almost impossible to do without looking up detailed information about him on the internet. Also, when writing a paper, some teachers only accept typed papers. How are we supposed to do that if we didn't have computers? This makes homework a lot easier and more efficient. Lastly, computers allow us to explore new places. Google @LOCATION1 is a detailed map of every place on @LOCATION1 that we can access. If you need to find out where something is, you can always rely on the internet. If you need directions, you can print them out off the internet. Also, if you need to find out what something means, instead of using a bulky dictionary, you can use the computer. Now can you see how much the computer benefits society? Some people say that other people take too long on the computer, but you don't have to. I don't know anyone who uses the computer for more than work or school - related tasks. The computer is an essential part of modern society, and its benefits far outweigh the few potential drawbacks.
1435	1439	1	3	"Dear local newspaper, I am sure you will agree with me about keeping the computers in this world. I am confident in this because computers are extremely helpful to everyone in their education. For example, when I don't understand some words, I go to the computer and type in www.dictionary.com. Then I enter the words that I don't understand. After that, the definition comes up in a much faster time. When I look in the dictionary, it takes me about @NUM1 to @NUM2 minutes to just find a single word, but on the computer, it only takes me @NUM3 seconds. Also, computers let us chat and send messages when we can't see or talk to a person in person. We send messages, and the recipient receives the message and then sends back a reply. Lastly, computers are very useful in English class, especially in areas like spelling, writing, typing, editing, and revising. That's why I think we should keep computers in this world. I know that everyone doesn't know everything. Computers can help us in math by using formulas and a calculator on calculator.com. Also, in science, we can go to @LOCATION1 and ask questions like, ""What is matter?"" or other scientific queries. Finally, I'm going to talk about not understanding some words again. I always go to dictionary.com so that this website can give me the correct definition and help me understand the word better. I always use these @NUM2 websites when I am stuck in math, science, or English. Those websites can be of great help in our education. That's my way of thinking about how computers assist us in our education. My parents are always concerned about me talking to my friends and hanging out with them. So, when I can't see or talk to my friends, I go to MySpace or Facebook or MSN to talk and send messages to them. We just keep chatting and sending messages because our parents don't always let us hang out freely. Most people do the same thing. We can also send pictures, music, and a lot more. That's my opinion on why we should have computers because we need to chat or send messages. At the end of the day, we all need to type our essays, lessons, and more. The computers help us make power - points, check our spelling, change the way we write, like using cursive, and they also assist in editing and revising. I always make spelling mistakes. So, the computer helps me correct my spelling and also makes my project look more presentable. That's why I firmly believe that computers are an indispensable part of our lives and should be kept in the world."
1436	1440	1	3	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, it has come to my attention that more and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits the society. I strongly believe that computers do benefit society for three reasons. First, computers are a great source to do school work on. Computers let you access and learn a vast amount of information. In addition, computers are an excellent way to keep in touch with friends and family. Clearly you can see why computers have positive effects on people and society. My first reason why I believe computers benefit society is because computers are a great source to use to do school work with. An example of this would be if a science teacher gave their class an assignment to do that had to be typed. It's truly impossible to type a well - formatted essay without a computer. Furthermore, if the project or assignment needs to have information looked up and there is no time in your day to go to a library, the computer is a great source that provides quick and easy access to a wealth of knowledge. Now doesn't that make sense? Computers don't just help you with homework, but many people go to college online also. ""My parents don't have enough money to afford me to go to college,"" says @NUM1 - year old @PERSON1, ""so I take free courses online and they work great!"" Isn't it obvious that computers have a good effect on people? In addition to schoolwork, computers are a great place to look when you need information. For example, you have just bought a new house and want to know more about that area. The computer is a great place to look at updated pictures, and learn about your new hometown. Sixty - nine percent of people use information from the computer to buy a home. People also want to learn basic information about bears or bees. In my belief, the computer is a great source to learn information. Obviously, computers have a great effect on people and benefit society. Lastly, computers are helpful ways to keep in touch with family and friends. ""I have my whole mom's side of the family living in @LOCATION1. When I get to use the computer to keep in touch with them, I feel closer and part of one big happy family,"" @PERSON2 of @STATE1, @NUM2, says. People who have family living in other states, countries, and even other continents, don't get to see each other every day of the year. That's why computers can help the people keep in touch. Another example would be if your mom or dad went away for a few days, weeks or months and you wanted to talk to them often. A good way to do that would be using email or instant messaging. Therefore, I strongly believe that computers are great for people and do benefit the society. To sum it all up, computers benefit society and have positive effects on people. Computers are great sources to do school work, they give you the information you're looking for, and are great ways to keep in touch with family and friends. Clearly you can see why I strongly believe that computers have a strong and positive effect on people and benefit the society. Thank you!"
1437	1441	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I have recently heard about the idea that computers are not very productive. Sure, people get information and talk online, but that can be a bad thing. I agree with the view that computers are over - used and used for the wrong reasons. To me, the main form of communication these days is chatting online. Even I talk online all the time. Chatting online is also a terrible thing if you abuse it. Children around the world talk to people they have never seen. People are being deceived because they believe the person they are talking to is the real deal. It is a great way to communicate, just not in the wrong ways. Plagiarism is happening all over the world. People just take whatever they want, when they did not create it. We know that if you are caught doing it, you can go to prison. Although there is a way we can help prevent the plagiarism. The internet has all the information in the world, and people abuse it. I have seen papers that have information that they copied and passed it to their paper. You can tell because it is in a different font than the others, and bad things happen. Teachers immediately notice, and you have to talk to a supervisor about it. I know I will try my best to not plagiarize. I can start by getting my own information. Everyone loves computers and technology, but if everyone can just lay off the computer for a while, things like plagiarism and the abuse of online chatting can be limited. By being more responsible with our computer use, we can ensure that these negative aspects are minimized and that technology serves us in a more positive way.
1438	1442	1	3	I think students should use computers so they can help themselves by using a computer. First, students should use computers because if they wanted to take notes on what they're doing, they can just go on the computer and write it. The computers are faster than just writing by hand. On a computer, all you have to do is type quickly and efficiently. You can use a computer to look up whatever you want. For example, if the teacher asks to look up a giraffe, the only practical place you can find detailed and up - to - date information about a giraffe is if you go on the computer and search for it. That's a reason how it's easier to look up things instead of using the old - fashioned way. Lastly, if you have a project you have to do and it involves pictures and you don't know how to find them, all you just have to do is go on the computer, find what you're searching for, and then you're done after you found everything that you need. It is clear that students should be allowed to use computers inside classrooms/schools so that they can get easy help. By using computers, students can enhance their learning experience and be more efficient in their studies.
1439	1443	1	3	Computers have been one of technology's greatest advances, and yet one of society's downfall. Originally thought to spread ideas and connect people to faraway places, computers have been proven to do quite the contrary. Computers are dangerous devices, and are targeting young, wholesome kids. It is the main reason why society is in the state it is today, predicting that this future generation is wobbling on an unsteady and weak foundation. These devices, the source of this mayhem, must immediately be removed from society because they take away the true benefits of life, have harmful effects on our health, and support some of the country's deadliest predators. Firstly, computers are linked with the crime of stealing the pleasures of childhood. Since @DATE1, the amount of adolescent users has shot up @PERCENT1. Amazingly enough, @PERCENT2 of parents polled admitted that their children spend at least @NUM1 hours on the computer every day. This takes away the pleasures of reading, exercising, spending time outside and hanging with friends and family. These negative effects have an unhealthy toll on society, especially teenagers, the most frequent users. As a result, diet and exercise are curtailed, raising the obesity number by @PERCENT3, and lack of outdoor or family activities have promoted anti - social behavior. At this alarming rate, our future generation indeed will be balancing on a cracked foundation. In addition to limiting diet and exercise, computers are also the source of yet another problem. As long as the computers are plugged in, they emit invisible waves of electromagnetic radiation. These waves are linked to diseases and cancers. Use of computers has been known to cause brain - tumors and leukemia, as well as brain disorders and other cancers. Leukemia, when caused at a young age, is difficult to cure and stunts the child's development. Children exposed to at least @NUM2 hours a day to @ORGANIZATION1 compared to the few who spend their time outdoors are @NUM3 times as likely to develop such health problems. The ultimate prevention to such risks is to remove the source of such causes, computers, and avoid using them completely. Lastly, computers are harmful because they also open a deadly door. As an adolescent unthinkingly surfs the web and enters chatrooms, they are at risk of attack by thousands of child predators prowling the web. Computers contain extremely valuable and secret information, such as names, birthdates, genders and even social security numbers. With one click, accepting a stranger's invite, the online predators hack into the child's computer and obtain such valuable information. Or the predators may be less passive and attack directly - asking questions to the child themselves. In fact, a familiar story tells the unfortunate fate of one local @CAPS2 girl, who unknowingly chatted with an online stranger. This online predator smoothly invited her to the mall, where they met. A couple of devastating weeks later, the girl's remains were found, burned, as the last deadly act the predator performed on the teen. Therefore, computers are simply too dangerous, a predator's handbook as they search for their next victim. By removing the computer, you eliminate the threats online predators pose for your child and you as well. It is amazing to learn that technology's greatest advancement, the computer, can unleash such harmful effects. Lack of engaging activities such as exercising and reading are stunted by the ever - distracting computer. Its electromagnetic radiation attacks our health and lastly, it supports the acts of the thousands of cruel, sneaky online predators awaiting your child on the web. By removing the source of all these troubles, those acts can be prevented and society can begin to repair the damage and move towards a healthier future.
1440	1444	1	3	"A large amount of people use computers daily, but not everyone agrees this technology benefits society. I think that computers benefit our way of life in many ways. This very useful technology has a positive effect on people because it allows people to send, receive, and research a vast variety of information easily. @PERCENT1 of people use the computer to get information and get it more quickly than reading a book about that specific topic. They say that this powerful technology has been more effective and quicker. My cousin and I were both given the same research paper to do. He used several books to get information on the topic and I used the computer. The project took me @NUM1 days to do, while it took him a whole week to complete. @PERSON1, a well - known computer programming expert, said, ""Computers have made receiving information so much faster. I vehemently believe that everyone should own this device."" Moreover, computers help with communication. There are many ways to keep in touch with people all over the world, like email, chat rooms, and popular websites like @CAPS1 and @CAPS2. These websites are a great tool to keep in touch with family and friends or even fans. @PERSON2, lead singer of the band @CAPS3 @ORGANIZATION1, said ""@CAPS1 is a way to talk to the fans directly and post updates about upcoming tours and albums. Not only is it great for bands but it is great for college students. My older brother is a college student and we communicate through these websites so it seems like he is never that far away. The computer can also help with business. Meetings can be done through @ORGANIZATION2 or a different web - chat service. Emails are a great way to send important information quickly and efficiently. @NUM2 of business meetings are held over the internet, which has benefited work ethics. Please heed my advice and use the internet and computer. It will benefit your way of communication and your way of getting information, making your personal and professional life more efficient and connected."
1441	1445	1	3	Introduction: Every single computer in the world should have internet. Internet helps people in many ways. For instance, anybody can do their homework on a computer. You can even talk to your friends on a computer, send emails to anybody around the world, or just play games. Teachers use computers because it's the easiest way to find information that they might need. Students can use a computer to do a research paper, say, for history. You can find anything about anybody or anything on a computer that has internet on it. There's also a cool thing that is found on some computers, it's called Microsoft Word. It lets you write anything you want, and if you mess up a word, you can fix it if you want to. Some schools actually supply their students with their own personal computer. They can do their homework whenever they want and just send an email to their teacher with that homework on it. Computers have more information than any book in the world because computers have way more storage for more information. Also, the cool thing about a computer is that there are websites that let you talk to your friends that live near you. But you don't have to actually go to their houses. You can put pictures of you on Facebook, MySpace, or any other site. You also can play games on Facebook, MySpace, or anything else. Schools should use computers because it's the best way to get the information that you need to do something, like science, math, or history homework. Or even just for fun or to learn something new that you never knew before. You should agree with me because everything I wrote down was true and it's almost the best way to get pictures or any information that you need to do something. Or even just to talk to a friend that you haven't seen in a while. In conclusion, the internet - enabled computers offer vast benefits in education, communication, and entertainment, making them an essential part of modern life.
1442	1446	1	3	Dear local newspaper, Many people think that computers educate people for the future, but I think that they actually harm children and adults as well. First of all, kids are so wrapped up in computer games that they never go out and exercise. They sit in front of the screen for hours, ignoring the outdoors. Second, if you ask a child anything about nature, they will probably not know what to say, but they would if they spent less time on the computer. For example, they may not know the names of common birds or plants. Finally, many families today never see each other because kids and their parents are too busy on the computer. These three reasons show why computers don't benefit society. Obesity is a huge problem among the children in [LOCATION1]. The reason for this is that they are spending too much time online and not outdoors and exercising. Kids are not getting any fresh air or exercise, and this can lead to serious health conditions like heart problems and diabetes. Parents sometimes don't do anything about it because they have the same problem. This just shows that computers and other technology are affecting families around the country by making them overweight and less active. Many children don't know the first thing about nature. People say that computers educate people about things, but nature and the environment are a big part of our lives. The best way is to learn about it and help protect it. With the time they are spending on computers, the earth might become even worse, so they need to get educated on nature and the environment so they can contribute to its protection. I know from my own experience that computers take away time from your friends and family. Instead of playing games on the computer at home, you could be spending time with your family in the park or the pool. My dad always spent his time on the computer, and we never had time to spend with him. When he realized this, he rearranged his schedule so we could have more time together. It is very important to spend time with your family because they are such a big part of your life, and less time on the computer will help families do that. As you can see, getting off the computer will help kids stay in shape and healthy, educate them on the environment, and help families interact with each other more. If getting off the computer changed my family's lifestyle, then it will do the same to others as well. Hopefully, you agree with me because it will surely take a positive effect on our lives and the environment.
1443	1447	1	3	Dear Editors of the [CAPS2] [CAPS3] [CAPS4], computers are a wonderful tool and they bear many positive impacts on society. First, computers have created numerous advanced forms of communication. Also, they have enabled us to create a revolutionary age in research. In addition, computers have given us amazing diverse ways to entertain ourselves. Computers have an incredibly positive effect on people. One reason why computers have such a positive effect on humans is that we have developed many efficient ways to communicate with people all over the world. First, one fantastic program such as [CAPS5] (instant messaging) has given us the amazing ability to hold a conversation with one or more people anywhere in the world and be able to respond within an instant. In a recent survey, [PERCENT1] of people said that they prefer instant messaging over any other type of communication beside face - to - face talking. Second, most computers come with webcams built in now, so you can actually see the person you are communicating with. I had a friend move recently, and we are able to see what each other are doing and remain friends even though we don't live in the same town, and I'm sure a similar experience has occurred to you or someone you know. Finally, the popular program of Facebook has changed communication forever. People can now see what goes on in your life wherever they want. Although some may have concerns, it has a wonderful impact overall. Computers have established incredible ways of communication. A second reason computers positively impact people is that they have created a numerous research opportunities. One example would be our phenomenal search engine, Google. Google can provide answers to almost everything, which helps people in finding information. Schools now use computer resources such as [CAPS6], which allow in - depth research due to the fact that there is so much available on the internet. In addition, computers have created many opportunities for people to learn more because of the billions of websites that exist. Studies have shown that [PERCENT2] of people have found a website containing information relevant to their research that was more useful than a book. Computers are the reason that research has continued to thrive and new discoveries continue to be made. Finally, computers have established amazing diverse entertainment for people of all ages. First, video websites such as YouTube have created a place for people to watch music videos and creative films just to enjoy themselves. If you can't get tickets to a concert you want, going online to watch music videos by that person is a much cheaper alternative. Second, gaming websites are a less expensive option. If you usually pay for games, you can play similar games at no charge online. Finally, websites with appropriate funny stories posted on them are a fantastic way to get the laughter of a comic without leaving your couch. Wouldn't you prefer to stay home rather than going out when it isn't necessary? Computers are an incredible way to achieve quick, inexpensive entertainment in today's economy. In conclusion, computers have transformed communication, research, and entertainment, making them an indispensable part of modern society, and we should embrace their positive influence.
1444	1448	1	3	Dear Newspaper, Have you ever stopped to think what modern - day technology has brought us? A great example is computers. Many people use this device to book vacations, talk and build relationships with people, and to discover new ideas the world has to offer. I strongly disagree with those who oppose their use. The hot sun glaring down at you can make you eager to book a vacation to a tropical island! Many people go on vacations, and what brought them there is when they sat at the computer looking at hotels and booking them. This modern - day technology has brought many humans to places they wanted to go. Over [PERCENT1] of [CAPS1]'s have a chat account to talk with family and friends. The distance from the country of Europe to the [LOCATION1] is over [NUM1] miles, and every time you make a call it can lead to a lot of high costs. Modern technology has outpaced the phones, and people are now using the computer to talk to far - away friends and family. In the process, the computer has helped over [NUM2] of single people start and develop relationships. Many arguments have been led to because of the disagreement. Many critics say that not many people interact with family and friends in person. On the other hand, the computer has enabled many people to connect and communicate. They can set a plan to meet up. Many critics claim that people spend too much time on the computer. Although this is true, there should be decisions that will improve the health of the human by limiting usage of them. Setting standards on computers can improve these problems and help encourage exercising. In this case, I strongly disagree with the critics and stand for the good uses of computers. If they took them away, not only will people's files fall into disarray, but everyone will be disorganized in the long run. Lastly, discovering places and websites teaches even the smartest guy or girl something new. After reading this, I hope I have proven that my [CAPS4] should be admired by many people. In conclusion, computers have revolutionized travel, communication, and learning, and with proper use, they can continue to enhance our lives.
1445	1449	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, Computers! Computers have a great effect on people. The advances in technology with computers benefit the society. Computers give people a place to chat with others, learn on school websites, and they teach hand - eye coordination. Computers are changing the world everywhere. Computers give people a place to interact with others. There are thousands of websites that have chat places and are online chat rooms. These chat areas give you a place to talk to others and even see what might be going on throughout the world. For example, you can join global discussions on various topics. Also, chat rooms on the computer can help friends always keep in touch. Studies show that ninety percent of [CAPS1] that have a chat room to go to with friends often have more friends than those who don't. Obviously, the interactions with others on the computer have a great effect on people. School websites also give people benefits in our society. It gives us the ability to learn more about what we are learning in school and maybe the ability to learn new things too. When almost every school in the [LOCATION1] has a school website, that helps students who are having trouble in school. I know from my experiences that having a computer helps me in school whenever I forgot what my homework was or I need to study for a quiz or test. I can always go on my computer and find what I need for school. When the computer provides such assistance, it clearly benefits our society. Computers teach hand - eye coordination too. When you use the computer for games or anything you do, it teaches you how to move the mouse quickly and keep your eyes focused on the screen. Whenever I have the ability to use the computer, I always do. That's because with all the games and websites, it will teach us hand - eye coordination while I'm just having fun. Ninety - five percent of people who use the computer enjoy using it. That's ninety - five percent of people who are learning more hand - eye coordination. If that doesn't benefit the society, then nothing does. As I have shown, computers definitely do benefit society. I strongly believe that computers have a positive effect on people. That is because it gives people a place to interact with others, to learn things on school websites, and they teach hand - eye coordination. In conclusion, computers play a vital role in modern society, enhancing social interaction, education, and physical skills, and their positive impact should be recognized and embraced.
1446	1450	1	3	Click click, another information page opens up on your handy @LOCATION4. These trusty, smart, and easy - to - use devices are always a great thing to have. Although, people are now starting to claim that these handy desktops are bad for your well - being, opposing the view that many strongly think we don't get enough exercise or outdoor activities in. Well, computers are such a great entertainment system. They also have a vast information supply and even allow socialization with friends and family. I don't understand why they say this. So let me express my love for computers to you. Televisions, radios, and @NUM1 players are no match for the internet and its great, widespread entertainment system. The computer has all of the family - fun movies, iTunes tracks, and even websites where you could make your own movies. Posting pictures on the @CAPS1 and sending them via email is just a click of your mouse away. The internet is the obvious best reason for a family movie night. One of the greatest pros about the internet is the vivid source of information. Google, Wikipedia, or even Dictionary.com are the greatest information sites of the @DATE1. As much as nature watching and exercise is healthy and fun, I would rather learn about a sunny beach of @CAPS2 or the great landscape of @LOCATION1. If you're looking up how to tie a tie or even info about your history report, the @CAPS3 is a sure - fire easy thing. How could you talk to your friend who is across the world in @LOCATION2 or Germany? The answer is simple. Skype, Facebook, MySpace and more are all available on your handy @CAPS3. Many sites have a no - fee policy so they can't charge you money for socializing with friends. As a personal experience, I can now talk to my cousins who live in @LOCATION3 and @LOCATION1 due to the great interaction site of Facebook. And why would you take the time to run across town to be unsure that they're even there? Obviously, the internet is a great socializing activity. Now that I have stated my opinion about the wonderful effect of the internet such as the entertainment system, information about the history of the world, and even the socializing with friends, I'm sure people will open their eyes and see the great uses of the computer.
1447	1451	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I think that computers have a positive effect on people because it helps them learn about foreign places, it allows them to connect with family and friends that live far away, and it helps them with their jobs. Computers help people learn about foreign places. Before my uncle went to @LOCATION4, he was really eager to learn about their culture. He sat down at the computer and thoroughly researched @CAPS1 culture, so that he could be well - prepared. How would you feel if you went to another country and knew nothing about it? What if you were to go to that country and do something that was disrespectful to their culture, but you didn't know because you didn't do research on it? I know I would feel really bad. Now some people might say that you can read a book on that country, but not everyone has the time to sit and read a book. Computers make the world a little smaller and helps us learn about each other. I think that's pretty positive. Don't you? People connect with each other through the computer. More than @PERCENT1 of people who move away from their family and friends reconnect with them through computers. Nowadays there are social networking sites, like @CAPS2, @CAPS3, and @CAPS4, that give people the chance to contact a family or friend that lives far away. When I moved to @LOCATION1 from @LOCATION2, I thought that I was never going to see my best friend again. But then, I got a @CAPS3 account and found her on there. I was extremely ecstatic. We swapped numbers and addresses. Now every day I talk to her on the computer. Also, the only way I talk to my aunty, who lives in @LOCATION3, is by the computer. I can't talk to her on the phone because that would run my phone bill up. Another reason that computers are positive is that they help people find their biological parents or siblings. It brings them together and helps them reconnect with each other. Computers help people with their job. Anybody who is a @CAPS6 of a company has a laptop. It helps them store data, files, and important information. Computers are essential to these people. Also, it helps them keep track of their company if they go on a vacation. How would you feel if you owned a company and went on a vacation, but you couldn't keep track of it because you didn't have a computer. Computers have a positive effect on people because they help learn about places, talk to their family, and keep track of their job. In conclusion, the benefits of computers in these aspects clearly show their positive impact on people's lives.
1448	1452	1	3	"Dear @PERSON4, I strongly believe that the use of computers is beneficial to the community. One reason I feel this way is that computers can improve hand - eye coordination and other skills. These computers provide access to games helpful in @ORGANIZATION2 training. In fact, @ORGANIZATION2, in @LOCATION1, @CAPS1, just began using these games as part of their training this @DATE1. Instructors report that @ORGANIZATION2 skills in trainees and students are far better than in years past. Additionally, computer games can improve reflexes. Two years ago, a man named @PERSON3, @NUM1 years old, fell onto the train tracks just as a train was coming by. Through extraordinary reflexes he managed to leap out of the way, saving his life. When asked how he did it, he said he had been playing computer games since he was @NUM2 years old. These games also make you more intelligent. The @ORGANIZATION1's @DATE2 study reports that brains were @PERCENT1 more active after use of computers. The researchers achieved this data by attaching electrolytes to the patient's brain both before and after using the computer. It is for these reasons that computers improve hand - eye coordination and other skills. Another reason for why computers are beneficial is that they allow you to talk online. They even allow you to communicate with your family who live far away, strengthening your relationships. I recently got back in touch with my cousin who moved to @LOCATION3. Letters were too expensive and took too long, but email and Skype provide us with a great alternative. These computers also improve social skills. @PERSON1, a resident here in town, says, ""I love using computers because I can talk to my friends whenever I want, and I feel like it really helps us communicate."" Who wouldn't love a machine that provides a service like that? These computers can even improve your mood. In a test done by @ORGANIZATION3 in @DATE3, @NUM3 people were put in separate rooms with personal computers for @NUM4 hour. Afterwards, @PERCENT2 said they felt an improvement in their mood. Computers are great because they allow you to talk online. Finally, computers allow you to learn about other places. Virtual tours are becoming more and more common today. In fact, at @CAPS2.org, you can take virtual tours of over @NUM5 different countries, including @LOCATION5, @LOCATION4, @LOCATION2, and @LOCATION6. You can also learn about other cultures and their traditions through online videos at YouTube.com and articles at Wikipedia.org, the free encyclopedia. You can even learn new recipes. Celebrity chef extraordinaire @PERSON2 not only posts all her recipes online at mstewart.com, but she even finds some of them! In a recent interview by @CAPS3 magazine, when asked where she's found some of her best recipes, including her famous @CAPS4 chocolate cake, @PERSON2 admits she found most of them online, saying, ""It's a powerful resource that more people should use. All in all, for all these reasons, computers are truly beneficial to the community."
1449	1453	1	3	"Dear local newspaper, I have recently seen that you think that people are spending way too much time on computers instead of exercising or hanging with their friends and family. Well, I think the opposite of that opinion. People interact with people online if they want to. People can also learn new things. Plus, computers help people make money. So read on to hear more. Most people that use computers are interacting with people some way or another. @PERCENT1 of all people have either a Facebook, a MySpace, a Skype, or all three. On any of those sites you can interact with people. We can meet new people on the internet, like people on the other side of the state or country. Also, we can hear about what is going on in our big or small town. For instance, if there was a missing child, we would know the description, so we could help find him or her. Not only do people interact, but people can research useful information. For an example, one day I was told to do a project on teen mothers. I went straight to the library, took some books out, and whatever I couldn't find in the books, I went to the computer for. Also, we can learn about far - away places like @LOCATION2 or @LOCATION1. My mom always says, ""Clean your room or I'm going to give your stuff to people in need."" The first time she said that to me, I went to the computer to see how other people were faring. Some lived in good, nice, big houses, but then others lived in boxes and trash cans. That changed me big time. I felt really bad for those people. Lastly, computers help people make money and support their family. @PERCENT2 of all people found out about their job on a computer. They can go to websites to find good, safe jobs that make good money. Plus, if you have a computer, you can easily work from home. Some people don't have the money for babysitters, so they have to watch their kids all day and thus have to work from home to make money. Finally, people can apply for jobs or even community service online. My sister, @PERSON1, got her first job by going on the @CAPS4 museum's website and applying right there on the computer. Therefore, computers are good. I say this because people can interact with other people online, people can research useful information, and finally, computers help people find jobs and make money. Do you use computers for any of these reasons? In conclusion, the multiple advantages of computers clearly prove their positive value in our lives."
1450	1454	1	3	Dear Newspaper, It's a small world after all - and growing smaller as computer usage becomes more and more widespread. Thousands upon thousands of sites and applications are now at your fingertips. I firmly believe that the effects of computers are overwhelmingly positive. For one thing, they increase hand - eye coordination. For another, they are a great means of communication. Finally, they are a very powerful research tool. Some @MONTH1 say that computers are lessening time with family and friends, but I don't agree. Computers help us stay more connected than ever! The computer is not evil - quite the opposite! First of all, computers are great for increasing hand - eye coordination. In a recent study by @PERSON1, he noticed a significant increase in motor skills of children aged @NUM1 to @NUM2 when they used educational computer programs such as @CAPS2 @CAPS3 for just half an hour, once a day. Children who did not use the program were seen to develop motor skills at a much lower rate. Hand - eye coordination is a skill needed from birth to death, and should be encouraged as much as possible. I know that it greatly helps me in my daily life - and probably you in yours as well - from the most basic tasks of eating and brushing my teeth to typing, drawing, and playing the piano. As you can see, hand - eye coordination is very important. Second in my reasoning is that computers are brilliant communication aids. People can't always be reached by phone. An email could be waiting for them online whenever - and wherever - they check it. Also, documents can be sent over email that would be near impossible for a home phone and difficult for most cells to process. Revolutionary video - conferencing programs like @ORGANIZATION2 can even allow us to talk to people around the world, practically eye to eye. I use it to keep in touch with family on the @LOCATION2. How about you? Last - but (at the risk of sounding cliched) definitely not the least - computers are very powerful research tools. Everything from the schedule of the local zoo (thus preventing toddler meltdowns when one arrives only to find it closed) to the average life span of the @CAPS4 elephant (@NUM3 years). Rather than skimming book after book for a single piece of information, plug your query into any of many search engines, from @ORGANIZATION1 to @CAPS5, and find answers instantly. Find out about @LOCATION3 without the expense of a plane ticket. See photos of @LOCATION1 - a sight most people would never get to see without the internet. The computer can take us anywhere. In conclusion, computers are a great resource that are often wrongly portrayed in a bad light. Computers teach and improve valuable hand - eye coordination. Also, they help greatly with communication. And finally, they are a powerful research device. Computers are often shown as the bane of society. This is simply untrue. They are an excellent tool for all ages. Technology is not our enemy. Don't treat it like one.
1451	1455	1	3	"To whom this @MONTH1 concern: I recently heard that people are engaged in a heated debate to determine whether computers bring benefits to us or are detrimental. In my opinion, computers are truly great. They offer us the wonderful opportunity to talk with people all across the world. They endow us with the ability to learn about a vast array of things. Lastly, they help us save money on a regular basis. Aren't these all aspects that clearly benefit us? I firmly think so. Please continue reading to discover more about why computers are so advantageous. First off, computers empower us to communicate with people from every corner of the globe. A significant portion of my family resides in different @CAPS1, and the computer serves as the perfect medium through which I stay in touch with them. If you were to move away from all your dear friends and family, wouldn't you strongly desire to maintain a connection with them? Well, you absolutely can by chatting with them on the computer. To keep the discussion flowing, computers present us with the chance to learn about diverse things. If I access ""@CAPS2.com"", I can effortlessly type in anything I'm curious about and promptly obtain valuable information about it. Or I can get a well - thought - out answer to a question. Are you a parent eager to know how your child is faring in school? You can simply visit their school website and check their grades in each of the classes they're taking. To sum it all up, computers save us money daily. If you needed to look up information for a project without a computer, you'd have to make a long drive all the way to the library and perhaps even buy a book. But with a computer, you can conveniently get the information you need right in the comfort of your own home. In conclusion, it's evident that computers benefit us in numerous ways. They enable us to talk to friends and family all around the world. They provide us with the opportunity to look up information quickly and easily. Lastly, they save us money every single day. Thank you for reading my letter, which I'm confident has convinced you to recognize that computers are indeed a great asset."
1452	1456	1	3	"How would you like to get a ""@CAPS1"" on your social studies report? What if you couldn't see your school friends at all after - school? What if you were extremely bored, and you weren't allowed to watch TV or play games? Some experts are worried about people because they believe that individuals are spending an excessive amount of time using their computers and not enough time exercising, enjoying the beauty of nature, and interacting with family and friends. On your computer, you can watch interesting videos and play engaging games, you can have in - depth chats and conversations with people, and you can even significantly boost up your grades. I sincerely think that the idea of people being on their computers too much is a rather silly thought. @CAPS2, let's closely examine how a computer can transform your life. Let's say you have a history report due tomorrow, you've unfortunately forgotten your history book at school, and you know next to nothing about the report. You're going to fail if you don't hand it in, so why not simply turn on your computer and open up the internet browser? I remember @TIME1 year I was working on a report about the @CAPS4 @CAPS3. I literally had zero knowledge about them and I'd carelessly failed to bring home my book. I opened up the internet and typed in @CAPS4 @CAPS3 in @ORGANIZATION1, and @DATE1 I was delighted to find out that I got a @NUM1 on the report. You can also use the computer just to look up information about something that you might study in school. ""@TIME1 @DATE1, I was reading about the @CAPS6 @CAPS7 and a few days @DATE1 we discussed how that @CAPS7 possibly could have been made. I was the only student in our grade who knew the answer. You can use the computer for playing games that are educational and related to school. For example, you can test how fast you can complete all of these multiplication problems or division problems. Look at what computers can achieve. If you get bad grades (without the help of a computer), you'll likely go to a sub - par college and end up with a mediocre job. However, if you get good grades (with the assistance of a computer), you'll have the opportunity to go to a top - notch college and secure a great job. Next, let's explore how you can chat or talk to people. You can establish a messaging connection with someone by using @CAPS8 or have a free - to - free conversation using @ORGANIZATION2 on your computer. Studies show that @PERCENT1 of people with computers have either @CAPS8 or @ORGANIZATION2 installed on their devices. You can also communicate with people who have an email address. I remember having a problem with my laptop and my crush is extremely knowledgeable about them. So I emailed him and quickly got a response, which helped me fix my laptop. You are able to interact with people by meeting them online and then meeting them in public. Everyone is aware of those dating websites that match two people and bring them together. A computer can truly enhance the quality of your life. Lastly, let's see what you can do on the computer when you're bored. Why don't you go to YouTube and watch videos that seem appropriate and interesting? ""@CAPS10, I was done with my homework and I had no idea what to do, so I went online and spent some time watching YouTube videos. Sometimes people enjoy playing games. Just @TIME1, I was playing Tetris, but only for @NUM2 minutes because I needed a good night's rest before the @CAPS11. You can also listen to the radio on a website. Statistics show that @PERCENT2 of people who listened to the radio @CAPS10 were in cars. But @PERCENT3 is also @PERCENT4 more people listening to the radio online. Not only can a computer increase your grades and improve your life, but it can also entertain you. As you can see, the idea of restricting the use of computers is a silly one and is completely nonsense. Computers can enrich your life and make you more successful. I've never seen someone who has used a computer appropriately and suffered negative consequences."
1453	1457	1	3	Dear Local @CAPS1, I firmly believe that computers do not have a negative impact on people because I'm convinced that they actually bring numerous benefits to people and the way they live. Computers are not just devices that have games. In many cases, they help you gain a wealth of knowledge. Computers can be used for entertainment, for various jobs, for in - depth research, for important projects, and much more. They are not limited to just games. Computers are extremely useful for people in their jobs. For example, if you work as a lawyer, you @MONTH1 absolutely need a computer to type up your important documents. If you have poor penmanship and have a job like a lawyer, and you @MONTH1 need to refer to something in your document and can't read your own handwriting, that becomes a significant problem. So in that situation, that's where the crucial role of the computer steps in. I also think that computers do not have a negative effect on people because during grade school, sometimes kids really need the internet. Some people don't have the option of a library because there isn't one near their homes. By using the computer to gather information for a project or homework, I think it is a great benefit, not a negative effect. I have one more reason why I think computers benefit, not harm. I believe that if you have a @CAPS2, or @CAPS3, you have a wonderful chance to meet people from all over the world. Just through this interaction, you could learn a great deal. You could learn about their unique lifestyle and various things about their rich culture. Thank you for taking the time to read my letter. Hopefully, you will reconsider your decision and recognize the many benefits that computers bring.
1454	1458	1	3	"Due to an ongoing debate about whether or not computers benefit society, I am writing to you to share my opinion on this matter. I firmly believe that computers have far more benefits than drawbacks. I hold this view for several reasons. First of all, computers bring about convenient online communication. Also, computers advance and enhance the learning process. It's important to mention that computers also play a significant role in advancing employment opportunities. As I've mentioned, computers enable online communication. Now, after reading this, there must be a question running through your mind: how to define this? Well, online communication includes popular social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter, and let's not forget MySpace. This also encompasses email, blogs, and some chat sites. Okay, enough about that. But how do these inventions improve our lives? These inventions allow for seamless long - distance communication, bringing people ""closer together."" @CAPS1 example, my uncle lives in @LOCATION1. And through Facebook, my mother can have a conversation with him any time she wishes, and also catch up with their other relatives. So online communication @MONTH1 can be very necessary in the same way. Also, you could use email to communicate with others, although it travels at a slower pace compared to other forms of electronic communication. Besides, I've mentioned learning. Computers can improve learning in a variety of effective ways. Computers enhance learning because they accelerate the flow of information. Students can visit places like school websites to find out more about what's happening at the school. @CAPS1 example, I regularly go on my school's website to retrieve my nightly homework assignments and read the next day's daily announcements. Teachers might post helpful hints on homework and @MONTH1 sometimes provide a detailed explanation of the assignment. Also, computers can improve learning by assisting with research projects. @CAPS1 example, a couple of weeks ago, my health class was gathering information for our illegal drug project. So with the information we found on the computer, we were able to create a wide variety of brochures from it. In conclusion, it's clear that computers have a multitude of benefits in terms of communication, learning, and employment, and these benefits far outweigh any potential drawbacks."
1455	1459	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Some people @MONTH1 might think that computers are helping our society, but I wholeheartedly disagree. People who are constantly sitting in front of the computer are not getting enough exercise or experiencing the beauty of nature. Do you really want to gain weight while sitting next to a metal box? People are also neglecting to visit their friends and family, who are the most important people in their lives. Do you want to be the one sitting on a computer all day, getting out of shape, or do you want to be physically fit while enjoying the benefits of exercise? The only ""workout"" you're getting on the computer is just moving your fingers. So you should get off your lazy self and engage in some good old - fashioned exercise. Yes, computers can teach you things, but exercise teaches you valuable lessons while you're getting fit. Who wouldn't want to behold the real beauty of nature? Yes, you can see pictures of nature on the computer, but those are just a collection of pixels mashed together. In the real world, nature is all natural and often much more beautiful than what you see on the computer. Doesn't that sound far better than being glued to the computer? All of the cool, healthy people are outside enjoying nature, so be one of them and go outside and have a great time looking at exotic plants and beautiful animals. You can do both of these activities with your friends and family, while when you're sitting on your computer, you don't get to see them as often. @PERCENT1 of @LOCATION1 love their family and friends, and I'm sure you're one of them. Friends and family can also support you through difficult times. Without them, who knows where you'd be in life. So do yourself a favor, get off the computer, and go visit some truly wonderful people. It's now or never to get off that computer, or your family and friends might drift away from you, and you'll end up gaining weight on top of that. Do you want to be that person? You're also going to miss out on the incredible beauty of nature. So go, go, go, and have a great time enjoying the real world."
1456	1460	1	3	I have realized that there has been a disagreement about the positive and negative effects of computers on people. It seems to me that, in fact, computers have more of a negative impact on people than a positive one. I believe that people are spending an excessive amount of time on the computer and not exercising. They don't spend quality time with family and friends and need to get out to breathe fresh air and enjoy nature. Although computers are a great piece of technology, many people don't venture outside to enjoy nature and fresh air because their computers are inside their homes. This is not good because when you go outside, the sunlight helps with skin health and allows fresh air to enter your lungs. In addition, taking a walk outside to enjoy nature wouldn't do any harm. It can relieve stress and be relaxing. Furthermore, it is obvious that when people are on the computer, they usually tune out what their friends and family are saying to them. People can lose track of time and be on the computer for hours. Instead, you should use this time to be with your friends and family. Being with your family can strengthen the bond between each other and help you get along better. Also, having a nice family time is an excellent way to connect with your family. A significant number of experts say that eating a family dinner can help a child's grades and prevent them from using drugs or dropping out of high school or college. Finally, kids are more obese than adults because they don't get enough exercise. At least a considerable percentage of kids are obese according to recent studies. Due to this, it can lead to bone and joint issues, heart disease, lung problems, diabetes, and asthma. These issues are serious health problems if not treated. If kids exercise instead of being on a computer all day, the number of obese kids will drop significantly. Exercise can boost kids' self - esteem and get them back in shape. They can either play sports or even take a walk or run. There are many different things you can do to exercise, and it's fun for kids. Undoubtedly, there are definitely more reasons why there is a negative impact on kids and adults due to computers for the reasons above and more. Computers prevent people from enjoying nature and getting fresh air. Likewise, they also prevent families and friends from spending time with each other, and lastly, it doesn't allow kids to exercise, which can lead to obesity. In conclusion, we should be more mindful of our computer usage to lead healthier and more fulfilling lives.
1457	1461	1	3	I would agree because computers do help people with various things like researching vacation spots, finding jobs, looking for presents, and shopping. There are so many uses for the computer. But the creators of the computer are worried that people are spending too much time on it. Mainly, it's about the concerns of users. Most of those people complain that they are having no time with their family and friends. You never know if the users are looking up vacation trips for both friends and family. The thing that the concerned people don't understand is that the computer can teach you a lot of things, such as history, mathematics, and science experiments. Computers are also used in schools to assist students with their work, and even teachers use the computer for grading. It is true that people don't go outside to get some fresh air or even take a walk in the park. They can't keep themselves glued to the computer for like a long number of hours; it's just crazy. So, I would side with both sides. It's just better to enjoy life rather than just looking up things that you don't really need. You should only need to go on the computer for essential tasks like paying bills and looking for furniture for your house. That's why the computer was invented. In conclusion, we should strike a balance between using the computer for its benefits and enjoying the real - world experiences.
1458	1462	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, imagine a world where the unemployment rate rises significantly, people can't communicate or learn as fast, and everyone is stressed out. That's what the world would be like if computers just disappeared. I think computers are more beneficial to society than some people realize. They teach us new things and help us with hand - eye coordination. Many jobs are involved with computers, such as an accountant. Computer games and certain applications help take the edge off after a hard day. Schools are the backbone of society. They teach kids and teens how to become successful adults. Computers have helped greatly in speeding up the teaching process. Teachers can now access grades in a heartbeat. My computer helps me with my studies and keeps me connected with the world. In conclusion, computers play an indispensable role in our society, and we should embrace their benefits while being aware of potential drawbacks.
1459	1463	1	3	Dear Newspaper: I have just read your recent article on whether computers are helping or wrecking society. I think it is helping because without the internet, I can't learn how to do things such as cleaning a particular item the proper way. This takes time to learn, but through the internet, I learned it quickly. If you do this the wrong way, it could cause damage and potentially harm you. There are many other uses. If you are in a situation where your family is counting on you, you have two options. You can panic and let everyone down, or you can go on the internet and find a solution. But all this is not just theoretical. The computer does affect how people exercise. I know what you might be thinking. The internet does have an impact on how you exercise. It shows you better and more effective ways to stay healthy. There are also cons; some of the cons include spending too much time sitting in front of the screen. All of these can lead to different things like a sedentary lifestyle. It isn't a bad thing when you use it in moderation. In conclusion, just do the right things, use the internet for learning and positive purposes, and balance it with physical activity, and you will be healthier than ever.
1460	1464	1	3	"Dear Readers at the organization in the location, In this time, almost everything in modern life revolves around technology, including various digital platforms and devices. With the rapid pace of technological change, do we still have time to stop and smell the roses? People are no longer at the well - known place looking at the beautiful scenery in the fall or at the other place or playing popular sports like basketball or baseball. Instead, they are sitting on a chair watching a video on a streaming platform or playing games like well - known game 1 or well - known game 2. In the specific location, health problems have become an epidemic! Why? Because instead of enjoying the fresh air and open fields that the location has to offer, people are engrossed in their digital entertainment or using their home computers. As a result, in the specific location over a certain period, the obesity rate has gone from a relatively low percentage in some areas to a much higher percentage! That's a significant increase! What other rate is going up increasingly? The number of homes that own computers and the rate at which each home owns them! A doctor conducted a study in the area. He found that in the last few years, the number of a certain type of diabetics has almost doubled! A well - known researcher at an organization wrote an article for a publication. In his article, he exclaimed that a large percentage of households own more than one computer per household! The technology - related industries are all doing very well in this economic slump, while sporting goods, books, and exercise equipment are not. The people at the organization see this as a main cause for the growing lack of exercise and increase in time on home computers. Also just as important is how all this time spent on computers is affecting children. As a writer for the publication said, ""Children are spending a large amount of time on computers each day."" It has become apparent that children are spending less time playing sports and more time on their ""amazing laptops"" playing video games! I am a certain age, and I have been playing a sport in the location for a long time. When I was younger, the travel team used to have so many people try out that it was difficult to get on, but now so few people play that they barely need to try out! When I grow up, I am most likely going to end up with a job somewhere working for a big business like Google, teaching things that require computer skills, so for now, I want to enjoy being a kid! We shouldn't let kids waste their childhood on video games; they will spend enough of their lives behind a computer later in life. We are talking about the health of the future generation! Do we want a future where everyone has diabetes and spends all their time on computers? Through all the technological changes, we need to keep one thing the same no matter how difficult it is. That is we need to get out and help keep our bodies in good shape, and we can't do that from behind a computer screen. Thank you for your time."
1461	1465	1	3	Dear @PERSON1, I am firmly on the side of computers. You might think I'm only saying that because I'm @NUM1 years old and using computers is basically what I do for fun. However, computers truly do benefit society as they are a source of entertainment, a means of communication, useful for schooling and education, and essential for work. Computers are not just the @CAPS1 but also @CAPS6 processor and @ORGANIZATION1 and all related components. They provide games suitable for everyone from ages @NUM2 to @NUM3. For instance, when it's raining outside, your parents are at work, and you're home alone with nothing to do, simply turn on the computer and play a game. There are numerous fun websites designed for all. Computers also offer an excellent source of communication. There are all different kinds of @CAPS2 - mail. @CAPS5, @ORGANIZATION4, @CAPS3, @CAPS4, and many other sites are great for chatting with friends. Not everyone has a cell phone, so chatting with them via @CAPS5 or other platforms is really nice. Computers are a wonderful source of education. If you're working on a history project and need more information and pictures, just log onto a computer and @ORGANIZATION3 it. At our school, we have edline which tells us all of our homework assignments. It's extremely handy. Now, there are also online schooling tutors, which is great. Computers are also great for work. @ORGANIZATION3, @CAPS6, @ORGANIZATION1, @ORGANIZATION5, and other @ORGANIZATION2 wear or other companies rely on them. You can find information and create useful things with it. It's very, very useful for business workers. As you can see, computers have a lot of great uses. I believe computers affect people in a positive way by helping them in multiple positive aspects. They allow for fun, communication, educational purposes, and work uses. Computers are a good thing to have around, @CAPS7't you think?
1462	1466	1	3	Dear @LOCATION1, minute man, people are complaining. They are complaining about how computers interfere with their family and life. But in fact, it teaches both adults and kids new things. Being on the computer is an experience. You can almost search for anything on it. You can learn about history or the present time. For example, one time I was searching on (@CAPS1.com) on how to fix a play - station @NUM1 controller. I found out how to do it and it actually worked. While you're on the computer, you can interact with friends, find out about the weather, and check if you have any homework. The computer also teaches you how to do different things. Like one time, I learned to do a hardflip. Also, computers can help you with your homework. For instance, if you have science homework and you're trying to figure out a word, you can search it. Or if you're looking for a book for @LOCATION2, you can search websites for good books or ask a friend. The computer helps many different people in many different ways. And you know how people say computers are bad. If you have a TV for a game system, it's like having a computer, right? But don't go overboard looking for a cheap one. I do suggest that everyone should have a computer as they are both helpful and fun. Overall, the advantages of having a computer far outweigh the so - called drawbacks.
1463	1467	1	3	"Almost everyone in the @LOCATION1 uses a computer at one point in their life. Computers are a great way to teach hand - eye coordination through programs, games, and typing. The internet can be used for researching different far - away cultures, as well as one's own lifestyle. This compact and well - made piece of technology has been becoming more and more intricate. Realizing how much help computers have in everyday life, people will either be the downfall or the support for computer technology moving forward. One very basic but evident result from using a computer is hand - eye coordination. Since children are in grade school, they start learning to type on a keyboard. Special programs help kids learn the necessary skills while having fun during the practice. When I was small, just five years old, I remember typing. I was always excited when my mom and I went to Barnes and Noble to pick up a new typing program. I especially enjoyed ""Type to Learn"" and @CAPS1 typing lessons. Teaching children to type in general, and specifically through these programs, teaches hand - eye coordination. In high school, college, and the job world, young adults and adults are expected to type papers, resumes, and applications. In this day and age, the technology era has begun, and typing is a necessity. Another way to teach hand - eye coordination is through computer games. A simple challenge like solitaire, Bejeweled, or car racing teaches the skill, and much more advanced games, for example, World of Warcraft, require perfect coordination. This can be achieved through both typing and games, both on the computer. Though some experts are concerned that ""people are spending too much time on the computer and less time... enjoying nature,"" you are able to learn about geography, travel, and nature. One amazing thing on a computer is the world wide web. This consists of millions of websites, pages, search engines, and information. Are you in an upcoming geography class? Are you planning a trip? Do you need to find a definition for the word ""cognitive""? If any of these situations pertain to you, a legitimate website can house your answers, and all you need to do is search. Instead of having to travel to learn about special wonders, since travel prices are expensive, you can simply click and type to access amazing information. When you're searching on a computer, you can learn about long - ago cultures and rituals, information that you would have found at a museum @NUM1 years ago. @CAPS1 is a complex yet simple - to - use technology that brings a world of pictures, simple art, and history right to your fingertips. In conclusion, computers offer multiple benefits despite the concerns, and their role in modern life is undeniable."
1464	1468	1	3	Did you know that four out of five households have a computer? But why so many? It's because computers have a positive effect on people. Have you ever thought about why? With computers, you can contact people in different parts of the @CAPS1. You can search up different information over the internet. Computers also benefit other electronic inventions. What do @LOCATION5, @LOCATION2, @LOCATION6, and @LOCATION7 all have in common? You can contact the people there with computers! While talking to people around the @CAPS1, you can learn something about a culture or lifestyle that you didn't know before. You just might make a new friend along the way. Picture if you will, a hard - working business man who lives in the @LOCATION1. He works for a @CAPS1 - famous company and has to go to a meeting with the big boss in @LOCATION4. Wouldn't it just be easier to set up a video chat? That way, there's no hassle with a plane voyage and it's much more convenient. Why do you think it's called the @CAPS1 - @CAPS2 @CAPS3? Over the internet, you can search up unlimited amounts of information. Whether it's about animals, sports, or a report to do on @LOCATION3, where do you go to find easy - to - read information instantly? Search it up on @ORGANIZATION1 or @ORGANIZATION2. You never know what you might find out. There are new additions daily. Without computers, how would you download music to an @NUM1? You can't; you have to use a computer. Computers benefit a lot of other electronic equipment. You can download videos, print out photographs, and charge @CAPS4 and other electronics. Technology these days is impressive. It gave birth to the much - used computer. Computers have a large positive effect on our lifestyle. Contact with others around the @CAPS1 is now easier than ever. Information can be found instantly. And with computers, other electronics can function as well. All in all, computers have become an indispensable part of our lives.
1465	1469	1	3	"Dear @LOCATION1, @CAPS1, do you believe people spend way too much time on computers? In a survey, @PERCENT1 out of @NUM1 of people would rather go on the computer than take a walk in the park. People who spend a lot of time on computers are lacking important things. For instance, they spend so much time on the computer that they have little time to exercise, enjoy nature, and interact with friends and family. Computers have a negative effect on people. Many people don't exercise for even @NUM2 min. But when you're distracted by your computer, gaming or using Facebook, you forget to exercise or only do it for @NUM3 min because you want to get back to the computer. The computer on your desk is tempting you to go on it, while the yoga mat or weights on the ground are also ""staring"" at you. However, the computer seems more fun and less worrisome. Therefore, you're more willing to go on the computer than exercise. Computers make it hard to exercise because you're less focused on doing it right and more preoccupied with a computer game, Facebook, email, and a bunch of other things on the computer. So, computers are unhealthy for people to have. Nature is beautiful. The trees sway in the wind, butterflies fly in the air, and there are all types of seasons with beautiful scenery. However, all some people see when they're on the computer all the time is a stuffy room with shelves, a desk, and some pictures. People are missing out on enjoying the little and big beauties of nature. People glued to the computer aren't walking on the beach, taking a nice long hike in the woods, or taking a stroll in a park. They're missing out on getting some fresh air and seeing the scenery that nature has to offer us. Instead, they're sitting in a chair staring at a computer screen. How can that be as pretty as enjoying the beauty of nature? Computers are taking away people's ability to enjoy nature. Hanging out with friends and family is a fun thing to do, but how are you supposed to do that if you're glued to the computer? They're not going to meet their friends or family on the internet. This could affect their future. They could grow up sad and lonely and not know how to act around people when they get a job that involves working with others. The people who are addicted to the computer are missing out on doing something fun with people they love or enjoy being around. Computers can keep people far away from their friends. Instead of just messaging, they could call that friend. Their friends probably would rather hear their voice than read a message. So, computers interfere with relationships with friends and family. Now, that you know how badly computers affect people, you can understand why I'm against them. They cut into people's time for exercise, prevent people from enjoying nature, and stop people from hanging out with friends and families. So, hopefully, you can see what a bad effect computers have on people."
1466	1470	1	3	Dear local newspaper, Do you like a place where you can control what you watch and where you go? I know I do. Well, if you agree with me then the computer is your cup of tea. I think that computers have a positive effect on society. I think this for three main reasons: Communicating with others, getting constant updates on what's going on, and being a learning tool make up only some of the fascinating aspects the computer has. So read on. I know you will think the same way as me about computers given my knowledge below. The computer captures over 2 billion humans' attention with online social networks. Facebook, MySpace, and Twitter are the main attractions. In all of these websites, you can keep up with what's going on with your friends and what's new around the world. These online social networks connect you and the people in your life to a crazy online adventure. All these websites provide the information that people want and keep them logging back on every day. I think these websites are great and can only improve society. This is my first benefit of a computer. Another aspect that the computer provides is world news and big events and drama that is happening in our society. Many news channels have their own websites and update what happened on their show. They provide pictures, stories, and actual videos of what's happening right now. The computer helps us Americans know what is happening in Europe and lets Europe know what's happening in the United States and the rest of the world. It isn't the only ones though. The computer provides international news and gossip for everyone. Here is another reason why the computer is great for society. There are many things that us kids don't know and if we need some deep information we search it on the computer. The computer provides websites giving information on every topic you could think of. For example, if I were to be stuck on some science homework I could probably type in my question on Ask.com and get a great answer. Parents and teachers want their kids to succeed and the computer definitely helps. In conclusion, I have given you three great, well - thought - out reasons why the computer benefits society. Communicating with others, updates worldwide, and information on school all are in a great piece of technology called the computer. I hope you will trust me that the computer has a positive effect on society.
1467	1471	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I think that computers definitely help our society for many reasons. For example, we can talk to friends online. Not only that, but then you can learn a lot more about the places you want to visit. It's also true that you can gain more hand - eye coordination with those nifty devices. Read on to find out how you can talk to friends on the computer. You can talk to friends on the computer via one of the most common websites, Facebook. Over 2 billion people use Facebook, that's 30%! Not only that, but you can also meet new friends on the computer by talking about games or popular TV shows. Wouldn't it be nice to meet up with all of your old friends from school that you don't ever see? My mom always says that that is how she stays close to her friends and that is the same with me. Do you want to learn about the far - away places without breaking the bank? If you do, then you should definitely search for some nice websites that explain culture and other details about other parts of the world. It's also true that you can learn a quick history lesson on some webpages. What if you are going on a trip but you don't know where to go? Then you could use the beloved internet. Read on to find out how the internet helps gain hand - eye coordination. You can gain hand - eye coordination by using the computer in so many ways. For example, you can practice typing up essays and other work projects. 80% of people that have computers type faster than they write. That's almost everyone. Not only that, but don't you think typing is faster than writing? Also, you see the words that you are typing and you press with your hands. Thank you for reading my essay on why computers are benefiting our society. Just remember, we learn more every day from the computers. Also, you can talk to friends. Lastly, you can plan your trip. In conclusion, computers offer multiple benefits that enhance our daily lives in various ways.
1468	1472	1	3	Dear Editor, The computers that are being used do have a positive effect on people. For example, there's better communication with friends and family. You can get instant news on any topic, and you can receive advanced education. Imagine if an important business was trying to be in contact with you by cell phone, but you missed the call. No worries, the person can now contact you by a simple email. Computers are also a positive effect because if you have a Facebook, or other interacting websites, you know what's going on in your friends' life all the time without having to reach them all the time to see how they are doing. Every adult watches the news at night before they go to bed to see what has happened. What if you went to bed early? How would you know what happened? That's when you would go online and check what you missed. You could've missed out on what happened in Asia and Africa, or missed out on the wars in the Middle East, or even tragedies that happened right near you. Not only will you have better communication and the news at your fingertips, but you will also have advanced education. If a student is doing a science project, but the work doesn't contain all the information needed. The internet is a way to expand education. Also, there are online courses and various more resources. Therefore, computers do have a positive effect on people. You can stay communicated, updated with the latest news, and have an advanced education, making them an invaluable part of our lives.
1469	1473	1	3	Dear local newspaper, This paper is going to be about the reasons computers are bad. First, computers are bad because people wouldn't have time to enjoy the nature when it's nice and warm out. Instead of going for a walk in the park or having a picnic by the lake, they are glued to their computer screens. The second reason is that they won't spend time with their families at all or their friends. The only time they would get off the computer is to pay the bill and buy a game for the computer. They become so engrossed in the virtual world that they neglect the real - life relationships around them. The third reason is that how are they going to get a job? They wouldn't want to get up to look for a job because they are having too much fun until they cut off the light. Then they would do dumb things to pay their bill so they can start to play again, and that's going to make them do it over and over again. That's why it's bad to have a computer. But now, where are people going to go in life? Some people love to play games on the computer and some don't. That's why some computers are bad for some people. And this is just my opinion. There are a lot more people who might think so too. And thank you for having the time to read this. In conclusion, while computers have their uses, their negative impacts on people's lives in terms of social interaction, real - world experiences, and career prospects cannot be ignored.
1470	1474	1	3	The reason why I think computers are good is because people like to do their work efficiently, or children like the educational and entertaining games on the computers. The second reason is that adults like to do their jobs online, which offers flexibility and convenience. They can work from home, saving time on commuting. Finally, people who have computers are probably happy because a computer is a good thing to have because you can do everything on it. My opinion is that computers are good for people because you can do everything like play games, go on MySpace, Facebook, Twitter, and a lot of other websites. You can connect with people from all over the world, learn new things, and be entertained. In conclusion, computers bring numerous benefits to people of all ages, enhancing work, play, and social experiences.
1471	1475	1	3	It is my opinion that computers are not completely bad for people; in fact, computers can also be quite beneficial for people. For example, computers allow people to communicate within seconds. From around the world, and computers open up new information to anyone with access. But a major concern is that some people spend so much time on the computer that they don't get any exercise. Firstly, computers are a good thing because they enable news and information to reach the whole world in seconds. Very recently, during the war in the @LOCATION1, news reporters were not allowed into towns and cities where battles were being fought. Every day, social messaging sites like @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 brought news to the world through cell phone videos and pictures that wouldn't have been seen by the world had it not been for computers and the internet. Secondly, computers allow people to gain knowledge in a matter of minutes on various topics. For example, if you need information on a particular country, you can find it with a computer. If you need a recipe for an @CAPS3 desert, look it up with a computer. If you would like to know what the weather will be like, you can look it up with a computer. With a computer, the knowledge of the world can be accessed by anyone. Lastly, the leading argument against is that people don't get enough exercise because they are always on the computer. Those against heavy computer use say that people will become so attached to their computer that it will affect their lives. However, these arguments can be countered as the overwhelming majority of heavy computer users do get enough exercise. A recent statistic shows that among internet users with an average grade of A or better, who also do at least a certain amount of physical activity. With this information, the argument loses some of its weight. In conclusion, computers are not completely good or completely bad for society. Their strong points are communication and the ability to gain knowledge quickly. The main downside is that a minority of computer users don't get enough exercise. It is my opinion that computers are good for society, and the benefits definitely outweigh the drawbacks.
1472	1476	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, I am aware that more people use computers every day. I think that computers do have a positive effect on adults and their children. Computers help us by providing information about things in other countries, states, and towns. It also can assist children with school homework. The last thing is that it helps you communicate with friends and family members who live at a far - off distance where you can't easily see them. Computers offer information about the latest and most recent things that happen in other towns, countries, and states. If you needed to find out something that happened about @NUM1 years ago or more, you wouldn't easily see it on @CAPS1.V., but you would be able to find it on the internet. Without the internet, you wouldn't find the things you were looking for. Another thing that computers are very useful for is helping kids with homework and school work. If your work is typed, then your work is neater and more understandable. I can understand why some parents wouldn't want their kids on the computer doing homework. They might start doing something else or get answers for something they can do without the computer. But using the computer with homework and school work will make it possible for you to make sure your work is correct. Last, computers can help you connect with friends and family members. If you have friends and family that you want to reconnect with, the computer can help you find information about where they are located. That may not be good for people who are trying to stalk or abuse someone. But in other cases, like being united with family, it can be very helpful. This can make families keep in touch and friends stay close. What are some of your feelings about computers? Some people may dislike them but they have good reasons why. More family time can be important, but I think you can make time for the computer and other things like family time and exercising. Well, my time is up here. I hope you liked what I said here and you'll develop a passion for computers.
1473	1477	1	3	I believe that computers have a lot of effects on people, for example, on their eyes, their body, and their mind. First, your eyes. If you sit next to the computer too close, your eyes get affected by the computer screen, and you may lose your eyesight over time. Then you wouldn't be able to see or read or do a lot of fun stuff as you'd like. It depends on whether you want to sit near the computer or not. Second, your body. If you sit on the computer for a whole day and not exercise, you will gain weight. In other words, your body will become fat, and you will not be able to run and do a lot of physical activities. So, it's a question of whether you just sit on the computer for the whole day or not. Third, your mind. If you watch a video or play a new game on your computer, your mind will only be thinking about doing that. Then when you go to school, you will only be thinking about that and you will forget everything you wanted to do because of that. Finally, I am telling everyone to not spend too much time on the computer. Instead, engage in exercising and other fun activities while also focusing on your school work and doing homework. I want everyone to have a good life by maintaining a balance between computer use and other aspects of life.
1474	1478	1	3	"Dear local newspaper, have computers ever hurt anyone? I believe the effects of computers on people are positive ones. For one, computers let people talk and socialize, even if they are on different sides of the planet. Another effect they have is enabling people to work faster in businesses and other jobs that require mathematics. Lastly, computers allow people to see far - away places and learn about almost anything with a click of a button. Because of the internet, people across the globe can talk to each other as if they were neighbors. Let's say a friend or family member had to move to another country or state. They could be apart for months or even years. They would miss each other constantly. But with computers, they can talk to each other like they were still neighbors, sharing daily experiences and feelings. Computers also have some more ""practical"" uses. They make it easier to monitor their stocks, their income, and even see sale trends. Let's say you needed to make a change to the price of your goods but your car broke down and the location with the incorrect price was miles away. You would almost have to wait for a mechanic or run for miles to get to a phone. But with a computer, you wouldn't need to do any of that. Just log on and change the price from the comfort of your own home. There are also educational purposes for computers. Computers let you travel the world without taking a step. You could take a virtual trip through the safari and observe wild animals in their natural habitat or go on an adventure in the rain forest and learn about its unique ecosystem. You could take in the beauty of the great plains or watch the ever - changing sands of the Sahara desert. You could learn about the Greeks, Archimedes, ancient Egypt, or even Pac - Man. With a computer, the world is your oyster. That is why I see computers as a positively amazing thing. Because they let us do things our minds usually can't, because they allow people to traverse the world in seconds, and because they allow people oceans away to talk together. So think, are computers really harmful? The answer is clearly no, as their positive impacts far outweigh any potential drawbacks."
1475	1479	1	3	My opinion is that computers should be used for many different purposes. One reason is chatting online with friends and family. Another reason is that if you are going far away and you know someone who can give you directions to where you are going, then you can chat with them as they give you detailed directions to where you're heading. Another reason is if you have family that does not live with you and you can't go and see them, then you can chat with them regularly to stay in touch. Another reason is that if you're going somewhere and you don't know the weather for the next day, then you can go online and find out what the weather will be like for that day. Also, if people really want to exercise, then they can go on their computer and go to YouTube and do exercise routines from their computer. Also, if you want to see the @CAPS1, then you can search it on your computer to see what's going on. Lastly, if you don't think it's right for people to have computers, then you should try to get one to see how much stuff you can do with it. You will be amazed at the wide range of activities and information available. This is my reason why people should have computers to enjoy while chatting, watching @CAPS1 and many other things that you probably can't imagine. Also, maybe kids should not have unrestricted access to computers, but they can get one when they get older and are more responsible. Also, if kids need to search for school - related information, then they can also do that. There are many reasons why people should get computers. That's my opinion about why people should have computers, as they offer so many useful functions and opportunities for both entertainment and learning.
1476	1480	1	3	"Dear Local Newspaper, I am here to tell you the negative effect on people because of computer usage. How would you react if you found yourself with no time to exercise, enjoy the beautiful nature, or spend quality time with your beloved family and friends? Well, some people don't notice that they are losing the time to do these wonderful things due to excessive computer use. No time to exercise? What does that mean? I can see these questions swirling through the minds of great people. No time to exercise means exactly what it sounds like. Since people every day are mindlessly wasting their precious time on the computer, whether it's playing addictive games or chatting aimlessly with people, etc., they don't get to do what they really want to do, which is, most of the time, exercise. What about nature? Are you a person who loves to enjoy the tranquility of nature? I know I do. Since time flies by quickly when people are engrossed in the computer, which sometimes they don't even realize, they would probably be thinking, ""I never got to go outside and take a leisurely walk through the forest and enjoy the serenity of nature."" Well, they'll say they'll do that sometimes, but the truth is when people say stuff like that, it doesn't help to motivate themselves. It's basically saying, ""I'll go for a nature walk tomorrow, and if that doesn't happen, I'll just have to do it the next day."" Odds are that the person saying that won't actually go for a walk. They will think it's going to be okay and just keep postponing it. What ever happened to spending time with family and friends? Oh, I know, I know. All of the precious family and friend time has been wasted on being glued to the computer. People don't realize that since their time is being squandered on the computer, they don't even have time to sit down and have a heart - to - heart talk with their family, have fun together, or go out with friends to catch a movie or something. As you have heard, more and more people are using computers, which I believe has a negative effect on them because they don't have time for exercising, enjoying nature, talking with family and friends, etc. All of the time being spent on the computer is replacing the time for these important aspects of life, and it's not a good thing. Computers have a negative effect on people, and I say we should find a way to cut down computer time to lead a more balanced and fulfilling life."
1477	1481	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper Editor, I wholeheartedly support having computers because they bring numerous benefits to our society. They are a powerful tool that helps us learn about countries around the world and stay informed about what's going on globally. For example, if you're curious about a particular country's sports scene, you can simply type in its name on the computer, and a wealth of information will be at your fingertips. Also, a computer can be an invaluable asset for your education. If you're working on a challenging homework assignment and need some extra help, you can quickly turn to the computer for assistance. It is also extremely beneficial because students can have lots of fun playing games on the computer. Say it's a cold, rainy day, and there's nothing much to do outdoors. A kid can find great entertainment by going on the computer. It is also an excellent way to communicate with your friends. For instance, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and email are all great sources of communication. Also, if you have an Xbox or a PlayStation, you need a computer to hook up a card so you can play online with your friends. It's highly advantageous to have computers in school. If teachers want students to explore a specific website to learn something new, it is a very helpful resource. It is also a great asset because in school, if you're working on a big, important project, a computer can assist you in completing it efficiently. I hope these are all good reasons to have computers in our society, and they will benefit us in a number of different ways, making our lives more convenient, educational, and enjoyable.
1478	1482	1	3	More people tend to use computers more than going outside to enjoy the pleasant weather, and I firmly believe that people should spend less time on the computer and more time interacting with others. People spend most of their time chatting with people on various websites or playing online games. I think that it's a bad habit. People of all ages waste their time doing this when they could be doing something truly fun, but they choose not to. Parents should be responsible for their children spending all day on the computer and should closely watch what they are doing because it can be extremely dangerous. There have been many cases where people have been harmed. Some have even been raped through interactions on dangerous websites such as Omegle, Chatroulette, and many other similar platforms. Moreover, children and adults often talk to strangers on the internet and think they know these people well. They might arrange to meet them somewhere and end up getting killed or facing other serious consequences because many people lie about their age. You never know; that person could be a fifty - year - old man or woman pretending to be a teen. That is why parents should not let their children use the computer for an unlimited period of time and should set appropriate limits. While you're reading this, I hope you understand why it's wrong to overuse the computer and take my suggestion seriously. By doing so, you can help us young kids have a safer and more fulfilling life. Thank you.
1479	1483	1	3	To: [Recipient's Name] this letter concerns, Computers have become an integral part of our daily life. You can engage in a wide variety of activities on them, such as playing exciting games, watching interesting videos, searching the vast web for information, and even communicating with people from all corners of the world. They are extremely useful for students who go to school because you can easily complete and save your schoolwork on them. Sure, maybe some people are overly addicted to the computer, but others use it only when they really need to. Computers have a massive impact on some people's lives. Sitting around on the computer all day can have harmful effects on one's health, but it can also be highly informative in many ways. One of the informative aspects is that every time you log on to the computer, you have the opportunity to learn new and interesting information. Whether it's about history, science, or the latest news, the computer can be a great source of knowledge. That is why I firmly believe that the computer has a great effect on people, as it combines both entertainment and educational value, making it an important tool in our modern world.
1480	1484	1	3	"Over 80% of the Newtown citizens own at least one computer in their house. Computers bring significant benefits to society because they are not only helpful to the earth but also a fast way to spread crucial information. Also, you can have meaningful conversations with friends and family on computers. We have been informed that some people think we're spending too much time on the computer. Yes, there might be some truth to that, but we actually need these machines to survive in this modern age. News Channel 5 took a poll and reported that ""more than half of Newtown schools are now using computers to assign homework to save paper."" If we start using computers to do things that we usually use paper for, we would be saving millions of trees. For example, you can send an email instead of traditional snail mail. The email would reach its destination much faster and save a large amount of paper! People who care about the earth create websites on the computer to inform others about how to protect the environment. If friends just want to see each other, they could use the computer to video - chat and talk all they want. Also, if you like to use your cellphone a lot, the electromagnetic waves it emits kill approximately 100,000 bees a year. If you chatted with your friends on the computer instead, it would save the lives of these precious bees. On the first snow day, my parents forgot to check the school's website, and I was out in the snow. If we didn't have computers, this kind of situation would happen to every little student on a snow day. Also, if there was a storm, the computer is another place you can check to get the weather forecast and keep your family safe. If there was a hurricane and the power went out, your computer can still be a source of important information. For events like birthdays and weddings, your computer has a calendar on it that reminds you whenever you write something down. Newtown citizens spend over $500 a year on phone bills. You can talk to friends and family on the computer and save thousands of dollars. When parents don't have phones, they rely on computers to communicate with others. Have your kids ever had a friend who moved away, and they spend hours trying to reach them? Well, they can talk and see each other while on video chat, and it will feel like the friend is still right there. It's now or never, citizens of Newtown! You know that computers help the earth, are a fast way to spread information, and let you talk and see your friends online. So get up and write to our local newspaper, clearly stating why computers benefit our society and how they make our lives better in so many ways."
1481	1485	1	3	Dear local newspaper, did you know that just about @PERCENT1 of the people in the @LOCATION1 have computers and use them daily? I am one of those people and I don't get how people are saying that computers are destroying our country. Yeah, I know that we spend a little less time with family and friends, but computers help us monitor weather and natural disasters like tornadoes and hurricanes. They give us a chance to see far - away places and learn more about the world, and we can talk with other people. Computers are very important in our world because we can monitor natural @CAPS1 such as tornados, hurricanes, and earthquakes. Without this technology, over @PERCENT2 more people will die from these @CAPS1 without computers because they will have less or no warning about the situation. Over @PERCENT3 of kids in the @CAPS2.S go to school, and with computers, the kids get a better chance to learn about the world and society. Kids should know what is going on in the world, or you could be an adult just browsing the web looking for information. My point is tons of people all around the world use computers to learn. My last reason is to teach kids to type and to have hand - eye coordination. When kids get older and when we get @CAPS3, they are gonna need to learn how to type. So odds are if you don't know how to type, you won't get very far in the real world. To conclude my statement, I'm gonna go over my three reasons why we need computers. First, to track natural disasters. Second, to learn about far - away places and our society. Third, to teach children hand - eye coordination and to type so they can get @CAPS3. This is why the @CAPS2.S really needs computers.
1482	1486	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I understand that more and more people use computers, and that can have a good side and a bad one. Do you go on the computer for hours every day? Spending long hours glued to the screen could be bad. I believe computers are a good thing, but only if they are used properly. Hopefully when I'm done, you'll see where I'm coming from on this matter. Everyone is on the computer these days. The problem is, many people are on way too much. They say they are working on hand - eye coordination, but in reality, they are wasting away their lives sitting on a chair. They do not communicate as much with the rest of the household, and that does not make a big, happy family. They say they are getting important information, but in truth, they might just be getting false information and viruses. Bad people are out there, and one might hack into your computer and ruin your day. Things like @CAPS4 @CAPS5 and @CAPS6 could have people that want to find out all about you so they can hurt you. Yes, being on the computer definitely has a bad side. But there is a good side as well. That is, as long as you are not on too much. It does improve hand - eye coordination, if you play the right games. And it can teach you things, too. Many websites have true information about places or things so you don't need to see it to know about it. You can be helpful. It is also an easy way to purchase items. You can just order them online. Most importantly, you can have fun. So, what is your side on this argument? Do you think way too many people are on the computer? Or do you think computers can be great, as long as you're careful? I, for one, pick the latter one. What about you?
1483	1487	1	3	Studies show that @PERCENT1 of people that are addicted to computers are not fit and don't play sports. I have a computer at home and I know how much fun it is talking to your friends on @CAPS1 or whatever platform you talk to your friends on. If you're not fit and don't enjoy the beauty of nature, you will not know how to live a good life. I'm not saying that you won't get anywhere in life, but it won't be very interesting. I play lots of sports and I love them all. I am fit and yes, I do like going on @CAPS1 and chatting with my friends, but that's not as important as breathing fresh air and playing sports with your friends. Yes, the computer has all different kinds of bad stuff and good stuff. I mean you could learn about far - away places without going there, but then what would be the fun of that? For an example, if you go to @LOCATION1 for snowboarding, don't you feel great when you're going down that @CAPS3? I know I do instead of being home on the computer. Nature is beautiful. I am thankful to God for giving us that beauty and all animals. It makes life better, glorious. I love taking hikes with my family up a @CAPS3. That fresh air you can't get anywhere else, or even riding your @CAPS5 up a trail, the beauty of that is unbelievable, you can't find it any other place. Doctors show that @PERCENT2 of people that spend time more than @NUM1 hours a day on a computer have glasses or have a very poor vision. All those people didn't want poor vision, but because of the computer, they got that which really stinks. Now as you can see, computers really can change your life. So that's your decision. Pick wrong from right, all up to YOU. Now make it.
1484	1488	1	3	I think that computers are very valuable and help a lot of people. I think that computers should be used for information that could help students with their homework or to study for a test, and also for adults to look up things such as directions, addresses, and prices of clothes and other items. They are also good because they help you communicate with friends and help people make plans to do with friends. However, some people should limit themselves on things like Facebook and Twitter. Some people spend too much time on those things and should limit themselves to just @NUM1 minutes a day on those sites. One of the reasons I think computers are good is because some students might not know the answer to something on their homework and could use the computer to find out the answers. Another reason why computers can be very valuable to all students is because let's say a student has a quiz on mitosis and cells in science the next day and doesn't really understand it. They could use the computer to learn about it and do well on their quiz. Another reason that computers are good for people is because it helps them communicate with their friends. Some kids are only children and aren't that good at interacting with people in person. But these social networking sites help them come out of their shells and make them a little less shy and make more friends. However, like I said earlier, some people get carried away and spend too much time doing this kind of stuff and should limit themselves to just @NUM1 minutes per day on these social networking sites. Some people use their computers for other important things like buying things and getting directions and addresses. If somebody wants to go to a store in a different town but didn't know where it was, they could look up the address and then find the directions to that place. Some people also use the computer to purchase things like groceries and clothes. Sometimes people save money because they buy something online on sale rather than going to a store and paying more money. As you can see, the computer has a lot of positives. Therefore, I encourage you to support computers, because they are so useful and valuable.
1485	1489	1	3	Dear local newspaper, In my opinion, I feel like too many people spend too much time on the @ORGANIZATION1. People are getting obese because they're not getting enough exercise. Children are going on the @ORGANIZATION1 instead of doing their homework. Maybe perhaps a family member is dying, and you rather spend time on the @ORGANIZATION1 instead of with that family member. All of these things are happening because of the computers everyone is getting. This can not be true! That over @PERCENT1 of the people in New @CAPS1 say that they are putting on a lot of weight and turning obese. I asked them what they think is causing this to happen. Someone named @PERSON1 said the reason is the computers; they are taking over people's lives. The computer is the enemy of the people that it is affecting most in life. As a child, the @ORGANIZATION1 is throwing me off of my homework. I used to have only A's and B's on my report card. Right now, it has turned into @CAPS2, and the @ORGANIZATION1 is changing my life drastically but not in a good way. As you know, your child could be going through the same terrible things as me. You should start to check their homework instead of them just going on their @ORGANIZATION1 and forgetting all about their schoolwork, like I did. Try and prevent this. Imagine tears running down your face and feeling disappointed in yourself. The one you love passes away, and you did not even spend time with him or her. Once again, the thing called @ORGANIZATION1 did this. The decision that you made because of the @ORGANIZATION1 would and is going to scare you for life. We, the people that have computers, would find out that they were never made for a good purpose, just to distract what we do and how we spend time with our families and friends. Turn your head and say no to the one thing that would wreck you into little pieces. How do you feel? I feel bad because I let something so little mess up my life. You still have time to change your life and say no to the computers. They could make you turn obese because you are not getting enough exercise. The one you love could be suffering because of the @ORGANIZATION1 that you have in your house. The worst thing of all is that you were not able to spend time with the family member that you love the most. The computers that we have are ruining our lives as we know it. Just say no to the computers and live your life the best way that you could. Don't you feel bad that you let something so little ruin your life?!
1486	1490	1	3	"Dear local newspaper, The effects computers have on people are quite concerning as people rely on them excessively, and that's not good because they end up having less time for exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. First of all, having less time exercising is not good as @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people end up struggling with obesity obsessively. ""You don't want to be one of those people trust me,"" said @PERSON1. Second, enjoying nature is a great alternative to playing with a computer because while enjoying nature, you get your daily dose of fresh air. ""You also have a lot of fun,"" said @LOCATION1. Lastly, interacting with family and friends is truly enjoyable, and who doesn't love that? ""Spending time with the family is fun as you get to go to different places,"" said @PERSON3. ""Who doesn't love going out and spending time with friends on the weekends,"" said @PERSON2. Those are my reasons why the effects computers have on people are not good, and we should be more mindful of our computer usage."
1487	1491	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1 and readers of @ORGANIZATION1, the @ORGANIZATION3 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, in a modern world sent back in time to the @NUM1, you might quickly drive your car to get groceries in the present, but in such a backward time, you must ride for hours just to simply buy some milk. Entertainment becomes dull, and it is extremely hard to obtain books for learning. Ending the usage of @ORGANIZATION1 such @ORGANIZATION1 technology as computers would surely be the first step to sending us back to such a barbaric era! Computers present job opportunities, educational opportunities, and a way to communicate with others! I urge you to continue using computers, for without computers, our modern civilization would be lost! Firstly, it is important to note, during our economic crisis, that the development and manufacturing of computers creates thousands of jobs! In fact, each year @NUM2 @ORGANIZATION3 jobs are created in the @CAPS5.S alone in accordance with the development of computers! If the customers who buy these products were to stop purchasing them, these jobs would be lost, and any progress we've made in the economic crisis would surely crumble! Do you, the fair people of our nation, wish to be responsible for such a catastrophe? Recently, the @ORGANIZATION3 stated, in the cover - page article, that, ""without the development of computers in technology in @DATE2, @DATE3 more people would be without jobs in the @LOCATION4A!"" Moreover, undoubtedly many educational opportunities would be lost for your children if you were to stop using computers! Computers present the easiest way to research and gather information.

This program lets students view the interesting aspects of world cultures in videos! For your visually - oriented children, this is a much better way of learning than using books! In fact, @PERSON2, superintendent of schools in @LOCATION1, recently stated in this newspaper, the @ORGANIZATION3 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, that he planned to implement the program into all @LOCATION1 schools during the @NUM3 year! He needs the town's support to have this idea come to fruition. He recently sent out fliers to local citizens bearing the impressionable heading, ""@CAPS10."" You should support him. Finally, communication is a vital part of using computers. In fact, the internet, which can only be accessed through a computer, offers the fastest way of communication other than telephones! ""@CAPS13, @CAPS7 computer expert for @ORGANIZATION2, ""computers offer far more than the telephones! Not only can one converse through the internet, they can also webchat, exchange files and important data, and market and sell items to customers!"" If you stop using computers, you deny yourself this magnificent way of communicating! My sister lives in @LOCATION3, and as a result, I barely get to see her or even talk to her. Then, when my mom bought me a laptop, we were able to speak to each other again. She helps me through all of my personal problems, and without this way of talking with her, it would be a great loss. Now, envision a modern, civilized world. You, the parents, are heading to work while your child goes to school and enters into the wonderful learning center of computers. In @LOCATION2, your favorite sister's currently writing you an email. This fantasy is possible if you continue to use computers! They present jobs, educational opportunities, and a way of communication! You don't have to use them all the time; still enjoy nature and have fun with friends, dear readers, but do not forget computers! Computer usage will keep you in the @DATE1!"
1488	1492	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I think computers can have a bad effect on people from a really early age, starting at thirteen and continuing up through adulthood. People spend hours at a time on the computer when they could be exercising or engaging in some type of outdoor activity. Computers can make some people feel like life is being taken away from them. Spending so much time on a computer can really damage a person's posture. It is said that when some people get on a computer, a state of comfort comes over them, and they lean over with their backs bent and stay in that position for long periods of time. Imagine a person being cramped in a tight space for eight hours, and when that person gets out, feeling all their joints and muscles being stretched from that point of tension. This is what we do to our bodies when we spend excessive time on computers. We should limit our computer usage to protect our physical and mental well - being.
1489	1493	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I believe that computers do benefit society in a positive way. Without computers, we would not be able to be as social. We also would not have the ability to do research for school online, and running a business would be even more difficult. Without computers, our society would not be so far advanced. Being social is an important quality in life. The main way of being social these days, other than texting, is to chat online with friends. Facebook, @CAPS3, @CAPS4, and Skype all give their users the ability to make new friends, find long - lost friends, and chat with friends. I personally have a Skype and Facebook account, and I am able to access them every day. Without them, I wouldn't be able to chat with friends outside of school except for during sports activities and through texting. Every day, I work out and lift weights and then go on Facebook. That is why the whole statement, ""spending less time exercising and more time on the computer"" is false. Facebook and Skype are a part of my everyday life, and without them, I know I would not be as social. Computers are also a part of my everyday life because I have to use it to do research for school or type up an @CAPS5 paper. As you can see, my handwriting is not so great, so I end up typing a lot of my homework because of it. Without computers, my teachers would not be able to read my work. Computers also help with making graphs and data tables for science lab reports. Without a computer, the graphs would have to be handmade, which is not as presentable. Overall, computers are used every day in school to either do research or to type up some homework. Education plays a key role in society, and if we did not use computers, the education that we would receive would not be the same as it is now. My last reason why I believe that computers play a positive role in society is that computers are what keeps businesses running. Without computers, some businesses would be unable to function, and those that could function would be extremely slow. Since our society is so far advanced, our businesses need computers in order to complete the jobs. Expenses and income are saved on businesses' computers. If that was all done on paper, they could be lost or ruined. Computers also simplify work for businesses; they speed up the tasks that would take a long time to be done by hand and they complete the tasks that could not be achieved without a computer. Computers play a large part in the development of the world, and we should continue to embrace and utilize them."
1490	1494	1	3	Dear editor, Computers are one of the best things that have ever happened to the human race. They benefit society in every way imaginable and have numerous positive effects on people. Computers improve hand - eye coordination, allow people to learn about many subjects that books do not give them access to, and allow millions of people every day to talk and communicate with friends and family. The most important use for computers is learning. Using computers, billions of people gain knowledge that they never would have been able to learn before. Many people like myself check the weather on the computer daily, making sure we are prepared and dressed appropriately for the weather. Without computers, I would not be able to do this. Also, on days when it snows during the night, I always check the school's website when I wake up in order to ensure that school is still on. This is a helpful resource, and I don't know what I'd do without it. Another thing computers allow us to do is check the news. With the click of your mouse, you can check to see who won the presidency or what shows are on tonight. Another amazing aspect of computers is that they improve eye - hand coordination greatly. This not only benefits my mom who checks her email five times every minute but also my little three - year - old sister who loves to move the mouse around and type in random letters on documents. It could entertain her for days, but most importantly, it helps improve her eye - hand coordination every second she sits in that chair. This improved skill will help her enormously in her future when she soon begins to play sports and ride bikes. Finally, computers allow millions of friends and family to communicate daily at no cost. If classmates forgot to write down homework, they can email the teacher instantly and know exactly what the homework is and even open the sheet that the teacher attached and print it out. A couple of weeks ago, my dad went to @LOCATION1 for thirteen days, and it was outrageously expensive to talk to him on his phone. So, every couple of days, he video - chatted with me instead so I could talk to him, hear what he was doing, and even see the view of @LOCATION2 from his window. This was very special to me and could not have been done without computers. As it is so plainly clear, computers help us in so many ways that we often forget about, like educating us, improving our eye - hand coordination, and allowing us to communicate with friends and family. These are just a few of the many positive effects and benefits that computers provide us with, and we should cherish and make the most of this amazing technology.
1491	1495	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, I whole - heartedly agree with the experts. In today's digital age, people are spending an excessive amount of time glued to their computers. Instead of being active, reading a great book, or having quality time with friends and family, they are sitting idle in front of the screen. People are unfortunately quite lazy as they find it easier to just sit and engage in computer - related activities. If they don't break this habit and start doing other things, they are at a high risk of becoming overweight. My first reason why people should cut down on their online time is the need for exercise. Seriously, individuals should take a refreshing walk around the neighborhood, go to the well - equipped gym, or play an exciting sport. In contrast, spending all day on the computer doing nothing but clicking and scrolling will surely lead to weight gain and a lazy lifestyle. My second reason is about the importance of social connections. You should be spending time with your loved ones, not ignoring them because you're engrossed in something on the computer. It's extremely rude to neglect your family and friends. Why not plan a fun family game night, go out to a nice restaurant with your family, or have an outing with your friends like watching a movie, going skating, or visiting the park? These activities are far more enjoyable than being online all day. My last reason is the benefits of reading. Everyone should set aside some time to read a good book. Simply walk to your local library, browse through the shelves, and check out an interesting book. Reading is much better for your brain than engaging in mindless activities on the computer. In conclusion, I firmly believe that people should spend less time online. Lack of exercise can make you overweight and lazy, ignoring friends and family is impolite, and reading is highly beneficial. So, let's all make a conscious effort to reduce our online time and lead a more balanced life.
1492	1496	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1, humanity, as we know it, has its fair share of ups and downs, along with positives and negatives. The same can be said about technology. It has its advantages and disadvantages, but thanks to it, our society is progressing at an increasingly rapid pace. Technology offers us the opportunity to become more sophisticated and set our goals at a level that was once unreachable. With these technological advancements, we can initiate great things. Computers, for instance, are excellent teaching tools and can sometimes act as our guides. You can click on a link, and it might open up an amazing opportunity for you. However, clicking on the wrong link could expose your device to a virus. Computers can also serve as a stress - reliever. They can transport you to a beautiful virtual place and give you the chance to learn about things that you never even knew existed. In conclusion, despite its flaws, technology, especially computers, has significantly contributed to the growth and development of our society, and we should make the most of its positive aspects while being cautious of its negatives.
1493	1497	1	3	"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, Are you aware that more than @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2 families own a computer? Maybe you are, but were you informed that at least half of that @PERCENT1 face family - related issues? The question at hand is whether computers have a positive or negative effect on mankind. In my opinion, I feel that this invention is having a negative impact on society. Nowadays, there are numerous inappropriate websites that children should never view, and computers take away precious time that could be spent with family. But the main reason is the recent @CAPS3 issue. Without a doubt, young people are quite tech - savvy. Sometimes, even if we don't intentionally look for a particular website, we might stumble upon it by accident. There are countless adult websites that children as young as @DATE1 log on to every day. This is completely unacceptable and is one of the reasons why there should be more restrictions on computer use. No responsible parent would want their @NUM1 - year - old child on an adult website, and computers make it difficult for parents to prevent such situations. In my own experience, computers take away time from family. When my family member @CAPS4 had a computer, she was always on it. We never spent time together. She once said, ""If I never got on the computer, you would be right here with me."" She was absolutely right. Whenever my brother and I got on the computer, we would stay in the room all day. But since we've reduced our computer time, we've been spending more time together, and I've realized that computers have a negative effect on society, mainly because of the recent @CAPS3 issue. I was called to the office one day and informed that a group on @CAPS3 com had befriended me and was involved in using boys and girls for drugs and prostitution. People take advantage of computers and access others' personal information. This situation could have been prevented, but it wasn't. Now, it's your turn to take a stand. I hope you will share my view on the negatives and positives of computers. Remember, computers host many websites that are harmful to young kids, they take away family time, and the recent @CAPS3 issue is a clear indication of their negative impact. In conclusion, we need to be more vigilant about computer use to protect our children and strengthen our family bonds."
1494	1498	1	3	Dear Newspaper editor, I would like to share my thoughts about the benefits of owning a computer. For example, computers allow you to learn a vast array of things that you might never have been able to learn otherwise. You can also join chat rooms and have conversations with friends or other people from all over the world. Moreover, computers have made teaching more effective. In many countries, computers are a standard part of education, and they are used to learn a wide range of subjects. If you take a computer to the tribes in @LOCATION1, it might seem like an alien object at first. But once they learn how to use it, it can open up a whole new world for them. Many people in remote tribes and areas are unaware of significant events like a man landing on the moon. Another great advantage of computers is that you can pay various bills such as taxes, insurance, credit card bills, and other payments online. This is extremely convenient, especially if you can't leave your house or if the payment centers are closed. It also helps you avoid late fees and can save you a large amount of money in the long run. Many people use the computer for socializing. They join online platforms like @CAPS1, Twitter, and MySpace, where they can talk, view pictures, and keep up with what their friends are doing. On @CAPS2, you can also send private messages to your friends. Additionally, computers are a great source of entertainment. Many people play games on the computer, some of which are single - player games, while others are online games with millions of players simultaneously. You can even connect other gaming systems to your computer and play with others. There are also hints and cheats available for some games. The most significant benefit of computers, however, is their impact on education. They have revolutionized the way we do homework. Instead of filling out a worksheet, you can go on the computer, complete your assignment, print it out, or email it to your teacher. They also make research for projects and homework much easier, more reliable, and provide a broader perspective on the topic. Teachers often use computers to teach by showing educational videos, which makes it easier for students to learn and understand things. This will surely help us be successful in the future. Many kids tend to pay less attention during a lecture, but a computer - played video can easily grasp their attention. In conclusion, I firmly believe that the computer is an excellent invention, and every family and school should own one. I hope you will find my points persuasive and publish my thoughts.
1495	1499	1	3	"Dear @PERSON2, @CAPS1, your latest article on the pros and cons of computers in our society was quite informative. However, I believe you overlooked a few major reasons why technology, especially computers, is doing more harm than good. If people don't become aware of the consequences, it's hard to predict where our world is heading. First off, I'd like to highlight the health issues associated with technology, particularly computers. Dr. @PERSON1 of @ORGANIZATION2 states that ""@CAPS2 since the popularity of the internet soared with the emergence of websites like '@CAPS3' and '@CAPS4', we've witnessed a significant increase in obesity - related heart disease and diabetes."" And @PERSON3 isn't exaggerating. Due to the sudden boom in electronics, more and more people prefer to sit on the couch with their brand - new laptop or @CAPS5 rather than go for a bike ride or play a game of fastball with friends. This sedentary lifestyle has led to more people becoming victims of heart attacks, strokes, cancer, and bone - related problems that could leave them paralyzed for life. Is playing that online game really worth sacrificing your health? Next, I want to discuss the social aspect. Although the internet may seem like a great place to socialize, it can actually lead to the loss of real - life friendships. I know what you're thinking, @PERSON2, 'But sites like '@CAPS6' help people connect, so why would they lose friends?' Well, the truth is, since it's so easy to type in a conversation online, people are losing their actual social skills. They spend too much time chatting with friends without meeting them face - to - face, which eventually causes the relationship to fade. It's also difficult to determine if you have a real friendship when communicating through a screen. @PERSON4, a @NUM1 - year - old at @ORGANIZATION1, says that he and his best friend now only talk over @CAPS3, and they no longer feel like true friends. So, finally, I have a request. The next time you turn on your laptop, think about whether it's really worth losing your friends and your health. Instead of updating your status with something like '@CAPS8 got home,' pick up the phone and call a friend to go hang out at the park. Trust me, you'll be much happier. Thank you for taking the time to read my letter. In conclusion, we need to be more mindful of our computer use to protect our health and maintain meaningful relationships."
1496	1500	1	3	Dear local Newspaper editor, More and more people are using computers, but not everyone thinks that is such a good idea. Those who support advances in technology firmly believe that computers have a profoundly positive effect on people. Other experts, however, hold a different view. I wholeheartedly think that computers do have a positive effect on people because they allow you to effortlessly learn about anything all over the world, they enable you to talk online with other people in real - time, and they teach hand - eye coordination effectively. I truly believe that computers are very helpful. Don't you love having the wonderful opportunity to research anything from any part of the world that you want to learn about? I'm absolutely sure that everyone who has a computer does. With computers, you can conveniently use well - known search engines like Google, Yahoo, Ask, and so many more. I know that computers help me with research all the time when I do projects or write papers for school. The internet is a great, reliable source that you can turn to when researching a topic for school or even just looking for an answer to a simple question. My next reason is that computers let you talk to other people online. Platforms like Facebook, email, MySpace, and web - caming all let you communicate with people anywhere in the world. For example, I have an aunt that lives in @LOCATION1, and on Christmas, me and my family used my cousin's webcam to see her and talk to her when we couldn't be with her on that special holiday. Also, things like Facebook and MySpace let you put up pictures and chat with friends and family all over the world. My last reason why I think computers have a positive effect on people is that playing on the computer is a good leisure - time activity. There are all kinds of fun games you can play, and some even let you compete with other people around the world. For example, internet checkers is a game that lets you compete against someone else. There are so many websites that let you pick games you want to play out of a huge selection. It's obvious that computers have a positive effect on people for research, talking to friends & family, and leisure activities. I sincerely hope you agree with me!
1497	1501	1	3	Do you think that computers are good? Well, I definitely do. There are many solid reasons why I and you should think this. For example, it has a positive effect on people, it teaches hand - eye coordination in an engaging way, and it allows people to talk online with other people easily. One reason why you should think that computers are good is that it has a positive effect on people!! Don't you want to be happy? Well, then, computers are your online fun source!! And you can learn a great deal from computers!! Another reason is that the computers teach hand - eye coordination. Hand - eye coordination is an excellent and essential skill that you need in life. For example, let's say that you want to play baseball, and you have no hand - eye coordination. On @DATE1, you trip and you break something. That isn't good for you, is it? No, it is not good. But, if you had better hand - eye coordination, then you probably wouldn't have fallen! The @NUM1 reason is that you can interact with others online. You can @CAPS1, you can go on interesting chat rooms. Or you can go on gaming platforms and interact with other people!! And, you can even try online dating! The computer is a great way to meet new people that share the same characteristics as you!! If you already have a computer, then you're fine. But, if you don't, then you need to get one. And I am right!! People that don't have a computer often have no job because people with jobs most of the time use or have a computer. In conclusion, you need to get a computer!! Why? Well, that's because you can do a lot of stuff on a computer. For example, you can improve hand - eye coordination, and you can chat with online friends. Also, it gives you a positive effect, making your life more fulfilling.
1498	1502	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I believe that with excessive use of the computer, it will have bad effects on people. People can get addicted to it so easily. They also consume a large amount of electricity. And people sit on the computer all day and don't exercise at all. These are all bad effects computers have, but they're not all bad; without them, life might be a little harder. Playing computer games and online poker sounds fun right? Wrong! People get addicted to them every single day. Online poker could be extremely dangerous. I remember seeing a show about this guy who was addicted to it. He'd carelessly put his credit card information in and sit and play all day. Before he knew it, he was in deep debt. Once he was addicted, it was very hard for him to stop. It's a foolish thing to get into because there is no real point to it. You sit and waste money, especially with our economy in its current state. A recent study shows that @PERCENT1 of people who play online poker are addicted within two weeks. Other games are also highly addicting. There's a website that is literally called “addicting”. I guess people don't fully realize the effects of being addicted to a computer on them and their family. Did you know that @PERCENT2 of electricity in @LOCATION1 goes to computers? That's almost half of it going to one thing. I don't think it's right that pretty much everything is done on the computer now. In our economic crisis, I don't think energy should be wasted playing computer games. We could use energy for more important things that people actually need. If everyone didn't rely so much on computers to communicate and do everything, there wouldn't be a problem. The number of computers sold has gone up @PERCENT3 since @DATE1. I understand emailing and using Facebook. But don't go overboard with it. Isn't being outside on a beautiful day great? Wouldn't you rather enjoy that or exercise rather than sitting glued to a computer? Obesity is a huge problem in @LOCATION1. A lot of people are obese from sitting on the computer and not exercising. I remember when I was younger, every time I went to my friend's house, his dad would be sitting and playing poker and games on the computer. He was very out of shape and lazy. His parents later got a divorce because he turned into a totally different person. Most @CAPS1 are lazy. We don't like to do work if we don't have to. I'm sure they'd rather exercise or go outside instead of being on the computer. You live a lot healthier when you're not addicted to the computer. And when you're healthier, you're happier. So in conclusion, if you don't control yourself on the computer, it can have bad effects. Computers are easy to get addicted to, use a lot of electricity, and can make people fat and lazy. Do you really think playing computer games is worth losing friends and family?
1499	1503	1	3	"Dear newspaper editor, I think we should have internet, or computers at our houses. We should have it because we can chat with our friends and family conveniently, no one would get bored doing nothing, and we can learn new things from different websites. We should be able to communicate to our friends and family. @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people in our school think having a computer is good. For example, my friend moved to @LOCATION1. We couldn't talk on the phone because it was long - distance. But I talk to her over Facebook. There are a lot of popular websites you can talk on like Facebook, Twitter, or even MySpace. You can even use Skype. Skype is when you have a webcam and you talk through it. My mom said that most of her friends chat online with her. It doesn't matter how old you are. Anyone can learn important things. There are a lot of educational websites. @PERCENT1 of the things on the computer are worth having. If you are old and you can't go to school, just go to Google and type any math term, science concept, @CAPS1, or even learning a new language. Every time I have to do my social studies homework, I go online. Trust me, it's really helpful. Some things on the computer are very fun. You won't get bored with the type of games they have. A lot of parents complain that their children are doing bad things in the streets. They do these kinds of things because they are bored. @NUM3 people think that statement is true. If they had a computer, and were playing games or talking to friends, they wouldn't be like that. @STATE1 and @PERSON1 are two states that have more people that go on the computer than any other states. Remember, it's not only fun. Everyone enjoys having a computer. I think we should have internet access because we can do a lot of things. Some people think it's bad, but not everything is. We should have a computer because we can chat with friends, we can learn important and interesting things, and we won't get bored. I hope you made up your mind and decided that all internet access is not a waste of time. I'm not the only one that thinks that ""a computer is what keeps us alive"". It truly enriches our lives in so many ways."
1500	1504	1	3	When people think about computers, the first thing they think of is games. That's not all they are good for. For most people, they are very useful. Computers are great for @ORGANIZATION1. At @ORGANIZATION1, they assist with homework and projects in an efficient manner. When we are assigned a project, we need to do research on a topic, and the fastest and easiest way is by computer. The students at @ORGANIZATION2, especially those in @NUM1 grade, are able to type up essays quickly because it's faster and a lot easier. If we are at home and we forgot our homework, we could look it up online. This can be really helpful and convenient to students and teachers. Sometimes it's not just about @ORGANIZATION1, but also about finding things. Technology and computers have advanced a great deal. Now we can look up directions to places we don't or can't find. People can also find names, numbers, or addresses using websites like Yellow Pages, which can be a reliable resource for that. Say you're going on vacation and you're trying to find somewhere to stay. It could be tough, but there are websites you can go on where, if you want something fast or maybe a nice hotel for a low price, you can find it. The computer can be very fun and interesting when you go places like the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and you want to show pictures of the great time you had, so you can post them online. Say you haven't talked to an old friend in a while. You can look for them on @CAPS3 or another website and start talking again. You can also play games and connect with friends or play games with friends while online. Whether it's @ORGANIZATION1, finding things, or connecting with friends, the computer has whatever you need. Maybe it will at one point get damaged, but they have professionals who can fix it. Plus, if you think about it, computers have very reliable resources that are more updated than books. In conclusion, computers are an indispensable part of our lives, offering countless benefits in various aspects.
1501	1505	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @NUM1 out of @NUM2 of the students and staff members of @CAPS3 @CAPS4 school firmly find computers very important. Computers not only offer great assistance to people in school but also prove highly useful at home too. I am certain that the readers of this article will whole - heartedly agree that computers are extremely helpful. They teach us about people and things far away, and they are truly wonderful for chatting online! Most people use computers every single day! Computers are very helpful tools in everyday life. They always come with a program that, if you spell something wrong, it instantly corrects you. Computers even have websites of a dictionary where people can conveniently look up words. I know this is very helpful because my brother is writing his college essays, and there are no colleges that will be impressed by a grammatically incorrect essay. Computers also help you find things you need really fast, like food restaurants and the closest malls, or even jobs! Not only do computers help people with spelling and jobs but they also can teach us about far - off places. Computers can vividly show and tell us of wonderful places beyond what we have seen. A lot of normal society's families have been on vacation before. To find an intriguing place to go, they can easily look it up on the world wide web. Even if a family can't go on a vacation, they can still find from their computer cheaper, closer things to do. When computers are being used to find places and things across the world and near you, they can also give teens the opportunity to chat with their friends online. A lot of students in @CAPS3 hallow school have a Facebook account. Most use this account to talk to their friends online. I also have a Facebook and I use it almost every day to talk to my cousin from @LOCATION1 that I haven't seen since I was @NUM3. But, computers aren't just used for fun chatting; they can also be used for school blogs. In my language arts class, we have a reading blog that every student has to actively participate in. This blog allows the class to not waste class time to talk about recently read books. In conclusion, computers should be taken seriously because they do help society. Computers help us every day, they teach us, and they can be very fun and educational. Remember what @PERSON1 from the department of technology at @ORGANIZATION1 said, ""@CAPS5 can only get better if society accepts it."
1502	1506	1	3	"Computers can affect people in many ways. Most people use computers excessively, and it can have a negative impact on their health and the people around them. People need to go outside and become more active. America is facing an obesity problem, and many are not getting any truly useful information out of the computer. Some people are just sitting, mindlessly in front of their computer, munching on snacks at the same time! That makes things worse as not only are they not getting exercise, but now they are gaining weight as well as not losing any. This is the exact opposite of what a human should be doing. True, some people do exercise every day. Being on the computer is not always a bad thing. Sometimes you need to find something about nature, but wouldn't it be more beneficial to go outside and discover new things? I don't live near a forest, but you can visit one. The woods cannot just disappear. Even your front yard is full of nature, and you will be getting some (not all) exercise at the same time. Families are constantly having problems because family members never have time to talk, and some even punch holes in walls after losing a video game. Dr. @PERSON1 of ""The studies of the human mind"" says ""I found out technology and online gaming increases anger in most people."" That goes to show it can cause problems in families everywhere because of a video game! So please make sure you try to spend quality time with your family. So that shows that the computer can be fun, but also dangerous. We should strike a balance in our computer use to lead healthier and happier lives."
1503	1507	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 writers, on average, there are @NUM1 computers per house. That is just too many. I think society is spending too much time on computers. Computers are taking over our lives. Spending excessive time on the computer runs up the electric bill. Computers are one of the leading causes of weight gain, and you become less engaged and interesting in society when on the computer. If you spend too much time on the computer, you run up your electric bill. Do you really want to be spending @NUM2$ in a month, or would you rather buy groceries or even pay bills with that money? ""On average, a family who used fewer computers saved @MONEY1 more than a family that spends more time on their computer."" ""If I knew how much I'd save, I would cut down on computer use,"" says a gamer. ""I didn't know how much my hobby was costing me."" @CAPS5 @CAPS3 is the problem in life. The worst problem with computers is that you don't interact with society. If you spend most of your time on the computer, you won't have a lot of friends in real life. You might have online friends, but in real life, it's different. You can't truly fall in love just through the computer. I do other things rather than just play on the computer. I think society is spending too much time on the computer. Computers cause issues such as a high electricity bill. When you use the computer, you gain weight and don't participate in society. So get off that computer and start living a more balanced life."
1504	1508	1	3	Computers. There's fun. But there's also a downside. People spend more time on it than outside, exercising, or even getting together with friends and family. But on the other hand, they're also fun, help kids learn, and even assist people in finding partners through dating sites. It makes them happy. It's fun! Computers are fun. They provide a wide array of games, some educational and some just plain fun. You can play role - playing games (which are really exciting and fun because I play a few myself), or you could play educational games like the games on certain islands, or other downloadable educational games that are, @CAPS1 not only fun but essential for the growth and development of a learning child. They also can help kids learn various skills and other things at a very early age. Some adults also use computers for different purposes and various other things that I can't, for the life of me, think of right now. @CAPS2 Computers bring people together and they are happy. They use computers hundreds of times a day. Take away computers and people will feel lonely and sad. So in conclusion, my ideas are that computers are fun, help kids, and help older people get together. Read this and @CAPS3 I'm sure you'll see it my way. Let's embrace the good that computers offer while also being aware of the need for balance.
1505	1509	1	3	Hi my name is @CAPS1 and I'm writing to the local newspaper to say that computers are good for people and help a lot. They show us how to get from one place to another, how to learn about black history or famous people that did something significant to the world, and how to find out the news and weather from home or at work. They also help keep your business going; without computers, their jobs would be hopeless. And if your family or you are trying to make it in life, and the only way to get in contact would be through the computers. There are computers everywhere; even doctors use them at a hospital to keep people alive, to see what's wrong with them, and where they came from. One more thing, jobs need computers to see if the person is capable for the job, so they might look for background information. Without it, even you would not have a good job. So here are some reasons why computers are important. One of them is we need computers so that we can get around. If you're planning to go somewhere for the @DATE1, you would look on the computer for that perfect place. Second, if you don't know how to get there, of course you can use a @CAPS2, but the computer is the best because it shows the miles and how long it would take to get there. So that's one of the advantages. And second, to help learn about black history month and famous people, we all know that black history month is in books, but not a lot of books have a great deal of info in them. That's why the computer comes in handy because, like on Google, it gives you more info and shows the image of that person so that you know who they are. Like a famous singer or rapper you @MONTH1 like but know nothing about them, you would use the computer, @CAPS3 because that's the best thing to do. Third would be how to find out the news and weather. If you did not watch the news because you missed it, what you could do is go on a news site and watch the news that has been aired on TV, or a favorite show too if you want. Fourth would be business. Without computers, their business would be hopeless; it would not last that long. They would not know their profits, and how would they manage anything? That's what would happen if they did not have any type of computers. There's lots of more stuff that could have been said that prove computers are good and why we need them, but I just had to cut it short. Schools need computers the most to take tests on the computers if they have to. So these are all the reasons why we need computers and why they are important for our daily lives.
1506	1510	1	3	I personally believe that computers truly do benefit society in a multitude of ways. With just a simple click of a button, it can present you with all the information you need. Entertainment is readily accessible by searching the internet, and most importantly, it significantly improves communication between people. One way computers benefit society is by making it extremely easy for everyone to obtain information about something. This is particularly crucial in school. It can assist kids in gathering detailed information about the person they are writing about in their report. Easily getting information on the internet can also be helpful to people in other aspects. For instance, what if someone urgently needed to get the hospital's phone number in case of an emergency? They can quickly use the computer to find that phone number. Another way computers benefit society is by enabling us to effortlessly access any form of entertainment. This is what the majority of people in our society rely on. A large number of people use the computer to play various games, listen to a wide range of music, and watch interesting online videos. If someone was feeling bored at the moment, he or she could use the computer to play fun and engaging games. What if that person thought it was a bit quiet in his or her room? He or she could then use the computer to listen to some soothing or energetic music. Without computers, we would probably find ourselves extremely bored for the rest of our lives. Finally, and most importantly, computers help improve communication between people. This is probably what everyone uses the computer for. Now you can send electronic mail to your friends in just a few seconds, post and view pictures of your family or relatives, and you can even use an instant messenger to write to your friend and receive messages from your friend at the fastest speed possible! Without computers, communication between others would be very difficult. As you can see, computers can provide you with information easily, entertainment is not hard to find, and it can even enhance communication between people around our society and the world. Computers are very helpful to us and improve everything about the way we live, making our lives more convenient, interesting, and connected.
1507	1511	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, The computer has been a valuable resource we have been using for years, as it can offer you a wealth of information and vivid pictures. However, that doesn't mean people have to be glued to it all the time. People can have face - to - face conversations with others or use the webcam to see a loved one who's in Iraq. But they also need to go outside to exercise, even if it's just to take a short walk around the block. They don't even need to leave the house all the time; they can exercise to a fitness tape or use a treadmill. That's all people need to do instead of sitting idly on their butts all day. They should move around more. The rate of people becoming obese has risen because of the lack of exercise. So, grab your shoes and go jog a couple of blocks in your neighborhood. Just do little things like this, and you will feel much better than when you were constantly on your computer. Nature is all around us, but most people don't notice it because they are engrossed in their computers. This situation needs to end now. These beautiful landmarks across the world are being wasted because hardly anyone is looking at them. Go to @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2, even @CAPS1 and breathe in some fresh, clean air that isn't from your home. You can go to the park to simply watch the birds and see something without a screen in front of your eyes. So, go get your camera and go somewhere with wildlife and have a great time. Just doing these things will improve your health, boost your energy, and clear your mind. You can go on the computer and chat with friends, but not all the time. Do you really want to be unhealthy in life? If not, go outside and take a walk and embrace a more balanced lifestyle.
1508	1512	1	3	Dear Local @CAPS1, I have been informed that people don't get to talk to friends/family, enjoy nature and exercise because of computers. Well, computers actually bring many benefits to our life. The first advantage of computers is communication. People can use @CAPS2, @CAPS3, @CAPS4 and other similar platforms. These social networking groups provide the ability to talk to friends, whether they are far away or close by, and also allow family members to enjoy research. Just because @CAPS11 use those internet websites doesn't mean @CAPS11 can't go outside and enjoy various activities. This leads to another aspect, which is portable devices. As technology advances, so do our capabilities. Every year, more and more electronics are developed, and most of them are portable, such as @CAPS5, @CAPS6 phones, @CAPS7, and so on. Many of these companies design these devices to enable us to carry out our daily tasks. With @ORGANIZATION1, the creator of the @CAPS8, @CAPS11 can use this internet/music @CAPS9 for a wide range of purposes. For example, when I visit my grandparents, I decide to bring my @CAPS6 phone. I can talk to friends on my @CAPS6 phone by texting while still spending quality time with my grandparents. The same applies to @CAPS5. @CAPS11 can still go outside and enjoy life. Exercise is something @CAPS11 should definitely do. If you stay cooped up in your house, you won't have any fun. @CAPS11 need to cheer up and go outside and play sports. @CAPS11 could get involved and join an activity. @CAPS11 also can find videos online to show us how to exercise or use yoga. Most of us use portable devices, which ties back to my previous point. Exercise is very important, and @CAPS11 all should do it. What I'm trying to say here is that @CAPS11 can use computers and electronics and still exercise and have fun all at once. If you understand this, experts can agree that kids could be healthier and still maintain good communication, achieving a harmonious balance between technology use and a healthy lifestyle.
1509	1513	1	3	"Dear local newspaper, I am writing to tell you I firmly think that computers are a great thing. They allow people to communicate effectively, a large number of people have jobs because of computers, and they provide valuable help with homework. People communicate through various means such as email, AIM, and Facebook, among other platforms. People have jobs related to computers, like court reporters who need to record information accurately using computer software, tax - retailers who manage financial data on computers, and sales people who use computers for market research and customer communication. Lastly, kids can do their homework on the computer. They can look up stuff ""@CAPS1 related"" on the computer, whether it's historical facts, scientific concepts, or literary references. In conclusion, computers are good for people as they play a crucial role in education, work, and communication with friends and family, making our lives more efficient and connected in various aspects."
1510	1514	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, In my opinion, I whole - heartedly support the advances in technology. Advances in technology offer numerous benefits. They help us obtain information on things we need to know about, enable us to chat with friends and family online, and can enhance our reading and hand - eye coordination skills. One of the reasons why I support advances in technology is that computers/phones can assist us in getting information on things we need to be informed about. We need to be constantly aware of what is going on around us. We need to know what is happening in our local community, as well as what is happening to other people in our lives. For example, we need to know the weather and traffic conditions. If you have children, you need to know if the school is open. And if you work in places that rely on computers for information, you need to check if your boss or co - worker sent you anything important that you need to be aware of. The second reason why I support advances in technology is that we can chat with friends and family online. We can communicate with our family and friends on the other side of the world who have access to a computer. Most of us are concerned about whether our family and friends are okay and healthy, even though we can't see them in person. I, for one, know this is true because my family and friends keep in touch with each other online. Staying connected with our family and friends helps strengthen our relationships. The last reason why I support advances in technology is that computers can help us with our reading and hand - eye coordination skills. Computers can improve our reading skills because if we don't have the time to go to the bookstore to buy a book, we can read the book online for free. It can also enhance our hand - eye coordination as it makes our fingers move more nimbly and helps us perform tasks more quickly. In conclusion, I have stated all of my reasons why I support advances in technology. Computers can help us get information on things we need, allow us to chat with friends/family online, and improve our reading and hand - eye coordination skills, making our lives more informed, connected, and skill - enhanced.
1511	1515	1	3	"Dear newspaper editor: We are all living in the age of technology. There are numerous useful devices that assist us in our daily lives. The computer is a major boon. We can talk with relatives from different areas and you can surf the internet to learn new information. Moreover, you can play games with people from around the world. The computer is a great device. Almost everyone has a relative that lives in another state or country. Well, you rarely see them because they live far away, right? With a computer, you can talk and even have a face - to - face conversation with them. It can bring your family closer together. For example, my family just got a new computer and we have relatives that live in Florida that we almost never see. With the computer, my dad talks to them almost every day. Some people that I have talked to said that they are excited to see their relatives or friends more often. It has brought them closer together and made them better friends. The internet is a wonderful place where you can look up information for a school project and learn about different topics. When kids are doing a project in school and the information they need is not in the class book, they can search it and it saves time. A significant percentage of kids said that when they are doing a project, the best thing to use would be the internet. Also, it helps the kids work faster so they can spend more time outside or hanging out with their friends. Another thing you can do is learn about recent events. For example, most local newspapers have a website that you can visit. Even if your local one does not, you can go to other websites like ""NewsSite"". They have recent events that happen around the country and around the world. The internet is useful in many ways and can help you with your everyday life. Every kid gets bored when it's a rainy day. So they can play games with people from around the world using a computer. There are many websites that have fun games that are enjoyable. You can also become acquainted with people from other countries. My friends Tom and Jerry play on the computer and they have a lot of friends from other countries. I think that it's cool that you are playing the exact game with another person in Japan or Australia. Also, most of the games are safe and fun to play. Another thing is that you can connect and play with your friends in your hometown. I have many times played games with Tom and Jerry. It's a fun thing to do during a boring, rainy day. In conclusion, the computer is a useful device that benefits us and helps us with our everyday life. It allows us to connect with family in far - away places and surf the internet for new information. Also, you can play games with people from around the world. It's a wonderful device and let's start using it."
1512	1516	1	3	Dear local news, As more and more people use computers, people ask if computers actually benefit society. In my opinion, I think computers do. They provide entertainment, access to daily uses, and have many websites for social interactions. I think computers really do benefit society, and here's why. Computers provide entertainment to people. Many people will want to watch funny videos or their favorite TV show on the internet. One of the most popular websites for watching videos is YouTube. Another great source of entertainment are video games. People buy video games at their local store or play them on websites. You can see that entertainment on the computer has much more flexibility compared to the TV where a program is shown at a certain time instead of whenever you want. Another benefit computers bring to society is access to daily uses. The internet provides information that can tell you your local weather. Instead of waiting for the local news, you can immediately access it on your computer. You can also access encyclopedias and dictionaries like at the websites Britannica Online. These websites provide an easy and immediate resource for daily uses. One last example regarding the benefits of computers. There are many websites that you can use. One of these websites is called Facebook. Facebook lets you upload pictures of people or family events for people in your network. You can also video - chat with people over the internet and see the other person's face. You can't do that on a telephone or with texting or a cell phone. Many experts believe that computers are taking away time with family and friends, but with websites like Facebook, it is actually adding time. In conclusion, these reasons support my opinion that computers benefit society. They provide entertainment, easy access to information, and have many websites for social interactions. Without computers, society would be a lot harder, and this is why I think computers benefit society.
1513	1517	1	3	Dear Sir/Madam, A computer is a great benefit. They help us in so many ways. It is extremely helpful and could make someone's life easier to handle. You could keep in touch with old friends or family. It would be much easier for work, and when you're bored, you could play some fun games. It's very difficult to have family you can't see and keep in touch with! With a computer, you could send messages and photos to interact with them. You wouldn't have to worry about ever losing communication with them. You could also meet new people. Get new friends from anywhere in the world! Have friends from all different races and cultures. Computers are a great way to interact with others, whether it's family or friends. It's always hard to do work when you have no clue what it's about! If you're ever in trouble on something, you could always look up information about it. You could learn how to do things or learn more information about a certain item. When you have homework and don't know the meaning of a word, you could always look up the definition of it. They also hold your information. For example, instead of having a ton of papers, you could simply just save it in your computer. Then you could print it out whenever you need it. Computers make work easier and help you organize better. Computers also amuse you as well. When you have nothing to do, you could play a lot of fun games. You could also watch music videos or funny videos to get you laughing. They have practically anything you want to play. You would hardly ever get bored! As you see, computers are a benefit to people. It's always helpful when you could keep in touch with anyone, have help with your work, or simply keep yourself entertained. Without computers, life would be harder and boring!
1514	1518	1	3	Dear Editor of the Times, Computers are a helpful advantage in a human's life. It offers and contributes many ideas and actions. Computers help people find a nice spot to travel. Also, it helps people meet or make new friends. A computer is another way for people to get their hand - eye coordination better. Computers are very helpful in a human's life. Computers are useful when trying to explore new places. One can book a flight anywhere in a matter of minutes on a computer. How else would it be possible to travel someplace far away without booking a flight on a computer? Next, computers help learn about different cultures. Once one has booked reservations to a certain travel spot on their computer, they will learn much about the unfamiliar land they have gone to. My family has gone to many different areas around the world. The trips would not have been possible without help researching and making flights with the computers. The computer makes it possible to experience new territories. It is a key item when someone is looking to travel. A computer is immensely important when trying to communicate with friends. People can meet and make friends very simply using websites such as Facebook on the computer. Facebook creates friendships very easily. I recently wanted to get to know a student better. I looked him up on Facebook and now we are acquaintances. Next, programs on the computers such as A.I.M. help people communicate about anything such as homework to other personal topics. Lastly, if one wants to get to know another better, he or she can look at their blog. Then they can start to talk and become good friends. Computers are useful when trying to communicate or find friends. Computers not only help with travel and friends but it also helps with one's hand - eye coordination. Typing letters while looking at a screen is using the hand - eye coordination. This action can help with sports. For example, in baseball, one must have a good hand - eye coordination to help catch and hit the ball. Secondly, with hand - eye coordination getting better with the computer, it helps kids fit in. If one has good hand - eye coordination, they can play sports and make friends. If one becomes good with hand - eye coordination and typing, they will be able to get a job writing for a newspaper or a book. Hand - eye coordination and typing with computers can lead to a successful life. Computers in a person's life can help in the long run. It will help with travel plans, friends, and hand - eye coordination.
1515	1519	1	3	Dear Tech Advisor, I think that people are spending too much time on their computers and not exercising as they're supposed to do every day. A recent study says that 70% of all people in the entire world are spending too much time on the computer and not enjoying nature. So they don't get exercise like other people do. Another research says that people that go outside and not stare at their computers will live a long and healthy life. I say that 60% of all people that are always on the computer often go blind and will never see how the world is changing around them. I say that 80% of all people that don't always go on the computer will live a better life than the people that are always on the computer. My mom told me that you should go on the computer, just not for a very long time because being on the computer for a very long time is not so good for you. So don't go on the computer for a very long time, only for a short amount of time and don't go on the computer every day, only like once a week. People that have Facebook accounts, you shouldn't go on it like every day. Go on like once to three times a week because going on the computer for a very long time is not good for people. My mom also says that 50% of all people in the world have eye problems and often go blind because of them using the computer all the time and that if you go on it for too long, your computer will melt down and break. I really think that people shouldn't go on the computer for a very long time because every time they go on is a time that they will miss in their life. So please don't do it.
1516	1520	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 have long debated on whether computers are good or bad. @CAPS6, I firmly believe that computers aren't as good as many people think. Ever since computers were invented, people have become increasingly sedentary and haven't been exercising regularly. Also, fewer kids are picking up books to read. Lastly, computers are significantly taking away precious family time. When was the last time you saw a kid outside doing something active such as running or playing a sport? If you haven't, it's probably because they are inside with their eyes glued to a computer screen. Exercise is a crucial part in staying healthy and fit. More kids are becoming overweight every day. Computers are just another contributing reason. I had a friend who used to spend all her free time on the computer. She became very lazy. She never wanted to exercise or do anything active. Little by little, she started gaining weight. This is happening all around the world and it needs to stop! What's your reading level? @CAPS3 are students in @NUM1 grade with a @NUM2 grade reading level. Part of the reason is because they would rather use their free time on the computer instead of picking up a book. Schools now run a program called @CAPS5 @NUM3. This program is designed to help students improve their reading levels. I believe that if students would turn off the computers long enough and read, we wouldn't need this program. My mom makes sure I read for at least @NUM4 mins every day. Every student should do the same. I remember a saying ""family time is golden time"". @CAPS6, nowadays no one spends quality time with their family. Once again, computers have played a significant part in this too. It's not just kids who have sacrificed family time for computer time. It's adults as well. I think the last time I spent some meaningful time with my family was about @NUM5 weeks ago when my grandparents came to visit. After that, everyone went right back to staring at computer screens. In conclusion, while computers have their uses, the negative impacts they have on health, reading habits, and family relationships cannot be ignored."
1517	1521	1	3	I firmly believe computers have a positive effect on people because computers can assist people in numerous ways. You can easily e - mail friends from across the world, access important information you might need, and also conduct business online. Computers have fascinating things to show and inform. Most people who own computers can use them for e - mailing friends. Sometimes your closest friends are located across the country, and you want to have a chat with them. Why not send them an e - mail on your computer? It would mean a great deal to your friends if you just take a few minutes to say hello through e - mail. My second reason on why using computers have a positive effect on people is that from middle school through college and throughout the rest of your life, you will need to use computers. Maybe it's because of some important information you might need for an assignment given by a teacher. Not all the time can you find certain things in books. Nowadays, computers are gradually taking over the role of books. My third reason for the benefits of computers is that some people are too ill to go to work, so they can work online. Even though you are ill, you will still be getting paid because you are still working. For example, a woman who has just had a baby can use her computer to work online. So she can earn money to support her family. In conclusion, my opinion is that computers have a positive effect on people because they are used for e - mailing friends, finding out important information for school purposes or job purposes. My last point is that computers are used for working online. To me, I think computers are indeed a positive influence on people.
1518	1522	1	3	Dear editor of the @PERSON1, I heard you are writing a section in your newspaper about computers and I just thought I would voice my honest opinion. Personally, I whole - heartedly think computers have a positive effect on people. First, I think computers are wonderful because you are able to learn things about faraway places, like exotic countries on the other side of the world, from the cozy comfort of your home. Also, the vast amount of information on the internet can greatly assist with students' schoolwork. Finally, you are able to communicate with other people online. These are just a few key points why computers are very important, that you should include in your article. First off, editor of the @PERSON1, I think computers are excellent for mankind because you are able to learn about places on the other side of the world, while sitting at home comfortably drinking hot cocoa. This is so incredibly convenient. There are numerous websites containing detailed information about the geography, languages, and unique traditions of countries waiting for you to explore and learn. For example, once my friend, @PERSON3, was planning on going to @LOCATION1 for a business trip, but had no idea how to speak the language. I recommended the website, www.Indianow.com and in just two weeks she was speaking like an expert. Another time, my sister, @PERSON4, was visiting her in - laws for the first time. They were of @CAPS1 heritage and she wanted to bake something traditional for them. She looked up a recipe on the web and everyone was extremely satisfied with the scrumptious ravioli she made. This is just one clear reason the internet is so useful. Second, computers are an amazing invention because you can effortlessly find help for schoolwork. My brother, @PERSON5, was having problems with learning about the seasons, but with one simple click, he was filled with knowledge. Also, nowadays they even have online tutors and online colleges! Professor @PERSON2 states that @PERCENT1 of passing college students are earning their degree online. This is a remarkable point on why computers are so important. Lastly, computers are really significant to society because you are able to interact with other people online. With video - chat, chatrooms, Facebook and @CAPS2, you are very likely to make a friend who would last a lifetime. I know I did! There are even online dating sites and match - makers. For instance, after my uncle divorced my aunt, she was devastated and couldn't bring herself to date again for the longest time. I told her to try one of those online dating sites, she took my advice and found a lovely man. They have been dating for @NUM1 months. Last @DATE1 he proposed. They are now happily engaged. This is my last reason how computers can change someone's life in a positive way. In conclusion, I think computers are a fantastic invention because you are able to learn about faraway places while staying at home, receive valuable help with your schoolwork, and communicate with other people online. I really hope you will consider my opinion for your article, editor of the @ORGANIZATION1. Thank you for your time.
1519	1523	1	3	@CAPS1, you know we all like computers and we all use them for all different types of things like to chat or to do work and most importantly to find something. But computers are, in a way, not that good for you, especially if your computer is your life. One reason I think computers are in a way bad is because when you are on it for a long time, you get hungry. Then you grab some snacks and by the time you're done using the computer, you've gained a pound. Now, imagine how much weight you will gain if you do that every day! My next reason why I think computers are in a way bad is because when you are on the computer too long, your eyes start to ache and your hands start to cramp. All that excessive typing and looking at the same screen for a long time can make you develop eye problems and can also cause issues in your hands. Then you will not be able to do anything with your hands for a long time because it will start hurting. My last reason why I think computers, in a way, are bad is because it can mess up your computer. It can overheat or just crash because you have been on it for too long. It can also get a virus, and then you will just have to get a whole new computer. @CAPS1, you can clearly see there are plenty of reasons why I think computers are kinda bad. In conclusion, while computers are useful tools, we should be aware of their negative impacts on our health and the device itself.
1520	1524	1	3	Many people have been talking about computers in the @ORGANIZATION1. Networks like @CAPS1, @ORGANIZATION2, and @CAPS2 have been saying that the computers are turning people into lazy good - for - nothings. But I say differently! I think the advances in technology are a great thing. Why? I'll give you @NUM1 reasons. My first reason is that they give people the ability to learn about faraway places and different people. The next reason is that they make life more convenient. And my last reason is that it improves your hand - eye coordination. Aren't you sick of having to go to the book store and find a book to do a project? Well, now with the computers, you don't have to. You just go online and look up the information that you need to learn about almost anything, from various cultures to @LOCATION1. Next, computers make life better. You can shop online, pay bills online, and even attend meetings without leaving your home. Moreover, games on the computer can enhance your hand - eye coordination, which is beneficial for various aspects of life. In conclusion, despite the negative views, the positive impacts of computers in terms of learning, convenience, and skill - building cannot be overlooked.
1521	1525	1	3	Dear local Newspaper, I was carefully reading this well - written article about computers. I whole - heartedly agree with the fact that both kids and adults are not having enough time to enjoy nature and interact with family and friends. They are so engrossed in the digital world that they miss out on these precious real - life experiences. But, also, kids and adults should definitely set aside some fun time outside and truly enjoy the fresh air and natural beauty.   When it comes to the usage of computers, it is indeed helpful for searching information. For instance, when doing school projects or work - related research, computers can provide a vast amount of data in no time. I think kids and adults need to get active and get healthy. Nowadays, kids don't want to play outside; instead, they prefer to play video games. When I was a little kid, I would always play hide and seek with my friends in the neighborhood. But now, my mother doesn't like to play anymore because of technology. She would rather be on the computer or on the phone, checking emails or scrolling through social media.   Kids all over the world now know how to use computers because they are more attracted to the virtual world than the real one outside. Computers are only helpful when you're doing a report or something important. For example, people that have businesses they are going to need computers to manage their accounts, communicate with clients, and market their products. Also, when a teacher assigns a project, you're going to need a computer to search up information for that project.   Finally, a lot of kids aren't taking responsibility for school. They don't take school seriously. Kids think that the computers will teach them everything, but they're wrong because things on the computer can be made up. Moreover, it's also making their life very unhealthy. So, that's why computers are good for usage at times and bad at other times because kids don't play outside anymore, and computers are helpful for searching information. Considering what I've said, don't you agree with me?
1522	1526	1	3	Dear @PERSON1, To this day, there are many people who use telecommunication devices, like the computer. Some think computers have a positive effect on people. Others are concerned that people spend too much time on them. I think that both these opinions are correct. Although using a computer can become an addicting and unhealthy habit, they teach a person something new every day, are enjoyable, and help save the earth.   Using computers is something I know millions of people do every day, and I would think it would be difficult to live without them. For example, my family owns four computers. We each have our own specific reasons for using them. For my mom, she's usually working on important business tasks or checking her e - mails. For me and my sister, we're researching and typing up our homework, and communicating with our friends via Facebook or other social media platforms.   So, say when my mom is working, or me and my sister are researching something, we learn. Before there were computers, everyone used books, but now that we have the internet, there's really no need to get a book. Most of the time, people won't even have the book they're looking for. They either have to go out and buy it or get one from the library. Now this is an inconvenience to people, so why not use the internet that's quick and easily accessible.   People also use computers to socialize, like I mentioned above, maybe through Facebook, @CAPS1, or e - mail. It's quick, easy, and fun. It also saves paper which helps the planet. We always used to send letters, but now with these digital sources, you don't need to use as much paper! Computers are also fun for kids because you can play a lot of games on them.   Now, even though I mentioned all those good things, there are unfortunately bad ones too. So many people use computers every day, and it's bad for your physical and mental health. People spend so much time on them that they can get easily addicted. This means they will be on them all the time, and never do other things like go outside. They won't get exercise which could be bad for their physical health. Also, staring at a screen all day is bad for your eyes and brain.   So I think, due to these causes, people shouldn't use them constantly. In conclusion, I'd like to say that people should use computers for learning things, but also go outside or do something active because spending all this time on computers can result in physical and mental health issues. Thank you and I hope you agree with my statements.
1523	1527	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, Although many people think computers are bad, there are many reasons as to why they are good. Computers are very environmentally friendly, and so are a significant percentage of people today. They also allow us to type assignments and other important papers neatly and quickly. People also don't know that they are not the worst option on the market today.   Computers might take away time from people that they should be spending on exercise, but computers aren't the only thing that does that. More people spend time watching @CAPS5 than they do on any other activity. @PERSON2, the head of @ORGANIZATION1, conducted a survey in @DATE1. His survey showed that out of the @NUM1 people questioned, @PERCENT2 spent @NUM2 hours a day watching @CAPS5, @PERCENT3 spent @NUM3 hours on the computer, @PERCENT4 spent @NUM4 hours reading, and @PERCENT5 spent @NUM4 hours exercising. So clearly, computers are not our biggest problem.   Many people today are ""eco - conscious"" or ""environment - friendly"". So instead of buying newspapers or magazines, most people go online to research current events. @PERSON1, @CAPS9 of the @ORGANIZATION2, says if we use computers instead of newspapers, a large percentage of the trees we cut down each year will be saved. So, obviously, computers are environmentally friendly.   Today's youth is messier than it ever was. Teachers are having a hard time grading papers and tests because of kids' handwriting. So instead of handwriting papers, kids make it easier on teachers by typing their work. Recent studies show that a significant percentage of teachers find it easier and better for kids to type papers. This shows kids are better off typing papers and assignments.   I hope you now understand my position on computers. They help us in many other ways too. In conclusion, they are not as time - consuming as everyone might think. They also help us with research, are environmentally friendly, and help the youth of our world become neater one click at a time."
1524	1528	1	3	Dear @PERSON1, I think myself that the computers could help you with a lot of things. Like my teacher gave my class some homework, and we had to find facts about @CAPS1 @CAPS2 the @NUM1. And if it wasn't for the computer, I wouldn't know anything about @CAPS1 @CAPS2 the @NUM1. The computer provides a vast amount of information at our fingertips, making it easy to complete such assignments.   Plus, the computer could help you find long - lost family members. Because when my grandfather died, my mother found her sister on the computer. It's amazing how technology can reconnect people who have been separated for a long time.   Plus, on the computer, I could find out about other states that I don't know about. The computer can teach you about a lot of things that my mother and teacher can't teach you. It has a wealth of knowledge from different fields, cultures, and places. Nah, I'm just saying computers could teach you about a lot of things that people don't know about. In conclusion, computers are truly a valuable tool that can expand our knowledge and connect us with the world.
1525	1529	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I recently started researching the effects that computers have on people and have found some shocking facts. I do not believe computers benefit society at all. Three reasons why I believe this is because it makes people lack exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with friends.   @CAPS1 is a rising problem in @LOCATION1, and a major factor towards @CAPS1 is computers. In fact, statistics show that people who spend more time exercising than looking at electronics all day actually live longer lives. So, my first reason about why computers do not benefit society is that it lets people lack exercise. People need exercise to live, and with computers, it is becoming more lacking than ever. Also, exercise gives you endorphins, which are hormones that make you happy. If you live your life exercising instead of watching or doing violent things on the web, it will lead to a less violent future.   My second reason is that computers cause a lack of enjoying nature. Nature is a beautiful thing filled with simmering lakes, the beautiful scent of balsam fir, and thousands of creatures. With computers, thousands of kids are missing out on the fresh air and adventures that nature has in store. My parents didn't have computers when they were little, and they say that they enjoyed running around their neighborhoods playing sports and other fun activities.   Finally, computers lead to a lack in interacting with friends. Remember when you were little and you called up your friend to hang out and have a sleepover? Well, now computers have caused people not to have to call or hang out with friends. Instead, you can just @CAPS2 or email them, and you can have a conversation without even looking at a person!   In closing, computers cause a lack in exercise, enjoying nature, and interacting with friends. Please help and encourage others to help me put a stop to the over - use of computers! Thank you for your time, and I hope you learned some shocking and interesting facts from this letter.
1526	1530	1	3	To: @ORGANIZATION1 develops technology at an incredibly rapid pace, and they keep coming up with more new inventions. They have invented a computer that helps people with the work they need to do. However, there is a significant problem: people, especially teenagers, are spending too much time on the computer. I firmly believe this is a horrible idea because they have less time to be physically active. They also have less time to interact with friends and family, and @CAPS1, it is indeed dangerous for teenagers. Nevertheless, many people in @MONTH1 do not agree with me. There are so many teenagers and adults who are just squandering their time on the computer instead of going outside to play, enjoying the beauty of nature, doing exercise, and simply having a great time. Don't you think this is a concerning situation? Well, a friend of mine used to go outside every day to play. I really miss those days when she was so active. You know, when you want to spend time with your family, but guess what? They are all glued to the computer, wasting time instead of being with you. Do you think that's a good thing? It's not because that's how family gatherings stop happening, and relatives stop coming to visit. It's so sad to see families growing apart. That's not all. Do you think people can get into dangerous situations? They definitely can. For instance, you create a MySpace account and meet a boy who claims to be the same age as you. He asks if he can meet you, and you say yes. Let's say you're an @NUM1 - year - old girl, and he's actually @NUM2 years old. He might abuse you or even kill you. You thought he was @NUM1 years old, but he wasn't. I truly think it's dangerous for kids. Having computers is, in my opinion, a terrible idea because you'll spend less time in nature, less time with your family, and may get involved in dangerous things. However, people in @MONTH1 still don't agree with me. But what if your child was in danger? How would you feel? People really should think twice about the impact of having computers.
1527	1531	1	3	Who in the world would say a computer is useless? Absolutely no one. Computers are one of the most useful devices ever created. I firmly believe that computers are perfect and can help you develop various skills. I have @NUM1 reasons for this: they help build skills, provide fast information, and offer a great deal of fun. Now, let's start with the skill - building aspect. Skills are essential if you want to pursue a successful career. You can learn skills from books, TV, and computers. For example, I learned how to type rapidly on a keyboard through a computer game called Type to Learn. After just a week of playing this game, I was typing like a professional. The computer also has chess, which is an excellent tool for building strategy. Just ask my super - smart English teacher, @PERSON1. She says that chess builds character and strengthens your mind. Moving on, I want to talk about how you can obtain information instantaneously with computers. Experts say that it is the number - one way to get information quickly when you need it badly. I wholeheartedly agree with this. After studying for a test on @LOCATION1 Carver in my book, I found that one of the pages was missing. So, I used my computer. Not only did I get the information I needed quickly, but I also got more information than what the book provided. The next day, I passed my test with @NUM2 percent. You can see how useful a computer can be. Finally, I want to talk to you about good - old - fashioned fun. As you know, computers are great for building skills and getting information, but you can also always use a computer for entertainment. Do you know anyone in the world who can say that the computer is not fun? No, you can't because everyone in the world uses the computer for fun activities like playing online games, watching videos, and chatting with people. Thanks to these reasons, it's clear that computers are valuable for building skills, accessing information, and having a good time.
1528	1532	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, In numerous ways, computers have been extremely beneficial to the human race. They can be used to look up information, communicate with family and friends, listen to music, and so on. Don't you think people are spending an excessive amount of time on the computer instead of getting some exercise? It's evident that computers can do almost anything we want them to. But why waste your time on the computer when you could be spending quality time with your family, playing sports, or enjoying some fresh air? I believe that computers have both positive and negative effects on people. One of the positive effects is the ability to talk to your friends. I know that sometimes we can't see them as often as we'd like at school. In my opinion, it's a great way to catch up on the funny times you've shared with your friends. Now, let's talk about the negative effect. Many kids get bullied and picked on by other kids over the internet. This can lead to low self - esteem in these kids and cause potentially dangerous situations in the future. When it comes to computers, they have saved many people's lives. Some of these ways include finding cures for harmful diseases. Computers can also provide information about upcoming serious weather storms and help us prepare for them. Wouldn't you agree that computers have played a huge role in our lives? However, sometimes we should take a break from them and enjoy the beauty of nature. So, have fun with technology, but don't forget to stay active as well. In conclusion, while computers offer many advantages, we need to use them in moderation to maintain a healthy and balanced life.
1529	1533	1	3	Dear local Newspaper, Have you ever wondered why people spend so much time on the computer? The impact of computers on people is both good and bad. The positive aspect is that you can communicate with people in far - away places. For example, you can talk to someone you went to @LOCATION1 with during your time in @LOCATION1 and / or @CAPS1 @LOCATION1. You can share memories and keep in touch easily. However, the bad part is that if you're on the computer all the time, you're neglecting the time you could spend with your family and friends. When you spend all your time on the computer, you're becoming a couch potato, which is extremely unhealthy. Another good reason for using a computer is when a family member moves away. For instance, if you live in @LOCATION2 and your family is in @STATE1, instead of just sending letters and pictures, you can communicate via webcam. Through a webcam, they can see how you act and express yourself, which is much better than just hearing your voice on the phone. A lot of people disagree with the extensive use of computers because they think computers are a big waste of time. In conclusion, while computers offer great communication opportunities, we need to find a balance to avoid the negative impacts on our relationships and health.
1530	1534	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2's opinion about computers is that people should use them. Think about your children. When they grow up, they will definitely need to know how to use a computer for school or even for a job. It also helps develop hand - eye coordination, which is essential for multitasking. The computer is not only useful but also fun and easy to use. I'm almost certain that you love using a computer. Who doesn't? @CAPS2's first reason is that you will need to use a computer in your daily life. For example, if you're going to a job interview, most @CAPS3 will ask how many words per minute you can type. You need to be proficient in typing. Also, at school, if you have a writing assignment due, it would take much more time to write it by hand than to type it on a computer. All @CAPS3 will have to type at some point. Especially in your job as an @CAPS1, you need to use a computer every day. The computer also teaches hand - eye coordination. Hand - eye coordination is similar to multitasking. You could be typing and talking on the phone simultaneously, or even exercising and texting. Hand - eye coordination is a very important skill in life. All @CAPS3 will need to multitask. For example, at a library, you need to find a book while talking to people. Even when driving a car, you need to multitask to stay on the road. You need to operate the brake and gas pedals while keeping your eyes on the road. You must be able to multitask along with having good hand - eye coordination. Fortunately, a computer can teach you these skills. @CAPS2's last and final reason is that it's fun and easy to use. I was @NUM1 when I started using a computer, and I loved playing fun games. I couldn't type at first, but I quickly caught on because when you're having fun, it's easy to learn. Just like math, it may not be fun, but you have to learn how to do it. So, if you like having fun while learning something, the computer is perfect for you. It's now or never for people to learn how to use a computer, get @CAPS3, and achieve good grades. It's fun and easy to learn how to use, teaches you hand - eye coordination and multitasking. You will absolutely need to know how to use a computer for @CAPS3 and school. We need computers in our lives, and we will always need to use them every single day. Don't listen to those who say it will rot your brain or make you unhealthy. Look at all the positive aspects. In conclusion, computers are an indispensable part of our lives, and we should embrace them and learn to use them effectively.
1531	1535	1	3	Here is my @CAPS1. I firmly believe that computers are incredibly useful, and here are my @NUM1 compelling reasons. First, kids can easily talk to their friends on the computer when they are grounded. For instance, I was grounded in @DATE1 for slapping my cousin in the face. However, I still managed to talk to my friends. The only way to trick my parents was to tell them I was asking my friend about homework, and we've been in touch ever since.  My second reason is that people can turn to the computer when they are bored. For example, when a kid has beaten all his games and is feeling bored, he can search for new ones to buy. He also has the option to rent games or play downloadable games on the computer.  My final reason is that when someone wants to look up information for a project and the library is closed, they can simply copy down what they need from the computer.  In conclusion, we truly need computers to thrive. Without them, we would still be living in the stone - age, cut off from the vast resources and connections that computers provide.
1532	1536	1	3	"Some people don't like computers for immediate, often unfounded reasons, while other people are a little too infatuated with them. I like computers, but @CAPS1 I'm not obsessed. Computers give good opportunities to people, even to me. You can learn a wide variety of things from the computer, and it also helps you develop good hand - eye coordination. One of the things I really like about computers is that you can ""talk"" to other people from different places.  However, lots of people use the computer so excessively that they don't exercise regularly, or observe nature as much as normal people should. Moreover, they don't spend enough quality time with their families.  I prefer to spend only (#@NUM1) three hours on the computer each day. This way, I can have time for other important activities. I believe you or anybody else should also strike a balance and do the same to lead a well - rounded life."
1533	1537	1	3	My opinion on computers is that I firmly think it's a great idea for people to use computers. I hold this view because if you haven't seen someone for many years, the computer gives you a chance to see and talk to that person. It's like having them right in front of you.  Computers are also extremely useful when it comes to school projects. If you have a project to complete, you can obtain high - quality information relevant to your project.  I enjoy going on the computer to catch up with friends I haven't seen in a while. Additionally, you can meet new people and make friends from all over the world.  Without computers, we would have to laboriously search through numerous books for information, or travel all the way to the bank to check our account balance. This clearly shows why computers are such a good idea.  On the computer, you can find workout videos to get fit. You don't always have to go to the gym. My dad uses the computer to talk to his sisters or play games with people from around the world. My mom, on the other hand, talks to her family in @LOCATION1 and other places.  If there were no computers, we couldn't take our online tests, and getting information would be a huge hassle. Computers are also great when it comes to paying bills.  We can interact with friends and family online, especially on rainy or snowy days when we can't go out to meet them. Some people think it's not a good idea because some individuals get addicted to computers. However, there are so many diverse things to do on the computer that you'll never get bored.  In conclusion, computers are a wonderful invention. They are not only convenient but also play a crucial role in our daily lives, making them very important.
1534	1538	1	3	A lot of people use computers today. But not everybody believes that they benefit society. However, computers are truly capable of doing almost anything! You can conduct in - depth research, play a wide variety of games, and most importantly, enjoy a great deal of freedom.  Have you ever been assigned a school project, but couldn't find the information you needed in any book? Well, the internet is the solution. A large number of computers are connected to the internet, where you can find virtually anything. For example, if you're trying to find facts for your science project, just go on your favorite search engine and enter your topic. You'll be presented with endless pages of relevant information.  Even if you're not doing school work, the internet is still a goldmine. Did you forget the number of your favorite football player? Simply search his name, and the information will appear right on your screen. Are you curious about why the @CAPS1 won the @CAPS2 @CAPS3? The possibilities for finding answers are endless!  Even if your computer doesn't have an internet connection, you can still play games. Playing games on your computer is a really enjoyable hobby. And if your computer is connected to the internet, you can play games with other people from all over the world.  There is a wide variety of computer games available, such as adventure games, shooting games, multiple - player games, and more! You can even play poker on your computer.  I think the best part of using a computer is the freedom it offers. You can do almost anything you want. You can surf the internet, play games, and communicate with people. You can also customize your computer according to your preferences. For example, if you have a picture of your cat, you can set it as your desktop background. If you want a different cursor, you can easily change it with just a click of your mouse.  In conclusion, there are endless possibilities with computers. You can learn new things, have fun playing games, and enjoy the freedom they provide. But the most important thing is to use the computer in a balanced way and have a great time while doing so.
1535	1539	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, based on my @CAPS1 personal experience, I firmly think that computers have a highly positive effect on people. Many people enjoy their time on the computer because, thanks to today's advanced technology, so many tasks can be accomplished more quickly and efficiently.  @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2 have a computer at home. I am one of them, and it has been a great asset. I can get most of my tasks done in a short period of time.  I believe computers have a positive impact on people because today you can do almost anything on them. For example, I have family members living in @LOCATION2; @LOCATION3, @LOCATION1 and @LOCATION4. Instead of making expensive phone calls, I can video - chat with them. It makes me feel as if I'm right there with them.  Moreover, you can pay your bills online. This saves you the trouble of sending letters through the mail, waiting for them to arrive, and buying expensive stamps. You can simply send an e - mail for free.  Most college students do their homework on the computer. They type essays and can easily save research materials and take notes later.  In essence, a computer is almost an indispensable part of everyone's life. It can be entertaining, fun, and useful for important tasks. Computers are a part of every teenager's daily routine. We can interact with friends, listen to music, and connect with family and relatives we don't usually see, all on one device.  Some people even pursue online education and earn a degree through the computer. Computers are so important that they can scan my test and give me a score.  I hope that after reading this, you will agree with me when I say that computers have had and will always have a positive effect on people. Thank you for taking the time to consider my opinion, and I sincerely hope you share my view.
1536	1540	1	3	@DATE1 @CAPS1 Local Newspaper, I think that computers have a huge impact on people. My take on it is that the computer makes kids lazy and inactive. Having a computer often leads kids to just sit around and do nothing productive. I'm sure you've heard of popular websites such as MySpace, Facebook, Formspring, etc. These websites can make a person prefer to be on the computer rather than exercising and maintaining a healthy lifestyle. I believe kids like me these days want to keep in touch with their friends. If the phone isn't an option, then the computer becomes the go - to. Also, getting rid of excessive computer use can prevent homosexuals from approaching kids by pretending to be their age. I will admit the computer can be useful, but being on it all day is just ridiculous. I have a @NUM1 - year - old brother who stays on the computer from the time he gets home until the time he goes to sleep. Compared to me, he's not fit and healthy at all. That's what countless hours on the computer has done to him. In fact, he's on MySpace so much that he has over @NUM2 friends, and he doesn't even know half of them. He gives them his number and home address without thinking. Do you notice a lot of kids these days would rather waste time on the computer than be outside and take care of themselves. I've always had a passion for football, but I can hardly find the time to play with my brother because of his computer addiction. All he seems to care about is girls and, of course, the computer. I'm not asking to take away computers from people's homes, but we should put a stop to the daily number of hours spent on it because time is one thing that money can't buy. Some kids will look back on these days and wonder how much time they wasted on nothing. In conclusion, life is precious, and we shouldn't spend it all on unproductive computer use.
1537	1541	1	3	Dear NewsPaper, people are spending an excessive amount of time on computers. Instead, you could be outside enjoying the beauty of nature, playing exciting sports, or embarking on interesting travels. Some people say that you can learn about animals and plants on a computer, but there is truly nothing like being physically outside surrounded by them. People who love hiking and really enjoy being outdoors are @PERCENT1 smarter than those who don't. I like being outside more than inside, and I have straight A's, which shows that outdoor activities can be beneficial for learning. Sports are also an excellent way to get outside. My favorite sport is baseball, and I'm quite good at it. Some places claim that computers can help with your hand - eye coordination, but how can a computer achieve that? It's sports that truly help you develop hand - eye coordination. Playing sports can also help you build strength. Baseball is the reason I can bench press @NUM1 pounds. @PERCENT2 of kids who play a sport are not overweight, but @PERCENT3 of kids who don't play sports are. Traveling is also a great way to get outside. I love traveling to different places. I am fluent in English, French, and Spanish, which has enhanced my travel experiences. My favorite place to go is northern @CAPS1 in @LOCATION1. Computers can show you pictures of a place, but when you are actually there, it is incredibly fascinating. A picture on a computer cannot even come close to the real - life experience. You also cannot walk on a computer, drink the water from a stream, or climb up a cliff. There is really no comparison. Computers are far worse when it comes to experiencing real nature. Compared to real life and nature, there really is no competition. Computers aren't as good as real life. You can enjoy nature, play sports, and travel the world, all by simply being outside. Thank you for taking the time to read this.
1538	1542	1	3	Do you remember those school projects where you'd sit down, bored, and watch your @CAPS1 stations, or sitting in the doctor's office waiting, bored out of your mind? Well, those days are over! Since the computer was invented, there have been numerous advancements, and all those dull moments are a thing of the past. There was once a time when the only way to do a project on a country was to search through piles of papers until you found something relevant. Now, with computer advancements, you can simply enter a country's name into Google, a well - known search site, and up come @NUM1 pieces of information on that country. In fact, @PERSON1, an expert on computers and the inventor of one of the most advanced computers on earth, says that searching for information is now @PERCENT1 to @PERCENT2 easier, depending on the topic. Also, you no longer have to use a redundant typewriter that always makes mistakes and requires you to retype everything. You can just use @ORGANIZATION1 to type your essay. Anything spelled wrong is underlined in red, so you only rarely have a spelling mistake. As a result of this increase in knowledge, from a learning standpoint, computers are extremely good for mankind. My second reason that computers are extremely good for us is that they are entertaining. On your new laptop, you can visit Miniclip or Addicting Games, both popular gaming websites, and play a variety of games. These games, while being fun, also improve hand - eye coordination, which is helpful for sports, driving, writing, and many other things. More advanced gaming computers called consoles, such as the @CAPS2 - box @NUM2, by @ORGANIZATION1, the @NUM3, the @CAPS3 by the @CAPS4, provide an extreme gaming experience. One of the more recent games for these consoles is called @CAPS5 of @CAPS6! Modern @CAPS7 @NUM4. This game has an online system where you can talk to and play against people all around the world. Not only that, but advanced games such as @CAPS5 of @CAPS6 improve eyesight. Studies show that playing a high - action game @NUM4 hrs a day will improve eyesight more than eating @NUM6 servings of carrots a day. My final reason that computers are good for you is that they make boring waits more bearable. If you've ever been to @CAPS10, you know that the line can be @NUM4 hrs long. People used to just stand there waiting. Now, people can pull out their @CAPS11 or @NUM8 player and listen to music. The @CAPS11 can take videos and pictures as well as play music, videos, and games. If you are lucky enough to have an iTouch, you can check email, stocks, weather, and news right on your @CAPS13, as well as buy songs, which can be @NUM9 cheaper than @CAPS14. In conclusion, all these advantages in technology benefit us greatly. We can now learn about new and exciting things, have fun while improving our eyesight, and make the most of our waiting time.
1539	1543	1	3	Dear local newspaper @CAPS1, I think some people are not using the computer too much. Some people might be using it to talk to their family members. They want to check if they are okay or if there are any problems so that they can be aware. How about if someone in their family passes away and they don't know about it? It could be their parents, grandma, grandpa, aunts, uncles, or even one of their best friends. Some people also might be on their bank account. They use the computer to see if they can withdraw money from the bank. They might also be sending money to their family members by using the computer. They could be paying a bill through the computer, the money they owe to that bank, or they might be doing something else useful. However, I also think some people are using the computer too much. Just like kids, they go on the computer just to play games. That's not good for the little kids because if they keep using the computer all the time, they might not want to get away from it. Then parents will have a very hard time calling their kids to go eat or to go to sleep. That's going to be a difficult task. So, I think some people should go outside to do exercise and enjoy the beauty of nature. I truly believe that people will eventually go outside, do exercise, enjoy nature, and spend more time with their family. And thank you, local newspapers, for providing a platform to share these thoughts. In conclusion, we should strike a balance in our computer use and not neglect the real - life experiences and relationships around us.
1540	1544	1	3	People spend an inordinate amount of time on the computer. A large number of people are on the computer for almost the entire day. Instead, they should be spending quality time with their family and friends. People often find themselves with little to no time for activities that are truly important. Also, the computer should mostly be used for talking with family and friends, doing homework, conducting research, playing games when bored, and for work - related tasks. To begin with, people need to allocate more time to be with their family and friends rather than being glued to the computer. For example, if your mother or father asks you if you want to go out to dinner and you say no because you're on the computer, that clearly shows that you are obsessed with it. A lot of families are being torn apart because people spend excessive time on the computer. If you have a friend over and they say they are bored, but all you do is play games on the computer, that is just plain rude. So, you need to get off the computer and engage with your loved ones. As I previously mentioned about spending time with loved ones, people also need to spend more time doing physical activities. A lot of people sit on the computer and eat, and over time, they gradually gain weight. If you are putting on weight because of your computer use, then you need to go do some activities to shed that extra fat. If you are a teen and you are offered the chance to play a sport but you decline because the computer is more important, then that is a serious obsession with the computer. As a result, the computer should be used in a wise manner. The computer should be used to communicate with family and friends, complete homework, conduct research, do work, and when you're bored, play some simple games. These are probably the most important purposes for which the computer should be used. A lot of these things that I have listed are crucial because if you go on the computer just to idle and watch people talk, then there's no point in wasting your time. For example, if you have homework such as vocabulary and you need definitions, you can go to www.dictionary.com to find them, or if you just need to define a simple word. In conclusion, people are spending far too much time on the computer. They need to focus more on spending time with family and friends and engaging in physical activities. Lastly, you should use the computer for useful things like homework or important research. In short, we should limit our computer use and make the most of our real - life experiences.
1541	1545	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I am aware that many people are stating that people spend too much time on computers and not getting enough exercise. Well, I have noticed that there are a lot of people using computers, and they are getting sufficient use out of them. I'm going to explain why within the next few paragraphs. First, I would like to start off by saying it's good that people are into computers and working with them because that broadens their learning activities. They learn new things, and it will help them be successful in life. People play games, crossword puzzles, riddles, and many more. Some use the internet for ingredients, car parts, etc. Next, using computers is very helpful to the human race because it will impact students, parents/guardians, and teens. It will have an effect, and lots of schools are using computers now, especially for students to do their assignments. It affects parents because it will assist them in life and help them find jobs related to their fields. Finally, they are getting enough exercise because they go to bed, they eat, they go to school, work, or do something for the day that involves walking. Nobody just sits home and does nothing these days. There's always something to do or a place to go. Well, I hope you think about what I told you and take it into consideration. Thank you for your time, and just remember your job is done on the computer too.
1542	1546	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, People use computers all over the world, for one reason or another, but they are very necessary in our world. That is why computers have a good effect on people today. They help us contact distant family members. Kids rely on them for studying or homework. Adults need them for their jobs, like sending emails or typing a proposal. That's why computers have a good effect on us. Like me, many kids have family across the ocean or just across the country. Either way, contacting them is tough. Calling them in @MONTH1 can be expensive in most cases, and sending letters certainly takes too much time to reach them. With email, the message will be sent quickly and for free. You can also have conversations through email with no problem. Another very effective way to contact family is through Skype or a webcam. This way, you can see your family from miles away in the comfort of your own home. Computers help kids too. Kids like me always have homework on the computer. It could be typing up a final draft of a paper or taking notes on a historical figure. Either way, they both require a computer. Sure, there are books to take notes on people, but do books type up papers? Kids and teenagers can also use them for studying. I constantly use the computer to practice Spanish by using a website with worksheets and flashcards to help me. Computers not only help kids, they help adults too. Many adults in @LOCATION1 and other countries are business men and women. They are constantly sending emails, typing proposals, and all those things. And without a computer, all that would be very challenging. Business men are not the only ones doing that though. My father, an electrician, has to send out emails and documents about his latest project several times a week. Aside from work, we use them in our everyday lives. For example, ordering clothes and toys, but most popular is doing your taxes online. It is quicker, easier, and that is why @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2 finish their taxes online. Computers have a good effect for people of this age. Not only is that my opinion, it is also more of a fact. They help us stay connected with distant relatives, help our children stay on top in school, and help our parents and other adults in their jobs in everyday lives. Not only are they helpful, but they are necessary, and I hope you agree with me.
1543	1547	1	3	Dear local Newspaper? Today I am writing this letter to you on a computer. I believe that the people who don't have computers have the right to say that people are online rather than exercising. My three topics are that they teach hand - eye coordination, give people the ability to learn, and allow people to communicate. First, the computers aren't just for entertainment! They teach hand - eye coordination. If people were to believe that computers are just for fun, they would be wrong. They teach you how to type and take some lessons on typing without looking at the keyboard. Secondly, it gives people the ability to learn about other cultures or where a place is. @PERCENT1 out of the American population are online, learning, and the @PERCENT2 are online for a job - related purpose. What about little kids? I'm sure parents buy them educational games for online use. Finally, it gives people the ability to communicate with other people. If there's a school closing or a delay, you can find out that information quickly. People can check out what's going on around the world or check for the weather. These are my reasons why I truly believe that people should be online at least twice a week.
1544	1548	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 don't have a negative affect on people because you can play a variety of games, web - chat with friends, and watch hilarious videos on the computers. Also, you can use the computers for a research project or you can use the @CAPS2 to find some facts on @CAPS3 people like @PERSON2, @PERSON1, and @LOCATION1. Also, who would want to get off their @CAPS2 and exercise? Exercising is so boring and lame. Second, who would like to especially enjoy the nature? Walking through the woods is so boring. You'll be walking through mud, ticks will be all over your body, and mosquitoes will try and bite you when you sweat. When kids get older, they mostly don't want to interact or spend time with their family. They want to spend time with their friends every day. Also, they mostly want to use technology to communicate. Kids will spend time texting on their cellphones when they're not in the mood for calling. Thirdly, computers do give you hand - eye coordination. It teaches you how to type without looking down at the keyboard. Computers also teach you how to set your fingers on the home row for the keyboard. Finally, @CAPS2 really do benefit society because you can use this technology in middle school, high school, and through college. When you get older, you'll be learning more about these kinds of technology. Also, kids could teach their parents how to use computers if their parents don't know how to. Teaching your parents how to use @CAPS2 is a great responsibility for your actions, and it shows the positive side of this technology.
1545	1549	1	3	To whomever this @MONTH1 concerns, @ORGANIZATION1, almost everyone has them. Computers can make it easier to find certain places by using search engines such as @CAPS1 or @CAPS2. They are also a great way of communication. I believe people using computers does benefit society because scientists use computers every day, to make the plans to send a ship into space or to keep track of an experiment's progress. Computers help people stay organized. A lot of teens and kids use their computers to shop and stay in touch with friends. Some people believe people spend too much time on computers. That @MONTH1 be true, but also remember what it's doing for society. When people spend less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends, it's a personal choice. It's not like they are being forced by the @ORGANIZATION1. In conclusion, the benefits of computers for society clearly outweigh the possible drawbacks of over - usage.
1546	1550	1	3	Dear local Newspaper, nowadays, many people use computers, but not everyone agrees that it benefits society. In my opinion, computers bring numerous benefits to society. There are countless useful websites that can help you find all kinds of information. Computers also enable people to work more efficiently and easily. A third reason is that numerous companies are able to use them to expand their business and gain more customers. If you are doing a project or need to look up information about something, the internet is one of the easiest and quickest ways to find that information. Google.com has an extensive amount of information about almost any topic you can think of. If you are a teenager that doesn't have a driver's license and there is no one to take you to the library, computers allow you to be able to hand in the report/project on time. There are also websites that can find you directions to where you need to go. Mapquest.com is a quick and easy way to help you figure out which way to go. Computers allow people to stay connected easily. If your family member lives far away and you don't have enough money for the phone bill, computers help you to not lose touch. There are websites that can help you keep in contact with old friends that you don't see anymore. Computers are one of the only ways that people fighting in the wars can talk to their relatives. They are not able to have phones and sending a letter can take a long time. Companies use computers for easy access to the public. If you are a new company, you can put a little ad on the side of the screen on yahoo.com and millions of people will see it. They also use computers to make flyers easily and quickly. Making a hundred flyers by hand can take hours. But on the computers all you have to do is make one and then you can print out one - hundred. Using computers helps society in many ways. You can easily find what you are looking for and you are able to talk to anyone you want. Also, it is easy for companies to attract business. Those are only a few of the significant reasons why computers are good for society, and it's clear that computers have become an indispensable part of our modern society.
1547	1551	1	3	"Dear local newspaper - I understand that computers are becoming more of a ""must - have"" in people's everyday life. I believe this is a great thing! If you're on the computer, you type, which helps improve people's hand - eye coordination. Also, you can learn more about people, places, cultures, and much more. Lastly, you can communicate online with other friends or even meet new people. To begin, I think having computers is a good idea because it helps people improve on their hand - eye coordination. My cousin @PERSON3, who is a big - time baseball player, used to have trouble catching the ball when he was younger. He kept trying over and over again and never gave up. Then, for his birthday, his parents bought him a computer! He was so excited, but when it came to typing papers, he wasn't the best. Not only did he practice baseball but also typing. His family realized that buying him that computer was one of the best ideas. It improved his baseball career (by enhancing his skills in throwing and catching the ball) and increased his grades in school. However, @PERSON3 is not the only one that has gained hand - eye coordination from computers. A recent study from Yale College shows that @PERCENT1 of people that use the computer for at least a month gains some sort of hand - eye coordination. @PERSON1, a teacher of the computer class at high school states, ""@CAPS1 freshman that I get in my class tells me that computers have made their sports careers easier because they now have better hand - eye coordination."" Computers have two things in one: you learn to type and help your hand - eye coordination. Do you want your @CAPS3 to be lacking that positive ability in life? In addition, computers help you learn more about people, places, and cultures. I heard a couple of nights ago that @ORGANIZATION2 had an earthquake. I also learned about the power - plant explosion in @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1. How do I know all of this you ask? The front page on @CAPS2.com! But, I'm not the only one who has gained this knowledge from the internet; so many more have too. @ORGANIZATION1 took a poll about how many @CAPS3 use the computer to do research, and @PERCENT2 answered that they did. Does the society really want to take away @CAPS3's knowledge of what's going on around us and our history? In conclusion, people can communicate with friends and relatives. This is great if you haven't seen them recently, or if you want to just stay in touch. For example, @PERSON4, my cousin, just found me on Facebook. I haven't seen her for eight years, but now I talk to her all the time. We talk about visiting each other and how our families are doing. But, you can also talk to your friends too. Studies show that @PERCENT3 of @CAPS3 between the ages of eleven and eighteen talk to their friends over Facebook on a daily basis. Dr. @PERSON2, a teen psychiatrist, says ""I think this is a great idea for @CAPS3 to communicate with other @CAPS3 through the computer. It gives them the chance to interact in a different way."" Computers offer so many positive aspects, and it's evident that they play a crucial role in our lives."
1548	1552	1	3	Dear: local newspaper I agree with experts that said that computers should be used because I believe that people do need computers as they are important. The computers search fast, and people can communicate using the computer. People have computers at their houses because we all need them. Sometimes, you may take minutes to find a word, but if you look it up on the computer, you will see the result in a second. In this way, we should stay with computers, and more @CAPS1 need computers. This is very important for @CAPS1 because sometimes they do not understand something, and they can look it up on the computer. For instance, if we have a homework assignment and we have to know about an important person, it's easy to look it up on the computer. Some people do not have a computer at home. But they go to places like libraries to use the computer for the things they need. We have to think about spending time with our family. But we also have to use the computer because we need it. Some people play games on the computer. But it's also important for homework, and some people at their jobs need computers. Most of the occupations need computers. For example, if one wants to be a police officer, the police officers have a little computer in their car to search for stores and other important information, and that's crucial for their work. I know that most families want to be together and spend time with each other, but we also have to think about our future. We need computers that can help us, and we need them for a better future. And that's my opinion, and I hope that you agree with my words as computers are truly beneficial for our daily lives and future development.
1549	1553	1	3	"Dear local newspaper: As you being the local newspaper, you have the power to express how you feel about the effects computers give to people. I believe that computers give great effects to people because it teaches hand - eye coordination, gives people the ability to learn about far - away places, and it allows you to talk to people. In all, @PERCENT1 of people agree with my idea about computers. Firstly, using computers teaches people about hand - eye coordination. For example, my grandmother told me that she knows how to use her hands and eyes well because of using the computer. This is because she types and researches information all day long. In all, computers are designed to help your eyes and hands to focus more precisely. Secondly, computers have a lot of interesting information on far - away places. @PERSON1 from @ORGANIZATION1 quotes, ""I always use computers for my work because it helps me learn about many new things. Moreover, it lets my wife and I search details about a trip we want to go on."" Also, the people agree with what @PERSON1 stated. However, some people @MONTH1 say that computers give the wrong information many times, but if you find a reliable and wonderful website, it will never lie to you. Thirdly, if you use computers, it will let you talk online or video chat with friends or family all over the world. How this benefits you is because if you have not seen your relatives in ages and you cannot buy a ticket to visit them, then you can video chat. It has gotten people so much closer, and you see the world in a whole different way. Instead of wasting all your cell phone minutes, go buy a laptop or computer with a camera on it so you can video chat. Lastly, taking to people and being active in other people's lives is important. In conclusion, you will have great eye coordination, you will be able to research far - away places, and you will always be allowed to video chat or talk to family online. I want you to tell the whole world that computers are useful, and people use them every day without a problem. Lastly, you will have the best feeling ever if you make everyone smile by knowing you believe that spending time on the computer can teach you a lot, and it enriches our lives in many ways."
1550	1554	1	3	Computers? Have you ever thought of how a computer is made or how every small part of a computer is installed? Well, unfortunately, I don't have the answers to these questions, but I do have another question for you to think about. Are computers bad for you? Well, I think that they aren't because first of all, they teach us hand - eye coordination, give people the chance to learn about places and people that they have never seen or even heard of, and lastly, they allow people to talk to far - away relatives or friends without ever having to go to them. As I was saying before, the computer gives people good eye - coordination. For example, people usually are not very good at catching a ball at first, but of course, if you keep on practicing, you will get better. Same thing with the computer; at first, you aren't very good or fast at typing, but if you keep practicing, you will gradually get quicker at it. Then this good habit will help you while you're at school or at work. Second, the computer gives people the ability to learn about places or people that they have never seen or heard about. For example, some people might have yet not heard of the waterfalls, trails, or foods from @ORGANIZATION1. Another example is that maybe some people might not know that the belly dance came from @LOCATION1 or the big dragon legends came from @LOCATION2. The excellent source to find out all these things in a quick amount of time without having to travel far is the computer. The computer is also excellent for elderly people who are in wheelchairs and can't take too much physical exertion. Lastly, it lets people talk to far - away relatives or family members online. This is better because then maybe a father went on a business trip to another country, and talking on the phone can be expensive, and you can forget about sending letters which take a long time. It is always nice to greet a father, a mother, or even a distant cousin online where you can see how much they have grown. I hope you have taken my side on this judgment as it is very important to me. Please remember my three reasons, and don't forget that computers bring these wonderful benefits to all of us, making our lives more convenient and knowledge - rich.
1551	1555	1	3	Computers can be used for anything, but sometimes people use them for illegal things. For example, some music sites are illegal, and people may download unauthorized content off the internet. Meeting people over the internet can also be dangerous because some individuals lie about their age or post fake pictures of themselves. We should be cautious when using computers to avoid getting involved in illegal activities and protect ourselves from potential online risks.
1552	1556	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, Computers play a huge role in society. Many adults and children spend a significant amount of time on a computer every day, and I firmly believe that this is detrimental. Instead of being glued to computers, it would be far better to spend quality time with your family. Engaging in exercise and enjoying the outdoors are also excellent time - consuming activities. Studying, completing school work, and fulfilling job responsibilities are important tasks that people should prioritize over excessive computer use. Family is truly precious in life, yet some people take it for granted. Instead of being on the computer all day, staying at home with family and participating in activities with them can be much more enjoyable. For instance, most teenagers come home from school and immediately turn on the computer to chat with friends or play games, rather than having a conversation with their parents about their day. By spending time with family, you not only get to know them better but also strengthen your bond and can communicate openly about anything. Nature is a magnificent creation. While you can view pictures of nature on the internet, it is nothing compared to experiencing the real thing. By going outside, taking walks, runs, or hikes, you can get the necessary exercise. Exercise is crucial for a person's well - being as you need to be fit to stay healthy, which won't happen if you're on a computer all the time. Adults and even some teenagers have jobs. Although some jobs involve computers, the majority do not. No one can land a job by spending all day playing games on the computer. There are plenty of important activities, such as spending time with family, enjoying nature, and focusing on school work and jobs. Computers are not an absolute necessity in our lives, so I think we should limit our use of them.
1553	1557	1	3	"Dear Local Newspaper, I'm tired of seeing lazy people sitting in front of their computers and wasting their lives because of it. The issue at hand is whether people are spending too much time on the computer. I strongly believe that they are. Here are several reasons why: people are spending less time exercising, not enjoying nature, and having less interaction with family and friends. Without a doubt, you're aware that exercise is at least somewhat beneficial to life. However, if people are sitting at home all day, glued to the computer with no physical activity, they will gain an excessive amount of weight. The more they just sit around and do nothing but stare at the computer, the more lethargic and lazy they will become. They'll lose the motivation to do anything, and it's truly a waste of life. In some cases, it can even lead to depression. Just ask a local resident who says, ""My mom used to be on the computer all the time and did nothing with her life,"" and eventually, she became depressed and, soon after, took her own life. If this trend continues, more and more people will end up like this. I know that many people enjoy being outside on a nice sunny day. But imagine someone spending that beautiful day in a room, with their eyes fixed on the computer screen because they can't think of anything else to do with their lives. If that was someone you loved, I'm sure you'd try to help them get off that self - destructive path. Just ask another local resident @PERSON1 who says, ""I remember coming home every day, and there was my mom, no shades up, the room was pitch black, it was like a dark cave, and she would sit there for hours on the computer, wasting her life. I remember asking her how long it had been since she'd gone outside, and she answered that it had been almost two months."" This excessive computer use is a real problem, and we need to take steps to prevent more people from falling into this trap."
1554	1558	1	3	@PERCENT1 of all people in the @LOCATION3 own computers. This statistic clearly shows how many people appreciate the technological advancement of the computer. It enables us to communicate more effectively, obtain information more rapidly, and provides entertainment. Computers have a highly positive impact on us. With the invention of the computer, an increasing number of people can communicate more quickly and easily. For example, if you want to talk to a friend in @LOCATION1, all you need to do is log on to a social networking site and start a conversation. Also, if you have relatives living across the country, you can use a webcam to have a face - to - face chat with them. When you can communicate with people from around the world, you can learn a great deal about other countries' cultures and different cities' ways of life. Moreover, if a relative is away, you can still keep in touch with your uncle or grandma, and your relationship will only grow stronger. The internet and computers are a vast source of information. With all the search engines available on the internet, you can find out how tall a maple tree is or how to lose weight. Some may argue that sitting still while learning is bad, but you can search for family activities, nature walks, and new and exciting exercises. When students need information for a school project, they can simply search for it online instead of making a trip to the library. As a result of the internet, people are becoming more knowledgeable. Thanks to the internet, boredom is almost a thing of the past. Both kids and adults are no longer bored. Boredom is harmful because kids will do anything to get rid of it. Since the advent of the computer, people can play games, watch TV shows and movies, and conduct business. If you miss your favorite TV show, you can go online and watch it. If you need to send a message to someone in @LOCATION2, email comes in handy, and your communication will never be delayed. Additionally, you can play numerous games on the internet to improve your eye - hand coordination. With all these wonderful benefits, we can all live in a happier and better world. Information is more accessible, communication is more efficient, and entertainment is more diverse. We are truly in a very good technological era.
1555	1559	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper: I'm @PERSON1, and I'm going to tell you about the positives and negatives of computers. First, let me share some of the positives. The internet is a virtual treasure trove at your fingertips, providing answers to the most complex questions. Using the internet is incredibly easy; all you need to do is learn how to use a keyboard and a mouse. Computers have evolved over the years. There are popular chatting websites like @CAPS3, Facebook, Twitter, and Flickr. It all seems really cool, but the internet also has a very dark side. Second, here are some of the dark secrets of the computer. So far in the news, there have been reports of teenage suicides. For example, girls have killed themselves due to a lack of self - confidence, and boys have done the same for various reasons. We live in a world where everyone is often judged by their appearance. Well, there you have it. Computers have both good and bad aspects, and we just have to be more cautious and discerning when using them.
1556	1560	1	3	"Dear newspaper, @CAPS1, do you really want people to be so engrossed by a computer that they miss out on the world around them? @CAPS1, do you want the kids in @LOCATION1 to spend hours each day on the computers playing games while they could be outside breathing fresh air? The question then is, @CAPS1, do computers have good effects or bad effects on people? The obvious answer is a bad effect. People constantly using the computers develop bad habits and can search for inappropriate things. If people are always playing games on the computers, then when @CAPS1 they go out for a jog, the answer is never. People who are constantly on the computer don't get enough exercise. One reason why a lot of people in @LOCATION1 are obese is because they aren't getting enough exercise. Computers aren't helping this situation at all. Some people say, ""@CAPS2 I'll just spend an hour on the computer and then I will go work out."" But, the one hour on the computer turns into two hours, and then two hours turns into three. Before you know it, you've wasted the whole day on the computer and didn't exercise at all. Also, there are so many games on the computer now that can be really addictive, and you don't want to stop playing them. Yes, some games can be really entertaining, but you don't have to spend all day playing them. You can play a fun game for fifteen minutes and then go get some air. As you can see, computers can mesmerize a lot of people so they don't get enough exercise. Second, people develop bad habits. For example, kids are always on the website chatting with their friends. On the computer, the problem is that people don't use proper grammar. They get too used to writing like that. Then, kids in @MONTH1 start doing that when writing in school, and most don't even know it. Also, there are new websites where you can put personal information about yourself. This makes it easy for strangers to learn your details. Lastly, it is very easy for people, even kids, to search for inappropriate things. Everything is on the internet, and little kids are going to be very curious about it. They can search for inappropriate words and pictures, and no one would ever know. People can post inappropriate information on their own profiles for others to see, and it can be impossible to take it down. And, if parents don't know that their children are searching inappropriate things, then the kids are going to keep doing it because they know they won't get caught. So, as you can see, computers have a very negative effect on people. It causes individuals to easily access inappropriate things. So go and limit the time you spend on the computer."
1557	1561	1	3	Dear Local @CAPS1, @CAPS2, how do you feel about computers? Are they good or are they bad? I strongly believe that computers are bad and people spend too much time on them. I'd much rather spend time outside where I can exercise; @CAPS3, wouldn't you? Computers are a waste of time and they keep family and friends from spending quality time together. Finally, computers can be very dangerous. People could be lying, and you @CAPS3 wouldn't know it. To start off, computers take away from exercising and spending time outside. I know if I had to choose between looking at a boring computer screen all day and going out for a brisk run, I'd choose the run any day. Computers don't keep people fit and healthy, so they should find something else to do instead. I've observed that the average teen spends @NUM1 to @NUM2 hours a day on the computer. That's @NUM1 to @NUM2 hours they could be exercising or playing outside, like walking the dog, or kicking the soccer ball around in the yard. You see, there are many things you can do other than going on the computer. Furthermore, computers cut into quality time with friends and family. I know you can video chat and instant message them, but @CAPS3, wouldn't you rather spend time with them in person? Too many kids are on the computer so much they don't know what's going on in their mom or dad's lives. There are a lot of things kids can do with their friends and families instead of using the computer. They could play a board game, watch a movie together, and much more. I guarantee they will enjoy these activities more than staring at a computer screen for @NUM5 hours. Finally, computers are extremely dangerous. People have been killed because they don't know who they are talking to. Kids go on MySpace and put up pictures and posts, but they don't realize that everyone can see what they said. Once they put something out there, they cannot take it away. It's also dangerous because if someone is applying to a school, that school can see what they put up and can decline the person from college. I hope you agree with me when I say computers are bad. They keep people from exercising, spending time with friends/family, and are very dangerous. In my opinion, we should get rid of computers in every house to lead healthier and safer lives.
1558	1562	1	3	The importance of computers in the modern world. Computers nowadays are popular technology. Nowadays, computers are like a super - sized calculator. The invention of the computers was initially as a very simple calculator. It's like having a helpful assistant in your house. A lot of people own different types of computers. These computers are more improved, faster, and of higher quality. The computers nowadays are continuously improving their technology. Every day, billions of people around the world are buying computers. But that does not mean that they are all of the best quality. People are constantly striving for better, more modern inventions. In conclusion, computers have become an integral part of our lives, and their development and popularity show no signs of slowing down as we continue to seek more advanced and useful models.
1559	1563	1	3	Computers, one of the daily things we use and interact with. Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time indulging in the awesomeness of the computers! I love computers, but as a teen, I know about managing your time on the computer. You cannot just sit there and waste your precious time on the computer. The amount of time wasted on your computer could be the time you might be outside having a great time. There are lots of things you could do outside! As for some examples: play ball, run around freely, go to the park and enjoy the scenery, go exploring in the nearby woods etc... Friends and family are very entertaining. I have lots of friends, and I love them all! If you have some spare time, you should hang out with them and have some fun. You could go to the mall and window - shop or try out new restaurants! I always go to the mall with my friends instead of playing on the computer for hours on end. So get off the computer and go outside! Have some fun in the sun today and make the most of your time.
1560	1564	1	3	I disagree with what people say about computers. Of course, they teach hand - eye coordination. But they are not good enough for people. Let's find out what I have to say to these people who think that computers have a positive effect on people. People are so overweight! Wonder why. Because they spend too much time on computers and less time exercising. Anyway, @PERCENT1 of @LOCATION1 is obese. It's a fact that some people die each year due to being overweight. Think of it this way, baseball players and other athletes can earn about @NUM1 to @MONEY1 a year. Isn't that what you want to be, millionaires? Isn't nature so great when you experience it? Well, I think so because people don't think before chopping down trees. Think about the animals. Don't you think they suffer enough torture every year? Computers are such a bad influence on people again because people need to experience real life and not sit behind a desk or at home being lazy. MySpace, Facebook, and all the other crazy sites on the web are not good. There are sexual predators all over the world that like to target kids and teenagers like us at Batchelder. You should not interact with friends on the internet for that reason. You should get some exercise at the park with your friends and family. Also, it's better to talk to new friends in person because you can get to know them better as you grow up. There are many reasons why computers are bad and sometimes even worse. Don't use computers for stupid reasons. Otherwise, you might get yourself into serious trouble or even killed. It makes you so lethargic that you won't be able to walk properly. Just keep that in mind, people. In conclusion, we should be very cautious about our computer use and prioritize real - life experiences and safety.
1561	1565	1	3	Dear, local newspaper people @CAPS1's lot of computers that have helped us with our planet. For instance, they've enabled initiatives like not letting us drive our cars for certain things. Learning was easier for everyone with computers too. We could access vast amounts of knowledge at our fingertips. Then, having communications with people became seamless with computers. We shouldn't hate a box that has information in it; we should be glad we have something like that in our home. Why we don't need our cars sometimes if we have a computer. Like some people have decided that they can have @CAPS1 own business, so they use the computer to make one. Then, if you don't want to waste time driving to buy a t - shirt, you can just go on the computer and buy one. Next, the more we drive, the more pollution gets in our atmosphere. If we did not have computers, our planet will get @PERCENT1 more polluted each year. Now, do you want that to happen to the world? Last, we won't be wasting gas on our cars because we are using computers. If the computer was taken away, people will still choose the lazy way and just drive cars. Learning is easier for everyone with computers. Like we don't have to look in a book to find something. Then there are @CAPS1 different learning programs to teach us a different language. For lots of people, it's like having college - level resources at home, even for those who didn't attend college. Last, it can help us do our homework if we have it. I really consider it my second brain. Now, a lot of people are realizing its benefits. Third, communication is going to be a whole lot better with computers. Say you don't have a landline and you need to send a lot of messages. The computer can help you. It will allow you to talk to others, then you can talk to other people like the Japanese who know English so you know how @CAPS1 life compares to yours. You can ask people questions. Or just for fun, you can play mind games with other people. I got to do a lot of chatting with my old friends by this, and I miss them, but if the only way I can talk to them without my parents yelling at me because the phone bill is so high. The greater good of a computer makes us know we don't have to do that many harmful things like pollute our air. Then we can learn fast without a book. Last, it allows us to talk to my old friends. So, can everyone believe me that the computer is not that bad?
1562	1566	1	3	"Hello my name is @PERSON1 @CAPS1 and I am going to convince you that computers can benefit our society. First, @CAPS3 allows students to easily get good grades on projects and reports. Second, you can make online job applications. Lastly, computers allow people to chat with other people. Firstly, the computer allows your children who are also students to do better on their projects and reports. They help children's reports because, for example, if they are doing a report on ""@CAPS2 Lincoln"", they have access to look up the person to get the information they need right at home. When doing reports with their computer, there is no need to use up your precious time in the library. You can also look up information and print out pictures to make your project more vibrant and eye - catching, especially to younger people. Also, @CAPS3 allows you to type your information neatly, making @CAPS3 look organized and presentable. Accordingly, if you are trying to find some job applications without wasting your time, just look on the internet. This way, you won't go to a place not knowing if jobs are available and seeing none. Also, @CAPS3 saves you the trip out there. You are able to look up the pay of the job and its regulations, and you can find out if you get the job faster. Lastly, @CAPS3 allows socializing. For example, platforms like Facebook or/and MySpace let you talk to friends from school or friends you met online. For adults who don't have a MySpace or Facebook account, they can use email, MSN, AOL, AIM/AOL Instant Messenger, or via chat. This way, adults can catch up on work - related conversations and children can keep in touch with friends or/and family. This is why @CAPS3 think computers with internet benefit our society in terms of projects, reports, job applications, and socializing with family and friends. In conclusion, it's clear that computers play a vital role in enhancing different aspects of our lives and should be embraced for their positive contributions."
1563	1567	1	3	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @DATE1, everywhere you look, technology is being exercised, and it is beneficial to many aspects of our lives @DATE1. Many engineers strive to improve the popularity of technological devices, while others use it to communicate or relax. A study conducted by @ORGANIZATION2 university shows that the computer is the most widely - used machine. The computer positively contributes to our education, economy, and entertainment. As I mentioned before, the computer is beneficial to our education. An example of this is the school I attend, a middle school. Here, we have over @NUM1 computers in use throughout the school day. These computers help the students complete research papers, typed assignments, and other teacher - required papers. By using the computer to complete research papers, students save hours of scanning through books in the library and money on purchasing reading materials. In addition, computers help teachers in organizing files and entering grades online so students can check their progress. This is beneficial considering the large number of assignments graded each week. Moreover, a computer - based system called the ""parent portal"" allows the students to stay connected with school events that would not be mentioned otherwise. In all, computers are an effective way of enhancing education. Besides education, computers touch upon our economy as well. Now, due to the wide variety of computer selection, a computer is affordable, starting at prices as low as sixty dollars! This is a positive aspect of the computer because currently, the country has been enduring economic hardships since the depression in the past. Consequently, the economic situation has made families start to cut many useful technological devices out of their budgets. However, since the price of computers decreased, purchases have been stimulated. Also, the computer has mainly improved methods of entertainment. Instead of just listening to a CD player, you can download music and listen to it while chatting online with friends. This is very helpful for last - minute plan changes, because for those who do not own a telephone, communication can be difficult, negatively affecting your time of entertainment. In addition, children can use the internet in order to play games to take their minds off a hard day at school, or an adult can unwind after a rough workday. Computers are also involved in producing the movies you watch at home on the couch and the video - game you ordered off of eBay. From Facebook and MySpace, to classic movies like ""Gone with the Wind."" Computers create a relaxing entertainment opportunity. In conclusion, computers have far - reaching positive impacts on education, economy, and entertainment, and are an indispensable part of modern life."
1564	1568	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, I think that computers are having bad effects on people's lives. Instead of using your time wisely and getting active outdoors, you're inside your house on the computer playing games or chatting with your friends. If you're one of those people who easily get overweight or are on any diabetic medication right now, I'd strongly recommend you to do a workout or go and invite a friend over for a walk at the park. That way, you are enjoying nature, having a real - life conversation with your buddy instead of doing it online, and you'd also be getting exercise. If you didn't notice, you are also doing your friend a favor too. Not only are you getting good benefits from being outdoors, but so is your partner. Getting more active can even bring your friendship or family bond even closer. You might also improve your self - esteem because you'll look in the mirror and feel great about your new, healthy - looking body. Also, if you're one of those people who are always depressed, feeling lonely, or just in a bad mood, this advice could be the key to your solution. The workouts and activities help you have more energy than you ever thought you'd have before. If I were you, I'd stop being lazy and actually enjoy your life and not waste time sitting in front of the computer. In conclusion, it's clear that the excessive use of computers is taking a toll on our physical and mental well - being, and we should prioritize real - life activities.
1565	1569	1	3	The effects computers have on people are not reasonable for children and other people. Computers are not good for people these days because people are spending all their time on the computer and aren't really realizing that it messes up their eyes, and some people are addicted to it. Now, people are using the computer as if it's an essential, mindless activity. Some people think that the computers aren't hurtful to their eyes. But the time people are spending on the computer, they could be spending time with their family and friends. People aren't being as helpful as they could be when they're glued to the computer. People shouldn't be using computers like they do because spending all day on the computer can mess up your eyes, and that's what people are not understanding these days. I think that there should be a limit for when people go on the computers. In conclusion, setting a limit on computer use is necessary to protect our eyesight and to ensure that we maintain healthy social relationships.
1566	1570	1	3	Yes, I believe that computers benefit society because you can talk to other people, it helps you learn, and lastly, computers are a part of today's technology. First of all, computers have really progressed from the old typewriter we used to have. Computers have helped today's life for a few different reasons. With computers, they help us learn or find things we didn't know. For example, if you have a project due on the @LOCATION1, then most likely you're probably not going to know much about it. If you go to the internet, then you can find tons of things about it, like who and what needs the @ORGANIZATION1 for water, how long the @LOCATION1 is, where it's located, or anything else about it. Also, another reason why computers help us learn is that, say you're going to a new job interview and you have no idea where it is or how even to get there. If you type in the address, the internet will give you directions. Even if you don't know when your favorite show is on tonight, just type that in and the answer will be right in front of you. Secondly, why I believe that computers do benefit society is you can talk to other people from across the state, country, or world, or even just down the street. Facebook and @CAPS1 are very helpful as well. One of my best friends moved away in second grade. Just before about Christmas, I found her on Facebook, and now we talk and catch up because we haven't seen each other in years. It's great to be able to just talk to her. Another reason why is that if someone's mom or dad is away at war or overseas, then the kids and parents could talk to them by using email, Skype, Yahoo Instant Messenger, with the webcam or the telephone, just by typing back and forth. You could also just use it for a job business to talk to your co - worker or one of your workers on webcam to see how things are going with profit, stores, etc. Lastly, why I think computers actually do help us is technology has come a long way. For example, if you had to type something up, you would have had to use a typewriter, and those things are hard to use. Today, you just have to go onto @CAPS3 @CAPS4 and type it out. @CAPS3 @CAPS4 also has spell - check, you could email it to someone, or even change the font, color, size of the font, and much more. Another reason why is with iPhones or iTouches now, you don't have to be at home; you could take out either one and just use the internet for whatever you want to. To find an app, find how long the @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7 is, or even just to order a pizza. Technology has come a long way. So, this is why I agree that computers help benefit our society because you can talk to other people, it helps you learn new things you didn't know before, and finally, computers have changed a lot and they are a part of our technology. In conclusion, computers have become an indispensable part of our lives, bringing convenience in communication, learning, and various daily tasks, truly benefiting our society.
1567	1571	1	3	In my own opinion, I think that people should get less time on computers and more time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. If people spend too much time on computers, they will not get off and be stuck on them instead of spending time going to the park, or the mall. However, for my second thought, people should not get off of computers because if they ever leave somewhere far, they may not be able to contact you. If you are on the computer, you could get a laptop that says it's free, and then you could take it far, like on an airplane to North Carolina, or Virginia, or Washington @ORGANIZATION1, or to a party, or on a road trip, or on a ferry boat to the Long Island Sound. For my third consideration, I agree people should not be off of the computer because they might plan a trip to a far - away place, a new house, or plan an anniversary, or a new spot for a honeymoon, a gorgeous place like on a peak hill or at a hotel with a bed shaped like a heart. For my fourth point, I agree that people should not be off of computers as it can count a location other than a person's house or a location where they might be for that particular spot where that person is. For the fifth aspect, I agree that people should not be able to get off of computers. Let me tell you why. You could be planning a birthday party for your child, or going to someone's house for a visit, like to Tennessee. Or going to @CAPS2 @CAPS3 to see a basketball team and @CAPS1.S another team, and they are called the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 Lakers and us Cavaliers. In conclusion, considering all these aspects, people should not be able to get off of the computer as it offers so many conveniences in various aspects of life.
1568	1572	1	3	Dear to @CAPS1, regarding this @MONTH1 concern, Computers do a whole lot nowadays. You can play games, do homework, socialize, but don't you think there are better things than that? Such as exercising, enjoying the beauty of nature, and most importantly, interacting with family and friends. These are all the things that computers take away from people. Once you get onto a computer, you never want to get off. If you look at it, it doesn't take much work and energy to use a computer. So, if you eat and use the computer all day, you're not really burning any calories; therefore, you will gain weight. Computers make people feel lazy sometimes, and as a result, they spend less time exercising. That is not good for your health at all. Exercising gives you energy and is good for you. Have you ever looked out the window and saw how beautiful nature is? When you're on the computer chit - chatting with people and playing online games, do you think about what you're missing? Every time I use the computer, I wish I could be outside playing and enjoying nature. Trees, flowers, plants, grass, and lots of other things are what make up the earth, but some people don't appreciate those things. So, next time you're on the computer, think about that. While you're on the computer wasting time, there is another homeless child wandering, maybe looking for their family. Would you like to be that child who doesn't have a family or any type of friends? Lots of people think of their life without a family, but it can happen any day. So, I believe instead of wasting time on the computer, we should go and interact with family and friends. Even if it's just having a conversation, do it. Maybe it can show them that you really care. In conclusion, I think that computers are a waste of time. I understand how people say it is used to communicate with people, but back then they didn't have computers and they communicated, so we can too. Computers make you spend less time exercising, keep you from enjoying nature, and lastly, interacting with family and friends. You won't go wrong if you listen to someone who uses a computer every day. So, let's step away from the computer and embrace a more fulfilling life.
1569	1573	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, how are you? As for me, I am fine. I am writing this letter to explain to you why you should believe that computers have a positive effect on people. The reasons why I am writing this letter are that people could contact with friends and families from far - away places, computers help you learn more about different parts of the world, and also computers help people understand and learn more about life. That's why I believe you should believe that computers have a positive effect on people. First of all, why I believe that computers have a positive effect on people is that people could contact with friends and families from far - away places. An example to support my reason is that people from all parts of the world have families in different places. And they cannot have a good contact with them. But if they go on the internet, they could reach their friends and families and chat with them. This shows that if you live in the @LOCATION2 and you have a friend that lives in @LOCATION1, you could have a great time chatting. I have families that live in @LOCATION1, and it is hard to reach them. But when I am on the computer, I can chat with them and have a fun time. This shows that you need a computer to catch up with friends and family. That's why I believe that computers have a positive effect on people. Second of all, why you should believe that computers have a positive effect on people is that computers help you learn more about different parts of the world. An example is that if you don't know anything about a country or a place, you could go on the internet and research and learn more about that place. This shows that having a computer is important. Another example is that when I have a project or an essay and I don't know about it, I could go on the computer and look it up. And by doing this, it will help me on my project or essay. That's why I believe that computers have a positive effect on people. Finally, why I believe so is that computers help you understand and learn more about life. An example is that if you don't know if something is right or wrong, you could look it up, and it @MONTH1 help you. This shows that computers can give advice. Another example is that computers could give you an idea on what to do. If you are trying a new recipe and you are not sure how to make it, it will give you the ingredients and directions to make that food or snack you want. In conclusion, considering all these benefits, it is clear that computers have a positive effect on people, enabling communication, learning, and providing life - related guidance.
1570	1574	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @ORGANIZATION2, I have recently learned that the paper has decided to write about computers and how they benefit society in @LOCATION1. I am writing this letter to say that I agree with how computers benefit society. The first reason is that computers help people educate others. They allow people to learn about hand - eye coordination. The final reason is that computers allow you to talk online with your friends. There's a lot more in store, so keep reading on. The first reason why computers are good for society is that computers help people learn about things. To start things off, computers are a great way to help out in school because it's a quicker way to get an education. For example, a computer helps you study for a test with information websites like @ORGANIZATION1. The second reason why computers provide a good education is that computers help you do your homework. For example, when there's a major essay due the next day, you can go on a computer and type it. It's quicker and a lot more productive. I remember this one time when I had to write a final draft for an important essay, and it was the last day to do it. Since it was the last day to do it, the first thing I did was go to the library and type it. What would have taken me an hour to write took me half an hour to type. That's all for this point; I'm moving on. The next reason why computers help out in society is that computers help learn about hand - eye coordination. Hand - eye coordination is something that most people have, but for those who don't, the computers help out in many ways. The first reason is that computers help learn yoga. Yoga is something to help take away stress inside of you. Computers have online videos that help you use it if you don't have the time to actually go. The final reason is that computers help out with sports. Sports are something that everyone loves to participate in and something that everyone likes. Computers have videos that show you how to play sports and enjoy them as much as you do in real life. I'm moving on now. The last reason why computers help out in society is you are able to talk with your friends online. The first reason why you can talk with your friends is a website called @CAPS2 - @CAPS3. Myspace is a website that's all about talking with your friends. It has grown extremely popular in chatting. The final reason is online dating. If you want to start dating again, you can always start online. It allows you to start a new life without leaving your room. Now that you have heard all of the reasons for why computers are helpful in society, I should wrap things up. Having computers in life is one of the most useful things you can have. You can talk to your friends, learn hand - eye coordination, and get an education. As you can see, computers are truly beneficial for society.
1571	1575	1	3	"Dear Local Newspaper, I am writing to you to talk about the effect computers have on people. Since I have two computers and one laptop, I've had plenty of experience with them. I have to agree that every person who likes to look up stuff should have a computer. Everyone should have computers, because you can look up different things. For instance, you can search for historical events, scientific facts, or even the latest fashion trends. You can play games like checkers with the computer or against somebody else. There are also various other games available, like chess or card games. And the last reason is that you can chat with people from different states and even countries. I know everybody likes to talk to one another, and it's really exciting to connect with people from diverse backgrounds. Everyone should have computers, because you can search different things. You can search places and people. Basically, you can search anything on the internet as long as you are on the right website. One time I wanted to go on the web and look to see if there was a bookstore in @LOCATION1. I went to ask.com and typed in ""Is there a bookstore in @LOCATION1, @LOCATION1?"" It said yes, and then it showed me a wealth of information about it. It told me the address, the phone number, and the name of the manager. Looking up places can be really useful sometimes. Everyone should have a computer because you can play any types of game. You could play internet games like checkers, solitaire, and even freecall. If you don't have any types of games installed, you can always go on gaming websites and just pick games up there. Since I use the computer every day, I've had many experiences on it. When I was six years old, we found a driving game. Since I did not know the website, all I got to play was checkers on the computers. But one day, I logged onto it and played my first driving computer game. Everyone should have a computer because you can chat with people. Instead of always using your phone to call and text people, which can raise your phone bill, why not use your computer and chat all you want without wasting minutes on your cell phone. I know everybody likes to talk and text on your cell phone. Instead of doing that, just go on the internet, find a chatcom, and start chatting or blogging with your friends. One time I ran out of minutes on my phone and I didn't have internet. I asked my dad if I could use the computer. He said yeah, so I went to a local chatroom on the internet. My friend had an account there, so it would be easy for us to talk all we wanted. I joined in and we chatted until @TIME1. In conclusion, I think everyone that likes to look up places, play games, and chat should have a computer as it offers so many great benefits."
1572	1576	1	3	Computers are interesting pieces of technology to work with at home or at work. Some people might think that computers are a waste of time. They also might think that computers are not useful or that the computers don’t have any way of helping you. Other people think that the computer is very helpful. People should be happy about the computer invention. What do you think about it? “You're wasting your time on the computers!” That's what you hear your parents say all the time, right? Well, kids don't really waste their time if they are on the computer because they could be writing up a paper for a class. They might be playing an educational game on the computers. Even if they aren't playing a game or writing up a paper, it is still making them learn something. Some people might say that computers are useless, but that is not true. When you are writing a paper for an @CAPS1 class, you would want a computer to help. It has a keyboard, so it goes faster when you type. Instead of writing the words out by hand, typing on a computer is much more efficient. It also has a grammar check. That is to help you spell the words out correctly. This is why a computer is a useful thing to use. Computers don't just make things go faster. They help you find information about many things on the internet. Also, if you had to look up a person for a school project, I think you would find more things about that person than you would in books. It really does make things go faster. Computers do help you. They are not a waste of time. They are useful to everyone. They also help things go faster. In conclusion, computers are a valuable tool that offers numerous benefits and should be recognized for their usefulness.
1573	1577	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Many people have used a computer to learn new things such as cultures. Computers affect people in so many positive ways. They have changed the way people think and how they look at the world. Experts even say how computers change the way people act at home and in the public. Computers also help special - needs individuals learn how to read and spell. A lot of people have used computers to learn different cultures. This has helped our society in many ways. By educating youth, so they don't make mistakes such as having racial biases. Computers have helped people learn things not only about racial differences in the past but also about their own culture. Which has been proven by @ORGANIZATION1 news. People state that computers have made citizens lose their daily exercise. But people don't only use the computer to study; they also use it to find different fitness routines, different diets, and ways to stretch their body so they won't hurt themselves. Less than @PERCENT1 of the population studied that the computer - based diets and fitness plans can help them take care of themselves. The @CAPS5 times has said, ""The computer not only helps our fitness but also helps us stay informed. Our computer keeps our world connected by one little click. And it gets the information we need in less than a minute. So as you can see, computers have changed not only society but also the world. That's how big of an impact computers have had. In conclusion, despite some concerns, the positive impact of computers on learning, culture, and well - being is undeniable."
1574	1578	1	3	Dear, @LOCATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 I think that although computers are very helpful to society, they are also posing a problem to it. For example, there are people out there who are addicted to computers and will stay in a dark area for hours just on the computer. Also, it's not helping the fact that there is an obesity problem in @LOCATION2. I'll explain that to you, but anyway, this thing that is teaching our youth could very much hurt them. Computer junkies, what are they? A computer junkie is someone who wakes up in the morning at @TIME1 and stays on it for a good past @NUM1 hours. This is a problem that @PERCENT1 of our @CAPS1 youth have. This topic might not seem big to some, but it is a problem that must be known. My brother is addicted to his laptop. He spends hours in his bedroom watching anime, Japanese cartoons, and not eating anything the whole day. He never leaves his room, and my mom gets so tired of trying to drag him out of his room that she just gives up, and it gets annoying after a while. A little computer use isn't bad, but a lot is. Obesity is a growing problem in our nation, and computers aren't helping. In fact, computers are making matters worse by having items being shipped to people without them having to get up. If the obese person got up and moved around, they could lose a little weight. Now you can order offline and have it delivered to your door. Big - name @CAPS2 @CAPS3 markets such as @CAPS4 @CAPS5, Domino's @CAPS4, and @LOCATION3 Jade have been a part of this issue. We should stop online @CAPS3 ordering. The computer is a great way to learn about things, but it is also a great way to become a junkie and gain weight. In conclusion, while computers have their uses, we need to be aware of the negative impacts they can have on our health and well - being, especially among the youth.
1575	1579	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, I believe that computers do have a positive effect on people. They give you the ability to talk to people online, not just your friends but also family that live far away. This is extremely valuable as it allows us to stay connected with our loved ones regardless of the distance. For example, half of my family live in @LOCATION1, and my mom uses the internet to communicate with them regularly. Through video calls and messaging, we can share our daily lives and important events with each other. Secondly, computers have a positive effect on people. They allow you to do homework that can't be done by hand. Such as essays that have to be typed and can't be hand - written, and projects for school. Typing on a computer is much faster and neater than writing by hand, and it also offers features like spell - check and formatting options. Lastly, computers have a positive effect on people. Computers allow people to learn about far - away places and people. For example, when I first came into this country, I didn't know much about it, so I did some research and learned great things about its history, culture, and traditions. In conclusion, computers have a significant positive effect on people. They give you the ability to talk to people online, not just your friends but also families that live far away. They also allow you to do any kind of work that can't be done by hand, and even allow people to learn about faraway places and people. We should embrace the benefits that computers bring to our lives.
1576	1580	1	3	Dear @CITY1 @ORGANIZATION1, I am a @ORGANIZATION2 student, and I've heard that there's a split opinion on computer usage. Some folks think it's great, while others consider it a waste of time. Well, I've got @NUM1 solid reasons to show why computers are excellent technology. One reason is that you can easily book the places you want to visit or the sights you wish to see. This is a fantastic way to use the computer because you can plan and track your route. You can even print a detailed map and go on an exciting hiking adventure. (How's that for getting some exercise!) Another reason computers are useful is online chats. Suppose you have a family member living all the way out in @LOCATION1, and they have a computer. If you want to talk to them but it costs to make a call, you can simply send an email. This is a wonderful way to use the computer as it allows you to stay updated on what's happening with your family members. Another benefit is learning. You can explore many different cultures. You can learn about various people and how they lead their lives and their unique cultures. My last reason is the @CAPS1. This is an amazing way to use the computer because you can stay informed about the latest events, like the earthquake in Haiti, a hurricane, or a @CAPS1 breaking story. Or if there's a storm heading your way, you'll know in advance. In conclusion, using the computer offers numerous great ways to be utilized. Sure, there are some bad websites out there, but if you use it the right way, it's a valuable source of technology!
1577	1581	1	3	"Some experts are worried that people are spending too much time on computers, and I firmly believe they're correct. Most kids would prefer to be on the computer, chatting with friends online or spending hours on Facebook. But what's the point of this when there's a whole world to explore? They don't appreciate nature as they should and spend less time with family and friends. If you're on the computer 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, how are you supposed to get enough exercise? Well, that's the problem – you don't get any exercise. Some might disagree with me, but the truth is, moving your hand over the mouse doesn't count as real exercise! A recent survey has been conducted, and @CAPS2 said that out of the @PERCENT1 of kids who own a computer, @PERCENT2 are overweight or at risk of being overweight. @CAPS2 is saddened to think that technology has taken over so much that it's ruining people's lives. I use the computer @CAPS1 too, but I always make sure to ride my bike afterward or go for a hike with my family. @CAPS1 of the times I have softball practice, so I'm not able to go on the computer anyway. Now, what about the beautiful things in nature that most of us are missing? The outdoors is something most of us take for granted. Some of us have @CAPS3 never seen a day - lily bloom at night, and new ones grow the very next day. This is a fascinating sight that many might @CAPS3 never see because they have a computer screen in front of their face. Kids really should learn to balance technology and the more important things in life, like protecting nature and exercising. Yes, I know some will disagree, saying, ""But I'm saving the rainforest, or the @LOCATION1, by being a member of this website."" @CAPS2's true that you're helping, but doing it yourself would feel so much better. For example, you could gather a group and clean up the streets in your neighborhood or help plant trees in the park. The most important thing in life is family and friends, and technology should @CAPS3 never get in the way of that. If you lose everything, what's the one thing you'll always have? Loving family and friends, of course! If family is so important, then why would kids want to be on the computer rather than at a family picnic? Is it because technology is taking over their lives and clouding their vision of the more important things life has to offer? Don't you sometimes wish you were a little kid again, running bare - footed in a field with your parents? That could somewhat happen if you got off the chair you've been sitting in for three hours straight and took a hike with your family. I might not be making perfect sense, but being with family in person is better than instant - messaging someone you just met who lives halfway across the world! I know that a lot of people are going to disagree with me when they read this, but I think technology is ruining some people's lives. If you think about it, a computer is like a @CAPS4 - @CAPS5 @CAPS6. It has a sweet coating, but when you experience its full impact, it traps you in and won't let go. A computer is ruining lives, and experts have a right to be worried about people's health! All of us should get more exercise, spend more time in nature, and be with family and friends more often instead of sitting glued to a computer screen."
1578	1582	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I'm sure you'll agree that computers benefit society. I definitely do. I find that my computer benefits society in multiple ways. You can interact with others online, it's easy to find entertainment, and @CAPS4 is extremely helpful and profitable. Now, you might not believe that computers are ""society - friendly,"" but I'm here to refute that statement. One thing I love about computers is how easily you can interact with people, whether they're miles away or right in your neighborhood. With just the push of a button, you can chat with them. For instance, my friends all have the well - known Facebook account. All I have to do is go online, click my chat box, click their name, and then @CAPS5! We're having a conversation. And the best part is, you don't have to share any personal details (like @CAPS6 @CAPS7, phone number, etc.) to chat on Facebook. Wow, wasn't that simple? Have you ever turned on your @CAPS8, scanned through channels, and thought, ""@CAPS9 nothing good on @CAPS8?"" Well, with a computer, there's always something to watch. Whether it's old or new, fake or real, live or pre - recorded, the computer offers many options to watch. You can pull up your @CAPS12 browser and go on @CAPS13 (a video site) and enjoy their wonderful variety of content. There are at least @NUM1 million videos on @CAPS13, and @NUM2 are being watched or uploaded per day. In fact, the ""@CAPS14"" views @NUM3+ videos a day without even realizing it. If you're looking for stand - up comedy, you could type in ""@CAPS15 @CAPS16!"" If you're into action, you can type in ""Chan."" Basically, the computer and the vast world wide web offer endless things to do. Now, after stating those two points, it has come to my attention that the computer is also extremely helpful. Say you have an extremely big test or report due tomorrow. You can study for it online. You can go on Google and type in your project's subject and get over @NUM4 results in a fraction of a second, depending on your bandwidth. Also, the computer is profitable. Did you know the two people who created Google are extremely wealthy? They made more money than the @ORGANIZATION1, and the company @ORGANIZATION1 makes the most widely used computer system. So, once again, the computer is extremely helpful and profitable. This is precisely why I believe the computer benefits society. The computer allows you to interact with others, keeps you entertained, and is very helpful and profitable. So, quite frankly, you should believe that the computer is beneficial to society. Thank you for your time."
1579	1583	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I think it's a great thing that people spend so much time on computers. One reason for this is that when you type, you develop hand - eye coordination. Another reason is that computer time can save money on other things. The last reason is that you can accomplish things in seconds on a computer that would normally take hours. Hand - eye coordination is an important skill. For example, imagine you're walking down the street, and a baseball comes flying at you. You're able to catch it because all the time you've spent on the computer has trained your hand - eye coordination. There are lots of ways to develop it, like playing sports, writing, or just using your thumbs, but learning to type is by far the best way because you'll use this skill both as a kid and as an adult. Are you having trouble paying your phone bill? Guess what? You don't need a phone. Why not use your computer to call people since it's free. Also, you won't really need a cell phone because you can do everything a cell phone can do, and do it quicker on a computer. Moreover, it's harder for people to steal or for you to lose a computer compared to a cell phone. Have you ever gotten frustrated when trying to find a piece of information in a book? Well, you can avoid hours of searching if you just use a computer. Then you can get outside and play games. Most of the time, it takes me hours to do my homework, but if I had a computer, it probably only take me minutes. So, for the development of hand - eye coordination, dealing with bill - paying issues, and the time - saving aspect of looking things up, I think it's good that people spend time on computers, and I hope you agree.
1580	1584	1	3	A lot of people have different views on whether computers benefit society. I, for one, firmly believe that computers are useful in many ways. The first reason I think so is that many schools require them for students to complete projects. Second, there are computer games that help kids learn. Third, I believe it's a great way to just relax. The first reason I believe computers are good is that many kids in school need them. In school, we have numerous projects that we might need to type or find pictures for. If we didn't have computers, there would be no way we could do that. Also, when we write persuasive essays, we need a computer to type them to make them look better. Many people might say we could just write them out by hand. But I believe that typing is faster and neater for some people. The second reason I believe computers are good is that they offer many excellent games to help people learn. I know there are various educational games available. The third reason computers are good is that it's a great way to unwind. A lot of people come home from work or school very tired. Instead of just sitting on the couch all night, they can go to the computer and play a fun game for a little while. Many people say that watching TV and using the computer are the same. But if you play an educational game once in a while, it can be beneficial. And you can also do something enjoyable on the computer from time to time. In conclusion, I believe computers are good because, first, many kids need them for school; second, they have a lot of educational games; and third, it's a good way to relax.
1581	1585	1	3	Do the members of this well - known and captivating newspaper think that the effects of people owning a computer are good or bad? Well, if you think negatively about computers and how they affect people, I would like to politely disagree. I'm certain I could sway you to agree with me too. Computers are positive for many reasons. The internet and other resources on the computer can be used for school projects, work tasks, and answering various questions. The computer gives people something engaging to do when they would otherwise be idle. It also allows people to talk to others online, whether they are friends across town or family members in another country. There are many great effects computers have on and for people.  Everybody has questions, wouldn't you agree? And more often than not, people don't know the answer right off the top of their head. Research is the key to answering questions. But who has time to go to the library and spend hours searching through dusty old books for an answer that would take a matter of seconds to find on the computer? Not every student, employee, or other person can afford to spend that time looking for an answer. There are far too many other important things to do! The internet on the computer allows people to find an answer quickly. This can actually improve people's knowledge, and enhance their performance at work or school. You can see here the positive effects of a computer.  Have any of you ever been bored? I'm certain that you have. Everyone gets bored from time to time. Instead of sitting around doing nothing, people can go on the computer and engage in many activities. Contrary to some people's beliefs, this can be an excellent way to spend, not waste time. There are all sorts of educational games and mind - boggling puzzles to do on the computer. I'm certain you can see how much better these things are than sitting in front of the TV. The effects are positive, because your brain is challenged, and your boredom has vanished. Also, hand - eye coordination can be greatly improved by doing activities on the computer. These are so many positivities about the computer's effect on people's boredom!  People have friends, and it is only human to want to keep in close contact with them. But what if a close friend moves away? You don't want to lose that friendship right? People can write letters to each other, but that can be time - consuming, and slow in delivery and response. And the positive effect of a computer is it allows you to keep in contact online with friends and family through instant messaging and email, both great resources for talking with others. Computers can keep friends together and save families from drifting apart. It is also good for couples or parents to keep in touch with their partner or children if they are away. These are all positive effects don't you agree?  As you can see, I feel strongly that the computer has positive effects on people. It's good for research, it's something to do when someone is truly bored, and it enables friends and family to stay close via online communication. I strongly urge you to change your opinion from negative to positive about the effects of computers. Everyone can choose their own opinions, but I know you'll prove wise and agree with me!
1582	1586	1	3	"Dear, Newspaper People should use less time on the computer because it significantly affects their lifestyle. Instead of using their computer all the time, they should exercise, hang out with their friends and family, and simply enjoy nature.  First of all, computers can bring a lot of obesity to the community because they bring laziness and make people not want to exercise. If people start to exercise regularly, at least around @PERCENT1 of the laziness will go down. They should at least go out for a brisk walk instead of using all their electricity on the computer. Also, around @PERCENT2 of your electricity bill will go down if you choose to exercise instead of using the computer.  Secondly, people need to start enjoying nature instead of being on the computer all the time. People should go green and start recycling and not worry about what somebody said on ""myspace"" or ""facebook"". Also, if we started recycling and caring about nature, @PERCENT3 of the earth would be greener.  My last reason is that there should be more friendly family time instead of computer time. Computers just make you break away from your family and friends because you're worrying about what's happening on the internet. @PERCENT4 of people should just get off the computer all the time and simply chill with their family and friends.  In my conclusion, these are my reasons for people to use the computer less so that they can kick back, relax with their friends and family, exercise, and enjoy nature. By reducing computer time, people can lead a more balanced and healthy lifestyle."
1583	1587	1	3	Dear editor, I think that people are spending too much time on the computer. Because of this, people are getting less exercise, they are not spending enough time outdoors, and they don't spend as much time with their family and friends.  Exercise is an important part of one's daily schedule. I have a friend who exercises every day. She is the healthiest person I know and rarely spends any time on the computer. But, she knows someone who is almost her complete opposite. He hardly ever exercises and spends @NUM1 hours on the computer each day. He has also been diagnosed with diabetes and is obese. These are the type of health problems that are faced because of lack of exercise and too much computer time.  Experts say that people should get at least @NUM2 minutes of exercise every day. But, because more and more people are spending time on computers, this is almost impossible. Studies done at @ORGANIZATION1 show that @PERCENT1 of kids under the age of @NUM3 are obese or at the risk of becoming obese because they are not getting enough exercise. You don't want that number to increase, do you?  There are other problems that people face because of too much time on the computer. People are spending less time outdoors and more time inside at a desk. My friend @PERSON1 spends way too much time on her computer and not enough outside. She failed a science project because she was on her computer, rather than outside comparing the leaves from different trees. Doctor @PERSON2 is a child psychologist and when he asked kids if they would rather play outside or be on a computer, @PERCENT2 of them said computer. This shows that people using computers are not only young, but they want to be on the computer more than be outside. This is a number that, in my opinion, is too high.  Lastly, there is the problem of people not spending enough time with their family and friends. By this I mean face - to - face time, not just video chatting with your friends on facebook. This has caused tension in relationships. My friend @PERSON3 didn't go to her family reunion but stayed at home on the computer and at the next family get - together, she was ostracized because she didn't go to the reunion. High @ORGANIZATION1 guidance counselor @PERSON4 says that @NUM4 out of @NUM5 friendships are ruined because kids don't spend enough face - to - face time with their friends but are on the computer.  These are all good reasons why less time on the computer and more time exercising, outside, and with family and friends will make your life happier and healthier. By reducing computer time, people can improve their physical health, enjoy the outdoors, and strengthen their relationships.
1584	1588	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1 of The Local Newspaper: As @CAPS2 students are promoted to higher grade levels, more teachers will require research papers. In my opinion, advances in technology, especially a computer, helps me complete my research paper, and the contents in it are the best it can be. What makes students and parents more happy to see @CAPS3's on their child's paper? Advances in technology. There should be advances in technology because they teach hand - eye coordination, it gives the ability to learn about far - away places and people, and even allows people to talk online with other people.  To begin, there should be advances in technology because it teaches hand - eye coordination. In a recent poll seen in TIME magazine, it showed that @PERCENT1 of people who use computers had a large increase in their coordination. People were not as @CAPS2 clumsy and poorly coordinated. @PERSON1, a professional tennis player, stated that, ""Before I started using a computer, I always played tennis for a living, and it was a bad choice because I was poorly coordinated. I always missed the tennis ball in matches. So I decided to stop. Then I started to use the computer more, and my coordination improved. Now I barely miss any tennis balls."" Clearly, advances in technology will improve and teach hand - eye coordination.  Another reason there should be advances in technology is because it gives people the ability to learn about far - away places and people. @PERSON2, a writer from @ORGANIZATION1, stated that, ""People like to research a place before they go on vacation or a business trip because they would like to know more about it."" Not knowing anything about your vacation destination is like not knowing what's for dinner tonight; it is clearly unreasonable. Recent studies show that the more a person knows about their vacation destination, the more enjoyable it is. Thus, the more vacations they go on, which is profitable for airplane companies. Also, knowing about the different cultures of the people in far - away places gives people a better perspective of the world they live in. Thus, advances in technology will give the ability to learn about far - away places and people.  Furthermore, advances in technology will allow people to talk online with other people. @PERSON3, the creator of @CAPS9, stated that, ""Advances in online chat programs will help people communicate with each other. @CAPS9 has been beneficial to everybody. For example, it helps people re - connect with their former friends. It is also very beneficial to students because if they forget a homework assignment, they can log onto @CAPS9 and ask a classmate."" A recent article found on @ORGANIZATION2 showed that online chat programs helped people communicate with each other. Clearly, advances in technology will allow people to talk online with other people.  In conclusion, advances in technology will improve hand - eye coordination, teach people about far - away places and people, and allow people to talk online with other people. When voting on this decision, please take part and support advances in technology, as it will be beneficial to everybody. Thank you for your time."
1585	1589	1	3	"Dear editors of the @ORGANIZATION1, Every morning, my sister wakes me up to go to school. She uses her cell phone to set an alarm. A few years ago, my mom would come in and tell us it was time to get up. Now, we have one small device that we carry around with us to do our work. Most everyone has a cellphone now, and it does much more than allow people to talk to one another from two different places. Now we can play games, go on the internet. These advances in the technology are making us very selfish. I, for one, do not approve.  For starters, all of these new and improved gadgets are time - consuming. With all the things to do in the world, we could all be doing something helpful, fun, or productive. Don't you agree? I mean, if you consider the idea that we all could be hitting the gym or studying for school tests and quizzes, then most teenagers would be in much better shape, physically, and mentally, too. @PERSON1, my aunt, a former physicist, said, ""The rate at which most students and kids grow increasingly more obese, mainly because of these new ideas involving phones and i - pods, is completely sickening."" The more time we spend using these items, the more we oppose the idea of being active. You can clearly see how we are growing less energetic, and much more careless of our time.  Furthermore, the advances in today's society are pushing on the boundaries of internet safety. Sure, people might claim that they can block out other people, but sometimes when someone posts something on the web, they don't always hide it well enough. They could have blackmailed one of your friends into committing a crime, right? That happened to one of my cousins just last year. The police took a long time to find her after she had been kidnapped because the person who kidnapped her hid the evidence by a chain of blackmails. Do you see how important it is to spend less time on these silly computers? It sucks us into a virtual world that is sometimes 'bloody' or 'war - like'. My brother learned swearing from the new & advanced game of @CAPS5. It's a fighting game (how violent!).  I implore your company to make the right decision and write to help pull us off of our butts and get us up and going strong again. By reducing our dependence on these time - consuming and potentially dangerous technologies, we can lead a more active, safe, and fulfilling life. I hope you take my advice, and I thank you for your extremely valuable time and effort."
1586	1590	1	3	Dear Local @CAPS1: I'm comfortably sitting at the cozy couch, deeply thinking about what I should do for vacation. I know I definitely want to take a trip somewhere to engage in some creative writing. However, my notebooks are all scattered everywhere. I don't know how to quickly contact someone who could offer help, and I have no clear idea about the country that I plan to visit. I take a last despairing look at my notebooks strewn about the closet, which looks very much like a tornado swept through. Then, I find a solution on the highest shelf – my laptop. First, I whole - heartedly agree with the people who think computers are useful. Three effects they have on people who use them usually are truly fantastic. Compare a person with a laptop to one without. The person with a laptop might often be a busy business person and have to converse with many people from long distances apart. So, they use e - mail and @ORGANIZATION1 quite frequently. They can travel places with people at their fingertips. However, a person without a laptop could be constantly busy moving from place to place just to meet these people. Their schedule could be extremely chaotic. Conversations over a chat system are fast and effective. Take my story for example. My mom hates wasting resources, so instead of me driving to a friend, we @CAPS2. It saves both money and time! In addition, I happen to be a writer who writes often every single day in many notebooks. I've written so much over the years that my notebooks are piling up all over my room. What organizational tool could help me in this situation? Why, a laptop of course! One laptop or computer can store a bunch of content and make editing a breeze. Anyone who deals with data and writing would be crazy not to have a computer! Would you prefer a room full of notebooks that you buy one by one, or a single computer with tons of space and backup? You tell me. Computers encourage users to be more organized! Respectively, computers are a great resource for millions of pages of information. They're similar to libraries. But think about a library and then imagine a computer. In one, you have to walk around laboriously to seek your information, and with the other, knowledge is merely a click away. Some @MONTH1 might argue that computer websites are not entirely reliable, but I beg to differ. There are specific websites on computers with suffixes like '.org' and '.gov' and even '.edu'. These websites contain proven factual information and more great resources for research. By using computers, I have acquired greater knowledge and have found computers highly beneficial. They have effectively made me more intelligent as a person. In conclusion, it's my strong opinion that those who use computers gain nothing but the positive effects, and these include money/gas - saving conversations through @CAPS2 and email, organization, and increased intelligence from reading. I've decided to take my creative writing on my laptop and in doing so, I've learned to weather the storm.
1587	1591	1	3	"Dear Local Newspaper, it has come to my attention that you have asked people to tell their opinions on the effects computers have on people. In my opinion, computers do not have a good effect. The reason I think that is because kids are often on the computer instead of doing their homework. People do not exercise as much because they are always glued to the computer, and they do not spend as much quality time with their family and friends. There are many kids that go on the computer all night and never get around to doing their homework. I read an article that said, ""Computers are the number one problem for kids not doing their homework."" People get so distracted on the computer that they never end up doing anything else. Eight out of ten kids say that they sometimes don't do their homework because they get easily distracted on the computer. I interviewed a student in the @NUM1 grade and she said, ""@CAPS3 class usually gets all homework done, but sometimes we forget when we are engrossed on the computer. That is really the only reason we don't do it."" Clearly, computers are not a very good electronic if kids are not getting their homework done because of them. But that is not the only bad thing about them. Since people are always on computers, they don't get out and exercise as much. Instead, they sit idly and play games on a computer. I found this quote in an article I was reading: ""@CAPS5 since I started spending a lot of time on the computer, I have gained weight because I am not out exercising."" Exercising and going outside are very important things to do, but people cannot do them if they are always on the computer. Nine out of ten people say that @CAPS5 since they started going on the computer a lot, they have not gone outside or exercised in a while. I interviewed a woman and she said, ""I had to stop going on the computer for a while because I realized that it was not good for me and I needed exercise."" People get so distracted on computers that they never go outside to exercise anymore. There are still some other reasons why computers are not very good. Spending time with your family and friends is a very important thing to do, but with computers, people do not do it that much anymore. In a magazine I read, it said, ""People are not spending time with their friends and family because they are on the computer instant messaging."" Computers are keeping people from spending time together. Nine out of ten families say that they have realized they don't spend as much time together because of computers. I interviewed some kids and they said, ""I don't spend a lot of time with family or friends. I am mostly on the computer instant messaging."" Computers are definitely not a good thing for families. Those are the reasons why I think computers do not have a good effect on people. Kids are on the computer and don't do their homework, people do not exercise as much, and they don't spend as much time with family or friends."
1588	1592	1	3	The computers are really cool. Do you know that the website is @NUM1.com? We need to take the time to learn and understand it. I truly love the computers. We need to @NUM2 make computers that are green and environmentally - friendly computers. In conclusion, computers bring so much fun and potential, and making them green is a step towards a better future.
1589	1593	1	3	As the people of the world are starting to use the computer more and more, I think it has an extremely positive effect on people. Computers are not all about fun and games; they help with other things as well. For example, some of the amazing things the computer can do are: teach hand - eye coordination, give people all over the world a chance to learn about the places, people, and culture from far - away places, and last but not least, it is another great way to allow people to talk online with their friends. Now, let me explain more about what a positive effect the computer is for the millions of people that use one. The computer today is such a great thing to have in your house. It is not just for goofing off and playing video games on; it is also very helpful in the education of young children, teens, parents, and even grandparents. When you use the computer, there is so much you can learn. For instance, let's say you have a question in your social studies or history class about a country or a region, and you don't know a thing about it. What do you do? You should log onto your computer, find a reliable website, and boom, you are learning facts about @LOCATION1 that you would have never known until you logged onto the computer. The computer is also a great way to practice and get better at using your hand - eye coordination. First, you need to learn about the layout of the keys and where they are positioned on the keyboard. After you have that skill, you should try to look at the computer screen and not be looking down at your finger keys. Not only is that not helping your hand - eye coordination, but it is causing you to type much slower than you would if you were looking at the screen. The computer truly is unbelievable. Are you one of those people whose parents don't let you get a phone because of how much it costs, without even considering the cost of texting? Well, if you are, the computer can help you out with that problem as well! There are bunches of different ways to talk to your friends and family on the computer. For example, you could use @CAPS1 to instant message your friends or Facebook to learn more and more about somebody. The computer is so handy! So, let's recap on what we learned! The computer helps people learn about different places all over the world, helps with hand - eye coordination, and lets you talk to your friends! I think the computer is a must - have in every household.
1590	1594	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, many people say that computers can have a bad effect on people. I firmly come to disagree as computers make our lives so much easier. We can talk to people that we have not seen in a long while, we can read about and see other places we thought we would never know about; and instead of having to hand - write that book, we can type it up. I find these are reasons that show that computers don't have a bad effect on people. Imagine you are on Facebook and you type in your best friend from high school's name. She pops up, and you are back in touch. The next day, she is on, happy that you are connected. That's the kind of thing that happens every day. People reconnect, and this not only happens on Facebook but all over the internet! Reconnecting with friends and family, talking to your boss next door, you can even send a picture of your new - born baby to your mother who lives in @CAPS2. Having computers really allows us to reconnect to those we have lost touch with. Other aspects are also very important. But what if we know nothing about other cultures? Then what would life be like? With computers, we can instantly learn about other places. All you have to do is type in the place and pick the size you want to look at, all with the use of computers. In the past, people would have to write everything word by word, letter by letter. Not with computers. So, don't worry about that @NUM1 - page paper. You can just type it, and with some software, you can even get your paper edited right on the spot. This is great for not only school children but adults too. That business proposal can be done quickly and easily with computers. Many people say that computers can have a bad effect on people. But with advancing technology, it gets easier, and it gives more time for other things. There is no bad effect of computers. The effect is just pure helpfulness. In conclusion, computers are a boon to our lives, bringing numerous benefits and making our daily tasks more convenient.
1591	1595	1	3	Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1's opinion on the effects computers have on people is that they help make everyday life easier. First off, with just a few clicks, you can effortlessly chat with people from long - distance places. Also, it makes homework and finding information a great deal easier as well. You don't have to spend hours in a library flipping through books. Last but not least, when you have nothing else to do, you can play games and watch interesting videos from online platforms. One of the best things about computers is going online and chatting with @CAPS1's friends. Even if they are across the country, you can still have a real - time chat with them, completely for free! Also, if you can't get in touch with them immediately, you can send them a @CAPS2 - mail, and as soon as they log on, they will receive your message promptly. Best of all, when you forget to write your homework down, you can quickly go online and ask one of your friends what it was. Besides talking to people, you can do your homework on a computer as well. All you have to do is create a word document and type with the keys. Let me just say this is a lot better than having to painstakingly write with a pencil. Not to mention, typing a paper is a lot neater and more presentable. Also, if you are doing a report on something, all you have to do is look it up on the internet, and you'll get endless and detailed information about it, all right on your computer! Last but not least, you can play games on your computer. Whenever someone is bored and has nothing to do, they can just turn on a computer and play their favorite game. Not only is it fun, but it also teaches hand - eye coordination as well. Some people say they don't have the money for games, but little do they know, there are millions of free online games that people of any age can play. This is great on a boring day when you have nothing else to do. In summary, the effects computers have on people are that they help make everyday life easier. You can chat with people from long distances, and it even makes homework much easier to complete. Not to mention it has fun games for people to play when they're bored or have nothing to do. I strongly believe that computers have a positive effect on people because of all the things they offer and the help they provide. Thank you.
1592	1596	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I wholeheartedly agree that computers have had a positive effect on people. They teach hand - eye coordination, give the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and allow people to talk online with other people. More people should see computers as a positive influence on people. Spending time on a computer is an excellent way to enhance your hand - eye coordination. It also teaches you how to type fast. Typing is an important skill that you need for most jobs. It is so crucial that throughout school, teachers are teaching us how to type. We also use hand - eye coordination when using a computer. You have to keep your eye on the screen and precisely move your arms and hands to hit the keys accurately. Computers are helpful in numerous ways. Have you ever wondered about what a far - off island looks like or what kind of unique things would be found on it? With a computer, you can easily find out. Computers give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people. You can get vivid pictures of some important cities and places, and gain some in - depth knowledge on the people who live there. Yes, you could do this in a social studies book, but it is much easier and faster online. Computers save time and make your life more convenient. Computers are becoming more and more advanced every day. They give you the opportunity to talk with people online, whether they are across the world or just down the street. In order to do this, you need a webcam. They are sold in computer stores, and some are already installed into the computer. Being able to talk with people online is a really great thing. It's a fast way to learn about that person and maybe discover more about their culture if they are from a different country. It's almost like having a pen - pal, but in a digital form. People are saying that computers have a negative effect on people. They say people are spending too much time on a computer and not getting enough exercise. They also say that they are not interacting with family and friends in person. All of these things should be taken into consideration. All you have to do is manage your time well. Don't spend all day on the computer. If you do this, everyone will say that computers have a positive effect and are one of the greatest inventions created. I would like to thank all of the readers for their time and hope that you all support me and my ideas.
1593	1597	1	3	North @CAPS1 courier, I would like to give you my opinion on the usage of computers. I am a person who wholeheartedly supports the advances in technology and firmly believe computers have a positive effect on people. @CAPS2 can benefit people in many ways. The three most important ways to me are that @CAPS2 helps with hand - eye coordination, gives people another reliable source to retain knowledge from, and lastly, @CAPS2 provides another effective way for people to communicate. Hand - eye coordination is an awesome skill to have in our society. In a country like the @LOCATION2, which revolves around sports, hand - eye coordination really comes in handy. Using the computers really helps harness and train your hand - eye skills for sports such as baseball, basketball, and many more. Using the computers for hand - eye coordination could really help the @LOCATION2 to develop some world - class athletes. We also have a problem with bad drivers here in the @LOCATION2. So, if they improve their coordination, maybe the numbers of car accidents and fatalities involving automobiles will decrease. Well, how do computers help with hand - eye coordination, you ask? I'll tell you how. By people using fun gaming sites, like luniosity.com, which is a website with games specifically designed for brain training. @CAPS2 helps with hand - eye coordination, concentration, memorization, and problem - solving. They help your brain in all of these categories just by having cute and engaging little games. As you can see in the @LOCATION2, we need improved hand - eye coordination, and @CAPS2 could do many positive things for the country. We can improve it just by using the computer. To retain knowledge about other cultures, places, people, and miscellaneous things is amazing thanks to the computer. Besides books, we have the internet. With the internet and computers, you can know about whatever you want when you type in the subject into a search engine like Google or Yahoo. People can learn all of this wonderful and interesting information about things they may have never known before. @CAPS2 also helps kids to find information for reports and projects. There is truly a vast amount of knowledge you can learn on the internet. You can learn about historical events or scientific phenomena. Maybe the difference between an element and a compound, or even just the definition of the word success. That is a great advantage to @LOCATION1. You can get so much knowledge from the computers/internet. Communication is another huge part of our daily lives. Most people have home phones or cell phones, but for the ones who don't, they need a means of communication. On the computer, you can use instant @CAPS3 or email; you can also use @CAPS4, Twitter, or MySpace as well. The computer gives people who don't have phones another way to communicate with others. Even if you do have a phone and someone you know is overseas, instead of wasting money on a long - distance call, just use one of the systems I've mentioned. The same thing goes for our military. They don't always have phones to call home, so they communicate via the computer. Communicating via computer is just another reason why the computer is so important. So, as I conclude my letter to you, the North @CAPS1 courier, I shall restate that I do support technology because they do have positive effects on people. The positive effects that are the most major are that @CAPS2 teaches hand - eye coordination, helps people with another source to gain knowledge, and lastly, @CAPS2 allows another way to communicate with people. I will tell you once again that computers benefit society and do have positive effects.
1594	1598	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, I think the effects that computers have on people are bad and should be stopped. I mean, don't get me wrong, computers do help people in some ways, but a large number of people use them every day. Some computers can get viruses, and there are many more enjoyable activities to do other than being on a computer. I hope to persuade you about the horrible effects a computer has on people. Do you know how many people use the computer? Well, according to @ORGANIZATION1, over @NUM1 billion people use a computer worldwide. The problem we are facing today is that too many people are glued to a computer, and most of them are teens. According to @PERSON1, about @PERCENT1 of teens spend most of their precious time on a computer. Facebook, @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS1, and @CAPS2 are the most common virtual hang - outs to find teens. I would know that because I have a Facebook myself. I've had one for almost a year, and you should see all the people who have one. My friend wanted me to get one because she said she had one and wanted me to join too. So I did, and then I found out that more than half of my grade had a Facebook. In my own words, I honestly think the computer can be extremely addicting, especially when you're on a worldwide account like Facebook. There are so many people on the computer, and this trend must be stopped. In addition, another reason is that computers occasionally get viruses. According to @CAPS3.com, the average adult gets about @NUM2 to @NUM3 viruses a year. My friend @PERSON2 was on his computer typing an important report, and then suddenly his computer shut down. Then, @NUM4 seconds later, the computer popped up a message saying you have a virus. The next day, @PERSON2 told me he didn't have his report because the virus wiped out all his hard - work and information. About @PERCENT2 of viruses can cause a computer to shut down, and it is very difficult to reboot it. Some places have made virus scans such as McAfee and @CAPS5, but sometimes they can't catch the sneaky virus. @PERCENT3 of people who say that a virus was caught by the virus scan they have, find that their computer freezes up and they can't delete the virus. Viruses must be terminated so that the computer can work properly. That's another reason why computers affect people in a bad way. Furthermore, people think that the computer is their everything. They're wrong! There is a plethora of activities that they can do other than being on a computer. According to @CAPS6. Burn, the average person between the ages of @NUM5 and @NUM6 spends more than @NUM7 hours on a computer. There are many other options of activities like calling your friends and getting together, that's why they invented the cell phone. You can also play a sport, read a fascinating book, or spend quality time with family. According to @PERSON3, there are so many better things to do. About @PERCENT4 of teens who spend a lot of time on the computer tend to get into lower - ranked colleges later in life. That is my final reason for the bad effects a computer has. In conclusion, computers can cause a bad influence due to viruses, excessive time spent on them, and people neglecting to do other things. I hope you can see my point to this and please send me a response as soon as possible.
1595	1599	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1, I firmly believe that computers are not necessary. Some believe that they help us learn, but I say that books can do the same job just as well, if not better. Some people believe @CAPS2 can help to improve hand - eye coordination, but so does playing a simple game of catch. Most believe that the internet teaches about people in faraway places, but I say why not actually visit those places? Then you'll know more than what was just typed in a computer. If it were a battle between computers and books, I would definitely side with whomever roots for books. A good book is not only a source of knowledge but also a healthy mental exercise. To me, reading a book on the computer is one of two things: unhealthy and unethical! You can't get the same tactile and immersive experience as turning the pages of a beautiful paperback or hard - covered book. I believe that you can learn so much from what you read in a real book. When you type on a computer, with all that ""clickety, clickety"" noise, you say that it's learning because you learn to type without looking, which is related to hand - eye coordination. I say no! That is not a natural form of learning. Why not go outside and throw a ball to one another? That's a real and fun way to show hand - eye coordination. It's an easy game, and it not only teaches hand - eye coordination but also gets you some fresh air and exercise. When you want to surf the web to find a nice vacation spot, you should really just take the plunge and visit that place. Flip a coin: heads @LOCATION3, tails @LOCATION1. If you pick heads, stop surfing the web to get info on that place! Just go fly there and surf the truly radical waves. Surf the real waves instead of the artificial ones, dudes! So as I restate, computers might seem okay, and I guess they aren't all bad, but they are not my cup of tea. So take some time away from that computer and go read a good book or play a game of catch. You know what? How about"
1596	1600	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2, you really think we shouldn't have computers? Or perhaps @CAPS2, you specifically think we shouldn't? Well, I firmly say we should. Computers have everything you need, like vast amounts of info, a wide variety of games, educational resources for school, and websites where you can buy clothes. Others say no, for some reason claiming it's not good for you and that it's too addictive. But I clearly think that having computers is entirely appropriate. They absolutely help us learn. Whatever you need to learn, a computer has the information readily available. If you want to learn about other places besides the one you live in, you can easily find it on the computer. I remember one time when I was looking for a word in the dictionary and they didn't have it. But when I looked it up on the computer, they had it, and I thought it was truly magnificent. I love computers as they connect me with my family who are in far - away places. There's nothing better than being able to talk to your family all day or whenever you want. Computers have everything; any info you need, you can get it off of the computer. It also lets you stay alert on what's happening in the world today. Moreover, it really does work on your hand - eye coordination. ""@CAPS3, isn't that brilliant?"" Some say computers are not good because people are not enjoying nature, or they start not wanting to get out of the house, don't spend time with family because they're so addicted to it. Some also say you're not exercising, so you get too fat or too skinny and are not healthy at all. But I disagree. That's why I'm not fond of writing this side of the story. ""@CAPS4, I'm kidding."" @CAPS5, you have a chance because computers are the best. They are definitely not the baddest. After reading this, you couldn't agree with me more. So it's up to you to agree or never to disagree. The big question is what will you choose! This is not a hard decision to make, and I hope you'll see the many benefits of computers."
1597	1601	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I've been reading your paper weekly and keeping up with local events. Through it, I was able to retrieve information about a controversy dealing with the effects of computers. I, for one, think that the computer has come to be one of the greatest inventions ever created. It has truly changed our society, and if you ask me, in a very positive way. My first reason has to do with the knowledge that the computer possesses. You can practically discover anything in the blink of an eye, as opposed to using a book or going to the library, which is very time - consuming. Not only does a computer take far less time to get information, it also holds a much larger amount of information than a library can store. Computers hold knowledge on almost everything imaginable, and best of all, it's right at your fingertips. Another great characteristic of the computer is its ability to let people thousands of miles apart converse freely. This might just be the greatest thing about the computer. Chatting online completely erases the hassle of high phone bills and carrying around cell phones. You can speak with friends halfway around the world with no cost to you. It's amazing! The one thing that is faulty about the computer is its over - usage by children. Although this is a significant problem, it is not the computer's fault. Kids should know their limits. There should be regulations for both the time spent on the computer and for exercise and fun with friends. This problem has most likely influenced many to come to dislike the computer, but you must understand that the time children spend on the computer is entirely up to him/her or the parents. In conclusion, I hope I have persuaded you enough to agree with my thoughts and to give the computer a chance. I'm sure you'll be satisfied with all the advantages it brings.
1598	1602	1	3	Dear editor, Computers have a good effect on humans. The reason is that you can interact with friends and family you know, the computer can be portable so you can still get outside, and lastly, people can research places where they want to go on vacation. These reasons clearly show how computers have a good effect on humans. To begin with, seeing people in person is not the only way to communicate. On the computer, there are numerous ways. There are chat rooms where you can type to each other. Take my friend @PERSON5 for example. He used to live in @LOCATION2 with all his friends and family until business came along. His business transferred @PERSON5 all the way to @LOCATION1. Thank goodness he had a computer because otherwise, he would not have been able to communicate with his friends. @PERSON5 is not the only person who has been transferred far away from home. In fact, @PERSON4 showed that @PERCENT1 of people with a computer tend to talk to friends and family more often because they can do it whenever they need. Gene, a psychiatrist, states that when someone in a family has to leave to go on business, then that family will start relying on a computer to communicate. Do you want to lose the connection with a friend or family member? Moreover, computers can be portable. If a computer is portable, then you can enjoy nature and still use the computer to get the job done. Take my cousin @PERSON2, who is a teacher and always has to do his students' grades during the weekend. He was bummed out because he could never get outside. So for his birthday, he got a portable computer. This allowed him to go outside and do his job while getting fresh air and seeing nature. @PERSON2 is one of many lucky people that has had this happen to them. @PERSON6 has shown that @PERCENT2 of teachers buy portable computers so they can see nature and get fresh - air while doing their job. @PERSON1 proved that if a teacher doesn't get any fresh air while doing their job, then they can make a valuable mistake or even get sick. Would you, a teacher, want to get sick with no fresh air or be healthy working outdoors? Lastly, there is more to do on computers than just doing work and communicating with friends and family. You can research places for vacation. My aunt @PERSON3 had always dreamed of going on vacation but couldn't find any information on fun, outdoor places. Until she got her hands on a computer. This way she found a fun place and left the country for a week. @PERSON3 is not the only person this has happened to. In fact, @ORGANIZATION1 shows that @PERCENT3 of people hesitate to go on vacation because they don't know about the country or place. In conclusion, computers offer so many benefits in communication, work - life balance, and vacation planning, and their positive impact on humans is undeniable.
1599	1603	1	3	To the local Newspaper, I think using computers does not have a negative effect on people. I believe it's an advantage to use it. You are given technology, so why not take advantage of it? Computers give people a chance to chat with others and allow them to make friends. These days, people even watch shows on computer - websites such as @CAPS1. @ORGANIZATION1 allows them to search for anything and watch it on @CAPS1. People can make emails, download music, and do several other things. Children at the age of @NUM1, @NUM2, even @NUM3 can use computers and play games on them. I have a cousin who is @NUM3 and he plays games on it all the time. He even knows how to search for something on the computer. Some people might think it gives you a negative effect, but really it doesn't. Those people need to come to the reality. We have to step up as life goes on. Let's say a girl doesn't have a computer, and her parents think that computers and technology spoil children. The girl goes to school, and her friends ask her to give them her e - mail. Every time her friends ask her about email, she makes up some excuse and tries to avoid the subject. This time she made an excuse, but how many times is she going to make up an excuse? Then suppose one day her friends find out she doesn't have a computer and embarrass her in front of everyone. So, what I'm trying to say is that you have to look around you and keep up with it. Computers also save your time. You can just type instead of writing everything out. You can make your writing cursive or any other style that you would like. After reading my letter, I hope you understand my point. Next time you see a person who thinks computers give negative effects to people, tell them the advantages of the computers and how it benefits the society around you. In this digital age, computers are an essential part of our lives, and their advantages far outweigh any perceived negatives.
1600	1604	1	3	Although many people love to be on the computer playing video games and having cyber chats, most of them don't know how bad a computer can be. Even though I experience a great time on the computer, I know how bad it is. Here is a short example. You can experience problems with your computer. If you stay on the computer for too long, it can overheat, and that can cause it to stop working. Another problem is the side effects. You can get headaches from just staring at the screen for too long. Those headaches over time can become even worse. You might even get poor vision from a computer. Computers can also be addicting. Because of your addiction to computers, you might become less close with family or friends, causing your social life to be very minimal. Also, because of the addiction, it might work its way into your daily routines, causing you to have to play it daily and more than the average person does. Your personality might also change along with your social life and routine. Lastly, computers can be very dangerous. If your child gets on one, he might accidentally link himself to a dirty or bad website. He will then be exposed to the negatives of a computer. On a computer, your child will probably be shown things like inappropriate words or pornographic features. These are all things that should not be allowed to be accessed on a computer. Computers are addicting, they cause problems, and are dangerous. In my opinion, the over - use and improper access need to be stopped. Now you might think about what we should do about computers. We should set limits on usage, especially for children, and use proper filtering software to protect against bad content. This way, we can minimize the negative impacts of computers.
1601	1605	1	3	"Do you want your child to succeed in life? This is precisely why computers are incredibly valuable to everyday life. Computers play a pivotal role in helping children acquire more education. They can be independent, learning on their own without relying on others to tell them how to use a computer. When they get to college, they can take notes quickly and avoid falling behind. This clearly shows why computers are important to everyday life. Computers are crucial because your child will receive the proper education they need. A significant @PERCENT1 of children who use the internet for their studies are the ones who will be a grade ahead of most of their classmates. Dr. @PERSON1, a computer expert, says, ""When I was using the computer to do research on a topic, I went on a particular website on @DATE1 and from there, I advanced significantly because I was on the computer."" As you can see, computers are valuable items used in everyday life. Computers are important to everyday life because they help your children be more independent and learn how to use different parts of the internet. Between @PERCENT1 to @PERCENT2 of children who use the internet are most likely to succeed in college because they know what websites to visit and how to get there. There is an @PERCENT1 chance that the children who succeed in college will get the higher - paying jobs. Dr. @PERSON1, the computer expert, says, ""@CAPS2 son was at @ORGANIZATION1, and he was smart because he was always on the computer looking up new facts and ideas that popped into his head."" Achieving such academic success as a student is very difficult. This is why computers are valuable to everyday life. Computers are important because you can look up sites that will help you eat healthy foods. @PERCENT3 of adults who consume healthy foods are most likely to live an additional @NUM2 years of their life because they keep their bodies in good health conditions. By eating more fruits and drinking more to keep their bones strong as they get older, they are better prepared for any falls. As you can see, using the internet can be very helpful if used in the right way. This is why using the internet will help you become the successful person that you want to be in life."
1602	1606	1	3	"Dear who ever this @MONTH1 concerns, I firmly believe that people spend way too much time on computers. As a result, they do not exercise as much. People sit inside all day instead of going outside to enjoy the beauty of nature. Families and friends are spending less time together because they rely on computers to communicate with each other. Computers have become a negative influence on people today. People need exercise to live a healthy life. It keeps us fit and in good shape. With all the fast - food places around, people need exercise more now than ever. People do not want to exercise if they have a computer to go on. A statistic shows that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 @CAPS2's @CAPS3 each have their own computer in the house. They said ""I would much rather be on the computer than outside"" (@PERSON2, a @NUM3 grader at @ORGANIZATION1). Even students do not want to exercise when they could be spending time on the computer. Humans only have a limited time to live. There is beautiful nature outside waiting for us to explore. We do not appreciate our surroundings because we would rather be on the computer. For example, @PERSON1 would rather spend her day on the computer than enjoying the amazing nature we have around us. Only @NUM4 out of @NUM2 students enjoy nature every week. A young girl about @NUM6 never appreciated nature until her parents made her stay away from the computer for a month. She now loves nature because it got boring day after day on the computer. Family and friends are huge parts of our life. We want them to be a part of our big events. Because of the computer, we can talk to them whenever or email a video of our big event. But would it not be much better for them to be there, cheering you on when it is happening? When I was around @NUM1, my grandparents used to come to my soccer games, but now they don't because my mom just records it for them to watch. I liked it so much better when they were at the soccer games, cheering me on. ""I want my family and friends to be at my events, not just show them after the event happened."" A fact is that everyone wants to share their event with the family. Computers aren't that great. They make it so family and friends do not come to see you. Computers take you away from the beautiful nature that surrounds us. It limits you on exercise and makes you gain weight, which is unhealthy. I urge you to use your computer less and exercise, see family, and enjoy nature."
1603	1607	1	3	"I think that computers can be harmful because you can develop arthritis in your fingers, experience loss of vision, and you also should go outside to get fresh air. It is not good to sit on the computer for long periods. Because you can get arthritis in your fingers. There is also a disorder called carpal tunnel, which can make it difficult for you to grasp things anymore. My grandma has arthritis in her fingers, and it's from doing dishes all the time. But I think if she were to use a keyboard, it would do much more damage and affect her for the rest of her life. My mom always told me that if I sit in front of the screen for too long, I will go blind. Well, in a magazine it said that ""if you sit in front of a computer for too long, it will partially blind you."" So, whether you're sitting in front of a computer doing Facebook or something else, it can partially blind you. It is good to go outside sometimes to get fresh air or go for a walk. These are some ways to stay in shape because if you become obese, then you will be at a higher risk of dying. If all you do is sit in front of the computer, you need to get exercise every day to stay fit and healthy. That is the way to be instead of eating junk food and drinking soda. I'm sure it's okay to go on the computer when you look up other health - related stuff to do. What I'm getting at is it is good to go on the computer sometimes, but it can be very unhealthy to sit in front of it all the time. You need to be healthy to stay alive, and if you sit in front of it all day, then the results wouldn't be good. Those are the reasons why I think the computer is bad to sit in front of all day."
1604	1608	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, over the years, computers have gotten faster, smaller, and smarter. These advances have led to the progress of mankind as we know it. However, the effects that come with this development can be non - profitable to the youth of the computer world. Some common effects computers have on people, mostly children, are preventing kids from playing outside and being active. Computers also prevent people from using their imagination, and they are a waste of time. Every day, a child across America will use the same old excuse, ""no mom, I'm not on Facebook, I'm doing my @CAPS4 report"", while in fact, they haven't even started it, or they started hours ago and are now goofing around online. But ask yourself, ""did this happen thirty years ago?"" No, your parents who grew up then were thrilled to go outside when their assignments were completed. They could not wait to get on that flaming red bike to go play ball with Joey. Kids these days are becoming less active and eager to play outside. Some people blame obesity on genetics, while it probably should be blamed on computers, which suck children in. Because kids never want to leave the side of their beloved computer to go outside, they are using less and less of their imagination. Parents tell stories of when they would watch the one new episode of their favorite show, and for the whole week, the kids in the neighborhood would take roles and act it out. But do you see that every day in this generation? Not at all. No one imagines anything new about it with friends to make it more fun. They only move on to the Wii five minutes later to play a smashing balloons game. Computers just eat up all of your time. The average kid will spend up to four hours on the computer just fooling around with no purpose. Wasting the time they could be improving their homework or walking the dog. The time is not being donated to a good source. It is not being effective most times. They say computers are the now generation, but does that mean that the now generation must be lazy, un - imaginative, and not care what their time is put towards? Most people will say no, we are not. But if you offer a nine - year - old to play on the computer or, say, go outside! You would be ignorant to think they would go out to play. People want to move forward, but can we not make a compromise?"
1605	1609	1	3	"Dear local newspaper, I firmly believe that the effects of computers are good. Some reasons I think this way are that we can acquire a vast amount of knowledge from it, and we can contact people who don't live near us and whom we haven't seen in a while. My first reason for thinking the effects of computers are good is that you can obtain a great deal of knowledge from it. For instance, if you want to make a special @CAPS1 meal, you wouldn't easily find the recipe in an ordinary @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4. Instead, you would have to look it up on the internet. Another example is if you wanted to travel to @LOCATION1 by car and you didn't have a map, how would you get the directions? You would go on the computer, look up directions to @LOCATION1, and print them out. You would have never been able to go to @LOCATION1 if you didn't have a map or a computer. My second reason why I think the effects of computers are good is that you can contact friends or family that you have not seen in a while. For example, if your sister just graduated from college and you wanted to congratulate her but you were @NUM1 feet in the air on an airplane and all you had was your laptop and your luggage, you would e - mail her saying ""good job"". These are just a few reasons why I think the effects of computers are good, and I sincerely hope the local newspaper agrees too."
1606	1610	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1, I remember when I was younger my parents got two laptops for themselves. The laptops had sleek designs, and with just a click, they could access the Internet. Internet use was always readily available, enabling lively interaction through online chat. It was extremely exciting for them as they connected with friends and explored new things. On the other hand, I got to sit home and watch them have fun. I couldn't go outside to play basketball or hang out with friends just because I was stranded inside as they enjoyed the computer. I strongly feel as if computers do not benefit society. People spend too much time glued to the internet rather than exercising. Nobody gets to truly enjoy the beauty of nature, like taking a peaceful walk in the park, and there is less face - to - face interaction with family and friends. There are many holes being dug while computers are still being used and bought. Our society is just going downhill from here. People don't need to be sitting at home inside, breathing recycled air while using the computer. Professor @PERSON3, a well - known health generalist, stated on @ORGANIZATION2 news that @PERCENT1 of all people around @LOCATION1 would rather be on the computer at home doing nothing than going outside and/or getting some kind of exercise. Could you imagine all of those unhealthy people not worrying about anything except their computer? The only thing computers do for us these days is gobble up our free time. @CAPS2 waste @PERCENT2 of their spare time on their computer. If technology decreases the number of new games people play and sites people use, it is likely for people to get out of the house and do something healthy for themselves. @PERSON1, the respected owner of @ORGANIZATION1, said ""I have never seen in my entire life, so many people using their computers and the internet. It's been quite some time when over one billion @CAPS2 are online on a typical weekend. "" @PERSON1 later mentions "" it's kind of depressing how much time they spend on computers rather than outside and enjoying nature."" Not only is exercise time headed down the drain, but our once "" beautiful"" nature is as well. Many young kids these days are watching @CAPS3. They see computer game commercials, and their parents buy them the game, and all of a sudden they are glued to it @NUM1. Since adults aren't doing their part by encouraging these kids to run around outside and do something healthy, the kids need to step up for a change! Did you know global warming is caused by the minimum density in the air? If we have almost no children or adults running around outside, our world is not functioning well. Hence our budget is low, and pollution is extremely off the charts; our nature is going from beautiful to less and lesser. @PERSON2, a government official, has surveyed @NUM2 people from each state asking about how much time they spend weekly just enjoying nature and appreciating its beauty. The survey reads one in every @NUM3 people thoroughly breathes in the beauty for at least @NUM4 minutes a week. I mean come on; that's pathetic. Maybe if we surely excluded computers and technology for a while, global warming won't be necessary. I remember when I was about @NUM4 years old and I never once got to meet my other family besides my siblings. It was pretty sad because I'm always told I have a huge family that is very well - known in our town but I have no clue who they are! This is all because technology was invented. Never once have I ever been outside and relaxed besides when I got on and off the bus for school. My parents kept me in my house as they used the computer. The other day I just found out what ""snow"" is because my mom's computer broke and now I am getting introduced to my other family along with the freedom of going outside. Ever since my mom's computer broke, she has lots of free time to spend with me. Technology ruined my childhood as a kid, and without it, you get to open up the real importance of life. Would you want to become obese, contribute to global warming, and/or not interact with family or outside nature? It's sad how @PERCENT3 of these reasonings are caused by the excessive use of technology and computers. Let's just get rid of it all! Thank you for your time @CAPS1!"
1607	1611	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, Computers are very important to some people. In fact, almost everyone uses them or has used them before. It isn't bad to own a computer because you can still exercise regularly and be able to carry out the things you do every day. Let's say that you need to look something up, like historical facts or scientific concepts. The first thing you usually turn to for information is a computer. People in schools, industries, and in homes rely on it all the time. Teenagers will usually go on the computer to chat with friends or maybe play some exciting games. I know I do. It's a great way so they don't waste their time being bored all day. Exercising and being active is indeed very good for teenagers to focus on, but even though they engage in physical activities, they don't push away the computer. It will always be there when they don't have any more homework or when they finish running around the neighborhood with their friends. I can't imagine what my life would be like coming home from a tiring soccer practice and finishing my homework. Then the computer or @CAPS1 is one of the first places I rush to so I can just sit back, relax on my cozy chair, and unwind. Computers should be known as our friends. They won't hurt us. They just give us what we need and want. Research is a prime example because everyone uses the computer to find whatever it is that people are looking for on it. And if they're done with researching, they can have a little fun by playing games and chatting with friends. But I believe that the main purpose for computers is providing information. Whenever I get home from school, I finish my homework, stretch a little for cheerleading practice, then watch @CAPS1 or go on the computer so I'm not bored. It's not that I'm not active because I'm not working out or exercising at that moment. It's because I have nothing else to do, so why not make my time occupied? Everyone does it, so I'm not the only one. Yes, computers are just this square box with a keyboard, but if you don't push it away from people's common lives, then you can see that they aren't what some might say they are, and they won't rot people's brains or anything. The reason they are in an office, living room, or bedroom is because people like them and use them for their various needs. In conclusion, computers are an integral part of our lives, offering both utility and entertainment, and we should embrace them as valuable companions.
1608	1612	1	3	"Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1, what do @CAPS5 do when @CAPS5 need to write a detailed report for work or school? Or talk to a business partner about an important deal, a friend about the latest gossip, or a family member living far away? @CAPS3 computers help us do all of that. The electronic wonder improves our lives every single day. Yet some people stubbornly refuse to accept that computers are now an inseparable part of everyday life. Computers help us communicate, research different topics, and have just plain fun things to do. Computers make it incredibly easy to communicate. Things like ""@CAPS2"" and ""facebook"" let us have real - time conversations with each other, no matter the distance. Some @MONTH1 contest ""@CAPS3, use a phone or go out."" But what if @CAPS1 are away on a long - awaited trip, or live thousands of miles away? With computers, everything becomes much easier. We can share photos, videos, and messages instantly. Computers allow us to research topics @CAPS5 need for classes or work. ""@CAPS5 can get a vast amount of detailed information from thousands of reliable sites. Sceptics might ask the question ""@CAPS6 not go to a library."" Some of us might prefer to stay at home in the comfort of our pajamas. Another reason is that it maybe snowing heavily outside, or the library is closed due to maintenance. Whatever the reason, computers make research fast and hassle - free. Computers also fulfill a great need to entertain ourselves. Games sites like ""facebook"" have become extremely popular. They can provide us with an emotional release from the stress of the everyday world. A potential argument might be ""@CAPS6 go outside?"" But the weather could be bad, and you might be sick in bed. Computers are fun, educational, and a communication wonder. We should find the good in computers and recognize what they could do for us. In conclusion, computers have revolutionized the way we live, work, and play, and we should whole - heartedly embrace their many benefits."
1609	1613	1	3	Dear Newspaper, I think that computers have a positive affect on society because it gives a wealth of information, it has lots of engaging fun games and music, and it informs you about important issues in the world and communities. The first reason I think that computers have a positive affect on society is because it gives you an abundance of information. If you need to do projects and in - depth research, what better way to do them than on a computer. You can search all kinds of people like the presidents of the @LOCATION1, learning about their policies and legacies, celebrities, and people that made a significant change in the world. You can also look up and study different kinds of plants and animals, discovering their unique characteristics and habitats, and you can find fascinating experiments to do at home. The second reason I think that computers have a positive affect on society is because it has lots of fun games and music. You can go on the @CAPS1 channel website and play lots of different games based on your favorite TV shows. They also have learning games on test prep fun where you can play games to help you do well on your @ORGANIZATION2, such as comprehension clinic which sharpens your reading skills. The computer also has a vast library of music that you can listen to. You can listen to @ORGANIZATION1's album. I am @PERSON1 before You @CAPS2 it, or @PERSON2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7 before buying the @NUM1 songs. This allows you to preview the music and decide if you like it. The final reason I think that computers have a positive effect on society is because it gives you information about issues in the world. You can go on a computer and search for information on natural disasters like the @CAPS8 earthquake, the @CAPS9 earthquake, or details about the tsunami that @MONTH1 hit @LOCATION2. You can search for information on @CAPS10 @PERSON3 and get insights into their work. You can search your favorite artist and see what their upcoming album is going to be like or you can search for issues in your community, such as local environmental problems. That is why I think computers have a positive affect on society because it gives information, it has lots of games and music, and it talks about important issues. In conclusion, computers are a valuable asset that enriches our lives in multiple ways, from education to entertainment and awareness.
1610	1614	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, I think that computers are beneficial to our society. For example, computers are very helpful to everybody in numerous aspects. Computers also make news travel faster. And they can teach us new things. I am not saying computers don't have their downsides, but they also have many upsides. Computers are very helpful in many ways. They help people find lost family members. Imagine the joy of being reunited with a long - lost relative after years of separation. And they help police officers catch many criminals. Haven't you ever worried about the many criminals on the street and wanted to get them off the streets and into jail where they belong but didn't know how? Computers come to the rescue. Haven't you noticed that computers are helping police protect many women in the present time? Computers not only help people in these ways, but they also help information travel faster. For example, say you heard there was a hurricane or tornado and you needed to find out how severe it was and what precautions to take. All you have to do is turn on the computer and look it up. Also, there was an earthquake in @LOCATION1, and the local news didn't have enough information to help you. You would just go on the computer and find all the information you need, like safe evacuation routes and emergency contact numbers. Computers are useful for many things. They teach you a lot, like hand - eye coordination. Think about it. You might not realize it while you are on the computer, but it helps. If you pay attention to yourself while you are on the computer, you would start to see that you are typing faster and learning where all the letters are on the keyboard now compared to when you first saw a computer. Computers, though, not only teach you hand - eye coordination but also introduce you to many wonderful places. Such as @CAPS2 falls, with its majestic waterfalls and lush surroundings, and rain forests full of exotic plants and animals. Now, don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that computers don't have their downs and that people don't take advantage of computers. But, I am saying that they help society a great deal. They make news travel faster. Also, they teach a lot to people. So take my opinion into consideration. And think about how much computers have done for you. In conclusion, despite their flaws, computers are a powerful force for good in our society, and we should recognize and utilize their many benefits.
1611	1615	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I am a representative of @ORGANIZATION1 who firmly believes that computers have a decidedly positive effect on people. One significant reason is that computers help promote hand - eye coordination. Moreover, there is the fact that computers also help teach people about distant places and people without leaving their homes. Additionally, computers also allow people to talk to each other via the @CAPS3. What would we do without computers! My first reason why I believe that computers are a good thing is hand - eye coordination. According to @PERSON1 of the @ORGANIZATION3 of the eye, when you type, you have to watch what keys you are using. As a result, your brain builds a connection with your hand, thus achieving better eye - hand coordination. Consider this: there are millions of @LOCATION1 in car accidents a year, and @PERCENT1 of these are caused by the fact that the driver of a vehicle had to look down at the way to make sure they kept their car on the road. This indicates that they have poor eye - hand coordination. I believe that if computers were in the hands of every person in the world, there would be fewer accidents a year. Secondly, there is the fact that a computer can transport somebody in their mind to a distant place or person. A study at @ORGANIZATION2 showed that @PERCENT2 of people surveyed can find information on the @CAPS3 faster than they can in a @CAPS7. Also, a child of any age can use a computer to find the specific information it needs in a matter of seconds. I have observed that children know how to use the @CAPS3 but not a dictionary or encyclopedia. Moreover, people can contact and talk to others through the @CAPS3. For instance, this allows you to contact long - lost friends. You can talk to them easily and conveniently. There is the fact that you can contact someone halfway around the globe just with your @CAPS3. How cool is that! Thank you for reading this letter and sharing it with your company. I believe that you should support my cause because, as mentioned, computers improve hand - eye coordination, link people to other people and places, and allow people to talk via the @CAPS3.
1612	1616	1	3	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS1, Computers have advanced our world so far into the future that practically everything is just a click away. In fact, experts are truly awed that over the years, computers have helped billions of people get jobs done more efficiently and smoothly than ever before. Technology has been a game - changer in the medical field. It has helped doctors find new cures for patients, and diagnose their sicknesses in a more advanced and accurate way. Thousands of professions require the limitless knowledge of the internet, and computers continue to advance and redefine our way of living. Furthermore, kids of all ages benefit from modern computers. As technology becomes more user - friendly, children have quickly adapted to computers, which can give them answers to all of their questions. As a student at @ORGANIZATION1, I have found that computers are vital in everyday assignments. Essays are now typed neatly and not handwritten, and projects are displayed on flash drives, not posterboard. These advances have shaped our lives, and made everything much easier. Also, foreign places become closer to home when computers allow you to virtually visit hundreds of different countries. With modern technology, the world is better connected and united. In addition to students, doctors also greatly benefit from computers. Technology has re - shaped the medical world dramatically with x - rays, @CAPS2's, surgeries, and medicines. Amazingly, computers allow doctors and nurses to look at patients in a whole new way. Hospitals organize all records digitally to help give the right treatments to patients. @PERSON1, the head surgeon at @ORGANIZATION2 says, ""Without @CAPS3 technology, our @ORGANIZATION2 would be useless. We wouldn't be able to do anything."" Since @PERSON1 is well - spoken, he makes a very important point. Computers are indeed the building blocks of our medical world. Scientific studies have shown that the internet has brought people closer than ever before. Families separated by thousands of miles now have the ability to email, chat, or even video chat with far - away relatives and friends. Email has especially played a huge role in our society, helping millions of people communicate when needed. In fact, over @NUM1 million jobs rely on email to communicate important business information. Without the aid of technology, our economy would rapidly decline as communication between countries failed to exist. Computers are essential to our culture. I strongly urge you to consider my opinion on the benefits of modern technology and think of all the people computers have helped. Our culture is now bigger, better, faster, and stronger, thanks to the help of technology today. Knowing this, I vehemently suggest you educate others in the benefit of technology and play your part in advancing our way of living."
1613	1617	1	3	"Dear local newspaper, I feel that the people using computers benefits our society. I feel this way because computers give people the ability to learn about far - away places and people through educational websites, and even allow people to talk online with others. First of all, computers give people the ability to learn about far - away places and people. When I was in sixth grade, I had to do a project on @ORGANIZATION1. I didn't know anything about him. But, luckily, we have computers, so I was able to search for @ORGANIZATION2 on a computer and found a wealth of information on him. As a result, I got an A+ on the project. Also, when I was in fourth grade, I had to do a project on @LOCATION1. I went on a computer, visited @CAPS1.com, and got lots of useful information. Consequently, I got an A+ again. The second reason computers are beneficial to the society is because computers have educational websites. Computer technologist @PERSON1 says, ""@CAPS2 percent of the computer websites are educational."" I also remember when I was in seventh grade, the whole class went on @CAPS3.com and were able to learn math while having fun at the same time. Last but not least, computers allow people to talk with other people from around the world. There's a website called myspace.com, and it allows me and other people to talk online globally. I asked my class, and ninety percent of them go on myspace.com. On the other hand, the computer does have cons. Some kids go on unprohibited websites that are not for minors. There's a website called @NUM1.com, and it has shooting and killing games that are not suitable for kids. Also, some people are computer addicts who stay on computers almost twenty - four seven. Now, you know my reasons why computers are good for the society: they give people the ability to learn about far - away places and people, have educational websites, and allow people to talk to other people online. So, what is your choice regarding these aspects?"
1614	1618	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I've come across this letter I saw about the technology of computers and how it's affecting people's lives. I think the computer is a great means of learning. It's a new way to study and do other things to learn in a fun way. My opinion is that when you have to study for a test, quiz, or anything, it can become boring. I like to study in a fun way that will stick in my head. And when it comes to studying, the computer is a great tool. I learn a lot from the computer when I'm at home. My mom and dad think I spend a lot of time on it. Well, I do sometimes, but half the time I'm studying for tests. Now, I would like to take the time to talk about how it helps mentally when you go to learn. Physically, there is less pressure, and you can learn in different ways. You just log on, and there are various options to choose from. Lastly, let's talk about family and friends. Family and friends are important, and websites like @CAPS2, Facebook, AIM, and @CAPS3 allow us to stay connected. Isn't that cool? That's the beauty of computers and technology, letting you do a lot of things with just one device. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to say my opinion and what I think. I hope you take my letter into consideration and understand the many benefits that computers bring to our lives.
1615	1619	1	3	Dear @LOCATION1 newspaper, I have overheard this debate on whether computers are good influences on people or not. I am sending you this message to state my opinion on the matter, and in my opinion, I think the computer has very good effects on people. Not only does it have a good effect on people, but it also affects companies, places, and governments. There are many reasons why it has a good effect on people, but the first and maybe one of the most important is that it is an amazing learning tool. When people are on the internet, they can learn just about anything they want to from the giant mass of information we call the internet. It not only does this, but people can also learn how to do things through simulators, from flying a plane to driving a car. There is even more learning ability on the internet because a lot of people get home - schooled on it. This can be an important part of their education because they might not be able to go to school because they are always on the road or they move a lot, or for whatever their reason is. The computer is an important part in the advancement of people's education. Not only can people use the computer in education, but it is used as a tool in many ways. Let's say you're making a movie and need special effects; they will use software like Photoshop. Or if you need to collect and store changing information, like if you want to track stocks, you can always do it on a computer. Even if you were a construction worker, you could create your blueprints with pinpoint accuracy. Another less important thing about the computer is that it gives many people entertainment. Let's say you come home, you're bored, and you have nothing to do. You can play a video game or look around on the internet. It is also an important way of getting music and videos. This also affects many businesses, and if the businesses go under because people aren't moving their stuff, a lot of jobs will be lost, and that is the last thing we need. The government also relies highly on the internet. They need it to make plans, save soldiers, and communicate with other countries. And last but not least, we have the fitness and well - being of the people using computers. All I can really say to that is it is their decision. If they want to get off, they can, and if they want to sit there and waste time, that's their choice. However, overall, the positive impacts of computers far outweigh the potential negatives, and they are an integral part of our modern world.
1616	1620	1	3	"Dear Local Newspaper, The question everyone is asking is if computers benefit society? I firmly believe that computers don't because if you're always on the computers, you simply can't get exercise, and it's really hard to enjoy nature too. Another significant reason computers don't benefit society is that you aren't interacting with friends and family in person. Hopefully, I have encouraged you to not use computers as much and go have fun with your family. If you are always on the computer, how are you going to get exercise? It's proven that more than half of the United States of America is overweight. Exercising is far more important than using the computer. Knowing that you could be doing something useful that you know is better, wouldn't you choose to do it? Interacting with people is crucial because you can meet new people. If you don't, you might learn to be shy and not make as many friends as you'd like. It's true that you can make new friends over the computer, but it's not the same as meeting them in person. Also, if you do make a ""friend"" over the internet, you don't know if they are a stalker or a murderer. I strongly urge you to go out and meet new people, not just on the internet. Knowing that you are better off not using the computer and being with the people you like, wouldn't you make that choice? Yes, you can play games on the computer, but it would be better if you play those games with your family. To answer the question everyone is asking, I firmly believe that computers don't benefit society at all, and hopefully, I have encouraged you to believe this too. In conclusion, we should limit our computer use and focus on real - life experiences and relationships."
1617	1621	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1, If you believe that the advances in our technology are not good for our society, you must be misunderstanding. Computers have a positive impact on the people in our community by giving us excellent hand - and - eye coordination and enabling us to seek and find information to learn. They can also allow people to communicate online with others. Hand - and - eye coordination is an important skill that helps us in our daily lives. With new technology such as computers, we can enhance this skill, so we should make good use of it. @PERSON1 of @ORGANIZATION1 says, ""Computers do help us a great deal; almost @PERCENT1 of active computer users do improve their hand - and - eye coordination just by using the computers for a short period of time every day."" Knowledge and education are essential, especially in today's world; the more you learn, the better salary you can get. With this new technology, you can earn degrees and acquire knowledge in a relatively short period. My aunt got her @CAPS4 online about six months ago, and just because of that, she got promoted at her job. Gaining valuable knowledge online is not only beneficial for adults but also for children. If they have a report on @CAPS5 or need some help on their homework, these new technologies are one of the most effective and fastest ways to learn and find information. @PERSON2, a doctor that specializes in @CAPS6 emotions/feelings, says in the @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8 last month that, ""in this new millennium, preteens and teenagers simply love the new advances in technology, and if we want them to learn, then we can take this tool and have them use it."" Computers are also a great way to communicate. It's fast and easy. I have an uncle who lives in @LOCATION1, and we rarely get to see each other due to the distance, so we catch up by messaging each other on social networks or via emails. It's even free, unlike the costly long - distance calls. The communication is also great for businesses. A company can reach out and contact their customers to reschedule an appointment, give receipts, advertise, and do many other things. Computers are essential and effective technology that is used by people around the country and the world. They improve hand - eye coordination, allow people to gain knowledge and education, and give people the opportunity to communicate with others. This is another great and useful step in the development of our communities around the world. In conclusion, we should embrace the positive aspects of computer technology for our personal and social growth."
1618	1622	1	3	There are many reasons that computers are a good thing for the world. They let us learn about far - away places without us even having to leave our homes. Another important reason why computers are so significant is that we can stay in touch with our family without having to travel, whether they live in another country, another state, or even if they are our neighbors. Lastly, they teach us hand - eye coordination, which is a much - needed skill that can help us get through life. The fantastic thing about computers is that we can learn about far - away places without leaving the comfort of our home. People from all different countries may be inquisitive about where they came from. They may also wonder how other countries are doing in terms of government or even economically, such as the stock market. All of this information is accessible, and it's much quicker than watching the news or the weather channel. Computers allow us to search the web and arm ourselves with knowledge. The speed of computers is truly remarkable. You could be waiting for a stock update on the news channel, waiting maybe ten or even twenty minutes. However, if you use the internet on your computer, it makes your life much easier. The faster you can look up some piece of knowledge, the faster you might be able to make dinner or even enjoy a nice walk outside and breathe in the nice, icy, crisp, cold air. Also, radios and television stations might have some inaccuracies. Maybe a minute later, there is a suicide bombing that you might like to know about, or the stock might go up one - hundred points or go down one - hundred points. This is all valuable information that people would want to be one - hundred percent accurate. Secondly, you can stay in touch with your family even if they live in a different country or in a different state. With webcams that are attachable to some computers or some that are embedded within the computers, you can have face - to - face conversations with them. My grandma was in the hospital once, and I wasn't allowed to see her since I was too young. Thanks to the technology of webcams, I was able to see her on the screen instead of seeing her in real life, but at least I was able to see if she was doing okay. Webcams are also useful in discussions. For example, you and your friend are joking, and she says something you think is rude, but you can't tell if she's being sarcastic. You might get into a fight. If you have a webcam, you can talk to each other on the computer and see if she's being sarcastic or not. Technology may be one of the greatest inventions that has come forth and may be the best one that will ever be made. The last important thing that you need to know about computers is that they teach you hand - eye coordination. Hand - eye coordination is an important skill that is acquired over time. This skill is crucial because it allows you to succeed in life, such as when you have to write. This skill is also important if you have a job that involves computers because you need to know how to type and move your fingers quickly if you want to succeed in this well - paid job. This skill also opens up a wide range of other successful jobs in the world. Computers in the long run are magnificent machines that make life a lot easier and fun in acquiring knowledge. If you don't have good hand - eye coordination, you should get a computer because it will help a lot. However, if you get a computer, you must update it regularly so your computer will not become slow and start crashing on you. In conclusion, computers are indeed wonderful tools that enhance our lives in multiple ways, from learning to socializing and skill - building.
1619	1623	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Many people these days rely too much on technology. Everywhere you go, you usually see somebody on a phone, texting, on a computer, or plugged into an iPod. These people are not necessarily bad, but they are under the control of technology. Computers, for example, are, in the eyes of most people, fast, easy, and fun, but they also pose problems. Even though it seems like everybody has a computer, not everybody does. Also, people become overly dependent on such machines that they can become addicted to them. Computers may seem like they work @PERCENT1 of the time, but they can also be very unreliable. Just think about it, how many people do you know that use @CAPS4 or @CAPS5? A lot, I'm sure. Now multiply that number by itself for all the people they know and multiply it again and so forth. That number shows that, in fact, over @NUM1 million people use these platforms. Now, what are the chances that if you sent a friend a message through one of these programs (with the @NUM1 million + people on it) that the server will be @PERCENT1 reliable and your pal receives the information he needs? My point is that, what if something important came up that required your friend's help, and you could not reach him because of a fault in the system? What would happen? You could be at a hospital waiting for a ride home for an hour longer than it should have taken. Another problem is what if you needed to contact a specific person urgently, and you specifically needed to use a computer to reach them? If they did have one, you could get the job done in @NUM3 minutes, but how else could you contact them? You could try to call, but what if they are outside playing with their dog? Also, these days, if you are really grateful for something, you might go on Google and type in virtual thank - you cards. If the person gets it, they will be happy, but they would probably be much more pleased if they got a handmade, real thank - you card in the mail. My final reason that computers hurt us more than they help is addiction. As I said in my first paragraph, everywhere you go, you see somebody wired into an electronic device. People no longer go outside and play games like cowboys and @CAPS7 because now all they have to do is hit play. I will admit I too use my computer quite a bit, but at least I budget my time so I can also go outside and play for a while. Obesity also stems from the overuse of electronics, along with many other health and social problems. In conclusion, we need to be more aware of the negative impacts of computer over - reliance and find a better balance in our lives.
1620	1624	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1 of the @ORGANIZATION2, You know that computers have been around since the @DATE1. Ever since then, many people have had a better life. Computers really help the elderly out a great deal. When they need to pay a bill, they can simply log in, pay it, and move on. Another advantage is that if they need to write a letter, but their handwriting isn't as elegant as it used to be, they can type it, print it, and be done. This way, the person receiving the letter will be able to read it clearly. Computers are a trend that will never die out. Doctor @PERSON2 of the @ORGANIZATION1 in @PERSON1 said, ""The children I work with use computers every day to build their hand - to - eye skills, and ever since they started, that skill has increased by @PERCENT1."" The corporate representative from @ORGANIZATION3 said that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people agree that everyone should have a computer. Computers help you with projects, and I think everyone should have one too. Are you ever sitting home with nothing to do? Well, why don't you go out and buy a computer to play with? Computers can help you do all sorts of things. If you like to play video games, then you'll love these machines. There are all types of game systems available just for computers. They also have websites you can visit just to play those games. I'm sure most of you like to play games, so why not give it a try? A basic computer isn't that expensive if you're worried about the money. So, go out and buy one. There are a lot of people in college now, and mostly all of them have computers. They make research easier and faster to find. Which would you rather do: get ready, jump in the car, drive to the library, search for a book, stand in line, and check it out, or get on the computer, search for what you're looking for, and be done? You should make that decision. When college students get stressed, which happens quite often, they can turn on music from the computer to calm themselves down. Computers have changed the world in a positive way, and they continue to do so. You should buy a computer today. In conclusion, computers offer numerous benefits in education, entertainment, and stress - relief, and it's a wise choice to own one."
1621	1625	1	3	I believe that computer technology has a positive effect on people. I think this because it can teach you how to type faster, learn about far - off places, and talk to people online. Here are some reasons why. My first reason is that the computer can teach you how to type faster. For example, with fast typing skills, you can be more competitive in the job market and land a good job or build a successful career, which paves the way for a bright future. Another example is that you can quickly send e - mails, saving time and being more efficient compared to slow typing. Last example, by regular practice on the computer, you can continuously improve your typing skills and become an expert typer. My second reason is that you can learn about far - away places. For instance, you can explore other countries, understand their unique cultures, and compare them with our own to see both differences and similarities. Another example is that when you have school projects, the computer can be your best resource. You can gather all the necessary information and be well - prepared for a great project. Last example, every day, you can learn new things from your computer, like the latest news, weather forecasts, etc. My third reason is that the computer allows you to communicate with other people. For example, you can keep in touch with your friends and family, check on their well - being, and share your daily life. Another example is that when you're bored at home, you can always find someone to talk to on the computer and have a great time. Last example, you can plan outings with your friends through online communication. That way, you can go outside, enjoy the fresh air, and have real - life interactions. That's why I think that computer technology is a great asset. It can teach you how to type faster, help you learn about far - away places, and enables you to talk to people online. I hope you agree with me and recognize that computer technology is a wonderful addition to our daily lives.
1622	1626	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 have made remarkable progress with technology. Computers and other gadgets have propelled us forward. However, the computer is one gadget that fails to benefit society. My reasons for this are that when you are on a computer, you could be cyber - bullied. My next reason is that when you stay on the computer too long, you miss out on precious moments, such as spending quality time with family. The last reason why computers do not benefit society is that when you type on a computer, the spell - check on @CAPS3 corrects spelling, punctuation, and grammar, so you don't learn from your mistakes. These reasons support my view that computers haven't really benefited society. Firstly, my first reason for saying that computers have not benefited society is that you can get cyber - bullied. For instance, someone goes home after a long day and checks their email. They find threatening emails waiting for them. They're filled with fear and don't know what to do. Cyber - bullying, facilitated by computers, is the easiest way to bully somebody. You can make them feel bad without any physical confrontation, just by typing a message. All you really have to do is find out somebody's email. Also, the cyber - bully could be anyone, someone you know or a complete stranger. Computers have contributed to an increase in such crimes in society. Next, my reason is that if you stay on the computer too long, you miss out on life. Between checking multiple email accounts and constantly updating @CAPS4, the average person spends @PERCENT1 of their day on the computer. People who spend that much time on the computer often miss important events and interactions. My sister always interrupts conversations with questions because she's busy following and updating on @CAPS4 while @CAPS2 are having a chat. People are so engrossed in the computer that they miss out on real - life experiences. Lastly, when you are typing an essay or something, you don't learn anything about grammar or spelling because spell - check does it for you. Most teenagers in @LOCATION1 when texting don't use proper grammar or spelling. So they can write an essay in text language and when typing it over, students just choose what they mean from spell - check and move on. This is unacceptable because students must learn proper grammar and spelling. This is reducing students' thinking levels to just reading and clicking the answer. If computers did everything for us, @CAPS2 would quickly become mindless slugs. In conclusion, I firmly believe that computers have not benefited society. They induce cyber - bullying, prevent us from learning through spell - check, and cause people to miss out on life. Computers have not helped society for all of these reasons and more. Computers should be used less to restore a healthy balance in our lives.
1623	1627	1	3	Dear local Newspaper, I think using a computer has become a negative influence on modern society. When people communicate with each other via text message or e - mail, there is a lack of emotional connection. You're in the dark because you can't see who's on the other side of the screen. All you know is the username of that person. It's practically like wearing a disguise. Not only is the computer harmful to your health, but it has also become a threat to its users. Would you really want to use something that is so detrimental to your health and privacy? Statistics show that @PERCENT1 of teenagers have access to and use the internet more than three times a week. Statistics also show that more than half of teenagers in the @CAPS2.S.A spend more than @NUM1 hours on a computer, and some even spend @NUM2 hours! This has become an addiction in the world. My friend used to rarely use a computer and always played outside. When his sister introduced him to @CAPS3, @CAPS4, MySpace, @CAPS5, etc., he would stay on the computer for hours. After a month, the situation didn't improve. Day after day, he came outside less and less, and I started to be disappointed with him because of that. Statistics show that people who use computers excessively tend to experience a drop in their grades. People get so absorbed in these machines that they become anti - social, neglect their homework, potentially fail the unit, and may have to repeat the grade. Computers are similar to watching TV. Sure, they teach hand - to - eye coordination, but at the same time, they're turning people's brains into a mess. I believe that computers are as bad an idea as pouring gasoline on pancakes. In conclusion, the negative impacts of computers on modern society, including the lack of emotional communication, health risks, addiction, and academic decline, clearly show that we need to be more cautious about our computer use.
1624	1628	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I think that computers are great for our society. Computers have a positive impact on people. They teach people hand - eye coordination and provide knowledge about places all over the world. Computers are also excellent for online communication with family and friends. Computers teach people hand - eye coordination. They help people get used to looking at a screen and typing letters to form words accurately. For students who play the piano, like me, computers are extremely helpful. It trains us to look at the music while our fingers instinctively know where to play. The computer and the piano are similar in that they both require you to look at a visual source (screen or music) while your fingers perform specific actions. So, I think computers help children and teens develop better hand - eye coordination. Computers are also very useful for everyone as they are great for researching facts or planning vacations. Say you come home from school, and your teacher assigns you to write a two - page paper on the @CAPS1 @CAPS2. You can't rely on memory alone; you need facts. You could go to the library, but if no one can take you, a computer is the perfect solution. You can research the topic from the comfort of your home, even in your pajamas. Computers provide you with the necessary information. Or if you're planning a vacation in @LOCATION1 and don't know where to stay, the internet can offer you a wide range of great options. Another advantage of computers is communication. You can use platforms like A.I.M. online. You can have conversations with your friends and family. This year, my brother and my closest cousin went to college. Now I only see them about twice a year, and it's so quiet at home without them. When I want to talk to my brother, using the computer makes it feel like he's right there with me. He sends me pictures of his college, friends, and the fun places he visits. Without computers, I would hardly ever see or talk to my brother. Local newspaper, please consider my opinion. I believe that computers benefit our society. They enhance hand - eye coordination in teens and children, assist in school research when the library is not accessible, and keep me connected to my brother in college. I hope you recognize the many positive contributions that computers make to our community and world.
1625	1629	1	3	Dear Newspaper, I am writing this letter to explain to you how more people in our society would benefit from using computers. You can complete work in less time compared to doing it manually. You can interact and make more friends through online chatting or web - conferencing. Not to forget, it is also highly entertaining. That is what computers were designed for: to assist us with tasks and for our personal enjoyment. How do computers help us with work? Let's say you're having a business meeting and need to write a five - page report with pictures and graphs. It would take you much longer to do that by hand than with a computer. With a computer, you can type your work, which makes it neater and more professional - looking. You can search for and copy and paste images from the internet. Using graph - making software, you can simply input the collected data, and the computer will generate the graph. If you had to do this by hand, you'd have to write extremely neatly, search for pictures in a newspaper, or even draw them. Then you'd have to create the graph carefully, making sure not to make any mistakes. It's much more difficult to complete a simple task without a computer. What if you want to talk to a friend? With a computer, you can easily communicate with a friend, unlike having to write a letter or talk on the phone. You can either type a chat or even have a video call, seeing the person on your computer screen. Instead of just hearing their voice or waiting days to communicate, you can have an immediate conversation. If you have a laptop, you can talk to them no matter where they or you are. Being able to see the person at your convenience and talk without leaving your house is a great advantage. The benefits are significant, and it doesn't cost anything to chat. If you have a friend or relative living far away, you can easily have a video conference. What about entertainment? The computer is a very valuable tool! We can have fun by playing games or watching videos at our convenience. Games don't cost much to download and can be played with friends on a web - chat or alone. Videos can be watched without ads interrupting, and you can pause them anytime. This is more efficient and convenient. In conclusion, I believe that people would gain a lot from using computers. They make work easier, facilitate communication, and provide entertainment. Technology was created to simplify our lives, so we should make full use of it.
1626	1630	1	3	Has a computer ever helped you answer a hard question or type up an essay for school or work? I know a computer has helped me for years, so why would I terminate it or want it gone? Here's the controversy: many experts believe computers don't benefit society, but people, such as myself, believe the exact opposite. There are many benefits to owning a computer, such as they're always a reliable source of information, allow you to talk online with others in real - time, and they can assist people with their school and job - related tasks. No matter what the problem, don't you believe a computer is always a valuable source of information that could help? A computer has endless information on any topic, unlike books. This is because everyone, from the most to the least intelligent people, has shared their opinions, ideas, and hard facts in a computer on the web. I once watched a movie of a man who despised computers and new technology. Thus, for most of his life, he wandered the world with no hint or clue as to where to search in search of a rare artifact called the @CAPS1 diamond. He never found the diamond, but his son who searched it on the internet found out the root geo from @CAPS1 meant underground in ancient @CAPS2 culture. Due to a computer, he found the diamond underground, beneath the ancient @CAPS2 temples. Therefore, I believe if people would embrace technology such as computers, they would find many things that they never thought of. Also, computers give you the convenient ability to chat online with family and friends. Many people use computers to stay in touch when they have no available phones. With a computer, you could chat with your friend down the street or your family member on vacation in another country. No matter where you are, a computer can always be an available form of communication. For example, the only way many of our soldiers fighting wars stay in touch with their loved ones back home is by talking to them online with a computer. One thing I know is no matter how old, probably up to about @NUM1, if you have a job or go to school, you have used a computer to help you with @CAPS4. Whether it was getting an answer to a homework question or researching a person for a project, we all use computers. Computers even have the ability to help you make professional - looking brochures or pamphlets. This can greatly help you advertise if that is something you do at work. Also, many people don't have the neatest handwriting, so they type their essay or letter to their boss. You can even choose what type of font it types in. No matter the case, with work, a computer always helps. Yes, I do believe computers benefit the society. Although some experts do disagree with me and believe they can become an addiction, still take my suggestions seriously and continue to use your computer. Remember, it is always a source of info., you can chat online, and it helps with work. In conclusion, the advantages of computers far outweigh the potential drawbacks, and they are an indispensable part of modern life.
1627	1631	1	3	"I believe that computers are a truly great invention. It allows people to interact with people from very far - off places easily and quickly. It has lots of fun and engaging games you can play. And it is also an excellent way to learn detailed information on various topics and places very far off. Being able to talk to relatives from far away places is extremely important. @PERCENT1 of experts say that having a close - knit family will give kids a greater chance of going to college. I understand why some people think ""well why doesn't the..."". I grew up in a big family, and just the whole day, the phone was constantly getting used. The computer has a large number of fun games that you can play. I see why you might think that the computer is why kids are overweight, but it isn't the hours on the computer. It's the eating habits. Studies show that computers are used in the winter two times as much as in other seasons. Going on the internet to learn new information is a great way of utilizing your resource. Just imagine this: a straight - A student comes home for the weekend about to do the biggest project and, like, forgets to bring home the most important book. She is flipping out, looking all over the place and hyperventilating. But if you had a computer, your daughter would be able to get the project done and go to the college of her dreams. But since you didn't buy a computer, she is going to fail her class, not be accepted to Harvard, and settle for the local community college where maybe one day she will be able to transfer. So I've given you reasons to go out and buy a computer. You just have to go do it. Do you want your kids to interact with aunt Sally who lives @NUM1 miles away? Also, it is a great way to play games. And lastly, do you want your daughter to go to Yale or do you want her to fail? I have given you the facts, and the rest is up to you. In conclusion, investing in a computer can open up a world of opportunities for your family and children, so it's a decision worth considering."
1628	1632	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I do believe that computers can be highly positive. If you think about it, they can actually assist you in learning with all those different and useful programs they have. Say you need tutoring or advice, you can basically find all that on a computer. Even if you have a little kid with you, I'm absolutely sure that they have well - designed websites and programs for them, and trust me, they're both fun and educational! You know how people are complaining that computers are taking away time from exercising, and interacting with family and friends? Well, what if you have family living somewhere else. You can conveniently chat with them! And also do exercise while on the computer. For example, there are fitness video tutorials available. I'm sure if you keep reading, you'll know why I think they're positive. Having trouble in school? Are they blaming it on computers? Well, we can change that! If we're able to prove to people that computers can help us learn and are educational, then people might actually think that computers aren't bad, considering all of this technology that we're coming up with these days isn't that bad. I'm pretty sure that they have some sort of comprehensive tutoring program, and they even have full - fledged college courses online! Now, there's something to look into. Do you have a kid, a younger friend, or even a younger brother and sister? Are they always looking for games to play? Well, I'm @PERCENT1 sure that they have a wide variety of fun learning games and websites on a computer! So, while they're having fun, you can just think of how much they're learning now! It's a really fun way of learning! You can just imagine what they're learning and how well they're doing in school. Do you have family who live far away that you don't see much? Well, if you all have a computer, then you can possibly stay in close touch! You guys can chat with each other, check up on each other, and see how everyone is doing. It's a perfect way to stay in touch. Want to know what would also be a good way to connect? A webcam! You don't have to have one; it's just a suggestion. So that way, not only do you get to talk to them, but you can see them too. Isn't that cool? I don't know about you, but I think so. Well, now that you've heard what I've had to say about how I think computers are positive, I hope you think the same too. If you really think about it, they aren't bad at all. They're actually very helpful. Thank you. In conclusion, computers offer numerous benefits in learning, socializing, and more, and we should embrace their positive aspects.
1629	1633	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, I think that computers affect our country in a very positive way. Three reasons why I think so are communication, information access, entertainment, and employment facilitation. One of my favorite things to do is talk. When one of my best friends moved away and I lost his phone number, I thought we had no way of communicating. One day, he requested me on Facebook, and from there on, we have been communicating on websites like Facebook, MySpace, and Skype. My second reason why computers benefit our society is information access. At my dad's house, I do not have a television, so I rely on the internet to keep me well - informed on what is going on in the world. A website called @CAPS4.com was the first to announce @PERSON1's death before anyone even suspected it. Stories like that often break first on the internet. The third reason why computers benefit our society is entertainment. You can watch high - quality videos, play exciting games, listen to great music, and communicate with friends in real - time. The last reason why computers benefit our society is employment facilitation. Many jobs in our community require computer skills, such as an accountant, a manager, a software designer, and a computer programmer. The computer makes work and more efficient by correcting mistakes accurately, providing useful visual aids, and enabling fast typing. These are the reasons why computers affect our community in a positive way. In conclusion, computers play a vital role in various aspects of our lives, from personal communication to professional development, and their positive impact on society is undeniable.
1630	1634	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper @CAPS1, @CAPS2 is a great concern about computers and whether or not people spend too much time sitting in front of the screen. I believe that people should be more aware of the time they spend on the computers. Instead of ruining your eyes by staring at the screen for long hours, you should be exercising regularly, enjoying nature, and being with family and friends in person. Exercising is a major and essential part of every person's life, and if you don't get enough of it, you could become obese. Obesity @MONTH1 can cause people to have negative opinions about you or think that you are a slob. Although you might say that you don't care what others think, but in the long run, it might be a big mistake if you think this way. Exercise will most likely rid you of almost any type of discrimination because you will look no different or even better than the average person. If you ever get the chance, get a telescope and set it up in a spot where you can clearly see the stars at night. Instead of keeping your eyes glued to the computer on a nice, sunny day, go for a refreshing walk in the woods. As you can see, nature is much more beautiful than hundreds of tiny dots of colors forming an image of nature on a screen. If you find an image of a beautiful plant, why not go and see or feel the plant 'in person'? Many programs are now available on computers that let you see people, but wouldn't you rather talk to him or her in real life? I sure would, and I think most other people would as well. @PERCENT1 of the population of @LOCATION1 said that they would much rather talk to friends or relatives in person than on a computer screen. I feel that however possible, you should always talk to people in person and not through cameras and wires. I hope I have made myself clear that exercising, nature, and people in real life are all much better options than being in front of a computer for the rest of your life. In conclusion, while computers have their uses, we should not let them replace the real - life experiences that are so important for our well - being.
1631	1635	1	3	Computers are today a common household item, and some people think it's bad for society. In reality, it's our most useful tool nowadays. It supplies easy access to information, along with preparing skills for future generations. It also offers an escape from life's sometimes cruel days through gaming. Before computers, people spent hours in books to find what they were looking for. The computer solves this. It's as simple as typing what you need to know and hitting the enter key. This improves grades for children and enriches the lives of adults, solving problems without leaving your home and allowing news to spread as soon as it's known. It also creates an interactive place for anyone in the world, with things like question - and - answer platforms. This allows us not only to ask opinions and compare responses but to get statistics that, in certain months, help us make life - altering decisions. Not only does it supply info, but it also prepares us for the world. It helps children develop social and decision - making skills. It also teaches them skills like web design, as well as simpler things like time management and tougher things like business concepts. Along with all that, it gives a sense of community. Online video gaming is today a huge industry, which allows people to do anything from dance, build, fight, smith, tailor, and so on. In fact, a significant number of games are suitable for various ages. It also improves hand - eye coordination at the same time. So when you have a rough day, it tends to bring people happiness. So computers are a necessity and can put your mind to work, and within a reasonable limit, you can pursue your dreams!
1632	1636	1	3	It has come to my attention that there is an argument about whether or not computers have a positive effect on people. I think that computers do have a positive effect on people because with computers, people can get needed information that could be used to help them in various aspects of life. It lets people talk to friends and family around the world conveniently, and also computers teach people new things. Therefore, computers have a positive effect on people. Students, whether it be at college or elementary schools, almost always turn to a computer when they have to do projects for their classes. Without computers, students wouldn't be able to get the information that they need in a timely manner and could cause them to get a bad grade on the project, which could result in their grades getting worse and worse over time. Adults use computers often for work and planning. So if there weren't any computers, then it would mean thousands of people would lose their jobs and could forget scheduled plans that could be important. This could result in causing families to lose money, not having enough money to pay bills, and could ultimately result in losing their homes and having to live on the streets. Every person has at least two or more friends or relatives that live in a different place in the world that is not easy to stay in contact with. Using traditional long - distance calling could waste a lot of money. However, with computers, people can talk to friends and relatives from around the world without having to spend any extra money on phone calls. Also, if something happens to a family member or somewhere around where a relative lives, we could use the internet to check in with them to see if everything is ok. Many parents are using computers to help teach their kids at a very young age so they are ready for when they go to school for the first time. Also, computers are used at schools mainly to teach the students about things that they need to know for the future. As a result, computers become very useful to people when they are trying to learn how to do something, whether it's for school, college, or a job. Computers are often used daily for important things that we need to learn for our lives in the future, so we won't need any extra help trying to learn how to do something. Also, we would be able to help people when they need help if we already knew what to do. As you can see, computers do have a positive effect on people because people can use computers to help them gain the information they need for school or work, it lets you check in with friends and family from around the world, and finally, computers help teach us very important life lessons. In conclusion, computers have a positive effect on people and it could save a person from losing things that are important to themselves or others.
1633	1637	1	3	To [Insert appropriate CAPS1], [Insert appropriate CAPS2] [Insert appropriate ORGANIZATION1], computers are a significant benefit to our society. These computers are an advantage to our learning and knowledge acquisition. By using computers, students can get their work done quicker and more efficiently. While typing your report on the computer, if you might spell a word wrong, every computer has a spell - check feature. Also, if you need to look up a word because you don't know the definition, all you have to do is go to [Insert appropriate LOCATION1] and type in the word, and automatically you have the definition at your fingertips. You may have been given a book report, and although [Insert appropriate CAPS2] doesn't allow you to copy and paste directly, if you were using a piece of paper and a pen, you could write down the relevant information. A computer has made the life of a school student so much easier. If you need a job but can't stand, walk, talk, well, you could get a job working on a computer. Computers have allowed more jobs to be created and some traditional jobs to be replaced in a positive way. Without a computer, how would teachers get mail sent to them without wasting paper? Sure, a computer uses electricity, but paper production wastes trees. Anyway you think about it, the computer is a good thing to invest in. Going to college, not everyone has enough time in a day to drive to school. Well, with your computer, you can go to school right online. So if you don't have money to buy a backpack, you don't need one as your materials stay right where you left them on the computer. So a computer is a great invention. [Insert appropriate CAPS2] has made life quicker, more eco - friendly, and even has saved trees. On the bright side, [Insert appropriate CAPS2] has even produced many jobs. Last - minute tasks can even be completed online. Each computer bought has given someone else a new source of income.
1634	1638	1	3	"I believe that computers are helpful and useful to us. They provide us with a wealth of entertainment options, enable us to communicate with one another effectively, and even help us learn new knowledge. Today, if it's raining outside, or it's too cold to do anything outdoors, you can turn on the computer. You can watch movies, play games, and engage in web - chatting. The computer is a great machine, and health expert [Insert appropriate PERSON1] says ""computer usage is fine so long as it's limited to about an hour or an hour and a half a day"". Some people complain that people aren't getting enough exercise because of computers. But it's not really the computers' fault that they aren't exercising. In today's modern world, you can call someone, text someone, or page them with the help of computers. Moreover, with a webcam, you can video - chat with people and send each other videos. You can also connect with your friends on popular social media platforms like Facebook or MySpace. Sociologist [Insert appropriate PERSON2] says that more and more people are connecting to social websites and talking with their friends. ""[Insert appropriate CAPS1] websites are great,"" [Insert appropriate CAPS2] also said. ""[Insert appropriate CAPS1] enables you to talk with your friends when they're far away, or you just can't see them. However, nothing beats real - life connection."" Computers also help us learn. They can answer almost any question you have and offer a vast amount of information. Today, most people rely on them for knowledge. Some people still might think that computers are bad for you and they cause lack of exercise, but I believe people have the choice to make friends and stay active. They choose to over - use the computer, and too much of anything is a bad thing. Computers today are an invaluable part of life and are irreplaceable."
1635	1639	1	3	Dear [Insert appropriate CAPS1], as you know, more and more people are starting to use computers. In my opinion, I think the computer does benefit society in many ways. One positive effect it has on people is that they can communicate easily. Through the computer, people are able to send messages to each other in a matter of seconds. If someone doesn't have a phone or a car, they can simply go online, write a message, and click the send button. This is an easy way to communicate with someone who lives halfway around the world as well. If you have family members who live far away, you can also send them pictures of yourself, your friends and family, and places you've been to. They can receive them and also send pictures back, thus strengthening the family bond. Another positive effect computers have on people is that they can learn new things. The internet allows you to search different topics and basically has a vast amount of information on everything and anything you could ever think of. If you go on [Insert appropriate ORGANIZATION1] and type in a word like 'dog,' you'll see a bunch of websites that will take you to other websites that are just about dogs. You can find a detailed list naming types of dogs, how old a dog can live up to, where most dogs are found, how to care for them well, etc. The internet lets you explore new things and helps you find ideas. You name it; it's there. The computer also comes in handy when you have nothing to do. If you're bored and can't play outside because the weather is bad or you broke your leg, you can play computer games, listen to music online, or write your own story on a word document. Playing computer games can teach you techniques to help play a game better and also keep you busy. If you want to listen to music to keep yourself entertained, you can go on [Insert appropriate CAPS3] or other music - streaming sites and find any song you want to hear. It's better than listening to the radio because sometimes you don't like the song that's being played. If you're also in the mood to write a story, you can open a word document and pour out what's on your mind. As you can see, I think the computer is a fascinating tool to use. You can communicate, learn new things, and keep yourself entertained if you're not able to do something active. Just remember, whenever you can, go out and play or hang out with friends and family to maintain a balanced lifestyle.
1636	1640	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, in @CAPS3 communities, most people either own computers or laptops. These two devices essentially do the same things. These electronics are quite familiar to us. They can assist you in accomplishing numerous tasks that other tools @MONTH1 can't. These @MONTH1 technologies can even help you find long - lost siblings or anyone else you @MONTH1 specifically want to find. However, computers @MONTH1 can also get you into trouble or @CAPS4 if you're not careful when using them. ""I went to find my brother after I left my mother's house,"" cried the woman. That's a task that a computer can handle. @CAPS3 websites accessible through a computer @MONTH1 can help you achieve this, such as Facebook, MySpace. This can impact yours and @CAPS3 morals. It can completely transform your life in an instant. It can turn what seems like a difficult time into a good one just by helping you find your loved ones. But computers come with @CAPS3 risks. You might try to pay your bills online and send your money to the wrong websites, which can lead to identity theft. You could also put all your personal information online without giving it much thought when in fact, it matters a lot. You can expose your phone number, address, and many more details, and people @MONTH1 might contact you pretending to be someone else and @MONTH1 deceive you or even cause you harm. @CAPS3 people might think it's very safe, but it isn't. @CAPS4 Be cautious about what you do. The computer is a major reason why @CAPS3 people don't like going out to buy things anymore; they'd rather just shop online. That's one reason why you may start to become overly lazy. You @MONTH1 might just stay home and play games online all day. @CAPS4 @CAPS3 More Americans are falling into this trap. You should do both in moderation instead of being lazy. In the end, computers are useful @CAPS4, but you should focus on the pros and manage the cons."
1637	1641	1	3	People generally think the computer is something great and cool. Why is it cool? It's cool because the computer can assist you in every aspect. I have several reasons. The first reason is that when you're at school and have homework, assignments, projects, or anything similar, the computer can be of great help. Because on the computer, you can access the internet and visit Google or other useful websites. The second reason is that the computer is helpful at home. For example, if you have a big problem with your car or something like that, you can go on the computer to @LOCATION1 and then find the parts of your car. The third reason why the computer is so cool is that in this era, you can do almost everything with it. We can access the web to simplify our lives. Now you can complete work, homework, projects, generate ideas, write books, chat, gather information, print pictures, and so on. And if you're an architect, you can create your own designs or visualize your dream house. You can see that the computer is truly amazing. However, some people use the computer for bad purposes, such as accessing pornography or engaging in other inappropriate activities. This is not cool and not suitable for people. The computer is something fabulous and super - intelligent. In my opinion, the computer is extremely helpful and is almost a necessity in our lives. Not for survival, but for enhancing the quality of our lives or something @CAPS1. You can even see your family through a webcam. This is wonderful, but don't use the webcam for bad things. You can learn things you don't know. I think you should use the computer for good things. Appreciate the computer. Please.
1638	1642	1	3	Dear local newspaper, Technology is an important part of everyday living and even some people's lifestyle. Without technology, more specifically, computers, mankind would be at a loss. We wouldn't be able to learn about far - away places and people, conduct research with a wider range of available information, or for some people, communicate with friends and family. Whether they realize it or not, technology is needed in everyone's life. There is an endless number of things you can do on the computer, and as far as technological advances are concerned, this is only the beginning. The internet allows people to learn more than just what you'd find in a library book. You can learn about the unique culture of @LOCATION1, the delicious food they eat in @LOCATION2, or even the traditional way people dress in @LOCATION3. You can find pictures and details of far - away places and discover the currency or customs of a country. One of the many possibilities the @CAPS1 computer offers is research. When preparing for a presentation, it can make the process much easier! Furthermore, the computer enables people to communicate with others. For some, this is their only means of communication. If you have a pen - pal in a @CAPS1 state, or maybe even a @CAPS1 country, email is a great way to talk to them. It's a quick, easy, and enjoyable tool. Others, however, prefer instant messaging - the message you type appears almost instantly on the other person's computer, and then they can type a response that comes back to you right away! Either method is an excellent way of communication! So you see, without technology, we wouldn't be able to learn everything we'd like to, conduct research for, say, a language arts class. We might not even be able to communicate with some people. And this is only a glimpse of what our lives would be like without the computer. In conclusion, the computer has become an indispensable part of our lives, and we should embrace its continued development.
1639	1643	1	3	To the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, In this day and age, computer technology dominates the world. It's where we get our news, music, do our shopping, and even find entertainment. Sounds great, right? But there are some significant downsides to this source of information. Such as, this gadget is taking over people's lives and preventing them from exercising. Nowadays, people are even losing human interaction because of these so - called marvelous toys. And finally, computers are very expensive electronics. They require a lot of maintenance, which costs you money and ultimately makes you feel down. As you can see, although there are some great advantages to computers, there are also quite big drawbacks that you may not have considered yet. As I previously mentioned, computers are causing people to exercise less. We're all becoming increasingly lazy. People would rather stay in front of their computer screens playing Grand Theft Auto or stalking people on Facebook than go outside and play a game of soccer with friends at the empty field down the street. @PERCENT1 of the @LOCATION1 population goes without physical activity for at least a @DATE1 and a half. @PERCENT2 of those people would rather just stay at home on their computers. This is unacceptable! We cannot let this situation continue. We must change our lifestyle and reduce our reliance on this unhealthy appliance we call a computer. Of all the reasons why computers are bad, this is by far the most disturbing. People are having fewer and fewer human interactions as computers become more popular. Now, you can do everything from your computer. Soon, people might actually start marrying them. Oh wait, that's already happened. Just yesterday, I read in the latest issue of @CAPS4 @CAPS5 that a man married a character in his computer game. There was a priest present, and everything was formal. They just recently returned from their honeymoon. This is truly sad! Look at what our world has become. People would rather marry a computer character than have real - life conversations with others. We must act quickly; I don't know what will happen next. Finally, computers are costly. You pay @MONEY1 for the computer upfront, but then there's all the maintenance, and there's a lot of it. Computers are very troublesome. You keep spending money on them, which is just depressing. It will likely break down again soon or freeze, causing you to lose a report you've worked on all night. For example, on @DATE1, my dad had to pay @MONEY2 to get my @DATE1 computer fixed. He was very reluctant to pay it, and he was annoyed for the whole week after paying. It got even worse when it froze up again a week later. He was really frustrated. That's all you get from computers - more and more frustration. I just don't think it's worth it. In conclusion, we need to be more aware of the negative impacts of computers and use them more responsibly.
1640	1644	1	3	"Dear local newspaper, I firmly believe that computers can be detrimental to society. My reasons are that people are spending too much time on their computers, spending less time exercising, and losing interactions with family and friends. My first reason for thinking that computers are bad for our society is that people are spending an excessive amount of time on them. I know that when I get home from school, the only thing on my mind is getting on the computer. It's like an addiction. People spend all their time on social networks instead of going out and meeting new people in person. My second reason is that people spend less time exercising. I've been to a friend's house before, and all we did was play computer games instead of going outside and enjoying nature. A lot of @CAPS1 individuals don't make healthy food choices, so why not go out and exercise? It's because of the computer. I've seen my little brother spend his entire Saturday sitting in front of the computer, eating junk food and playing games. It's simply unhealthy. My last and final reason is that it takes time away from family and friends. I've spent my whole day after school in my room on the computer. It's as if when you're on the computer, nothing else matters because you think, ""Hey, why not just talk to my friends on @CAPS2, MySpace, or Facebook?"" You end up losing a lot of friendships this way. Also, you lose the connection with your family because you hardly talk to them while you're on the computer. Half the time, I'm too busy chatting with someone I don't know well instead of helping my little brother with his homework or assisting my mom with housework. In conclusion, these are my three reasons why I think the computer is bad for civilization. I sincerely hope you take all this into consideration and really think about what the computer can do to @CAPS1. We should be more mindful of our computer usage to maintain a healthy and balanced life."
1641	1645	1	3	"Dear @ORGANIZATION2, on @DATE1, it is evident that computers have become a significant part of our society. They represent a remarkable advance in technology and do bring about some positive effects. However, upon closer examination, it becomes clear that computers have more negative effects on people. They take away and diminish @CAPS3 time, limit opportunities for interacting with family, and prevent individuals from truly seeing the world.  First, computers have a negative effect on people because they severely diminish @CAPS3 time. People often get so caught up with computers that their desire for @CAPS3 starts to fade away. According to a comprehensive @ORGANIZATION3 survey conducted in @DATE2, a @CAPS1 person spending @NUM1 hours on the computer a week (roughly @NUM2 hours each day) experienced an increase in cholesterol and a gradual deterioration of muscles. ""@CAPS1 person needs about one to two hours of physical activity each day, and only @NUM2 out of @NUM4 people get this amount,"" says @PERSON1 of @ORGANIZATION1. When asked about the leading cause for this low number, she firmly replied, ""technology,"" specifically ""@CAPS2 computers, which take away all of the motivation and time people need to @CAPS3."" @CAPS3 is vital for maintaining a healthy lifestyle, and computers are unfortunately taking this away from society. People shouldn't have to suffer from bad @ORGANIZATION1 because of this negative effect caused by computers.  Second, computers have a negative effect on people because they deteriorate interaction with family. A staggering @NUM5 out of @NUM4 people say that computers take away from their precious family time, as reported by Family @CAPS4 @ORGANIZATION3. This is far from being a positive situation, especially since @CAPS1 person needs at least @NUM7 hours of interacting with family for an assured healthy mental state and well - being. Children are directly affected by computer use in family settings. When computer time starts to eat up the available time, it also cuts off communication, which is extremely important in raising children. As a result, family bonds and relationships are ruined as well. It's clear that computers have a negative effect on people when it comes to family interaction.  Lastly, computers have a negative effect on people because it takes away from people experiencing the real world. When you're engrossed in the computer, it may seem like the entire world is within your computer screen. But in reality, it's not. This is having a detrimental effect on people. @PERCENT1 of people who use computers on a consistent average of about @NUM2 hours a day have notably become withdrawn and unaware of their surroundings, according to myphyscology.net. The cure for this situation? Traveling, or even taking simple walks to enjoy nature can help. People should be aware of the world in which they live. They have to make important decisions for themselves, their children, and even their country, and simply staring at a computer screen won't help at all. It especially will have a negative impact on children, the next generation, who will have no real knowledge or a clear view of the world if people keep up their negative habits of excessive computer usage.  In conclusion, computers have negative effects on people. They diminish @CAPS3, leading to an increase in bad @ORGANIZATION1 and a growing need for @CAPS3. They cut family interaction by destroying family relationships and bonds, not to mention disrupting communication. Finally, they take away from people seeing the world, something that is actually very important as it affects people's decision - making as well as the future generations. People need to realize these bad effects and significantly decrease their computer usage."
1642	1646	1	3	Computers have a huge impact on people's lives! They can be both helpful and distracting at the same time. I have a computer at home, and I'm only allowed to use it after I finish my homework. I engage in a lot of activities on my computer, mostly playing games and visiting social websites like MySpace.  Computers can be extremely helpful. They are great for homework. For instance, when I have a project to work on or when I don't understand a particular subject, I use my computer to gather information. It's like having a vast library at my fingertips. I also find computers useful for staying in touch with friends and family. My family members live all the way in @LOCATION1, and I talk to them regularly through the computer. I go on MySpace about five times a week to catch up with them and share updates.  However, computers can also be a distraction. They can make people lazy and expose them to bad websites. MySpace, for example, can be dangerous. If you share all your important information with someone you don't know, it can turn out very badly. There are a lot of people who seem to be glued to the computer. I have many family members who only get up from their seats to go to the computer or play video games. They spend hours on it, sometimes up to eight hours a day.  My mom also uses the computer to go on @CAPS1. She loves talking to her friends from @LOCATION1. She still keeps in touch with her high - school classmates, but she mostly chats with her older sister. She's not on the computer for an extremely long time. She spends about @NUM2 minutes to an hour on it.  I think computers can be a great asset in life, but we shouldn't be on them for like eight hours a day. If you do that every day, you'll see the negative effects on yourself. My cousins, for example, are getting bigger and bigger (not in height). So, if you use the computer, make sure it's not for almost half the day. We should use computers wisely to enjoy their benefits without being overly consumed by them.
1643	1647	1	3	Dear newspaper, technology is a very useful thing, but it also has its downsides. It has a tendency to make people lazy. A computer, in particular, is a multi - use tool. With a computer, people can access any website for various purposes, whether it's for research or personal reasons.  First off, let me point out that computers are indeed useful multi - purpose tools. They can perform a wide range of functions and provide access to a wealth of information. However, computers can also make people sluggish or lazy. I feel this way because so many people spend hours sitting in front of the computer instead of getting up and being active. Being active is good and important for people's physical and mental health. A lot of people are not getting enough exercise because they are constantly on the computer. Students sometimes go home and head straight to the computer instead of doing their homework.  On the other hand, computers have many positive aspects. They can help you pay bills conveniently from the comfort of your home. You can also use them for research, finding information on any topic imaginable. And if you just want to have some fun, there are countless games and entertainment options available. There is an unlimited number of websites to explore, which can meet many of your needs. For example, uploading family pictures from your last vacation is a simple task with most computer software.  Finally, a computer is kind of like a blank canvas. It can be a source of inspiration, waiting for you to use it creatively. But we need to be careful not to let it make us too lazy. In conclusion, while technology, especially computers, offers many benefits, we should be aware of its potential to make us inactive and use it in a balanced way.
1644	1648	1	3	"Dear Local Newspaper, computers have a positive effect on people. With a computer, you have access to a world of possibilities! They provide plenty of information, offer new ways of communication, and even serve as a great source of entertainment. The only reason some people find computers to be unhealthy or negative is because some individuals abuse their ""computer - time"".  Ever used the popular website www.google.com? Sites like this, and many more, are invaluable when you need information. All you have to do is type in a word, and you'll automatically have hundreds or thousands of links, each containing information on that word, to choose from! How could having access to so much knowledge be considered unhealthy or have a negative effect on people? Computers are equipped with dictionaries, references, translators, encyclopedias, and history pages that hold a massive amount of information. So, go ahead and expand your knowledge with just a few clicks of the mouse.  If you log onto one of the most famous and well - used social networking websites, such as @CAPS1 or @CAPS2, you will discover a new and exciting way to communicate with friends and family. These platforms are equipped with tools and various settings to keep you safe. You can find long - lost friends or out - of - touch family members and instantly catch up with them. However, it's true that many people abuse those websites by putting up harmful words or inappropriate things. But this problem can be easily solved if you ""report"" them to the website manager or to an adult. You just have to know how to be safe online. If you do, you'll enjoy receiving messages from family or instant messages from friends, strengthening your relationships.  There is a wide variety of entertainment on your computer. From video - sharing websites like www.youtube.com to gaming websites like www.onemorelevel.com, these sites offer games, many videos, and even learning aids. There are also sites where you can purchase music, movies, clothes, and furniture. Many stores have online websites where you can purchase items and have them shipped to your front door. How could that possibly be a bad thing? Also, there are video games that are specially created for the computer, which you can buy and install for instant entertainment. I mean, who doesn't like to play games or shop without having to go through the trouble of finding time to go out and do it? I know my aunts really enjoy this convenience.  So you see, computers aren't negative, unless you abuse your ""computer - time"" and waste countless hours for no reason. You need to set a limit. Without it, it's just plain odd spending all day on a computer. So, have fun! Use your computer to learn, communicate, and entertain yourself in a balanced way."
1645	1649	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, computers tend to have more negative effects on people, rather than positive. This is true for several reasons. People @MONTH1 not be getting enough exercise, they @MONTH1 not be enjoying the beauty of nature, and lastly, they do not spend enough time with family and friends. Computers are useful to have around the house, but their overuse is causing problems.  To begin, people are spending an excessive amount of time on computers. This has a negative impact on their health because while on the computer, they are not getting the necessary exercise. Just think about a day where someone is sitting on the computer, eating fast food. Obesity is now a big concern for the @ORGANIZATION1. Staying glued to the computer does not help the situation at all. Any concerned person, even those who are technologically challenged, would agree that the countless hours spent on the computer are no good for the health of our country.  Furthermore, people are spending too much time on computers and not enough time appreciating the beauty of nature. Many people, both adults and children, have @DATE1 because they are so focused on the virtual world that they forget about the real world that should be explored. There are so many wonderful things in nature that people should be thankful for, but they just don't take the time to see them. They should be eager to experience the beauty that still exists @DATE1.  Although communication is important for everyone, instead of talking on the computer, people should make plans with their family and friends. This idea also relates back to the lack of exercise and the naivety of people. If people were to go out and enjoy life in the forest or other natural settings with their friends and family, there wouldn't be numerous hours a day wasted on a computer. People should get off their chairs and go out and live. Life is too short to sit around all day in front of a computer. Any intelligent person would realize that computer time isn't as fulfilling as family and friend time.  To conclude, computers are and have been very over - used recently. Instead of dealing with problems like lack of sun exposure, and just having boring computer talk, people should get up and go out and experience life. We only live once, and that once should be lived to the fullest. We need to balance our use of computers and make sure they don't overtake our real - life experiences.
1646	1650	1	3	Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 what would a person do without a computer? Well, I think they'd be at a loss because @CAPS1 if you're like me, having your family far away in another country, with a computer, you can see them through a camera and talk to them as if you were right there beside them. Computers aren't just time - consumers; they help you understand the true meaning of family. These are many reasons why I think computers should be very important. My first reason is that they give you detailed information about a place that you might be interested in visiting or learning about its culture. There are many people who love to explore and see new places, but they can't because maybe they simply don't have the time or they're swamped with work. There's no reason for someone to miss out on opportunities just because they don't have the time or a computer. My second reason is work. People like you who work in an office need in - depth information about a place where a disaster happened. You might need something to see exactly how it happened and @CAPS1 what the conditions were when it occurred. People who work in important places need a computer because they can save their work to avoid losing it and getting fired. My third and last reason is to be organized. Being organized is very important as it helps you keep a job or have everything at your fingertips. Well, computers aren't just a way to pass time; they also make your life easier. Many people say they don't @CAPS1 want to deal with too many papers. With a computer, you can have all those papers condensed into just one page that is saved by you, and only you can access it. As you @MONTH1 can see, many people who have computers use it in a productive way. It's not just a time - waster like people say it is. It also helps you do many things for your own future, not just to play around with some new friends. Well, as you @MONTH1 can see, these are my three main reasons for keeping a computer in your house and using it in a good and productive way. In conclusion, computers are an essential part of modern life, offering benefits in family connection, work, and organization.
1647	1651	1	3	Dear, @ORGANIZATION2. A computer is an incredibly helpful resource. It serves as a guide for people navigating through life. They can use it to find jobs, conduct research for school projects. This world would be unrecognizable without computers. But on the other hand, some people do spend an excessive amount of time on the computer. However, surfing the web for countless hours is their personal choice. Computers can assist students in doing research from the cozy comfort of their own homes. Instead of making a trip to the local library and spending hours searching for books, all they have to do is type in their research topic, and voila, tons of different websites are right there for them to explore. A computer truly puts the world at your fingertips. Also, a computer can be a great tool for unemployed people to find a job. It's straightforward; just type in the city you want to work in, and you're on your way. You can even fill out a job application right then and there. Hey, some people even have the luxury of working from home. Stay - at - home moms can easily earn money while taking care of daily chores like washing dishes. Also, working from home can be a lot less stressful. It's less stressful because you don't have to interact with annoying and impatient co - workers. Did you know that @PERCENT1 of employment is from the workers' homes? @CAPS1 now you know. Working from home turns another day at the office into another day at home. Computers have helped us progress a long way since caveman times. Without computers, this world would be a very different place. We wouldn't have many basic things like stoplights, elevators, and even blenders. We also wouldn't have the more sophisticated things likeockets (perhaps you meant gadgets), cars, and planes. Imagine an airport without computers; where would they store all of their information? On paper? Where would a school store all their grades and tardy records? On paper? Where would the government store their information? On paper? With just these three places, we'd already cut down half of the @ORGANIZATION1. Computers help the environment too. They will also help us to invent more advanced technology so that one day we can live on @CAPS2 or something similar. I hope this essay changed your mind about computers. Let's recap: they help students research, help people find jobs, allow you to work from home, and help the environment. Without computers, we'd be living in caves and walking around with leaves for underwear like cavemen. The bottom line is that computers are extremely helpful and have become an indispensable part of our lives.
1648	1652	1	3	Dear local news paper, @CAPS1 having computers is a great idea because every developed country makes extensive use of computers. Also, they @CAPS2 enhance learning, facilitate communication, and are commercially important. Computers also make life more convenient for many people. Computers @CAPS2 enhance learning by making a vast amount of information readily available. I personally find out about many world events just by opening yahoo.com. Computers allow me to learn about new @NUM1, such as different cuisines, and learning about cultures all over the world can be easily achieved through computers. The last way computers @CAPS2 enhance learning is by providing information about everyday things like how to get a stain out, how to pronounce a word correctly, how to make a new dish, and much more. Computers are also crucial for communication. We use computers to chat with our friends on facebook. You can also meet new people using a PC. Since everyone uses computers, you can basically meet anyone. The last reason computers are important is from the commercial standpoint. Computers help a lot of small businesses by making them known. Domestic sellers and huge companies can compete for the same customers. Furthermore, the internet generates a significant amount of money for people because they can use it as a cyber billboard. In conclusion, the computer is useful because of its contributions to learning, communication, and commerce. Therefore, the computer should be supported and not looked down upon. It is a vital part of modern society, enabling growth in multiple aspects of our lives.
1649	1653	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Have you ever spent more than an hour at once on the computer? Computers have a negative impact on people! You could be harming your eyesight, you should be spending time playing outside, and it'll make it more difficult to talk to people in person. Do your eyes tend to ache when you finally get off the computer? Whether you're playing games or typing articles, your eyes @MONTH1 constantly strain to keep up with the small font on a website. I remember the time when I was engrossed in an online novel, and my whole body was eager to go out and play, except for my eyes. Instead of playing sports games on the computer, you should get up and play one outside! When you're on a computer, you're most likely indoors. Did you know that a person should be outside for at least @NUM1 minutes to get their vitamin @CAPS3? You're not getting the right amount of vitamins you need daily while sitting in front of a computer screen. Do you ever find it easier to talk to someone on the computer than in person? You're not the only one who thinks that way. If you get off the computer and talk to someone face - to - face, you can improve your social skills. At first, it won't be easy, but it's worth it in the long run. By now, you know that computers aren't really having a positive effect. They're hurting your vision, limiting your outdoor activity time, and making it harder to communicate with people in person. So come on, put the mouse down and find something ""hands - on"" to do. In conclusion, we should be more aware of the negative impacts of excessive computer use and take steps to reduce our screen time for better health and social skills."
1650	1654	1	3	Computers do not benefit society today. Computers have made technology a necessity, many people don't spend enough time engaging in other activities, and they do not contribute to your health. Do you want a world full @ORGANIZATION1 of people who have their eyes glued to a computer screen? Computers are very useful to all people, but they are addictive. Computers were designed to get your tasks done more quickly and easily. For example, you can shop online and search for information on google. We live in a generation where computers have become a necessity rather @ORGANIZATION1 than a pleasure. According to @PERSON1, a psychologist at the @ORGANIZATION1, more than @PERCENT1 @ORGANIZATION1 of people, these days, are inside on their computers. Furthermore, computers are making people lazier. Instead @ORGANIZATION1 of going to the store to buy things or walking to your friend's house to talk, you would typically use the computer to do so. Therefore, people don't spend enough time doing other things. For example, on a sunny and beautiful day, you'd expect most kids to be outside having fun, but that's not the case anymore. For children old enough to use a computer, they'd @CAPS1 rather be inside on that nice day. There are many enjoyable things to do on a computer, like chatting with friends, checking your e - mails, and using facebook. Even though these things are pleasurable, you should limit your time on the computer. Most @ORGANIZATION1 of the time you spend on the computer could be spent outside or at the movies. Not being on the computer could also help small businesses. If you pay money to do an activity, buy something, or watch something, it would make a difference in the small business's profits. On the other hand, computers don't benefit your health. Mac. magazine says that there are health risks when you use your computer all the time. @PERCENT2 @ORGANIZATION1 of people become obese and have vitamin @CAPS1 deficiency from using their computers so much. When using your computer, you could be working out or exercising, and this leads to obesity. Also, if you're inside all the time, you won't get the healthy amount @ORGANIZATION1 of sunlight that you need, thus you have a vitamin @CAPS1 deficiency. Another health risk is having poor eyesight. If you spend hours a day on a computer, your eyes can get permanently damaged. Do you want your child/children to be put at risk for using a computer too much? In conclusion, it is evident that computers, despite their usefulness, do not benefit society as a whole. Their over - use leads to addiction, time mismanagement, and health problems. It's important to find a balance and reduce our dependence on computers for the well - being of individuals and small businesses.
1651	1655	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I think computers have a negative effect on people. Some adults and mostly kids are not getting enough exercise, or even spending time with family. Some parents are less active with their kids as they get caught up in their own computer - related tasks. Kids are failing to do their homework because they are always on the computer when they get home. Adults and kids are getting less exercise. Sitting down reading or whatever they do on the computer is not exercising. They are going to get fat because they eat and sit down, and then they get hungry again, eat, and sit down. Some people say that you're getting finger and arm exercise by moving the mouse, but that's not really true. Looking at the computer screen all day can cause massive hand strain. People are also not spending time with family. They are sitting in front of a computer and ignoring everyone and everything around them. Kids could be enjoying other things besides computers, like playing sports or riding bikes. Parents could be outside, playing catch with their kids or even playing a board game with them. People are becoming less active. They are not going out and having fun jumping around with their friends. Instead, they aim messages at them on computers or message them on Facebook or even MySpace. Kids are failing in school because they fail to do their homework after school. They would rather go on the computer. This is why I think computers have a negative effect on kids and adults, and we should encourage a more balanced lifestyle.
1652	1656	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 In my opinion, the computer is the better thing because you can do a lot of stuff like play games. My three reasons why you should have a computer are that you can talk online with your friends, do homework or projects, and find out @LOCATION1 things. Therefore, I think if you like doing that, then the computer is what you need. My first reason is talking online. People talk online so they can talk to their friends @PERSON1. If you talk online, you can figure out what the homework is, when the meeting is, or the time the party starts. You can also talk online with your friends or family who have moved or live far away around @LOCATION2. You can share photos and experiences easily through online chatting. My second reason is doing homework. Sometimes you need the computer to do your homework. You need the computer so you can print pictures for your report. You will also need to type your report on your vacation. The computer also helps you find the history or @CAPS2 book online so you can do your homework or project. You can access a vast library of resources with just a few clicks. My third reason is finding out @LOCATION1 things. You can find out how old is @CAPS3 @CAPS4 or how tall is @ORGANIZATION1. You can also figure out how to spell a big word. You can find out many hallways that can take you to @LOCATION1 or @CAPS5 beach or other places. Find out where the wall of @LOCATION3 is. In conclusion, if you like to learn @LOCATION1 things, talk online, and do other stuff, then you should get a computer as it offers a world of possibilities.
1653	1657	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 I believe it is true that many people use computers and that many more will use them in the future. Computers are a standard of the business world and are heavily depended on. People are even needing internet access on cellphones to stay up - to - date on stocks, shipments, and important emails. They can quickly check market trends and make informed decisions. Some computers are also just for at - home use and are used to contact family members and find information that you @MONTH1 need instantly or wouldn't be able to find anywhere. Computers are still developing and are becoming faster and better day after day and most likely will never be put out of use. But that does not mean they will permanently restrict you from other activities. It is true some people do spend too much time on the computer, but not everyone does. Some people work from home on the computer and cannot help being on it because it is their job. They need to meet deadlines and communicate with colleagues. I implore you to consider the reasons computers are used so much and to understand that computers are used to help, not hurt people. Computers are very helpful in simplifying things and are very useful for information. I stand strong with the use of computers and strongly disagree that they negatively affect the way of human life. Computers do the things people would normally not do. For example, someone would not go and look up everything he or she needs to know in a book because there are only certain facts they're looking for. It would also be easy to compare and contrast information on a computer rather than reading several different books. So if you truly think about it, computers save us a tremendous amount of time with the things we do. Once again, I say ""computers better our life, not hurt it."" and we should embrace their continued development."
1654	1658	1	3	"Dear Local Newspaper, I believe that computers have a negative affect on people today. I believe this because computers cause people to be less active. Most people would want to be at home on their computers than outside doing activities. They get so engrossed in online games or social media that they forget about the fresh air and physical exertion. I also believe computers restrict people who talk through it to show emotion. People should be out with each other when they talk, not talking through a machine. When you talk face - to - face, you can see facial expressions and body language. Finally, if people were not on the computer as much, they would bring down the obesity rate of the country if everyone just stopped using technology for a while and went outside. Every day, at least once or twice, or sometimes even more, people use the computer for hours on end. People today have so many options of things to do on the internet: @CAPS1, @CAPS2, ooVoo, and a lot more. @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people say they ""need"" to check these everyday, but they really don't. What they do ""need"" to do is to stop using computers as much and go outside! Furthermore, people all around the world communicate through the computer. ""I talk to my friends all the time through the computer,"" says @PERSON1, ""@CAPS3 the easiest way"". Now it @MONTH1 be the easiest way, but @CAPS3 is also the most boring. I mean, really, do you want to talk like a robot or with emotion like a person? Computers don't give you the chance to show emotion. This means people need to go out, hang out, and maybe even call each other to talk. At least you're getting up to get the phone. Finally, @CAPS4 is one of the most obese places in the whole world. People are sitting on the computer everyday, eating, and not moving at all and gaining weight. Do you really want to be known as the ""fat country""? I don't think so. People should restrict computer usage among themselves to an hour, or even less if you can. To restate, I believe that computers have a negative affect on today's people around the world. Computers cause people to be less active, have less emotion in a conversation, and cause people to be obese. So please help me fight to put more people outside and make people more active. It's a cause that can improve our health and well - being."
1655	1659	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I am here to talk about my view on computers, about how they help people, and how many people say that kids and adults are spending too much time on them. My first views on this subject are that computers are becoming more and more advanced as time goes on. These past few years, computer companies have been making enormous strides allowing people to do almost everything. This is both good and bad. A computer is a tool that is a good feature for any home. It is great for people who own a small business. You can easily go online and update something you want changed in your store, such as designing colorful posters to put on the windows of your store to increase business and to catch people's eye. You can also add special offers and event details on these posters. You are also able to book flights weeks or even months before you even go to the airport. This is good for those who are busy and travel a lot. You can go on a website called @ORGANIZATION2 where you can go anywhere in the world and zoom in on a landmark such as the Great @CAPS1 in @LOCATION2, or the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 in @LOCATION1. You can get a virtual tour experience. Computers can also improve your hand - eye coordination when you type. Typing is an important skill to master. If you are a good typer, you can do things much more efficiently than you would on paper. Some can even memorize the keyboard and not have to even look down. Computers are also great for communication. If you have relatives far away in another state or even country, you can easily talk to them through @CAPS4. @CAPS4 is an online service that you use to talk to them in person, and you can share real - time experiences. These are just some of the things you can do with a computer. On the other hand, many say that people are spending too much time on computers and not getting outside for exercise and not spending enough time with family. I do agree this is the case in some ways. I know some friends who average about six hours a day on computers, which to me is too much. Also, parents become too busy with work on computers when they should be spending time with their kids. Some kids become so addicted to computers that they might become unhealthy and become obese from sitting so much. This is something that should not happen. I hope you have learned a little bit about the good and the bad about computers, and how it is important not to be on the computer too much, but it can be an important feature if used correctly, and we should strive for a healthy balance.
1656	1660	1	3	Hello everyone, I have heard how many people are basically saying that computers are bad. They claim that people are spending too much time on computers and not enough time outside and being with family. But I'm writing you today to tell you about how great computers really are. First off, computers contribute significantly to technology. People can now perform tasks that were previously unimaginable. For example, chatting to people across the sea without having to pay for expensive long - distance calls or even be physically present. You can also look up ways to burn fat fast and various diet programs. Moreover, uploading photos to share with other family and friends has become incredibly easy. And there are so many other useful functions! Computers have helped so many people achieve so many things! Mostly good things, by the way. Secondly, computers have enabled us to accomplish feats that would otherwise have been impossible. Like going to the moon! Having cellphones! And some diseases were helped cured by using computers. Although computers can be a bit dangerous to some people who probably don't know how to use them correctly, in a few more years, all such issues can be resolved! We are advancing in so many ways, it's kinda crazy! I could go on and on about the numerous things that computers do for us, but there are not enough pages. Lastly, it is much easier and quicker to do research with computers. For instance, in my school, we use our computers for learning purposes, and they assist us greatly. I've personally learned a lot from computers. I even use them to get better at math for the upcoming exams! We need them! (I do at least) I'm even starting to learn another language, Spanish, with them. It's not to assume that everyone who uses them is fat, lazy, and doesn't spend enough time with family and/or friends. Furthermore, please stop all of this nonsense. I really don't think that spending too much time on computers is the thing that you should be worrying about right now. That is all I have to say. Bye.
1657	1661	1	3	I remember when computers weren't so popular. Back then, I had to painstakingly write my essays by hand and listen to music on the radio. Now, computers are extremely popular. I believe that computers have a positive effect on people in 2024 because students need them for school, you can use them for other things, and lastly, it is easy to access them. You will soon realize that computers are beneficial for our society! Most students use computers to type college essays, projects, etc. This is great because it's much more convenient. For example, I'm a student who can't draw, so I printed some pictures from the computer so I can paste them on my post - board. In other words, the computer is highly useful for students. I know 9 out of 10 colleges expect students to turn in their assignments through the computers; otherwise, it's a zero. In this society, there's no room for zeros because when you're in college, you're still paying for the class even if you're failing. So, basically, it's a waste of money. Thus, the computer can save us from failing! People these days use computers for pleasure. Usually, they message people on MySpace, Facebook, Twitter, and other social networks. It's quite interesting because you can reconnect with friends that you haven't seen in years. As you can see, the internet has its advantages because you would never have thought about what your friend is doing. Another great thing about computers is that you can find stuff cheaper than in everyday life. Say if you want to take a trip and you call a travel agency for your ticket. The ticket might cost a high amount. But if you go on the computer and visit the travel agency's website, you can find your ticket to Florida at a price that will most likely be a couple of hundred dollars less. Since we are in a recession, we will need those couple of hundred dollars for savings. Computers are everywhere. You can find one at school, home, a café, or even on your cell phone. This is good because you can use them at your own convenience. At home, if my laptop is free, I can go on it and play games for hours. Also, I remember when my computer broke and I really wanted to go on the computer. Then I realized that I could go on the computer at the library. I was so happy because it was free for me. To sum up, computers have a positive effect on people. I seriously don't know what I'd do if I didn't have one because students need them, you can do other things on it, and lastly, it's easy to access one! In this fast - paced generation, computers are truly indispensable.
1658	1662	1	3	"Dear local newspaper, Computers are affecting more and more people in the society rather than helping them. A boy named, Tom started to have many health problems after he had bought a computer. The computer that he thought would help him was of no use at all. His health issues started to worsen. He soon started to be out of breath more often, always had a high blood pressure, and he started to become overweight. Since he got this computer, he didn't exercise or spend time with his family and friends as much as he was on the internet. In my opinion, computers only waste time, cause you to lose your education, and can make you unhealthy. As you already know, computers can do a lot to assist you, but there are some things that you may not know about them. According to a well - known health magazine, tests show that using a computer for two or three hours can make you lose 20% of your brain cells. That's a significant number of brain cells to lose when you're going to need them for your education. And there is no way to get those back, either. After walking around the streets to listen to what people think about how computers can affect people, John, a policeman at the police department, had this to say, ""I love using the computer and going on the internet, but most of the time I start using the computer at 8 p.m. and find myself getting off at 2 a.m. The internet can be very unsafe and unhealthy. Computers can help you find what you're looking for or show things that you have never seen before, but it is all a waste of time. Instead of going on the computer to go on Facebook, YouTube, or MySpace, you should go outside and interact with your family and friends."" After interviewing Lisa, the best female rapper so far, she had this to say, ""Computers are okay but they are sometimes just a waste of time. Instead of being on the internet doing something pointless like playing a game, you could be studying for an upcoming test or doing your homework so that you wouldn't be doing it at the last minute."" In conclusion, we should be more cautious about our computer usage to avoid these negative impacts."
1659	1663	1	3	"Dear Newspaper, Do you agree that people could use computers all the time and never get off? Well, I don't. Think about all the negative things that could occur. Such as spending less time with your family, getting addicted, and becoming unhealthy. People who spend all their time on the computer often forget that their family is there. For instance, I remember when I was little and I was engrossed in the computer. I completely forgot that I had family members with me, so I missed out on all the fun activities like going to the mall or the park. Certainly, playing on the computer is enjoyable, but wouldn't you want to give some attention to your family? Almost 80% of people in other countries become very lonely because all they do is play on the computer and forget about other people. You wouldn't want to be like these people, right? I never thought that playing on computers could be addictive. Lots of people in other countries can't last a day without playing on computers. Some say that almost all the people who play on computers all day, from day to night, have died because they barely eat, sleep, or use the bathroom. Imagine your life ending because of an addiction to computers. I remember when my friend told me, ""Don't be on the computer too long; you might die,"" and I thought it was a joke. So, think about going on the computer all day and night. Last but not least, some people aren't taking proper care of their bodies. For example, some people playing on computers forget about eating, sleeping, or walking around. This often makes people's legs numb and their stomachs hurt a lot. Imagine not eating, sleeping, and walking around for a day. You wouldn't even want to experience that. Now is the time to decide whether people should be able to play on the computer day to night. Considering all the negative things that can happen, like spending less time with family members, getting addicted, and being unhealthy, it's time to make a change. So, get up right now and make a wise decision."
1660	1664	1	3	"Dear Local Newspaper, I have been using my computer for a long time now. I didn't have one during my childhood, but I got one last year. There have been people saying that the computer is great as it helps you stay in contact with friends and family, it helps you learn about everything, and you can look up the news. I completely agree with this. But some people don't like the computer because they spend more time on it than going outside. Here are my thoughts on the computer. First of all, the computer is an excellent way to look up the news. You can find more news and get weather updates faster than you can on the television. If you want to find the news, just go to a website that you think has reliable news. You can quickly find out what the weather is like today, what events happen throughout the day that might be shocking to everyone, and learn about celebrities. All this with just a push of a button and a click of the mouse. Secondly, the computer is like a personal tutor. Whether you're having trouble with your homework or you just want to know a simple fact, the computer is there for you. Just search for something you want to know on a search engine, and you will get your answer. This may not seem that crucial, but it is when you're eager to learn. Lastly, the computer is the most popular way of communicating around the globe. Whether it's Facebook, MySpace, AIM, you can talk to your distant or close family and friends. You might think, ""Oh, that's what a phone is for?"" Well, all of these websites are free. Yes, I said it - free. There is also Skype. Skype allows you to actually see the person you are talking to. Yes, it's the wonderful world of technology. So now you know that a computer can teach you things, it can find you news, and it can help you communicate across the globe. Now you're thinking, ""People spend too much time on the computers, right?"" This is where self - control comes in. Get off of it. It's your decision to stay on it, not the computer's. Limit your time to half an hour a day. Go outside, enjoy nature. Maybe do a little exercise. By finding a balance, you can fully enjoy the benefits of the computer without being overly dependent on it."
1661	1665	1	3	Dear @LOCATION1 press, I have recently heard about many arguments based on computers ruining society. I firmly believe these arguments are unfounded. I think the computer is an excellent and convenient way to hook up with old friends. The internet is also significantly faster for research than laboriously looking in a book, and there are a plethora of engaging games on the internet. I believe that the internet is a great way to hook up with old friends. Some people have moved far away, and I haven't been able to talk to them for a long time. Now, with the internet, I am able to talk to them again, just like catching up as if they were right next to me. The same case with my mom. She had friends from high school and college who she rarely ever talked to. Now, with Facebook, she has happily reunited with them. This also helps because you can email someone instead of sending a letter in the mail, which costs money for stamps and envelopes, unlike email. So the internet can also be a practical way of saving money. It is also much faster to send someone an email than a letter, allowing for quick and efficient communication. The internet is truly a great way to keep in touch with friends and relatives. I also believe that the use of a computer is more efficient than going to a library and researching a book. If you don't have enough time to go to the library, you can easily do some research at your house, in the comfort of your own space. What if the library is closed when you do go? Then you've wasted some precious time. The internet never closes; it is open 24/7. What if you go to the library and they are open, but they do not have a book on your subject? This problem can be easily solved on the internet because there is anything you could ever ask for on the internet. If you have an overdue library book, you can conveniently renew the book on the internet. The internet is a great place to research on any topic you have or do whatever you want. Finally, the computer is great for playing almost every game that you would feel like playing. Instead of spending about $500 on an X - box and a game, you only have to spend about $50 on a game that goes into your computer. There are also many websites that have games on them. Some websites are dedicated to specific games, and some have a wide variety of games on them. Only a few of the games are interactive with other players, and you can talk and make new friends while playing. On the other hand, many games are only for one player. As a result, a computer is a great tool to play games. In conclusion, I believe the computer is a great necessity for our society. In the long run, it will pay off, especially with the economic problems our country is having now, by helping us save money. It will also allow us to connect with old friends, save time, and provide entertainment to all who would like to enjoy it.
1662	1666	1	3	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, Which article title is more interesting, ""Local athlete wins three - mile race"" or ""Local athlete wins three - mile race on computer game""? Unfortunately, the less interesting title is what your news will change to if people keep using computers. Some effects computers have on people include cheating, less time with family and friends, and lastly, most people aren't learning anything while on the computer; they're just playing games. As you can see, I agree that computers are a bad idea. I bet some people have never thought of this, but computers can lead kids, and maybe even adults, to cheating. There are websites on the internet where the user just types the question in, and they get an answer instantly. There is also another way of cheating, copying others' work, essays, or articles from a website. Some students could be told to write a biography on a person, and they could just copy an article, switch some words around to make it sound like their own paper, and do so with no guilt. Another issue is that people spend less time with family and friends because of computers. I was watching a television show where the husband was always on the computer, playing games and ignoring his family. The wife was very frustrated because he spent so much time on the computer, helping virtual characters instead of being with his real - life family. Because of this show, I realized that computers can make people anti - social, and the divorce rate between parents might go up. Do you think all people using computers to look up facts about things are actually learning? I know that when I have time to go on the computer, I am not looking up things to learn. Most people these days don't care too much about learning about countries other than their own, or people other than those they know. I think it's pretty obvious that no one is going on computers to learn, otherwise, they wouldn't have so many users on game websites. In conclusion, computers have negative effects that affect all people. So, @ORGANIZATION1, do you want to have your news be about the latest divorces and computer game high scores? Or do you want interesting news that will keep your newspaper going? Thanks for taking the time to read this."
1663	1667	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 of @ORGANIZATION1; Technology seems to have a positive effect on people. But could it be a bad thing? The computer is one of the top devices used by people, but I think we spend a little too much time on it. My reasons are as follows. Firstly, kids and adults spend too much time on it, which is harmful to their health. When you're on the computer for 8 hours, you're sitting in one place, not moving much. You sit and eat junk food like chips and candy. Instead of getting a healthy meal, you're filling your body with empty calories. You can't get a healthy meal if you're constantly munching on junk while typing and clicking away at your keyboard. Instead of being blinded by the computer screen, you can get blinded by the sun while riding a bike. It's a great way to get fit, rather than just sitting and using your fingers to type. Another way of getting fit, rather than sitting, is going out for a run. Kids need about 60 mins of cardio, so why not run your legs instead of just running your newest download? You work out your arms and your legs when you run! My next reason why spending too much time on the computer is bad is because you won't have time for your friends or family. Are kids just going to sit at the computer all day while their family is having fun? Also, when you have chores to do, what will happen to them? The dishes will be dirty and your room will be a mess. Most of all, won't you miss your friends? At this age, kids/teens should be partying with friends and not gossiping online. No one would ever want to invite you anywhere because they will know you will be on the computer. Lastly, my final reason is the simplest; enjoy nature and explore the outside instead of living on the inside. It's good to go out once in a while and get a breath of fresh air. If you haven't visited the park in a while, it would be great. Hear all the birds chirping and see the trees and flowers bloom! Then take a nice walk or stroll in the park. You're getting exercise and exploring nature too. While you're at it, plant some flowers in your garden. This shows that instead of buying games online, you're buying seeds to help the environment. In conclusion, spending time on the computer is not bad, just don't spend hours - upon - hours on it. Kids will be kids, as well, adults will be adults. So take these considerations to heart. Try to get exercise, hang out with your friends and family, and enjoy nature!
1664	1668	1	3	Dear Newspaper Editor, It has come to my attention that the aspect of computers and their influence on people has been brought up. I personally feel that computers are a marvelous tool to help mankind advance. They provide infinite knowledge, entertainment, and despite what the opposing side says, allow social interactions for those who don't like to meet face - to - face. My first reason why computers benefit humans rather than hurt them is the knowledge they provide. Computers give access to the internet, which has a near - infinite amount of knowledge stored inside it. With a simple click of a button, you have thousands of websites dedicated to answering your question. They can provide tons of information normally unobtainable. Take for example two students, one with a computer and one without. Both are given an assignment to write a report on a famous person. The one with the computer logs on, searches for the person, and in seconds has enough information to write numerous reports. He aces the report, and continues to use this method. He graduates top of the class, goes through college and gets a high - paying job right out of the gate. The one without the computer needs to go to the library. After spending an hour walking there, he learns that all the books on that person are checked out. He finds a book with a short bit on that person and writes about it. He fails the test, fails the grade, drops out of school, and works at a fast - food joint his entire life. See how much of a difference a computer can make? My second reason is that, even though computers are often thought of as destroying social lives, they can actually build social lives. Millions of people use the internet every day, and there are places on the web built so that they can talk. Some people worry that this is dangerous and leads to privacy issues, but anyone who has basic knowledge knows not to share personal information. The internet also has social media platforms, and those still unsure can use specially designed sites to talk to people they know in real life only. The internet also allows for people to ask questions. Having difficulty finding specific information? Just post a question on a public site, and people with first - hand experience will answer it with all the detail you need and more. Say that somebody wants to be a writer, but needs to know how the writing system works, how to set up a job in writing, what the pay is, etc. He searches the internet, but only finds job applications and college ads, so he asks the questions on a public site. Someone who has been a writer their whole life checks out the question and answers it in great detail. Problem solved, and he has connected with someone on the internet. My final reason is the entertainment computers provide. You can play games, watch movies or homemade videos, and even talk to friends. Computers allow you to access thousands of free services to benefit you. Sitting in your room, bored? Why not play a game on your computer. Tired of watching the same old movies? Go to the computer and have an infinite video library at your disposal. Lonely? Go to a social website and strike up a conversation. The internet has infinite entertainment, right at your finger - tips. In conclusion, I believe that there is no limit to what you can do with a computer, as long as you have the imagination. Computers were invented to benefit mankind, not to hurt it, and they are doing a great job.

1666	1670	1	3	Do you like learning about far - away exotic lands and the diverse animals that inhabit them? Are you good at sports but would like to enhance your skills even more? Do you ever long for your family members who live in other states? The computer can assist you with all of these aspects, but is it bad for you too? In my opinion, kids and adults should use the computer. When people are on the computer, they can explore and learn about interesting far - away lands. When you're on the computer, you can look up some of the natural disasters. For example, people could google earthquakes and learn all about the people who have lost their lives. Then, they might donate some money to the poor, especially children living on their own. They can also learn about all the wonderful, beautiful lands that are out there waiting to be explored. Everyone I know likes to see the beautiful birds and animals in the world. They will be able to do this on the computer. There might be even more of these lands to discover. Having a computer will also let you talk to people who are not easily reachable. With a computer, people will be able to talk to their family that lives in other states. I have an uncle that lives in @LOCATION1. I only get to see him because it costs a lot of money for him to come. Somewhere on the computer, it is easy to just send him a message that says how I'm doing. With a computer, you will be able to talk to your friends when you can't talk on the phone. For example, what if your friend can't talk on the phone? What do you do? The computer can help you communicate with her. The last reason why we should have a computer is that if you use it for @MONTH1 periods of time, it will help you with hand - eye coordination. This will help the kids that play baseball. They will know where the ball is at all times, and they will most likely catch the ball more often. So, playing a little bit of video games is not bad for you unless you overdo it. Using the computer is indeed a good thing, and not using the computer prevents people from interacting with those who are not easy to talk to in person. So, if you are completely against using the computer, get up and use it right now. Computers offer so many benefits that can enrich our lives in various ways.
1667	1671	1	3	"As more and more technology is being invented, people rely on the computer to do work and to learn. But spending more time on the computer is not necessarily a good thing. People do not exercise enough, strain their eyes, and have less interaction with real people. One reason computers are having a negative affect on people is because they no longer get enough exercise. Take my friend @CAPS1 for example. He was a dedicated triathlete, who trained every single day so he could participate in the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 - @CAPS4 man in @LOCATION1 next @DATE1. But then he got his computer. @CAPS1 had suddenly lost all interest in exercise and spent his whole day checking his e - mail instead of training. But he is not the only person who has become unhealthy because of computers. Experts say that people with computers at home get only @PERCENT1 of the exercise that people without computers get. People with computers also were more likely to be overweight and choose chips over an apple in a study performed at @ORGANIZATION1. @PERSON1, who headed this study said, ""People are taught by society that computers can do such wonderful things and educate them. However, they are not taught how bad they can be for your health when used too much."" Clearly, computers are a problem to our health. Another reason computers are a problem is because they strain your eyes. When my school had disabled people come and talk to us @DATE1, there was a blind lady named @PERSON5, who lost her sight because she was a workaholic and spent too much time on her laptop. But she is not the only one to lose her vision because of computers. Scientists at the @CAPS7 lab in @LOCATION2 said that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 regular computer users lost their vision within two years. One of these scientists, @PERSON3, reported, ""As more people begin to use the computer, more people seriously hurt their eyes or even lose their vision. We estimate @PERCENT2 of this next generation will be legally blind before age @NUM3."" Undoubtedly, this new technology is harmful and very damaging to our vision. A third reason people should not use computers is because they stop interacting with real people. My uncle, @PERSON4, lives in @LOCATION3. We used to see each other from time to time and talk on the phone about once a week. That is, until he found out about the chat rooms and virtual worlds on the internet. Now, I haven't seen or talked to him in almost a @DATE1 because he has created a new family on the computer and spends the whole day pretending he is a @CAPS10 and fighting dragons on the internet game @CAPS10 @CAPS11. But he is not the only person with this issue. It is proven that @PERCENT3 of people who go into games like these or chatrooms lose interest in friends and family and their social skills worsen. Professor @PERSON2 had this to say about how this is affecting people. ""Too many people are finding out about these sites and getting hooked. They stop caring about school, sports, even their friends. It's alarming!"" Given all these reasons, why would you want to use a computer after learning how bad it is for you and your loved ones! Computers will bring nothing but grief to humanity. They are extremely dangerous for our health. They cause us to stop exercising and gain weight, permanently damage our eyes, and deny us of the proper socialization that all people need to be happy and healthy. We should be more cautious about our computer usage to avoid these negative consequences."
1668	1672	1	3	Computers are very popular these days. Many people use computers for research, jobs, shopping, homework, and more. Although, some people think computers take up too much of our time and that it prevents society from interacting with friends and family. What's great about computers is that you can chat with your friends and family online or even have a video chat with them. So, you're never really avoiding your friends and family. Another thing that is great about computers is that you can research anything you need to, for projects, jobs, homework, and things for school, etc. The top websites people use for resources are @CAPS1.com, @LOCATION1, etc. These websites offer a vast amount of information that can be accessed quickly. Computers are also great for typing out reports, making power - points for jobs and projects, and so much more! Anything you could think of is most likely found in a computer. As you can see, a computer is so helpful and is a great resource. Having a computer at home is much better than taking a trip down to the public library. You can save time and money from taking all those trips and get your own personal library by getting a computer. You never know what new technology could bring, and computers are constantly evolving to offer even more benefits. In conclusion, computers are an essential part of modern life, and their advantages far outweigh the minor concerns some people may have.
1669	1673	1	3	Everyone will agree that using computers is also a good choice because you do get to meet people you don't know. Also, you learn more stuff you don't know. Not only that, but you can also learn more about technology. Most people would say that meeting people is good because you can have fun talking and getting to know people. Also, people would want to learn about other people's cultures. Some people would want to know some personal or business - related things about people. Even people want to know where some people are from. People like to know about the different backgrounds and stories of others. Through computers, you can connect with people from all over the world, which broadens your perspective and enriches your knowledge. In addition, learning about technology can open up new opportunities and keep you updated with the latest trends. So, using computers is a great way to expand your horizons and have meaningful interactions.
1670	1674	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1's at the @ORGANIZATION1, as @CAPS2 said to @PERSON2, ""Computers have helped me further my research. I can search up so many things to help a patient and keep all my important information organized."" Can you question a leading doctor? I agree with @PERSON3 and say that computers are of great use in society today. People were already becoming lazy because of television. You can't blame it on computers. With websites such as @CAPS4 and @CAPS5, people can keep in touch. They can make plans with one another to go for a walk in the park or dancing. These things can keep people healthy, active, and in tiptop shape. Computers help people keep in contact with others. ""@My patients can email me to schedule an appointment and let me know if they think something's very wrong with them,"" says @PERSON1. With computers, you can email distant family and friends to learn if there are problems quicker. Most people tend not to pick up the phone if someone calls during a crisis. You also don't have to worry about running up your phone bill. You can just @CAPS4 chat with a bud instead of using up an hour's worth of minutes. You can learn so much more information faster. How would you feel if no one called and told you your best friend died or your mom, and you had to find out by reading the newspaper? You'd be extremely upset. I know I would. With email, you and your family can stay in touch with old, new, and now friends. So if anything bad happens and a person didn't know how to tell you, they could email you. It's so much easier than telling a person that their mom died by phone. To hear pain in a person's voice will make you want to cry. You feel their pain. So, now do you understand that computers are a great benefit to today's society? You can't blame computers for people becoming lazy, since television was already doing that. If a person wants to be lazy, then that's their decision. You shouldn't go around blaming others and things when it's no one else's fault but that person's. This is a great way to keep in contact with others. Plus, think of all the information you can learn. Not just about family and friends, but the world too. Thank you for taking the time to read my essay, and I hope you can see things my way. In today's fast - paced world, computers are indispensable tools that enhance our lives in numerous ways."
1671	1675	1	3	"One evening, after I got home from school, I was completely at a loss as I didn't know what I had for homework. I decided to call my friend's cell phone. However, instead of reaching her, I got her voicemail. I patiently left her a voicemail and then called her house phone instead, but unfortunately, the same thing happened. Luckily, I had my other friends' numbers I could use. The next day, I asked her why she didn't pick up her cell and house phone. She told me ""I'm sorry, I guess I was too busy on the computer e-mailing other people."" Whenever I think of people being on the computer too much, I believe they don't get enough exercise, don't enjoy nature, and spend less time with family and friends. First, when people spend too much time on the computer, they naturally spend less time exercising. About a certain percentage of people do this and it's clearly not healthy. If people do this too often, then they will not get enough exercise and without exercise, they won't be healthy as they get older. As @PERSON1 said ""If adults spend too much time on the computer, maybe several hours a day or more while eating junk food like chips and soda, they are not setting a good example for their kids. If adults get into this bad habit, so will their kids and it's too early for kids to be unhealthy."" I also whole - heartedly agree with @PERSON1; she is right about how people spend too much time on the computer. Second, when people are on their computer, it's as if their face is firmly glued to the screen and they don't care about nature at all. When people do this, I really can't stand it. It's like they don't care about anything else. What I don't get is why can't they go outside and do something for at least a half - hour, then go back to the computer and waste their time then? Going outside and enjoying nature is so peaceful on a nice sunny day. You could have a picnic, take a hike, or even hang out with friends instead of playing on the computer. I understand that if it's a bad day like when it's snowing or there's a thunderstorm and you can't do anything outside, then it's okay to go on the computer. I think that at least a certain percentage of people would try this. Third, if people are too busy on the computer then they won't be able to hang out with friends or family. If your friends want to hang out with you and they want to go to the mall. But you can't because you're on the computer, she would be really furious at you. You picked the computer over your friends to go to the mall. There's probably a certain chance she won't ever talk to you again. And I don't blame her. People who spend too much time on the computer would barely understand what's going on. If someone tells you something, it goes in one ear and out the other. When people do this, it's really disappointing because you don't hang out as much with your friends and family. As you can see, people are spending too much time on the computer rather than exercising, enjoying nature, and spending time with family and friends. If you ask me, I don't play on the computer as much which is definitely a good thing."
1672	1676	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, I'm really glad to see that you have a debate on whether computers are good or bad for human society. Well, I would like to state my opinion if that's okay with you. In my letter, I'm going to tell the bad stuff about computers and why they're not good for society. Well, I don't think computers are good for society because you don't work out as much as you used to. I can say that as a fact because I used to work out regularly. Then computer games came out and I spent several hours a day playing it. I had no time to spend with my family, and I had no outside communication. It was like it took over my life. Plus, I know a lot of people who feel the same way. The computer is like an addiction. I say this because once you hit the power button, you can't get off easily. All the communication websites are hard to get off because they're starting to put games on so you won't log off as fast. They have different websites that play videos of things that are funny. Like once you find it, you click and a lot of things pop up, so when you look, you're on something else. Don't get me wrong, you can see and talk to family members you don't see often, but you don't have time to go to the park and have fun and enjoy nature. It's like you're in a daze. I don't think we should get rid of computers, but we should spend less time on them than we do now. I know people are going to be upset by what I say, but we as a society are addicted to the computer. Everywhere you look, there's a computer. I'm going to leave on one note: would you pick computers or life? In conclusion, we need to find a balance and reduce our computer - time to lead a healthier and more fulfilling life.
1673	1677	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, The use of advanced computers has significantly increased. You don't see kids outside as often as you used to. On the news, you frequently hear about obesity. And you also hear that the crime rates are going up. This clearly does not benefit the society. Computers have a negative effect on people. Does your neighborhood seem to be ""locking"" children indoors? It's not because they're dead! They are now always inside on their computers. I know a thirteen - year - old named @ORGANIZATION1. She even admits that being on a computer is better than being outside with friends. Meeting people over technology, especially for minors, is a huge risk. You don't really know the person. Soon, you would have no friends when it comes to being in the social life. You'd be the outsider. For @PERSON3, her family doesn't even know who she is anymore. Do you want your child to be the outsider? Being on a computer all the time is like being at a fast - food restaurant. You don't exercise; all you do is eat and talk, but now all you do is eat and be on the computer. I have met an obese child, @PERSON2. He weighs three - hundred pounds at the age of fourteen. An eight - grader, can you believe that? He tells me he has his laptop on his lap, surrounded by junk food. He never exercises or takes a break. His report card is truly unbelievable. He used to be an A - student. Now he's in a really bad situation. @PERSON2 does not listen to his mom at all. @PERSON1, @ORGANIZATION2's mom says ""he locks himself in his room, goes straight to his laptop, and starts eating. You can even hear him munching the junk food."" And we wonder why our kids are getting obese these days. It used to be about jobs, but now it's about who you meet on a computer. Myspace, Facebook, Twitter, you name it, is how the crime rates are increasing now. The people behind these pictures and profiles may not be who you think they are. Especially, minors who lie about their age. They're the ones who fall for those perverted old men. That is one way our sex offenders get around. They can use someone's name and be under - or over - age. They tell these young girls to meet them places and that's how our young girls, and boys, get kidnapped, raped, and end up killed. A computer holds millions of ways criminals can commit a crime. Do you want your child to be next? Computers these days are used in the wrong ways, by the wrong people. Kids are never outside again. They are getting obese. And it's a way they get kidnapped. Don't allow this. Get your child(ren) away from their laptops now! Go on a family vacation, somewhere fun. And don't let these sick - minded people get to you or your kids. Take action now before it's too late."
1674	1678	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2: The effects computers have on people are bad because they are getting too addicted, the computer is a dangerous site to go on, and their brain is smarter than the @CAPS5, @ORGANIZATION1. They are getting too addicting because computers do have a benefit of you being able to surf the internet, but you'll get hooked on it too much. For example, YouTube is an internet site that about a large number of people go on and barely get off. The people don't turn off their computers to just go get some exercise but just sit there staring at the @CAPS5 and messing up their eyesight. These people need to learn to have the will - power to get off the @CAPS5. Second, the @CAPS5 is a dangerous site to go on because some people in the @LOCATION1 give somebody their @CAPS3 on the @CAPS5 to somebody they don't know about. Almost a significant percentage of teens get kidnapped because of giving their @CAPS3 away to strangers and a certain percentage of those teens don't get found. The @CAPS5 is also a place where a child or teen may get cyber - bullied. Cyberbullying is harassing children or teens on the internet. When children under or over a certain age get cyber - bullied, they sometimes suffer through a depression and don't tell their parents about it. Six months ago at my old @CAPS4, there was a volunteer at my @CAPS4 talking about cyberbullying and how he got so depressed because of the harassment, that he committed suicide. The @CAPS5 is not always a safe place to be on. Finally, your brain is more smarter than the @CAPS5. People can have the ability to depend more on their brains than on their computers because your brains are like computers. About a certain percentage of people use their brain more often than computers and they have been successful through life. The brain is like a @CAPS5 because you can store information and nobody can hack into it. So, in conclusion, computers have bad effects on people because they are getting too addicting, the @CAPS5 is a dangerous site to go on, and your brain is smarter than the @CAPS5. We should be more cautious about our computer use.
1675	1679	1	3	Dear society, Don't you all have some kind of computer at home or at work? What if we took your computer away? How would you work? These are all essential questions. The computers of our time greatly help us with what we do every day. First of all, they teach hand - eye coordination. Secondly, they give us the ability to learn and communicate with far - away places. Lastly, they allow people to communicate quickly by an email or an @CAPS2. If those experts took our computers, think about what would happen. A large percentage of Americans have a computer or a cellphone with internet. These people have hand - eye coordination, therefore they use technology a lot. People who use computers at work can multi - task effectively. Secondly, the modern computer is a huge necessity. Thirdly, the people who are still in school have to write papers, do reports, but without computers. How will they accomplish that? Think about what society would be like. Picture it. Facebook, @CAPS3, @CAPS4. These are all websites that have chats where people can communicate. Take it away. See what happens. We only have the telephone. What if we don't know someone's cellphone number? And we can't go on a computer that isn't there. Take all of that into consideration. Maybe the computer prevents us from face - to - face communication, but it's a common necessity. We need to be able to ask someone a quick question. Cellphones and calling aren't as quick as on @CAPS2. Do you really want to be the one to take it away? Think, think about what you're going to do. Take this letter into consideration. What are you going to do? These computers help with everyday life. From school to work to just having fun. Computers help teach hand - eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about people and far - away places. Thirdly, they allow people to communicate. So, go ahead, take it away, but see what kind of chaos it will bring to our daily lives. In conclusion, computers are an indispensable part of our modern society and we should make good use of them.
1676	1680	1	3	I think that we are all spending too much time on computers because all of my friends are on them all day. I think that people should get active and go to different places in the world, like the pool, the forest, the lakes, etc. I think that they should put a program in place so that people can go to places and forget about computers. For me, computers are good, but you cannot spend a lot of time on them. Try to spend more time outdoors and with your family or friends. And the problem is not only with computers; it's with a lot of technology, like video games, such as Xbox - @NUM1 - @NUM2 - Game Boy - Xbox @NUM3 and many others. You should play them @NUM4 a week, like @NUM5 hour, because there are a lot of activities you and your family can do outdoors. I will take a walk around the park or ride bikes with your friends around town and have a picnic in the park when it's hot and nice outside. Now that the @DATE1 is coming, you can go and do a lot of stuff. Even if you don't have money, you can go to the park or beach and spend the whole day there. What my family does when it's nice outside is that we check the weather and see if it's good outside. If it is, we'll get up early and go to the store and buy hamburgers, soda, plates, and other stuff we're going to use. Then we'll go to a lake or pool and spend the day playing and eating. My opinion is that people should spend more time outdoors with their friends and family. I want people to know that there is a world outside and not to get too addicted to the tech world. That's my opinion. I don't know if you like it, but I think you should try it. And if you don't like it, get into an activity that will help you. I'm writing this because I want people to know that there are a lot of places that are yet to be discovered, so go out there and enjoy life because life only comes once, so enjoy it with happy times and good times. Don't spend it crying and sad. Live like this is your last day on this world.
1677	1681	1	3	Dear, @CAPS1 town. As you know, computers are a part of our lives, but is it a positive or negative influence? Computers can be a great thing. They can show you different parts of the world and breaking news. They can even help you decide on your next vacation. They could also help you talk to family and friends. What would our lives be like without them? Well, our lives without computers could be challenging. However, computers do have negative sides as well. For instance, you have to spend a lot of money on one, and they often need to be fixed. People can use the computer too much and not get enough exercise, which can lead to obesity. Also, you can waste a lot of energy. A bad part about the internet is chat rooms. If you talk to the wrong people, then you can be in trouble. Overall, computers are a key part of our lives. They can help us decide on our next @DATE1 break trip, but they can also contribute to making us fat. We need to be aware of both the positive and negative aspects of computers and use them in a balanced way.
1678	1682	1	3	"Many people think computers are bad or that we spend less time outside because of them. But are they as bad for individuals to use as people say they are? In this instance, moderation would be helpful. When you think of computers, what comes to mind? Games? Social @CAPS1? What if computers are doing more than that? Last year, a computer helped diagnose a concussion of mine and helped figure out I've had @NUM1 others. Not to mention, the computer did it quicker and more efficiently than a regular human. An expert says ""Computers diagnose anything, not just concussions, @PERCENT1 better than doctors."" Moreover, the social networking has a positive aspect. This has let people, who haven't seen each other for a long time, reconnect and become good friends again. With the positive aspects, there is always a negative. Computers have started to make kids obese. This is a problem in the country because if we become lazy, then we could ruin our country. In addition, if we become too reliant on computers for diagnoses, what happens when they get faulty? These are problems that are very real and aren't being addressed. If we can't deal with these problems first, then computers will turn out to be a bad thing. Lastly, moderation could be extremely helpful for us today. For example, instead of using social @CAPS1 to communicate with friends next door, go outside and play wiffle ball with them. Social @CAPS1 was made to reconnect with friends far away, not across the street. Similarly, instead of totally relying on computers to diagnose problems, have them work together with the doctor to find out. Doing this will get great results and keep doctors prepared if computers don't work. These are just a few examples of how moderation could be very helpful to everyone. In conclusion, having no computers wouldn't be a great idea because of how much they help society. Although, being totally dependent on them is also a bad idea because they don't have that much benefit when over - used. We should strive for a balanced approach to computer use."
1679	1683	1	3	"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1... scroll... @CAPS1. ""@CAPS2 you know that only the male coqui is the only coqui that sings?"" Some facts are easily found on the internet. The computers make researching easier. Just imagine not having to drag home those gigantic books home or having to constantly search for information in them. First, the computer teaches us hand - eye coordination. Second, we can learn about faraway places. Finally, we can make friends from all over the world. When the ball goes right out of the park! the plastic object with a screen (computers) teaches us hand - eye coordination. It teaches us this by making our eyes stay on the screen, while our hands are on the hard, smooth keyboard. Children need hand - eye coordination for ball - playing sports like baseball, basketball, soccer and more. When you're in high school and play sports well, you might get scholarships to go to college. College is important because it has a big role in our life, so we can earn great jobs. Learning about faraway places like @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2 and so on is very interesting. Unless, you're learning about it through books, which can be dull and boring. The internet has taken over our lives, and it does so relentlessly and without hesitation. The internet takes less time than going to the library and coming back. Also, skimming through paragraph after paragraph on the computer is much simpler. In conclusion, computers offer numerous benefits in terms of learning and skill - building, making them a valuable tool in our lives."
1680	1684	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, my personal opinion on computer technology is that it is extremely bad for you, and we need to take precautions and worry about eye protection, virtual harassment, and that there are dangerous people on the @CAPS2. Eye protection is important. Although computers are useful, they can harm our eyes. The screen being too bright can hurt your eyes. Also, if you look at it for too long, it could make them tired. I can tell you from personal experience that glasses are un - cool and some people get picked on for wearing them, and that could happen if your eyes get hurt and you can't see as well as you did before. It could even lead to wearing glasses or, in extreme cases, going blind. Virtual harassment is another thing to be aware of. Over the @CAPS2, you could be cyber - bullied by kids you may or may not know. For example, one day you could be on @CAPS3 and be talking in a chat room, and kids could make sexual, homophobic, or just plain rude remarks. Which brings me to sexual harassment. Sexual harassment is extremely harmful and can make people feel very bad about themselves. Kids take pride in calling others bad names regarding their race, their gender, or even the gender they like. So take extra precautions when encountering sexual harassment. Sexual predators are a parent's biggest fear for kids. Sexual predators are everywhere, on @CAPS4, @CAPS5, @CAPS3, or even in your neighborhood. While kids are running around town looking and acting the way they do, they are extremely unsafe. This is why you should never put any personal information on the @CAPS2, not your address, not your birthday, not your cell or house numbers, nothing, not even your town. Also, sometimes it's a little dangerous to put your last name. So be very careful on the internet. When you see sexual harassment, or someone being followed by a sexual predator, report them! and be safe. In conclusion, while computer technology has its uses, we must be vigilant about these risks to ensure our safety and well - being.
1681	1685	1	3	"Dear Newspaper, I strongly believe that computers do not benefit society. I believe this because when you use the computer, you spend less time exercising. Secondly, computers reduce the time for enjoying nature. Finally, interacting with family and friends is important, but when on the computer, you don't do much of that. Please read on to find out what I have to say about computers. Using a computer has a number of downfalls, but one of which is the lack of exercising while on the computer. As you may know, many countries are becoming obese because of the lack of exercise. Computers are no help to this problem. The only exercise computers contribute to is the movement of hands and fingers, but even that is bad because if you are typing and on the computer for too long, you will get carpal tunnel in the fingers and hands. Dr. Smith, an expert on health, said ""One in three people go on the computer for more than one hour a day, which could lead to obesity. This leads to my next point. When on the computer, there is no time for enjoying the outdoors. Enjoying nature is important to every man or woman's schedule. On a computer, it's impossible to enjoy nature because all the computer is, is a time - consuming and somewhat brain - washing thing to do. Nature helps refresh the brain. Without that, then you'll be very exhausted all the time. Did you know that 30% of kids go outside every day? That means 70% of kids are inside on the computer. This leads to my final topic. The computer does have sites where you can talk to friends, but that is nowhere as good as seeing them in person. Your family is important, so you need to spend time with them. My family always does stuff together like playing board games and such. With computers, there would not be any time with your family because everybody will be on the computer playing games instead of spending time with your family. In my conclusion, computers have extraordinary bad effects on society because they exhaust time for exercising, also limit time to enjoy nature, and finally, people spend too much time on computers and too little time interacting with family and friends. Thank you for reading my paragraph on the many affects of computers."
1682	1686	1	3	Dear: ABC Company. My name is John and I am concerned that people around the world are using computers too much during the day. Some computers are bad because there are glitches in the computer. And everyone has a MySpace, and MySpace has a virus, and it leaves a virus in your computer, and your computer shuts down or goes slow. Also, people can hack your computer, and you can't find out about it, and everything that was on your computer can spread around the world. People can know your most secret things and more. Finally, you can get caught making movies on your computer and go to jail, and your business will be ruined. In conclusion, the over - use and the associated risks of computers pose a real threat to people's privacy, security, and legal standing. We should be more cautious about our computer usage.
1683	1687	1	3	"Dear ABC, Computers have really made an impact on society. Some people think they have made a good impact while others think the opposite. I believe that they are a good thing in our lives and have made a drastic, but great impact. Some reasons that support my opinion are that computers are basically what helps us keep in touch with people, they make it very easy to find needed information, and they make our school lives faster and much simpler. First of all, computers are pretty much how people keep in touch. There are many ways you can keep in touch over computers. There is video - chatting, e - mail, and chat websites such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram etc. There are many people that really enjoy having the ability to keep in touch this way. It is a step up from talking on the phone. On the computer, if you are web - chatting, you can not only talk to them, but you can see them! When it comes to chatting websites such as Facebook, there are millions of people who belong to this incredible website and love it. Kids and adults really enjoy having access to something like this. For me, since I moved to California and had to leave all my friends behind, the computer has saved some of my relationships that I thought I would lose but didn't want to. I can e - mail my friends, and even see what they look like and how much they have changed on Facebook. Computers are a very helpful piece of technology that have helped me, and so many other people keep in touch. Another important reason computers are a wonderful technology item is because they make it so easy to find needed information. From what a word means, to the directions to get to New York City, the computer can help with all of this. I talked to my mom and she said, ""Computers just make accessing all of the information I need to know about your brother's diabetes so easy."" Accessing information in books can take so long. You have to go to the library or a bookstore, find the book you need with the correct information, and then you have to read through the whole book to find the information needed. On a computer, you can just google what you need to find, and read the article or map, etc. Computers have made accessing information a breeze and everyone loves how simple it is! The last reason that supports my opinion is that computers make our school lives faster and much simpler to deal with. In school, there are times when we need to write a very lengthy composition, and it will take forever to write. With a computer, typing up the composition would probably take around half the time of writing the composition. I took a survey of three kids that typed a composition and three kids that wrote it. I asked each of the kids how long it took them. The kids that wrote the paper said it took them around two hours. The kids that typed the composition said it took them around an hour. Also, when things are typed, they are usually easier to read, which makes it easier for teachers to grade, and won't take as long. Computers make school easier for students and teachers. The opinion that computers are not a benefit to society just doesn't make sense. Yes, I know that there can be some disadvantages. But think of all the advantages compared to the disadvantages. There are a lot more good than bad things. Without computers, people would be incredibly stressed, and have a hard time making life easier. Computers are an amazing benefit to society. Everyone should agree with this because people can stay in touch because of computers, computers make it very easy to find information that is needed, and they make our school lives easier and faster for students and teachers. Computers have made an extremely large impact and changed our ways of life for the better!"
1684	1688	1	3	"Dear Local newspaper, I am concerned because lately a lot of people have been using computers a great deal. My concern is that they haven't been exercising much, they aren't enjoying nature, and they aren't spending much time with their family. This is not a positive way for their life. In my opinion, exercising is a very, very important thing to do. This is because you need to maintain a healthy diet to stay healthy, and you need to exercise. Some people I know don't exercise, and they are either overweight or not healthy. People are ""busy"", as they say, using the computer to do all their work because they just don't like using the old - fashioned way, which is going to your job and doing your work. Everything is different now, and people have become lazier than ever before. Would people be lazy if computers weren't around? Of course they wouldn't be. They would have a happy and healthy life. Nowadays, people don't go out and explore the world much. They just go online and they search a place up on Google. They don't see the real thing though. They see pictures, and everybody knows that seeing the real thing is way better than looking at a picture. But I guess everyone forgot about that. Computers have everything online. No wonder people don't want to leave their homes, and if they do leave, don't worry, they have a laptop with them. Computers are even portable, so wherever they go, they're still going to go online. People have also spent less time with family because they could talk to them online in a chat room. This isn't a good thing because what if you were talking to your ""mother"", well at least you think is your mother but is someone else, and you're talking about something private. That person on the other computer, ""your mother"", will know about that and can cause problems with you. You know what I mean? Like if you were talking about your credit card and that person asked you for your credit card number and you gave it to them, then they could cause problems. Online isn't a safe place, that's why you should talk in person, not on a chat room. Well, I hope that you put my letter in the newspaper so that people could exercise, see the nature, and be with family, like they were when they didn't have computers around."
1685	1689	1	3	Dear, The excessive use of the internet by people is a big concern. When people use the internet too much, it leads to a lack of exercise. Others are too engrossed in playing games online. Some people fear online chat rooms. They aren't safe. Some people get really injured or even murdered. Exercise is important, but many people neglect it because of the internet. That is very dangerous because your cholesterol will rise. You will gain weight, and that can lower your self - esteem. Other people commit suicide because of the way they appear, and no one wants that. That is sad for everyone, plus it's not worth it. Video games online are very amusing. But some people would do extreme things for these games. Games are a problem, let alone online games. Online chat rooms are very dangerous. You never know who you're writing to. Millions of people have faced bad consequences for saying the wrong stuff. Others have been raped or molested by these strangers. Thousands of kids give out their addresses and have been robbed. There are weird, crazy, or suicidal people in the world. So don't make yourself a target. I personally don't agree with computer use at all. So many bad things can happen if you do the wrong stuff. In conclusion, the over - use of computers and the associated risks are significant. We should be extremely cautious about our online activities. I hope you understand and agree with my reasons.
1686	1690	1	3	My opinion on the effects of computers is that most people in the world spend most of their time sitting on the computer day in and day out. If someone I knew spent all day long on the computer, I would tell him or her straightforwardly that he or she should go outside and get some fresh air and do some exercise. Sometimes the only way to make contact with them is by talking to them on the computer. Although the computer can be quite helpful by looking up important artifacts or important information about medical plans, tutorials of how to fix, make, or build things, and to meet new people. But, the computer can be a dangerous place as well. You can meet someone who is lying about their age; that person might rape or murder you. If you spend twenty - four seven on the computer, you could be paralyzed from lack of exercise or get lymphoedema, which is when your body appears swollen and will not be able to exercise and would need special treatments, like massage. Computers can also be good because it can give you hand - eye coordination by using the skills of looking and sometimes some people for using the computer: videos, video, and websites. You can get your computer updated for better quality. Some systems have computers in them or can be connected to the computer like the, and the @CAPS1 @NUM1 @CAPS2. There are games called p.c. games. Some p.c. games communicate with children to teach them how to write, read, spell, and pronounce words. There are also special computers and/or websites you can search for tutorials for speaking different languages. There are also sites you can search for tutorials for playing instruments. Some people use the computer to fill their emptiness inside of them instead of eating. Some people abuse the computer as a drug like they're addicted to it. Imagine someone addicted to computers; everywhere he/she goes they would take their laptop with them. Many people have died using the computer but that's because they abused it. Everyday people buy computers. This invention is very helpful. As time goes on, scientists are making new things to save lives, and computers will continue to play an important role in our lives, but we must use them in a balanced way.
1687	1691	1	3	Dear @LOCATION2, @CAPS1 your workers wake up in the @TIME1. They stretch their right muscles gently and put on their fuzzy slippers. They wander down the hallway slowly and open their @CAPS2 book air to check the weather for today carefully. They go on @ORGANIZATION1, @NUM1, and etc. to view their e - mails sent from work friends, and family one by one. They check the time on the bottom of the laptop screen and log onto to play some as they are getting ready. Society today relies heavily on computers and the network which keeps us all connected... with the incorrect with technological advances happening today, people are now using computers to help with their work. But is that a good thing? Some @MONTH1 say that it is due to the fact the amount of time spent on the computer is too much and that it stops people from interacting with friends. But it does, computers help with the skill of typing, help with fast and easy communication and helps friends and @NUM2. of through @NUM2 @CAPS3, @CAPS4, etc. I believe that computers have a positive affect on people and are a great addition to society. To begin, computers help to teach @CAPS6, children, and even adults the skill of typing. Statistics show that more and more jobs rely on computers and hire people with a higher words per minute ability. With almost @PERCENT1 of companies adopting new computer systems and using computers to store information for their company, computers are a necessity and so is the knowledge of understanding computers and being able to type. Moreover, @CAPS6 these days are depending on computers for research in order to do projects and gather information. I can personally connect to this because being a student at @LOCATION1 school, I am assigned projects that involve typed words and or information. How hard it would be if I had to hand - write all of my work and search on the paper for information. @CAPS1 multiple @CAPS6 are assigned the same project, the teacher does not have to check millions of @CAPS6 to look out @CAPS5 there was no computer to use, what would I do? For @CAPS6, computers are a great thing. Furthermore, @CAPS6 and even adults enjoy social time, but @CAPS1 friends are family live faraway or you are not able to visit them, the computer comes in handy. Computers help to keep friends and family connected through @CAPS3, @CAPS8, @ORGANIZATION1 / or @NUM1, I.M / @PERSON1, and webcam video chats. All of those computer - related things would not be there for @CAPS5 there were no computer. Would you want to be disconnected from family? Being social is a key part of being human. Why should we not keep computers? In conclusion, computers are wonderful things. They help to build the skill of typing, help with fast and easy communication and help keep friends and family connected. Computers have a positive impact on people and are an important part of our modern society.
1688	1692	1	3	Dear The @CAPS1, People have been saying that computers are not beneficial, but they are wrong. In my opinion, computers are very beneficial. Computers teach hand - eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about other people and faraway places. Also, you can use the internet to interact with friends and family. Computers can be very useful and efficient to anybody. Did you know that computers can teach hand - eye coordination? Some computers have programs that teach you how to type without having to look down at the keyboard. Even if people don't have the program, they can learn how to type fast without having to look down. Many people that I know have learned how to use the computer or type without anyone telling them how to do so. Computers are very needed all around the world. Computers give people the ability to learn about other people and places. If you go on the internet, you can search for a person or place and the computer will find it for you quickly. Children and adults need computers. For example, if a child gets a project from school that needs to be done about a famous person or smoking, she would most likely need to go to the internet. The same goes for adults who have jobs in offices, schools or anywhere else. Computers are essential to people all around the world. Computers can be used to communicate with each other. People use computers to communicate with friends or family in far - away places. They can communicate via e - mail, @CAPS2, video and maybe even in other websites. Some websites contain the ability to talk to each other through video or through messages, such as @CAPS3, or @CAPS4. People like using the computer because it is very useful when you need it most. If you ask anyone, they will tell you that having a computer is very important and necessary. Why would people intend to take away something as important and useful as a computer? Computers can be used to learn hand - eye coordination, and help you move your fingers faster. They give people knowledge about people and places in the world. Finally, they can be used to communicate with one another through e - mail, message and many other ways. In my opinion, computers are one of the most important things to a person as they enhance our lives in multiple ways and will continue to do so in the future.
1689	1693	1	3	"Dear Newspaper, Have you noticed that nowadays more and more people are becoming overweight? Well, it's true. People say that it is because of eating a lot of fast food, but I think that since we are always on the computer and not exercising helps contribute to it. Also, as the technology is getting better, it is keeping people from going outside and enjoying the beautiful nature. Sitting in front of the computer isn't going to help our environment. Lastly, kids aren't getting out of their house to interact with friends and family because technology has been able to let us communicate without leaving our house. I'm not saying that we should downgrade our technology, but we need to find a way to limit it. To start with, technology has a role in the increasing rate of obesity. Some @MONTH1 say that people choose not to exercise, but if we limit things then they won't have to choose. As a kid myself, I love to be on the computer. My parents are always trying to get me off the computer and take the dogs for a walk and I always say ""I'm busy"". Well, it's true, I don't really like to go outside because I have a computer to play games or talk to friends. And to be honest, exercising to me seems important but I don't do it because I'm always on the computer. I think that other people could feel this way, so that's why we need to limit the computer. Secondly, global warming is occurring right now and people would rather be inside on the computer than go outside and enjoy the nature. Well, you @MONTH1 be able to look up ways to stop global warming, but does it mean you are going to really do it? Some @MONTH1 not because they could just stay on the computer and keep ""looking up"" ways to help. Another thing is that when we use our computers, we use electricity, which adds to global warming. So if we limit the use of computers, then people could go enjoy nature and not destroy it. Lastly, internet sites like myspace, @CAPS4, @CAPS5, etc have allowed us to communicate with friends and family but we are still not able to get out and interact with them. When we get out and interact with our friends, we gain skills like communication, teamwork and respect. Friends and family can teach you this in person, but with the computer they can't. Also, interacting with your family and friends @MONTH1 let you go to new places that you haven't been before and on the computer you can't go there. Interacting with friends & family is better than talking through the computer. In conclusion, if we stay on the computer then we won't get exercise, enjoy nature or interact with friends. So we need to act now and limit computer usage to lead healthier and more fulfilling lives."
1690	1694	1	3	"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, I think that people spend way too much time on the computer these days. They get less exercise. They don't get to enjoy the nature around them, and they don't get to interact with their family and friends! If people stop spending so much of their day on the computer, then they wouldn't be having too many issues. People need to spend less time on computers and spend more time exercising! Computers all over the world do not involve much interaction with any part of your body other than your hands. You don't tend to want to get up or do anything else when you're on your computer, right? Well, that needs to change. Often, people get cranky while they are using a computer or if they need to get off of one. Some people are so obsessed, they might even break down and have a fit! Nobody wants to see someone throw a fit because they have to get off the computer, do they? If they don't get exercise anytime when you're not on a computer, it can definitely show. Jimmy @CAPS2 says, ""@CAPS3 @NUM1 kids are on their computers way too much! They never come out of their rooms, and if they ever do, then they are normally very cranky. They're getting fat! I can tell because all they eat is junk food. This needs to stop."" He can't even have a little bit of time with his children. They should go on a family trip and enjoy together! That brings us to the next issue. We all need to enjoy nature more. Why would you spend your time on a computer looking at pictures of nature when you have it right there in your vicinity? It's because kids are too lazy to get off their lazy butts and go outside. The best thing about nature is that if you are feeling about needing to be alone or even just need to get away, nature is always there for you anytime you need it. You can always go outside with your friends and family too! I'm sure that they would appreciate people getting off their computers to spend some quality time together. Yet again, our next and final issue. Computer - obsessed teenagers and adults need to be with their family and friends. When talking to your friends, why bother talking to them on the computer when you can just get together and go do something fun? Also, when you spend time with your family, it brings them a lot closer to you. Nobody likes to not talk to the people you love and the people who raised you. When you're on a computer, I just think of all the places you could go, places you could be with. Nobody wants to be distant from their friends and family. Therefore, people should turn off their computers, go exercise, be around nature and have some quality time with their friends and family. By doing so, we can lead more balanced and happy lives. Thank you."
1691	1695	1	3	"Dear local Newspaper, as you well know, in today's digital age, more and more people are starting to buy and own computers. Some experts say this is a bad thing and that we should spend more time outdoors. I disagree with this statement. First, computers help us with every day life. We can easily check news on computers, and some people even use their computers as a TV and watch important shows. Second, a computer is a great way to communicate. Whether it's with friends, family or even for business, a computer is an excellent way of communication. Finally, a computer is helpful when it comes to school or work. You could write a paper on the computer. For example, if you're writing an article on a topic, you can quickly organize your thoughts and make revisions. Read on to see how I support my reasons of why computers are helpful in people's lives. Have you ever had a time when you see something on the news that you want to learn more about? Well, if you had a computer, you could go online to the news website and read more. This is only one way a computer comes in handy in every day life, there are plenty more. Another way is if you don't own a TV, you could watch your favorite show on the computer. My English teacher, Ms. Smith, says ""I never owned a TV, I only watch shows on my computer and I like it better"". In fact, 70% of people who watch videos on the computer like it better than watching TV. This is how computers come in handy in every day life. I love how computers have various ways of communicating. I like it because I have several relatives who live far away and I use my computer to communicate with them from time to time. Skype is my favorite, I can see the person I'm talking to at the same time. Also, computers can be good for business for large companies who need to communicate out of the country. I'm sure being an amazing newspaper company, you could use a way of easy communication. Finally, communication with friends. There are numerous programs for this, such as WhatsApp, Facebook and MySpace. This is why a computer is a good way of communication. Finally, computers can be useful for schools and work. You can type a paper or news article on the computer. It's much faster than writing. Also, if you need more info on something, you could look it up online. Like if you are writing an article on dolphins, you could learn more about their habitats, behaviors and conservation status. In conclusion, I think computers are good things. They help with everyday life, they are good for communication, and last, they help at school or work."
1692	1696	1	3	Wouldn't you agree that computers are needed in our life? I would. We need computers for many things. For example, we need computers for communications. In modern society, with the rapid development of technology, we rely on computers to stay connected with others. We also need them to educate ourselves and others. Moreover, this is beneficial for both buyers and sellers. My first reason why I agree that computers benefit society is because of the communications. Now in our present day with all of our new technology, many people use computers to communicate with friends or family. For example, if you had a loved one in the military, you could use the computer to communicate with him with a webcam. You can have face - to - face conversations, which makes the distance seem shorter. Computers could also be a good way to talk and ask friends about homework assignments you might have missed if you were absent. Also, you could use computers to communicate with somebody selling something you might be interested in, or you could get more detail about that product by talking to the owner of it through maybe email. My second reason would be education. Nowadays, many college students with work commitments might not have time to attend schools regularly. So, with the help of a computer, they can take online classes. For some students, instead of studying in the classroom all day, they could be learning from computers, and it could be more engaging for the students, so maybe they would understand topics better. Like in science, for example, when doing a lab, you could research and simulate the experiment on a computer. With computers, students could learn more because they would have access to a vast amount of information. If they were interested in a topic, they could research it and educate themselves. My third reason would be buying and selling products. Many people all over the world go on the internet to buy or sell products. Like eBay, which is a well - known website where many people list items to make money and other people can buy them. So, computers could be a good solution to making money and to also saving gas because people can order products online and have them shipped to their house instead of driving around to different stores. As I have told you about communications, education, and buying and selling products, I hope you agree with me that computers do benefit society.
1693	1697	1	3	Dear local newspaper editor, I'm sure you love having the internet at your fingertips. Recently, it has been brought to my attention that some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers. I firmly believe that this is correct. My three arguments are it's not healthy, the friends you meet up there are cyber friends and bad incidents might occur. First of all, being on the computer too much is not healthy. This reminds me of my friend named Lily. Lily used to be humorous, outgoing and play a lot of sports. One sunny day, her mother bought her a laptop. This laptop was blue and white - her two favorite colors. She was on it all day and all night. She took it with her everywhere she went. Well, it got to the point where she stopped playing sports, gained some weight and the sadness crept upon her. She was in a depression mode. She went to the doctors and they told her that she had to give up the computer and use it for only two days a week for five hours only. She listened to the doctor and it took her about three months to get back to the fun Lily she used to be. Being on the computer too much can harm you and the people around you. Second of all, the friends you meet on the internet are called cyber friends. You don't know who they really are, where they really live, or their real age. They can tell you anything they want because they know that the internet is a little fantasy world. That is mentally not healthy. It is very important for human beings to be socially active. Being on the computer too much can harm your brain also, as it reduces real - life social interactions. Third of all, bad incidents might pop up. If you are the type of person who is on the computer every chance you get, like Becky, it is not good for you or the device. Being on the computer for long periods can cause eye strain, back pain and also harm the computer's hardware due to overheating. Well, you've read my arguments and ideas. Please take them into consideration as we should all be more aware of the negative impacts of excessive computer use.
1694	1698	1	3	Computers, Computers, Computers! That’s the first thing a teenager does right when they get home from school. Teenagers just can't wait to chat with their friends on Facebook and instant message. There are a lot of positive and negative things about computers. In these paragraphs below I am going to give you my opinion, tell you how people can manage their time better and the effects it can have. My personal experience with computers is that they have an abundance of information but sometimes it can be too much. Today, a lot of children and teenagers are getting bullied. People can send horrible messages to someone. They rather do it on the computer because they don't have to say it to their faces. That is one thing that I don't like about computers is that people can get harassed. Other than that, I think the computer is a great resource for learning about things and also connecting with people from your past. Not a lot of parents want to see their child coming straight home from school and go right to the computer. Parents have to be strict with their child when it comes to computers. They need to manage their time so they can also do their homework, participate in after - school activities etc.... Studies have shown that children who go on the computer every single day for more than two hours are most likely to see their grades drop. That's why if you manage your time, it wouldn't be a problem. You want your child to have a balance in their life, so manage the time where they are not on the computer all day long. There are positive things about the computer as well as negative things. The computer is a great way to research people you are learning about in school and find people from your past. For example, Facebook is a great way to stay connected to your old buddies. Google is also a great tool because you can type in anything and it will give you a hundred websites to choose from. A negative effect about it is that people are likely to say things on it to other people that they wouldn't dare to say to their face. It also prevents you from doing other things because you get so consumed about the computer you forget your main priorities. In these paragraphs I gave you my opinion on computers and how there are positive and negative things about them. I also explained how it can take up your time with your main priorities in life and how to manage your time wisely. The computer is a great tool but don't take too much advantage of it because it is not a priority.
1695	1699	1	3	Dear Newspaper, I think that computers have a good effect on people's lives. You can do a lot of stuff on the internet that costs too much to do without it. You can study different foods and cultures around the world in great detail. If you play games online, you can get better hand - eye coordination skills. There are also things you can buy to video chat with family or friends. The computer is very convenient and useful. If you are interested in a place in the world, you can type in the name of the place and get detailed facts about cultures, unique foods, and more. Instead of buying an airline ticket to see Paris, you can go online to learn French, the local language. You can also study the delicious foods that people eat and the stylish clothes they wear. You can also learn about different sports and games. If you play games on the computer, you can get a better hand - eye coordination. Most games you can download and are free. There are puzzle games that challenge your logical thinking, action games that are fun and require rapid button pressing, and adventure games that let you explore new virtual lands. And in a lot of these games, you can talk to people and make friends from different parts of the world. There are other ways to talk instead of games. There is email, chat rooms, Facebook, Twitter, and video chat. With any of these things, you can talk to friends or family around the world or in your state/country. All of these you can either download, access on the internet, or buy the software. You can talk to old friends or you can talk to family you haven't seen in a while. With video chat, you can see each other's expressions clearly, on Facebook you can share pictures and memories, and in chat rooms you can talk with multiple people simultaneously. In conclusion, computers are very convenient for our society today. Whether it's studying the world, having fun, or talking to people you know, the computer has many wonderful things to offer people.
1696	1700	1	3	"What is technology? Technology is precisely defined as anything that effectively helps enhance our overall way of living. Technology is truly all around us. Our comfortable beds, sturdy houses, entertaining televisions, and even simple chairs are all distinct forms of technology. There is one form of technology, however, that in my well - considered opinion, has completely revolutionized modern - day living as we currently know it. This remarkable form of technology is called the computer. My outlook on the profound effect the computer has had on our society is quite positive. Just take a moment to think of all of the numerous things we rely on this device to do. There is one thing, however, that really stands out prominently in my mind; @CAPS1. The computer is perhaps the greatest form of @CAPS1 the world has ever witnessed. E - mail is basically the convenient act of sending a letter to a friend without the unnecessary hassle of mailing it out where it might unfortunately get lost or stolen. E - mailing consists of two straightforward steps: @CAPS2 and @CAPS3. Not only does it significantly lower the risk of the letter not reaching its destination, but it is also much quicker. You simply hit the ""send"" button and before you know it, a new letter is sitting in your friend's inbox. Another method of computerized @CAPS1 is my personal favorite, instant messaging. Instant messaging allows you to have a seamless conversation with someone who could be miles away. And it's perfectly okay if you decide to go get a soda while you are instant messaging because unlike a real - life conversation, that isn't considered rude. These are just two methods of @CAPS1 that the computer enables us to enjoy. There is a variety of other methods that, much like these two, greatly enhance our way of life. I firmly believe that the main reason the computer has enhanced our life so much is because of one giant thing: the internet. The internet makes everything we do on the computer entirely possible. If I want to go on the computer and do in - depth research on a topic, the internet efficiently takes me where I want to go. With millions of different websites, the internet has truly endless possibilities. If I'm interested in arcade games, I can go on the internet and play them to my heart's content. If I have to write a science report, then I can go on the internet and collect comprehensive research. If I want to listen to music, then I can go on the computer, look up a song, and listen to it with ease. And guess what? If I'm looking for a funny video just for a good laugh, then the internet can quickly find me one! The internet is perhaps one of the greatest things ever invented. It's just another compelling reason to love the computer."
1697	1701	1	3	The computer is able to perform so many diverse things. I firmly think computers have positive effects on people. But some experts believe they don't, which is precisely why I'm writing this paper so that I can clearly explain the positions from both sides. Did you know that for most everyone who has a house, their chances of having a computer are just as high as having a telephone? Believe it or not, computers help us in life whether it's @CAPS1 to keep important information, talk online, find a delicious recipe, or whatever it is @CAPS1 there. That is why computers are so positive. If we did not have computers, there would not be any of the technological advances that we have @DATE1, as @CAPS1 is one of the most important devices. Let me share my experience, okay. I had a job interview. Well, I could not find that street, so I went on my computer and it promptly gave me the directions. Thanks to that, I made it to my interview on time. That's why I think computers have positive effects. Now, the opposite side says people are spending too much time on their computer and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with friends and family. Well, I think that some people spending too much time on their computer is completely a matter of personal choice. And those are people who usually don't have a lot of self - control. And regarding exercising, who said that everyone needs to exercise? If a person is already skinny, what's the need to exercise? For the interacting with friends and family, you can always find a balance. I mean, how long can a person realistically look at a computer screen? So in conclusion, you can see that computers are good, but with self - control, they can be enjoyed with no bad side effects. So next time you're on the computer, enjoy it, but remember your friends, family, and your health are more important.
1698	1702	1	3	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, as a regular computer user, I think computers are extremely helpful in many ways. They assist us in getting new @CAPS3. They play a crucial role in making machines function smoothly. They also help people learn new things effectively. Computers are great at helping us find and obtain new @CAPS3. They provide the public with another excellent way to find a new or another job. My brother, for example, @CAPS4 went to a university where @CAPS4 learned how to become a mechanic. @CAPS4 was having a hard time finding a job. (He was looking for me on the street was a bit of a struggle.) So someone told him to go on @CAPS1.com and go to ""@CAPS2 @CAPS3"". @CAPS4 did just that, and there on the computer, @CAPS4 found a good job and still works there to this day. The computer is truly a great way to find a job. Computers help make machines function. All the machines that we used to have to operate by hand now run with the help of computers. That is good in some ways and bad in another way. They help us make more products in less time. Today, more cars are being made in less time. If you've ever seen an assembly line of cars, you saw the mechanical robot hands putting them together, and that is all thanks to computers. One major problem with this is that many people are losing their @CAPS3. However, computers also have the ability to teach people new skills. Overall, computers are a double - edged sword, but their positive aspects generally outweigh the negative ones."
1699	1703	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, The effects computers have on people can either be hurting our society or it can also be helping society. As a middle - schooler growing up in this technological age, I believe using computers can be beneficial at some point but it is also damaging our society. First of all, the internet is full of inappropriate content. Illegal uses are involved and can draw in anyone with just a single click of a mouse. Anyone in the world can use the technology we have today to ""hack"" or trespass someone else's computer. Anybody can download songs or documents illegally for free, rather than paying for it themselves. In fact, not only can someone download inappropriate content right onto their screen, they can also be exposed to graphic words or view a website that involves videos with drug use, criminal acts, vulgar language, and more. A recent study on internet use from the @ORGANIZATION1 for internet use includes that ""@CAPS4 @CAPS5"" has a history of resulting in suicides or depression in teens. @CAPS4 @CAPS5 is a form of @CAPS5 where someone can chat or instant message someone and hurt their feelings in a very cruel way. Not only is @CAPS4 @CAPS5 an issue, however, people can now talk to strangers on the internet. Think about how awful it would be if your child had given out their private information online and a man who said they were the same age as your child received it and lied about their age, sex, appearance, and more. Now that man can track your child down and possibly kidnap or hurt them. Secondly, the internet can also be very unhealthy and can cause you to become less social. According to @CAPS7 @CAPS8 at @ORGANIZATION2, @PERCENT1 of children or teenagers that rely on internet use can create a weak relationship with friends and family members if they use the computer too much. It can be very unhealthy for someone, and not just teenagers, to use the computer for an extended amount of time than they should. People can gain the effects of laziness, little brain effort, and lose interaction with the outside world. Finally, my foremost reason on how computers can be negative is how addicting it can be. From my own experience, I used to stay up late for hours using websites such as @CAPS9 because everyone else was using it. Sure, it can be entertaining and fun but using the internet won't be so much ""fun"" when your academic grades are at risk and you stop communicating with the outside world. Addiction can draw anyone in against their willpower. My own brother became so addicted to computer games that he played one game straight for @NUM1 hours straight. You can get addicted to one subject until you lose everything else you have. The internet can be great in moderation, however it can be inappropriate, unhealthy, and addicting. If technology becomes too powerful in our civilization, we need to be extremely cautious about how we use it so that we can still learn to interact with our fellow humans."
1700	1704	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I wholeheartedly support the advances in technology, and believe that computers have a positive effect on people. I think this for three simple reasons. First, you gain computer skills, which can be extremely helpful in other situations. Second, computers give people the wonderful chance to learn about faraway people and places. Lastly, when you have a computer, you can chat and talk to other people. When I think of a computer, I immediately think of typing or a keyboard. After a few times of using a computer, you get better and better at it. You gain typing skills, excellent hand - eye coordination, and proficient mouse skills. After just a few uses, your computer skills steadily build up and you soon become quite good at it. When you do get better, you progress quicker and more efficiently, so it all works out very well. When you are on the computer, the internet allows you to search anything and everything. Whether it be a different culture or even schoolwork, a computer is extremely helpful. When I am doing my homework and I don't know how to answer a question, I go on the internet. The computer allows me to get detailed help with any homework I need assistance in, it's truly great. I can even look up something on a different culture and compare it to ours. The computer allows me to do everything I need. Have you ever felt alone, but there's no one to talk to? Well, that problem can be solved very simply, just get on a computer. You can chat with people even if there is no one around. You can chat with someone half - way around the world. It's amazing that you can be anywhere, talking to anyone you want. A computer's chat feature allows you to reconnect with old friends and make new ones. Computers are truly great. When you're on a computer, there is so much to do, so much you can get out of it. They are both helpful and fun, and you never run out of options with a computer at your side. In my opinion, there is so much to gain and learn from a computer, and it is an indispensable part of modern life.
1701	1705	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, walking into a room and seeing people interacting with their computer screens, I find it new and exciting that they can access information every day. The question is, what effects do computers have on people? I certainly think computers have a positive effect on people. They teach hand - eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with others. Computers can definitely have a positive impact on society. Computers have taught a very valuable skill to every user: hand - eye coordination! Whether it's clicking a link to a site that you found on @ORGANIZATION2, or playing the matching game of Bejeweled, you are learning hand - eye coordination. According to recent studies, over @PERCENT1 of people interviewed said they had excellent hand - eye coordination and @PERCENT2 said it was due to using the computer. Sure, we all need to get exercise outside, but the computer can be helpful as long as we don't let it overwhelm us. Smart people would agree that coordination is a very helpful skill. These brilliant inventions also help us learn about different places and people. Picture this scenario if you will; A student at @ORGANIZATION1 has to do a project on the @CAPS4 @CAPS5 in the @LOCATION1. He goes to the library to check out the encyclopedias but... they are out of date. He then goes to the computer lab and finds the relevant information on @ORGANIZATION2 right away! This scenario shows that the computer is one of the fastest ways to get information on any subject or topic. Certainly, text sources can give the same accurate information, but the computer is fast and easy, especially when you need information instantly. But why stop there? Not only can you get information on certain people and places on these machines, you can also learn what the newest fads are, what's currently happening in @LOCATION2, and the latest @CAPS6 gossip. The computer is definitely an easy source for information on different areas and people. This amazing device can also let you talk to people online! There are many ways to do this. You can use the old - fashioned @CAPS7 - mail, or you can use a device in the @CAPS8 to communicate with someone. Of course, you need a @CAPS9 to do that. I remember a time when I was bored so I decided to do my homework. The problem was I forgot what it was! I quickly grabbed the phone and called my classmate but he didn't answer. I then rushed to my computer and checked to see if he was online. Sure enough, he was! I got the homework details and got an A, all thanks to the computer's ability to interact with others. In conclusion, computers offer numerous positive aspects such as enhancing skills, providing information, and enabling communication, making them a valuable part of our lives.
1702	1706	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I firmly believe that computers have a good effect on people and not a bad effect. I think this for three key reasons. My first reason is that they relieve stress. In my opinion, without a computer, things would be a lot more stressful. With a computer, you can easily look things up without wasting time or getting stressed out by having to search for something in a pile of books or other resources. For example, if you need to find a recipe for a special dish, a simple search on the computer can provide you with numerous options in seconds. My second reason for thinking computers have a good effect on people is related to technology. Without technology, things would be so much harder. Without computers, it would be extremely difficult to neatly type assignments, print out high - quality pictures, and access vast amounts of information. If we didn't have technology in the form of computers, I think a lot of things would go wrong. For instance, in the field of research, computers help scientists analyze data quickly and accurately. My third reason for thinking computers have a good impact on people is that without them, factories would face major disruptions. I say this because if you think about it, almost every process in a factory is run by some type of computer. Without that computer telling the machines what to do, everything practically wouldn't work! Without the computer, every task would become so time - consuming that no one would want to get the work done. For example, in an automotive factory, computers control the assembly line to ensure precision and efficiency. These are my three reasons why I am convinced that computers have a good effect on people.
1703	1707	1	3	Dear whom it may @CAPS1, Have you ever wondered what it would be like to spend all your time in front of computers? Well, if you have, I firmly believe that you should not be in front of that computer all day. As my mom always says, only an hour a day is good. One important reason why it is crucial to limit computer time is because you need to enjoy what life has to offer. You could engage in activities like playing catch with the dogs, taking the dog for a long walk, and (or) playing at a friend's house. Yes, playing on the computer is fun, but you also have to exercise. You know, staying active is essential for your physical and mental health. Another @CAPS2 reason why is because by staying indoors on the computer all the time, you can end up in a situation where you miss out on so many wonderful experiences that you didn't even know you were missing. You could also make lots of new friends by going outdoors. That's how I discovered beautiful trees, friendly animals, and amazing scenery. You could feel like you're having the time of your life. The last and final reason why this is important is that you can gain a lot from the outdoors that you can use in your life. You could build snowmen in the winter or if it's raining, you could watch a movie with your family. You could build sandcastles at the beach or forts in the backyard. In conclusion, activities like building, playing, and jumping (the list could go on) allow you to enjoy the outdoors. Just remember the three good reasons why you should embrace the wonderful and lovely outdoors. Go walk your dog, have friends over, or even just have a great time out with your family and friends. By doing so, you'll lead a more balanced and fulfilling life.
1704	1708	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, Computers: well, computers are a huge part of our lives nowadays. You can look up information on various topics, learn new and interesting things, and they can keep you occupied for hours. It's like a whole package deal. When it comes to learning and getting information such as historical facts, details about the past, and knowledge about the @CAPS1, it helps us understand the world we live in and how things came together. A computer is like a virtual trip to the library, with almost all the information you need readily available. You can look things up for a school project or just for your own curiosity. And the best part is that you can access it in an instant, just like flipping through the pages of a digital book. You can learn something new every day from different websites like @ORGANIZATION1, @ORGANIZATION2, and @CAPS4, and so on. Some people can't even imagine living without these devices. However, sometimes when using objects on a computer like a music player, you have to download music and other apps. At the same time, having these things on your computer keeps you busy and engaged, whether it's listening to your favorite tunes or exploring new software. Computers are a big deal, as you can see. They have a significant impact on someone's life. They offer the ability to look up information, learn new things, and provide entertainment, whether it's on a desktop or a laptop. In conclusion, computers have become an indispensable part of modern life, providing a wealth of opportunities for learning and entertainment.
1705	1709	1	3	Everyone loves staying on the computer. I would truly be surprised if there was someone who didn't. I firmly believe the whole issue is that the machine itself distracts you from other equally enjoyable aspects of your life. People tend to learn an excessive amount on it, which can change their whole lives in unexpected ways. The computer is like a disease or a virus that takes control of you, but gaining your freedom from it is perfectly possible. I understand that some people @MONTH1 may not agree with me, however, I firmly propose that my side is the best. This situation is truly horrible. How can it be otherwise? It distracts people from living their lives to the fullest. It makes them blind to the beauty of nature. Spending too much time on the computer is indeed a horrible disease. The difficult part of regaining your freedom is being able to recognize that it is controlling you. Once you realize that, the door to freedom will swing open. Technology keeps you away from having real - life fun, doing your homework from school, and spending quality time with friends. I know that you can break free from it because I once went through the same experience. Technology is a beautiful thing indeed. It has so much information in it that you wouldn't even think a single person could possess. It can seem to know even more than a well - read individual. However, it is also very harmful. Once I came across a very disturbing scene on the computer. I just wished I could shut it off immediately. Machines seem to have a mind of their own, independent of ours, and can influence us in many ways. Changing a person's life is not an easy task. You can become a completely new person. Sometimes those changes are good, sometimes they are bad. But a machine can make you change in just ten minutes. Once you see what you like on it or what you desire, you can undergo a transformation. If you see something and you want it so badly and you can't get it, then you might be tempted to get it by stealing. It is a very terrible thing to learn. All you have to do is learn to control yourself. Machines are a very bad influence on people. There are books if you need information. Computers make you lazy; you don't have to read or think much as it does it all for you. It takes over your life. You become dependent on it. It teaches you bad things and changes your life in negative ways. What path would you choose? In conclusion, while computers offer many conveniences, we must be vigilant to avoid their negative impacts and maintain control over our lives.
1706	1710	1	3	Wouldn't you agree that computers have a great effect on people? The three reasons why they have a good effect on people are that it gives you good typing skills, it's educational, and it helps you out with a lot of things. The first reason why computers have a good effect on people is because computers help improve your typing skills. If you have a computer, you will soon learn that your typing skills get very good. Each time you use the computer, your hands adjust to the keys on the keyboard. Say if there is someone who wants to work with computers when they get older, well, if they practice their typing on their computers at home, they will be eligible for the job working with computers. Also, computers could be good for the hearing - impaired. If the hearing - impaired get used to the computers, then they can get a webcam or a microphone and chat with people online. This would be useful to them because since they cannot hear what people say, they can read what people say through the internet. Another reason why computers have a good effect on people is because they are very educational. In my opinion, computers are very educational because there are a lot of websites that teach you facts about different places. For example, what food people eat in different countries, or where that country is located. A website that is the best for finding out accurate facts is www.Ask.com. Ask.com is the best website because it tells you whatever you want to know in a matter of seconds. Computers are also educational when it comes to school projects because of these amazing websites. The last reason why computers have an effect on people is because they help you with a lot of things. They help you with a lot of things because if you want to know how far @LOCATION2 is from @LOCATION1, then you can go on your PC and find out. Or say that you lost the directions to your friend's house and you're on your way to their house. If you brought your laptop, you can go on the laptop and find where her house is from your laptop. I know you're probably thinking there is such a thing as a GPS, well, if you think about it, GPSs can be confusing, but your computer reads it out to you. Now you're probably saying in your heads why don't you text/call @CAPS3/@CAPS4. If you think about it, what if your friend does not talk clearly. In conclusion, wouldn't you agree that computers do have good effects on people? My three arguments are that they help your typing skills, they are educational, and they help you with things. Please take my ideas into consideration. Computers truly are a valuable asset in our lives.
1707	1711	1	3	My experience with computers is good because I can play games or do my homework. I can install my own music on my computer and do my homework at the same time. I can also go on the internet with computers. On computers, I can also do things quicker and easier. I can also get more things done faster by accessing the internet and going on it because I can do research and copy and paste stuff off the internet. I now have a laptop and it is pretty much a portable computer. On my laptop, I can make data tables and graphs and write papers and use a dial - up connection. Dial - up connection is what I can use to get free internet by putting a person's phone number in the place where the phone number goes. Then the laptop will call up the modem if the phone line is connected to the modem. On my laptop, I also have a place to put a floppy disc in and a place for a @CAPS1 - @CAPS2 to go in to. I also have a calculator on my laptop. Some laptops also have a mouse that looks like a little pad, like mine does. As you can see, computers and laptops are really good to own. They offer a great deal of functionality and convenience in our daily lives.
1708	1712	1	3	Dear The @ORGANIZATION1, @MONTH1 says that people are spending too much time focusing on the computer and not on their homework, or getting some fresh air outside. I say those people are @CAPS1! Computers are a giant step into new technology. For example, you can use the computer to do research for school, communicate with friends online and give children some down time where they can learn about far - away places and people. If you were doing a research paper for school and you have checked out all the books on the subject of your paper, but you suddenly realized that you forgot one of the most important books! You race back to the library only to find out that it is closed. Computers then come in handy. You can google the book and find an online copy of the book, so you make the grade on that paper. Also, possibly you are having trouble with math homework and you are home alone, what do you do then? That is what computers are there for! So you can easily go to your teacher's website and there would be the explanation on how to do that specific lesson. Children @CAPS2 to communicate with their friends, to some extent. Such as a homework question or just to talk for fun. Without friends, children would be nowhere. Statistics show that @PERCENT1 of all children who are permitted to talk with friends, out of school stay off of drugs and promote a stronger education and grades. The internet was not just created for the heck of it. It was invented so people can communicate, children can do research, and for fun and exploring as well. For example - learning about far - away places, people, and culture, exploring animals, and even online shopping is now available. These are necessities for all people to have access to. Without computers, @CAPS3 would not know the important news when @CAPS3 needed to or information needed for a specific moment. Computers are the future (yes I am repetitive). @CAPS3 @CAPS2 to have computers in our lives for communication, shopping, learning purposes, teaching, research on places, animals, people, and culture. Also for email purposes and to get important news around to everyone applicable to it. This is why @CAPS3 @CAPS2 to continue forward with computers, and technology for the future. So all the people of @LOCATION1 keep your computers, they are an important stepping stone needed for growth and moving onto the future of technology. Plus who would not want a good computer game once in a while? Computers are here to stay and will only continue to enhance our lives.
1709	1713	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, do you think people should stop going on the computer? Well, yes because they are not getting exercise. People's bodies start to get lazy and don't want to get up. They are not spending time with the family instead they would like to spend their free time on the @CAPS3. This is why people should stop being lazy and have some fresh air. Do you think people who spend time on the computer interact with their family? Well, no, because they think they will get entertained by technology instead of their family. The reason I don't like computers so much is because you get hooked on so fast you can't stop. When you interact with family, you get to know them better and that is priceless. This is why it should stop because it damages people's minds. Another reason I would like you to hear is less time exercising. When people don't exercise, you will notice anything to their body. They start to eat too much and later they become very lazy. When you exercise, you have tons of energy to do anything. Like bungee jump. When you exercise, you look healthy and people will notice. This is why exercise is the best way to stay healthy and always fit. In addition, my third reason I would like you to read is enjoying nature. Enjoying nature, you can have a good time and relax. You can swim in the beach, feel the amazing breeze, and have a good time. When you are on the computer, you are sitting down instead of going outside and that becomes a habit. It will be hurting our environment because people don't want to get up to enjoy nature. This is why it should not be tolerated because people are being lazy. In conclusion, the reason why people should not spend their life on the computer is because they think they will be entertained by technology instead of interacting with their family. People will start eating too much and so they will become lazy. People will never leave the house and instead they are on their computer. This is why it should stop as it's hurting our environment and people are becoming lazy. We should all strive to balance our time between technology and the real world.
1710	1714	1	3	I agree that we should have computers, because more and more people use computers. Long time ago we didn't even have computers, but now we do. Now that we have computers, we should use them. If we don't use computers, why do we even have them? Computers can help you to learn about far - away places like @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1, @PERSON1, and other far - away places. If we don't know what is going on in far - away places, then we don't know what kind of flag they have, what they eat, what they have, what they do, and what they speak. You can even talk online with your friends on a computer! You don't have to call your friend; you can just talk to your friend online. If you need help with your homework or you left your math textbook at school, your friend can tell you the questions by talking online. If your friend is in @LOCATION2 or other far - away places, your friend can bring their computer with him or her so your friend can just talk to you by talking online. You don't have to call your friend in @LOCATION2 or other places. You can also learn how to type. When you know how to type, you can type faster and faster. You can type stories, poems, and notes or something you have to do at school. So you don't have to write on a piece of paper; you can just type on a computer. That is why we should have computers and use them more. I hope you agree with me. Computers open up a world of knowledge and communication, making our lives more convenient and enriching.
1711	1715	1	3	"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, The question is whether too much computer time causes people to interact less with their surroundings. In my opinion, computers definitely don't make people lazy and less interactive with others around them. First, I think that computers can sometimes make you smarter. I mean you can read about history, world news, and you can research many different topics in - depth. I remember when I was younger, I would love to learn about the @CAPS1, like its unique culture and historical events. I used to search it all the time and I made a poster project for fun. Thanks to the computer, I got accurate and detailed information. A survey conducted by the @CAPS2 school social studies teacher shows that @PERCENT1 of their students used the computers to find facts for school projects. @PERCENT2 out of that @PERCENT1 end up getting better grades as they could access comprehensive materials. Famous psychologist @PERSON2 says that ""kids and students learn more when they are on the computer researching or @CAPS7 new things."" I know you @MONTH1 be thinking that too much internet is unhealthy for people, but mostly for students. But at @ORGANIZATION1, it is a good source of @CAPS7 for them. Therefore, the computer helps teach everyone facts and keep them informed about what's going on around the world. Second, people can interact with family and friends online. I mean there's @CAPS3 where people can socialize with their families who live out of state. I remember when I was in @NUM1 grade, I made a new friend and she moved to @LOCATION1 in the @DATE1 after @NUM2 grade. I keep in touch with her on @CAPS3, sharing our daily lives and experiences. A survey conducted by the student council shows that @PERCENT3 of students had someone they know and love move away out of state, and @PERCENT4 out of that @PERCENT3 keep in touch by email or @CAPS3. Famous scientist @ORGANIZATION2 says, ""People who keep in touch with family and friends tend to stay happy and not become depressed."" I know you @MONTH1 be thinking that people don't need to keep in touch with their families all the time, but it makes them happier. Therefore, people need computers so they can keep in touch with their families. Third, you can learn new exercise, moves or tricks. I mean you can do new exercises, train for a dance competition or learn new magic tricks for your magic show. I remember when I wanted to learn how to twirl a balloon between my fingers, I went and found a video of someone teaching step - by - step on how to do it. It's easier now as I can follow the clear instructions. A survey conducted by @CAPS5 muscles @CAPS6 shows that @PERCENT5 of their @CAPS6 members get stronger and more fit by @CAPS7 new exercises. Famous athlete @PERSON1 says ""@CAPS7 new exercises online helps me stay fit for my games"". I know you @MONTH1 be thinking that they can just go to someone to teach them, BUT no one wants to pay money for something you can get free online. Therefore, @CAPS7 new exercises, moves or tricks online can help them out a lot. To conclude, does too much computer time cause people to interact less with their surroundings? No, it helps them learn, socialize with family and friends and they can get in shape with the new exercise that they learn from how - to videos."
1712	1716	1	3	People think that using computers is a good thing, and I think so too because there are a lot of other people in this country that speak different languages, and the computers can teach them instead of a person that just speaks our language. Through various language - learning apps and online courses, people can learn at their own pace. This is crucial for some people as it can be a part of their lives. A lot of people use computers for their work, such as graphic designers creating visual content or accountants managing financial data. Kids also use the internet, not just for things such as facebook, myspace, gmail, and a lot of other web pages. I also use the internet but not as much anymore. I used to go on gaming pages like, @NUM1.com or even /cup/coffee, where I could play exciting games with other players. But I don't go on those anymore that much because I have xbox live, and that is a thing where the internet also comes in and you can talk to your friends while playing games. Some of my friends just go on the computer and don't get any exercise at all, but a lot of my friends go on it but also play a lot of sports, so they're not just getting fat all the time. So, people in the world basically have a computer, but not everyone in @LOCATION2 of @LOCATION1. I think that our country should write a big paycheck to those poor countries so they can get computers. Then, if they come here, they can speak our language. Or we can ship a batch of computers to their countries so they don't buy any crappy computers. Also, when you're on a computer, you can buy a webcam or it is already placed into your computer, and you can talk to your friends or even show them what you've made, like a handmade craft or a painting. So I think that computers are the best thing that we ever invented or whoever did.
1713	1717	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1, My name is @PERSON1 and I want to argue about the issue of computer use in @LOCATION1. First, I'll tell you about the benefits of owning a computer. Then, I'll talk about the whole computer network. Finally, I'll talk about the advances in technology due to the computer. I think the use of computers in our town is very good for society. There are major benefits of using a computer. One is the fact you can use Microsoft to write up a paper. It offers features like spell - check and formatting that make the writing process more efficient. Sixth - grader @PERSON6 says, ""I would rather type than write a paper. Another reason to use a computer is for research."" ""There are many articles and facts online about anything you need,"" says @PERSON4. The final benefit of a computer is the fact you can know about world news in a flash. ""I would've never known about the earthquake in @LOCATION3 without seeing the article on @CAPS2 homepage,"" says @PERSON5. Those are just some of the major benefits that the kids do on their computer. Now let's talk about something that is said to be bad but really isn't; social networking. Stuff like @CAPS5 uses a texting form on a computer which helps us connect without making a huge phone bill. ""With instant messenger, I can talk to my girlfriends,"" says @PERSON2. Also, there is facebook which can help us connect on a global stage. ""I can talk with my cousin in @LOCATION2,"" says @CAPS6. Those are the major social networking tools we use to talk to people around the world. One thing that is important about the computer is the advances in technology caused by it. For example, we have the laptop which is a portable computer we can take anywhere. ""I can use my computer anywhere I like, whether it's in a coffee shop or at the park,"" says @PERSON7. Also, the memory card which allows us to save data on a computer and take it to school or work. Eighth - grader @CAPS7 says, ""I can take work I didn't finish in school home with the stick."" The final major advance is the use of the printer. ""I use my printer to print off papers to bring to school,"" @PERSON3 said. Those are some of the major advances caused by the computer. That's why I think using the computer is good for us. There are many benefits to owning a computer. We can talk to people world - wide whenever we want to. The computer has even been the sole purpose for many other ground - breaking improvements in technology. So please help defend us kids in this case about computer use."
1714	1718	1	3	Losing @CAPS1 to @ORGANIZATION1 are a huge part of daily life these days, which is good for businesses and schools. But for people just looking to pass time, computers are a dangerous choice. Yes, computers are a way of communication, and are helpful if a student forgets their homework or an assignment. Through online platforms like Edline, students can access their assignments easily. However, when it comes to boredom, computers are bad. Social networking is scary in reality, and too many young people are exposing themselves by making @CAPS2 or a @CAPS3 page. Also, exercise is a big issue now, and you aren't getting any by sitting at a computer. On the other hand, though, computers open up new worlds to people. You can type in any question or place into a search engine and instantly get results. You can learn about different cultures, scientific theories, or historical events. Computers, like anything else, are fine in moderation, but too much of one thing just isn't healthy. Websites like @CAPS2, or @CAPS3, or @CAPS6, are scary when it comes to privacy. There is very little privacy offered, and your page can just be put out in the public. Also, these websites are addicting. You @MONTH1 just want to log on to check your notifications, but you can end up on the computer for @NUM1 to @NUM2 hours without even realizing it. Other ways of passing time, like running on a treadmill or jogging, have benefits. All you can get from an hour on the computer is blurred vision and a sedentary lifestyle. It would be okay to be on the computer for 1/@NUM1 hour a day, but not just using the internet aimlessly. Websites can be a way to make computer time productive. Edline is useful for homework or an assignment, and Google is helpful for research or vocab work. When websites like these are the focus of computer time, it is much more productive. Overall, I believe that computers have a negative effect on people if too many people use them without balance. If as many people that use computers balanced that time with time to exercise, they would all be better off.
1715	1719	1	3	"Dear Local Newspaper, Imagine what the world would be like without computers. Scary thought? I had the same reaction. A world without computers is a world of non - communicating people and no place to gather information independently. The benefits of having computers are that they are a way of communicating with friends and family that don't live in your area or that you just haven't talked to in a while. Through email, video calls, and social media, you can stay connected easily. They also teach hand - eye coordination which is good for almost anything, from playing sports to doing fine - motor tasks. Lastly, they give people the ability to learn about other things in the world. In conclusion, computers have outstanding effects on people. First of all, in my perspective, having a computer allows me to communicate with people I've met on past vacations. I can email them and talk to them on social networks such as facebook. This is beneficial to anyone that has lost touch with friends or even family. Being able to talk to friends I haven't spoken to in a while gives me and others the opportunity to catch up and reconnect, sharing memories and new experiences. In conclusion, being able to communicate with others on a computer is only one of the many benefits a computer has! Second of all, not only does having a computer allow you to talk to others but it can teach you hand - eye coordination as well. Dereck, a channel @NUM1 news reporter, said, ""I can hit some far balls that take the cake for some of our games. I truly believe it's because my mother taught me how to use a computer! ""Kids especially benefit from computers because they teach them hand - eye coordination which is great for those homeruns, or even touchdowns! Third of all, computers allow students and many others to learn and look up things they don't know. @PERCENT1 of schools around the country benefit from having school computers for research. Students can write better essays and understand complex concepts. On the other hand, businessmen, parents, and even teachers use the internet to learn about things around the world and to gather information to teach their classes. Overall, computers have many benefits such as they allow you to communicate with others, they teach you hand - eye coordination, and even allow you to learn about things and places around the world. As a whole, this intelligent invention of the computer is an incredible machine that seems to have all the answers and is a reliable source of information."
1716	1720	1	3	"Dear @PERSON1, in your esteemed newspaper, I read an article that truly sparked my interest. The article was centered around the supposed negative effects computers have on the community. I couldn't help but strongly disagree with the article, @PERSON1 because, in my sincere opinion, computers are indeed a significant step in the right direction for modern technology. I firmly believe computers are a great benefit to society as they promote hand - eye coordination, offer the opportunity to learn about almost anything, and enable us to talk online to other people. How do computers help with hand - eye coordination, you ask? When you are typing on the computer, your eyes are intently focused on the screen while your hands are typing, and the muscles in your hands are strengthening at an incredible rate! A well - conducted study made by students at @ORGANIZATION1 shows that the chances of developing arthritis by the time you are @NUM1 dropped almost @PERCENT1 in people that use computers often. Also, the hand - eye coordination you gain from typing goes a long way in sports such as tennis and baseball. So, if someone needs to build up their hand - eye coordination, I wholeheartedly suggest that they take a computer class, like the ones that are readily offered in many schools all over the country. Secondly, using the internet on computers makes finding information on a wide variety of subjects much easier. Say you wanted to go on vacation with your family. Instead of tediously calling a number, why not simply go online and plan your entire trip from the comfort of your computer. There are so many user - friendly websites that make it fast and easy. In addition, there are sites that can teach people various skills. For instance, if you wanted to learn how to knit, just type in ""how to knit"" in your favorite search engine and there are over @NUM2 sites to help you, making it easy to learn to make great things or even fix a bike. In addition to learning about new things, the internet allows you to stay connected with friends. After camp, I would always say ""oh we will keep in touch,"" but I never would be able to keep any promise. Once I found an instant messager or webcam application on the internet, it was very convenient to talk to my friends. Every once in a while I talk to my friend who now lives in @LOCATION1! Also, my dad is always stressed about meetings with other countries, but now that he can use webcams to talk to his other international bosses, he is so excited about his meetings. He always says that the computers nowadays are very easy to use for talking to people. In conclusion, I firmly believe that computers are a great benefit to the world because they help with hand - eye coordination, make it easy to get information, and facilitate communication with people."
1717	1721	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, I firmly believe that computers are extremely good for society. One significant reason is that kids often can't write a @NUM1 - page essay by hand. They will opt to use a computer because it is much easier. People use computers every day, whether it's for talking with friends, playing games, or conducting business. I personally don't use a computer that frequently; I mainly use it to check my email and do school work. But that doesn't mean that people don't need them. People get exercise even when they don't realize it, like when they are walking. So, they are not completely sedentary. I truly believe that computers are not bad; instead, they can be very helpful, especially for research projects. For example, if you don't feel like rummaging through books to find information, you could go on a computer and look up something. You could have the information at your fingertips in no time. Why are people so overly concerned about what we @CAPS4 with our time? We do exercise. We exercise at school, when we walk home, when we walk our dog, or take out the trash. Another great aspect about computers is that you can engage in video chat, a live video channel that allows you to hear, talk, and see the person. This is extremely useful because if a parent is away on business, you can see them and talk to them. I have used it to talk to friends as well. Computers are also a great asset because of the programs that come with them, such as Word, Excel, @CAPS2, @CAPS3, etc. They help you write essays, @CAPS4 grades, create charts, etc. Without computers, we would have to do all these tasks by hand, and the results wouldn't be neat; they would be messy. Computers also exercise your mind. The last reason why computers are so great is the internet. Everything is on the internet. If you want to shop, you can do it without leaving the comfort of your home. If you want to play games, watch videos, chat with friends, post pictures, or post videos, you can do it all. I could go on, but I won't. All I hope is that you, the @CAPS1, got my point. Computers are not bad for you, and that's a fact. Kids love them, and adults do too. Just think, if you took computers away from children and adults, how would kids @CAPS4, how would adults conduct business? Think about what you would do to the world without the use of computers. Hey, how would you @CAPS4 your newspaper without a computer? Think about what kind of world it would be like. People don't realize that we need computers, and they need us.
1718	1722	1	3	Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1, many people are actively talking about computers and what impact it has on us. A lot of people believe that using the computer is a waste of time. However, I firmly believe that computers aren't a bad thing at all. Using the computers can help us gain in - depth knowledge about other places in the world. It can also vividly show us the lives of people from the past. We can also conveniently talk to our friends online. If you want to know why computers are useful, just keep on reading. People say that computers waste our lives. I completely disagree with that opinion. The internet is an outstanding way to learn about different places in the world. We can learn about the unique climate of a place. The diverse animals and the specific food they eat. Different @CAPS1 places have distinct types of culture. For example, in @LOCATION3, everyone has a penchant for seafood. In @LOCATION2, everyone loves spicy food. The internet can present us with pictures of beautiful places that we have never seen before. It's a wonderful way to see and learn about different places compared to how we live. Do you have a friend that you haven't seen in a long time? Would you like to be in contact with that person again? Well, the internet is an excellent way to achieve this. It allows you to create an account on platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, @NUM1 and more. You can search up your friend's name, and like magic! You finally have the chance to talk to your old pal again. You would be absolutely thrilled to be able to talk with them again. Many @CAPS1 kids use the computer in order to do their history projects. Well, the internet is here to lend a helping hand. You can search up famous people from the past or people from nowadays. The internet enables you to see and learn about these people's past. One prime example is @LOCATION1. He was the first president of the @ORGANIZATION1. You can learn so much about him, like where he was born, how many @CAPS1 family relatives did he have, and more. So, you see, the internet is a highly useful tool for kids. These are my reasons for believing that computers aren't bad. We still have ample time for family, friends, and any fun outdoor activity. We can learn about different places in the world. We can talk to friends online, and we can learn about people from the past. In conclusion, computers are a valuable asset that enriches our lives in multiple ways.
1719	1723	1	3	Dear newspaper, @CAPS1, do you think that computers have a bad effect on people today? I know I don't. Over @PERCENT1 of people today own a computer. On a computer, you can discover great things about a place and people. If you don't have the best handwriting, then you can type on the computer, and it can also help you look stuff up. Do you want to look up your favorite hockey player? Instead of going to the library and hoping that there's a book on him, you can simply @ORGANIZATION1 his name, and hundreds of different websites will appear. That will save a lot of your time and it will also save you a lot of money. If you go on a family trip each year to the same place and you need a change, then you can look up another place online that @MONTH1 has the same features but it @MONTH1 be way closer than going to @LOCATION1 each year. So, if you have a computer, then you can look up places you @MONTH1 want to travel to or look up cool facts about your future sport player. If you have messy handwriting and it's getting harder and harder for your teacher to read, then you can just learn how to type it up on the computer. At least @PERCENT2 of students in schools today are getting zero on homework or tests because their teacher can't read their handwriting. If you type it up on a computer, then you can correct spelling or grammar errors as you go. You can also add pictures, adjust sizes and colors, which will make your grade higher as you put a little more work into it. So, to all the people who think that computers don't help anyone, here are the reasons why computers can be really helpful. Computers can help kids find something or can help them access information. You can also find videos about your favorite player or about your favorite hockey players, even get warnings about the playoffs. You can find all sorts of good stuff online. You can find your favorite song for your cellphone. Over @PERCENT3 of people get the song from the computer. Also, the computer can play your favorite song. For example, if your favorite band was Dropkick Murphys, then you can @ORGANIZATION1 and you will find all of their songs. A lot of people think that computers are not good for us. But, I say they are wrong. You can find information about your future role models. If you have messy handwriting, then you can go and type it up. Lastly, you can find songs, videos, and much more when you browse the web. For example, @LOCATION2 might have its very own website. Computers can help kids find information better, especially when your hand - written paper is sloppy. In short, computers are a great resource that offers numerous benefits.
1720	1724	1	3	Dear NewsPaper @CAPS1, Have you ever seriously taken into consideration how much of an impact technology has on our society? Well, for numerous people, computers are an integral part of their lives. They help adults stay in regular contact with their friends. Also, they provide users with a vast amount of useful information about anything you can possibly think of. Computers are truly a great tool to help us with our lives as they help us learn skills that will be beneficial later in life. People who use computers do not spend an excessive amount of time on them; in fact, we need them to live a good life. For example, the internet has many well - known websites that keep people connected. There are countless sites, and to name a few, @CAPS2, @CAPS3, @ORGANIZATION1, the list goes on and on. Many adults begin to realize that childhood friends seem to drift apart as time passes. With computers, you can chat with each other all night long. Additionally, it is also a very convenient way to contact friends if they live in different places around the @LOCATION1. Moreover, computers are brimming with information. If a family wanted to take a vacation, they could use the computer to carefully find a place they would enjoy and easily book a flight there. Also, if a student needed to do a report and was not able to go to the library, he/she would be able to use the computer to get the necessary info for the report. Lastly, if someone had an ailment and didn't know if it was serious enough for a visit to the doctor's office, they could look it up on the internet. There are also many reliable sites for that sole purpose such as @ORGANIZATION2. Lastly, computer users learn valuable skills that those who don't use computers will never acquire. Just knowing how to operate one is an important skill, but there are many features computers have that will be extremely helpful in a job or in college. For instance, making a power - point presentation for jobs or just creating slideshows of a party in your back yard. In addition, typing is a valuable skill that most jobs nowadays require. And using the computer fine - tunes hand - eye coordination. Although some @MONTH1 say that staring at a screen all day isn't healthy, a significant @CAPS5 of @CAPS6.S.A citizens say using the computer is healthy for their social lives and we should use it in moderation. Computers are amazing tools if used properly and in moderation. The time has come to tell the public that computers are useful to society. They enhance social lives, teach us essential skills, and provide us with information on countless topics. People need them to have an enjoyable life. So, write an article regarding the need for the use of computers @DATE1 and notify the people that they are making the right decision by using them. In conclusion, computers are an indispensable part of modern life, and their benefits far outweigh the minor concerns.
1721	1725	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, imagine @CAPS3 a world where nobody has any hand - eye coordination. Whenever @CAPS6 they try to catch a ball, it simply slips away from their grasp. In such a world, there are no friendships and no communication with other countries. Is this really what you want? Computers, in fact, do have positive effects on people. For instance, they help with hand - eye coordination, endow people with the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even enable people to talk online with others. Computers have a positive impact on both people and society. First, hand - eye coordination is not a natural trait for all people. However, it is a well - known fact that you can improve it by using computers. A recent study by Computers @CAPS4 said that computer use helps @PERCENT1 of @CAPS5 with their hand - eye coordination. Take my mom as an example. She used to have extremely poor hand - eye coordination, but now, after regularly using a computer, it has improved significantly. Oprah once said, “When @CAPS6 I was young, I couldn't catch a ball, but now that I'm older and using computers, I'm really good at it.” @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people agree that computers help with hand - eye coordination. Next, computers assist other people in learning about faraway places. For example, if we didn't have computers, people might never travel to @LOCATION1. @PERCENT1 of @CAPS5 agree that they would never travel if it weren't for computers. It's a fact that people use the internet to learn about other countries for educational purposes. The website Www.exploretheworld.org wrote that @PERCENT2 of the people who use the website are students. Clearly, computers help other people learn about far - away places. Finally, computers allow people to talk online. @PERCENT3 of people on Facebook have at least one friend who lives out of this country. It's a fact that countries become better allies when @CAPS6 their people get along. The website Www.internationalfriendships.com wrote that they have over @NUM3 users who talk with people from other countries. For example, my friend's mother was born in @LOCATION2 and she often talks online with many of her friends there. Dr @PERSON1 said, “@CAPS8 friendships are the best kind because you learn about other cultures.” Computers are indeed a wonderful way to communicate with other people. Now, envision @CAPS3 a world where every country gets along because of online friendships. A world where adults can play a game of baseball because they've regained their hand - eye coordination. A world where students can learn about distant places they didn't know existed. Doesn't that sound great? Computers teach hand - eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway people and places, and allow people to talk online. So, @CAPS1 @CAPS2, it's evident that computers do benefit society.
1722	1726	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, have you ever considered that @NUM1 in every @NUM2 @CAPS2 families own a computer? Computers can be quite helpful when you need to write an essay for school. However, when it comes to the choice between family and computer, the average kid will usually opt for the computer. In fact, computers are taking away family time, exercise privileges, and time that should be spent on schoolwork. “@PERSON3, get off the computer and come play '@CAPS3' with us!” Many moms will say this to their children at least once a week. The most common answer they get is “@CAPS5!” These days, children from the ages of @NUM3 to @NUM4 would rather spend time on the computer, whether it's playing games or chatting with friends. This is an issue that definitely needs our attention. Families should start to spend more quality time together instead of just sitting in front of a screen. My friend @PERSON1 has a little brother who is always engrossed in playing games on the computer. Whenever @PERSON1 wants to play hide - and - seek with him, he always finds an excuse to avoid playing and instead continues to play on the computer. Apart from taking away family time, computers also deprive kids of their exercise privileges. For example, last week it snowed and I invited my neighbor @PERSON2 to come outside and have a snowball fight with me. But she said she had to finish a level on a computer game and that it was really important. This clearly shows that computers take away time that could be spent outside exercising. A walk in the park with friends sounds relaxing to most people, except for many teenagers who would rather talk to their friends using a computer instead of actually spending time with them. Lastly, if time is being spent staring at a screen, when does homework get done? I recently conducted a survey among the eighth - grade students, and the results showed that @PERCENT1 of the students who don't do their homework are because they spend too much time on the computer. In my science class, a boy named @CAPS7 never does his homework. I asked him why one day, and he said it was because he was talking to his girlfriend, who also never does her homework because she always has something to do on the computer. Losing time spent with family, missing out on exercise, having less time to play outside, and neglecting homework assignments are a high price to pay for “@CAPS8 one more level.” If you want to help me get children to spend less time on the computer, please write an article on this important issue in one of your newspapers and consider my ideas. By taking action, we can help children have a more balanced and healthy life.
1723	1727	1	3	Do @CAPS1 you want people to be overweight? Do @CAPS1 you want our beautiful outdoors to be ruined? And do @CAPS1 you want families to be distant because they are too @CAPS2? Statistics show that @PERCENT2 of families don't talk because they are too preoccupied with computer games. The issue we need to grapple with is whether @CAPS1 computers have an impact on people. In my view, yes, computers have a negative impact on people, and here are the reasons. People spend too much time on the computer and don't get enough exercise. Statistics indicate that @PERCENT3 of people who are overweight spend more time on the computer than on the track. I remember a time when I was overweight because I spent too much time on the computer. One day, my mom took the computer and threw it out the window, and I had no choice but to go outside and get some exercise. Do @CAPS1 you want kids to be overweight like I was? Many people don't get to enjoy the great outdoors because they are too preoccupied with the computer. Lisa, a volunteer worker in @LOCATION1, says, “This field used to be a vast array of plants and animal life, but now it is a wasteland because of computers. No one had the time to worry about the natural wonder because they were too @CAPS2 with their computer - animated jobs and didn't care what happened to it.” Do @CAPS1 you want this to happen to our country? @PERCENT4 of high - technological places are dirty with very little plant life because the workers need to tend to the computers rather than the bushes. Some families have a hard time talking about their daily lives because they spend too much time on the computer and don't take the time to talk and get to know each other. Statistics show that @PERCENT1 of divorces are related to not being able to have a conversation, and with more technology on the way, that number will likely grow. I remember that my parents got divorced because my dad spent more time on the computer than talking to me or my mom. Most people think that computers are good for research. Yes, but you are still cooped up in the house instead of being in a big library with all the information you need. In conclusion, I firmly believe that computers have a negative impact on people. We should be more aware of these negative effects and try to limit our computer use to lead a healthier and more fulfilling life.
1724	1728	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I've noticed that there is more and more controversy about computers and whether they benefit society or not. In my opinion, computers are a wonderful resource that will soon become a common household item. I am writing to convince you that computers have a positive effect on people. I firmly believe computers are a good thing because they allow people access to more knowledge, enable them to stay in contact with people they don't see very often, and help them keep up with and understand what's going on in modern life. One significant reason computers are useful is that they allow people to stay in contact with those they don't see frequently. Nowadays, parents are less worried about sending their children off to college because they can actually see them using video - chat websites like @ORGANIZATION1. This feature on computers has had a profound impact on people's lives. People in @LOCATION1 can easily talk with people in @LOCATION2. This kind of interaction often allows for the sharing of new and innovative things they've discovered. Another reason computers are useful is that they help people keep in touch with modern life. Many companies are now phasing out newspaper ads and putting them all on computer websites. Some companies are even selling items only on their websites and shipping them to the buyers. With computers, students can also complete their homework and send it to their teachers by email if they can't make it to school that day. There are even at - home colleges now where you can take your classes online. I believe that in a few years, more and more people will conduct business using computers, and more stores will sell only online. Finally, the last reason I think computers are a great idea is that they provide people with access to more knowledge through the internet. There are websites solely dedicated to history and information on various topics. Additionally, there are blogging websites where people can debate information or get their questions answered by real people who, as of @MONTH1, know a lot about the topic. Another useful tool on computers is websites like Wikipedia, where people can search a topic, read its history, and follow links to other websites if they want to explore the topic in more depth. Overall, I am convinced that computers are an excellent resource for humankind and will be used for more and more purposes in the coming years. They are useful because they offer access to more knowledge, the ability to stay in touch with others, and the means to keep up with modern life. I believe that in a couple of years, there will be fewer stores on the streets, and most will be online because it is much more cost - effective for the companies. So, in the future, most people will own computers and use them effectively to enhance their lives.
1725	1729	1	3	Computers have become increasingly advanced over time. They have also gotten smaller and smaller, yet many people still fail to understand the dangers that computers pose to society and their personal lives, such as stress, addiction, and cyberbullying. I am here to discuss how computers are a nuisance in our lives. First and foremost, computers are one of the leading causes of stress in daily life. Approximately four out of every ten stressed people are stressed because of their computers. For example, imagine you're writing an important document or sending an email to your boss about work, and suddenly your computer crashes. How would you feel? Would you be extremely upset? Would you feel like pulling your hair out and throwing that computer out the window? I'm pretty sure you would, as your data is lost, you'll have to restart your computer, and in the worst - case scenario, take it to an electronic store to get it fixed. Another cause of stress is computer hacking. Hacking has unfortunately @CAPS1 become a worldwide “sport.” There are books and instructions on how to hack a computer, and the government can't do much about it since the First Amendment gives people the right to publish what they want (freedom of speech and press). Just look at what happened in @LOCATION1. A computer hacker managed to hack into a system and shut off power to an entire city for about @NUM1 days. Moreover, if someone uploads a virus to your computer, they can steal all of your personal information, like your social security number. These two factors can cause major stress in your daily life. Secondly, people spend an excessive amount of time on the computer at home. A recent survey shows that six out of every ten teenagers spend more than two hours on the computer each day. This makes them less social, meaning they won't spend time with friends, family, or even participate in sports. As a result, they won't get the recommended one - hour of exercise a day. In conclusion, the negative impacts of computers, including stress, reduced social interaction, and lack of exercise, are significant. We should be more aware of these issues and find ways to use computers in a more balanced and healthy manner to avoid these detrimental effects on our lives.
1726	1730	1	3	Many people debate on whether, on net, computers have negative effects on them. Some believe they have negative effects on them, while others believe computers are an asset to society because you can access almost anything. That is the problem. The content on computers is inflicted upon everyone that sees it. Computers also don't help people get healthier, and if you need to research something, books are more helpful than the internet. For starters, the contents on computers and the internet are overwhelming for people and society. What I'm saying is that way too much can be accessed on the internet. Derogatory and pornographic websites harm people, especially children and teens. Chinese government officials have cut off access to these dangerous websites. Chinese readers started saying that the things that are easily accessed on computers are poisoning the minds of the youth. The internet and computers are waiting to explode and invade the minds of everybody. Secondly, computers aren't just mentally but physically unstable also. Computers offer a plethora of games for children to play. These games start off fun but they become habits. Don't get me wrong though, games can be fun, but when a child plays a game for hours a day, there is a problem. The problem is that kids are not getting enough of the exercise they need. Studies performed by educational institutions know that a significant percentage of children who play computer - generated games are overweight. Therefore, I believe games are a harmful habit to young children. Lastly, many people do research on the internet, but some facts are actually inaccurate. What I'm getting at is that no one needs a computer to look up or do research on projects. Instead, go to a library. Many find books boring, but it will help in the long run. I remember a time when I had a project due for a teacher in a certain grade on a specific location. I looked up information on the internet instead of using a book, just to learn that the facts were actually highly inaccurate. Therefore, never depend on the internet as a source of research. From derogatory content, to unhealthy youth, to inaccurate research, computers are not assets to society but issues. In my opinion, I believe computers are actually doing more harm than good to everybody that uses them.
1727	1731	1	3	"Dear Local Newspaper, ""Do people have any viruses in their head?"" They need a miracle to pop up away from the computer. Why I stated that is because it's unhealthy for many people. It's not using time wisely. But most importantly, it can get you into trouble you don't want to be in. Stick around if you want the antidote for the computer virus so people can be cured. OMG!!! My stepfather needs to get off the computer! It's unhealthy the amount of time he spends online. He needs to get up and move around. But instead, he just sits there online every day, eating junk food. Another reason why it's unhealthy is, as you get older, your bones get weaker, and when you're old, you can't move like you used to and want to. Man, just think, if we didn't have a computer, all the time and money people spend on computers can be spent on stuff more useful. For example, a certain number out of another number of people love computers more than life itself. A significant percentage of the world spends their time doing something active instead of being on the computer. ""A computer is nice, but you've got to know that you can't get controlled by it. ALERT! ALERT!!! Sirens are getting closer and closer to my house. I am getting scared because I am online and I'm wondering if I did anything wrong. But it wasn't me who the cops were coming for; it was my next - door neighbor. I guess he was doing illegal stuff online that he had no business doing. See, computers can get you into trouble. For example, I remember when I got into trouble with my parents and they took the computer away from me. Now, you know why computers affect people. How unhealthy it is for many people, why it takes up so much time from people's lives, and all the trouble it puts people through. In conclusion, we should be more aware of the negative impacts of excessive computer use and try to limit our time on it."
1728	1732	1	3	Dear, computers are a major part in everyday life. They are used by just about everybody. There are so many benefits if you know how to use one properly. They help you through everyday life, whether you're trying to find that song that is stuck in your head or trying to file your taxes. Computers are a necessity in every household. They are also a great way to learn. You can look up a question that has been bugging you or you could learn to play a new song on your favorite instrument. Either way, you're learning. So I think that computers definitely have more of a positive effect on society than a negative one. Computers are also a great way to interact with family and friends. Some computers even have built - in cameras that let you hold conversations with peers through the computer while seeing each other. This is great if you have family that lives far away, or you're in a long - distance relationship. Another benefit from the computer is that it is great for organizing things. Whether it's important documents or personal schedules, you can count on your computer to keep it all organized. Some computers also have a built - in calendar that could help you plan out your day. But say you don't know what to do that day. Well, that brings me to my next point. Computers are also great for looking up places. For instance, say you fly to a particular location for the first time on a business meeting and you arrive a few days before the meeting. So maybe you decide to go sightseeing to some of that location's most elegant spots. With a computer, you could look up some spots and be on your way to having a great day. Overall, I think that computers make the world go round. They will never die out, that is why everybody should know how to use one, and if you don't, you should hurry and learn as soon as possible. In a world that is constantly evolving, computers are the key to staying connected, informed, and productive.
1729	1733	1	3	I think that computers are a good benefit for people because those who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people. For example, they teach hand - eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk with other people. My first reason is that important people around the world use computers to have a better future in life. The people that use computers have important jobs. For example, a judge, who uses computers to research legal precedents and manage case files; an engineer, who designs complex structures and systems with the help of computer - aided design software; a lawyer, who drafts legal documents and conducts legal research online; an architect, who creates detailed building plans using computer programs; a scientist, who analyzes data and conducts simulations on computers; an archeologist, who uses computers to document and analyze archaeological findings. This is why I think that computers are helpful for people. My second reason is that computers could be helpful with kids because computers could help kids get better grades at school. It could help develop a smarter brain in many ways. The first way that it could help develop a smarter brain is by reading a lot on the computer. It helps by knowing the meaning of new words. It helps you speak correctly and clearly. That is why I think that computers help develop a smarter brain. My third reason is that it helps adults connect to different places in the world. That could be a hobby for adults who don't have something to do and could have a good time. My conclusion is that with computers, you could have a better life. Computers could help you get a better future, whether it's through career advancement, educational improvement, or social connection.
1730	1734	1	3	Dear Connecticut [Audience], do you like to catch up on your favorite television shows, shop for the latest trends? Or maybe even planning out a get - together with some of your old friends? Well, with today's great technology, you can do that on the computer! I can see that the experts are trying to decide whether or not computers are the healthiest thing that benefits our society, but in my opinion, I think they are great! As you may not know, I am a certain number of years old and have a younger brother of a specific age; we spend a lot of time on the computer, not just for homework. I like to shop online for discounts and sales where I know things are cheaper than in stores. I know my brother likes to go to concerts and buy himself the latest video games. My grandparents are older and don't watch a lot of TV and read the newspaper, so the computer is great for catching up on your favorite TV shows and or the news. With these great pieces of machinery, you can chat up a storm with old friends on Facebook, other social media platforms, and various online communities. A significant percentage of teens these days are shopping by brand names, like well - known fashion brands and designer labels. All of these clothes and designer stuff is everything we want, but half of us don't have the money. If you go on the computer, you can get all of these names and items for less than a certain amount of money compared to a higher price in stores. Computers lower the price of things we want and need. These days, grandparents try to have a decent conversation with their kids or grandchildren but often go back to when they were little. As a grandchild to my grandmother, all she used to talk about was her days going through the Great Depression, but with computers, she got to catch up on the news and now I can sit down with her and have a great conversation. You can also catch up on the shows you are missing when everyone is talking about them in school. The kids won't be missing out! When I was in a particular grade, I got my first Facebook, I thought I was so cool! That specific day, I went to camp and met all these new kids and found out that they all have Facebooks. Now I can keep in touch with them without losing my friendships. You see, I know the scientists or experts are probably smarter than a [Age] year - old girl, but I know that most teenagers and parents have Facebook and say it's great because we connect with people around the world. So I know these experts are going to make the best decision on whether or not computers benefit our society, but please take my ideas into consideration. In conclusion, computers offer numerous benefits in terms of entertainment, shopping, and social connection, and should be recognized for their positive impact on our lives.
1731	1735	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, The issue before us is that some claim people are addicted to computers. However, I firmly believe we are not. In addition to all this, many people can multitask and engage in various activities like hanging out with their family and friends, and most importantly, enjoy life. In a way, computer privileges can be similar to enjoying life. Say if you and your friend have the same computer equipped with a webcam, video messaging, and more. That's a form of enriching life. What I'm trying to say is that you can talk, see each other, and have private conversations. Computers don't always take you away from the important people or things in life. Some computers can be extremely helpful. You can take online courses, learn how to write well - structured essays, learn how to read more effectively, and much more. Computers can be a great success for some people. The only thing that can take you away from having fun with your family and friends is yourself; you can't blame it on a computer. Imagine life without a computer. What would you do? How could you survive? For example, if you were given some homework that you had to do on the computer and there was no way for you to do that project in school, how would you complete it? Some people truly need computers. I think if those who developed new technologies foresaw how excited we'd be about our cool computers, they'd still be happy to introduce so many advancements. Now you can probably clearly see why I think we need computers and how they can sometimes greatly benefit our society.
1732	1736	1	3	@ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS1, can you imagine the kids in the schools that you yourself run not being able to conduct research on computers? Would you be okay with kids not having the option of typing their homework? Do you think the adolescents in @LOCATION2 would want to waste paper because of their messy handwriting and mistakes? I would truly hate to live like that, and I know my peers would whole - heartedly agree. This is just one of many reasons why computers have a positive effect on people. Other reasons include that citizens around the world need an easier way to communicate with each other, and some people have to work at home. I know you as an authority would not want to upset as many people as taking away computers would. First of all, think about the schools that the @ORGANIZATION1 runs. Now picture this: kids turning in eight - page hand - written essays to their teachers, when typing it would have taken just three pages. Imagine those kids the night before, scribbling words away with their cramped hands, trying to write as quickly as possible. These children have no computers, and therefore their teacher will have to take the time to try and comprehend the illegible students' handwriting. I can almost see the kids screaming, their eyes darting around as they struggle to finish their high - priority papers. If there were no computers, then this is what would happen to children. Also, students use computers for research, learning about different parts of the world. As an @ORGANIZATION1, I doubt you @CAPS1 would say that research is a negative affect on school kids. I mean, unless you didn't want them to learn. Secondly, I want you to close your eyes. Think of yourself calling your best friend who lives in @LOCATION1. He does not pick up, so you walk to your clean, shiny black computer. You hear the clickety - clack of the keys as you write him a message, and the wooshing sound that your monitor makes when you press send. It is kind of amazing how advanced our technology is, how you can send a message from @LOCATION2 to @LOCATION1 in a matter of seconds. You couldn't possibly say that all the hard work put into making computers did not have a positive effect, could you? I know that I talk to my friends in @LOCATION3 all the time, but not on the telephone. You see, my family does not have long - distance calling, so if I didn't have a computer, I would never be able to talk to her. I know a lot of my friends have the same issue, and if not, then the time difference between locations makes it hard to call people. Have you ever had this problem? Would you want the effect to be that you couldn't talk to some of your friends anymore? Most importantly, I would like to tell you a story. When @CAPS2 was five, my daddy used to tuck me into bed every night. It was my favorite part of everyday. But then, when I was six, my dad got a job that required him to work late every night. He stopped coming home and tucking me in, and I didn't understand why, being as young as I was. I cried every night for three weeks. After those three weeks, my dad's boss told him that he could work from home... if he had a computer. His work gave him a computer, and he was back to tucking me in every night, and he still does now. If that wasn't a positive effect, then I don't know what is. Many people are able to work from home with computers, which is just another reason why computers are helpful to all citizens around the world. I'm sure you, as an @ORGANIZATION1, need a computer to work. Although I understand why some people oppose computers, I completely and utterly disagree. Computers help people with working, learning, and even communication! People might think computers cost too much, but you can find them in almost any price range. I do agree that citizens should not spend too much time on the computer, but it still has a totally positive effect on people around the world. I know that you, as an @ORGANIZATION1, should agree that computers are essential.
1733	1737	1	3	I whole - heartedly agree with the idea that computers help people. To start with, computers have a positive affect on us. They also give us the ability to learn. Moreover, it allows people to talk online with those from far - away places. So, yes, computers are indeed good for people. First of all, computers do have a positive effect. A computer can give someone the motivation to achieve their goals. Or it will help someone find their lost pet by posting information on relevant platforms. Also, it could help you get a job by allowing you to search for job openings and submit applications online. Plus, you can find a safe home with it through real - estate websites. So, indeed, computers do have a positive effect. You can also gain the ability to learn. This is by providing useful sites for deaf people to learn sign language. Also, you can get detailed information on places you will visit. This will help you learn about different countries' cultures, traditions, and histories. Most importantly, it will assist kids and adults with school work or work - related tasks. This concludes that you can learn a great deal on the computers. The computer also allows you to talk with people far away. This will be extremely handy for families. Also, for people who have hospitalized family members, they can keep in touch easily. Plus, fathers or moms in the military can talk with their kids regularly. Most of all, adopted kids could talk to their birth parents online. Here is another reason why computers are good. This is why I whole - heartedly agree with the benefits of computers. They have a positive affect on people. They give us the ability to learn! Lastly, it allows you to talk to people you love that are far away. So, in conclusion, it is a great benefit for people to use the computers.
1734	1738	1	3	Dear readers, People around the world are starting to use computers more often, but there are also people who don't agree that it benefits society. I'm not one of those people. I firmly agree that this benefits society. One reason why I agree is that sometimes there are teens and even adults that can chat online with their friends if they can't contact them in any other way. Another reason is that in all schools, teachers give their students projects to do over vacation or weekends. For these projects, they can look for information on the computer. The last reason is that computers can give the ability to learn more about things they didn't know before. In my opinion, I whole - heartedly agree with computers benefiting society. Teens, kids, and even adults would like to talk with their friends, so they can get on the computer and chat with them if there's no other way to contact them. It's quite easy. You only have to first get on the computer, then get into a site where you know your friend might be. Next, log in or register if you've never been into that site. Last but not least, look for your friend to start chatting. Teachers always give their students work, for example, like projects. Kids also do projects on weekends or vacation, and so you don't have to go to a library to check out a book. You could always get on the computer and look for the information you need there. Computers give you the ability to learn information you didn't know before. For example, if you're bored and you've got nothing to do, get on the computer and look up information about things like nature, books you're interested in, etc. I agree with computers benefiting society, but not everyone does. The reason why I agree is that kids can chat online with their friends, look up information for projects, and find information they never knew about. What do you think? Am I right or wrong?
1735	1739	1	3	Dear State legislator, @CAPS1, imagine living back a long time ago when there were no computers. The only difference now is that the technology is there but you are not allowed to use it. Do you think your job would be harder? I definitely think that computers are making your job and everyone else's lives easier. With the computer, it teaches hand - eye coordination, gives people the ability to learn about far - away places, and it gives people the ability to talk to each other. I believe the advanced technology of the computer is definitely helping out society. To start, computers are helping many people with their hand - eye coordination. As you know, hand - eye coordination is necessary for a good driver. The statistics that came out from “@CAPS2 drivers.com” show that the rate of accidents has decreased over the past ten years. In fact, it decreased by @PERCENT1. With all the computer games that are available for young kids, it is improving kids' hand - eye coordination from a young age. With games like “@CAPS3”, a majority of kids are riding bikes, skiing, or snowboarding by five years old. All of these activities require very good hand - eye coordination. Lastly, the resources that help with hand - eye coordination are being used to help special - ed students get better at simple tasks at a faster pace. Secondly, the world wide web is teaching people of all ages about places that are located thousands of miles away from their homes. Something that I personally use my computer for is to research a location and find historical facts about it before I go on vacation to that place. The computers in our school have greatly helped our classes in social studies. My teacher @PERSON1 said that he has been grading more strictly often, and the grades are still up by @PERCENT2 on computer and internet research projects. I should also add that using the computers, our school is in regular communication with a school in @LOCATION1. Once a week, we email our pen - pals. The computers have definitely helped my school's curriculum. Finally, computers are letting people of all ages talk to business partners, friends, etc. The social networking sites have kept @PERCENT3 of friends in touch, as found in “@CAPS4 - tech” magazine. I should also add that it has reconnected @PERCENT4 of friends from high school, all due to the computer. Another form of online talking is video chatting, which many people are now using for business meetings instead of spending the money to fly to the location of their meeting. Now, for one day, you should track how many hours you are on the computer for your job. I can bet the number is going to be about @PERCENT5 of the time you are in your office. The computers have assisted with hand - eye coordination, given people the ability to learn about places far away from home, and let people talk to each other online. So, do me a favor, state legislator, realize and come to terms with how much society needs the computer.
1736	1740	1	3	I think computers have a good effect on people. They teach hand - eye coordination, which is a vital skill, give people the ability to learn about faraway places, and allow them to talk online with other people. Computers teach hand - eye coordination. This skill will be used throughout people's lives. Without hand - eye coordination, people will be clumsy. Hand - eye coordination is used in daily activities. When using a computer, you have to look at the screen and type at the same time. For people who do not have good hand - eye coordination, this will be a big help. They will be able to do more things without making mistakes, like hitting a baseball! For kids who want to play sports, this could actually help. They will learn to use their eyes, arms, and hands to their advantage. Computers give people the ability to learn about faraway places. If we did not have this ability, we would not be able to know what is going on around the world. Also, if you have family in a faraway place, you will be able to look online and see what is happening there. If something bad has happened, you will know this and will be able to help them. Also, being able to learn about faraway places will help in school. If you have a report to do on a faraway place, instead of searching through books, you can look on the internet for information. Computers also allow people to talk online with other people. This provides more communication. You will be able to make more friends and better friends. Having the opportunity to talk to people online is great. You can learn about someone, become friends, and hang out a lot. Also, you will become a lot more interactive with people. If you are a shy person, this can help you. You will get used to talking to people, and when you get comfortable, you will talk to them in real life. This will make you gain a lot more friends. This will help you come out of your shell and become a lot more interactive around people. These are three reasons why I think computers are a good thing. They help with hand - eye coordination, give the ability to learn about faraway places, and allow you to talk online with other people. In conclusion, computers bring numerous positive impacts to our lives in these aspects, making them an essential and beneficial tool.
1737	1741	1	3	Dear local newspaper, do you like computers? I do. Computers help you learn about all kinds of things. Plus, computers let you chat with people on their computers even if you can't call them. Another reason why I love computers is that when I have to write a project, I can just type it! Computers make everything easier. So, please consider liking computers. Initially, imagine you have a project due in two days. Your mom can't drive you to the library and you have no information on the subject. But hey, don't you have a computer? You can use the computer to look up your subject, and a variety of different websites will quickly come up on your screen. Most of them will help you learn about the subject, and then you have time to finish it and hang out with your friends. Secondly, oh no! You forgot what page of the book you're supposed to read. Also, you lost all your friends' contacts. Not to fear, the super - duper computer is here. You can email or chat with your friends online and see what pages to read and get their phone numbers back. Did you know that 80% out of 100 people said that the chat & email programs are amazing because they can contact friends, family, and co - workers. Finally, you can type your essay on the computer. Writing a 5 - paragraph essay takes too long, so use your computer to help you out. Go to Microsoft Office and type your essay. Computers make writing an essay really easy. 90% out of 100 people said they like typing on the computer more than writing it on paper. In conclusion, computers are amazing technology when you have to chat with someone. Also, when you learn about something. Another reason why computers are amazing is that you can type essays & papers. So, please change your view of computers being bad to computers making us more efficient!
1738	1742	1	3	To whom it may concern; I am writing this to let you know how I feel about the effects computers have on people. My opinion on this topic is that I think that both statements are true. Yes, they give people the ability to learn about faraway places & people and also allow people to talk online with others. If we did not have computers, I would not have finished many of my school projects and homeworks. However, some experts point out that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. I know this is true because I know some people who have gotten addicted to online video games and wouldn't leave the computer for hours. I also know that I myself have found new websites and want to learn all about it, so I'll be on the computer instead of exercising. But even with both statements being true, I do not think computers have a negative effect on people. Because without computers, a lot more students would be failing classes and getting zeros on projects, class assignments, and homework because they don't have a quick way to look up all their information. Also, most families or friends will lose contact because they lost a fun way to communicate. I think computers have a positive effect. Don't you? In conclusion, despite the potential drawbacks, the overall benefits that computers bring to our learning and communication make them a positive force in our lives.
1739	1743	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I believe that using computers is a good idea and will help people. So many people all over the world have computers. Computers are good because they help kids learn, communicate with others, and help teach responsibility. Please just listen to what I have to say. First, I believe that computers help kids learn. If you buy computer games like a cooking game, you can learn how to cook. Even if you buy a virtual pet, you are still learning by taking care of it. There are so many good websites that you can go on like National Geographic Kids. People learn through playing new things, and why not play with your favorite characters. Also, you can go on Google and type in anything you want, and it will give you the answer. You use a keyboard for all this, so you also learn how to type. If your teacher gives you a homework assignment, why not type it so you learn that skill. This is why computers are good for helping kids learn. Secondly, you can communicate with others from around the world or just your friends. There is a thing called Skype or Zoom. You use a webcam and talk to anyone you want. There are also websites you can go on to communicate with people from all around the world. It is pretty cool because you don't have to travel there to talk to them. All of this stuff teaches you how people are different and no one person is the same. People's language could be different or their personality. So many communicating things make computers even better. Lastly, using computers helps teach responsibility. Kids who use the internet know that people need privacy, and that comes with responsibility because you should know that. If someone doesn't want to be bothered, then don't bother them. That has to do with privacy. Also, you learn to be nice on computers. If you video - chatted, you should definitely know to be nice and not be rude. That is how you get kicked off of these things. Another thing is that people learn to take care of things. A computer is worth a lot of money. Not everyone has one, so you should be thankful for what you have. Don't brag, but just know you are privileged to have a computer. These things are the reasons computers are good. So, if you ever consider getting a computer, the answer is yes because computers help kids learn, you can communicate with others, and you learn responsibility. Now you know computers are really good for kids, not that bad. In conclusion, computers offer multiple advantages for kids in learning, communication, and character - building, making them a valuable addition to a child's life.
1740	1744	1	3	"Dear Local newspaper, do you have a computer at home that you enjoy? Computers are a big thing now in life. They help with many things, such as staying organized, studies, and even entertainment. These are the three topics I will focus on because I truly believe that computers are useful and people use them as a help to make life a lot easier. Let me start by saying: ""I am a man who enjoys computers, as a way to talk to friends, listen and search for music, watch videos on YouTube, get school work done, and much more! Although, one main point is that it helps me stay organized. I can make many folders to store my work in, rather than losing or spilling something on the paper if I wrote it out. I can have my music, homework, projects, chores, videos, pictures, and much more saved and organized so I know where it is every time I go to find it. There can be no more, ""my dog ate my homework"" excuse. Moving on to the next topic. As I mentioned, you can save work onto your computer, and you can add without erasing as well. The work becomes neat and perfect every time. So when your teacher is grading on neatness, no need to worry. You can also look up information on any topic you are working on in class, which allows you to get more information, and the better the grade. Spelling is not a factor now because your computer tells you when a word is spelt wrong. It even gives you suggestions on how to spell the word by underlining it with a red squiggly line. This really helps because a lot of people have a hard time with spelling. You can even get text - to - speech software to play a book you are reading, which helps you learn new words that you might not have known how to sound out. Teachers can even post notes on school websites about homework and when projects are due. No more, ""I didn't know/remember what was homework/project due."" Lastly, entertainment is the biggest thing with computers. People go on every day uploading videos, pictures, blogs, and just about whatever they want. Games are played on computers by younger kids who are just learning, while older kids are enjoying playing maze, driving, shooting, adventure, and much more types of games. Just about everyone using a computer knows of some chat website in which they use to communicate with anyone. Myspace, Facebook, Twitter, and so much more are used by people to talk, express how they feel to everyone (or just let it out), show love to someone, send birthday wishes, and do whatever. Those are endless possibilities for entertainment on a computer. Without a doubt, no more, ""I'm bored"". Do you use your computer to do anything like this? If so, you must enjoy it. People use computers for everything from work to expressing feelings. Now, what side are you on? In conclusion, computers play a multi - faceted and crucial role in our lives, from keeping us organized to enhancing our studies and providing entertainment, making them an indispensable part of modern life."
1741	1745	1	3	Dear local newspaper, A few decades ago, computers didn't exist, but now many people have internet access in their homes. However, to some, the effect it's having on people is negative. Nevertheless, I believe that computers have a positive effect on people in many ways. For instance, the internet allows people to keep in touch, equips them with technology skills to prepare them for more hi - tech jobs, and enables them to find and learn about new things. Don't you think computers help society? People live in all corners of the world, and those who are fortunate get to meet a lot of people from different places in the country. But, making long - distance calls on the phone can be inconvenient; so with a computer, people don't have to lose touch! It's quite easy for people to talk with others from anywhere without having to actually see them. Computers are an easy way to stay in touch with family, too. Therefore, people can talk to their distant relatives from all over without even having to visit them. Having a computer helps people to keep distant friends and family closely in touch. Let's face it, the world is relying more and more on technology and computers. But, if young people start using computers earlier in life, it will make it easier for them to get a better job. Lots of jobs require technological skills in order to be hired; so having a computer when younger automatically prepares young adults for life. Besides that, there is a computer in just about every up - to - date workplace, such as restaurants, hotels, retail stores, and even in the construction business. Nevertheless, computer skills aren't just a good skill to have; they are a necessary skill. Last, computers are a faster and easier way to find new things and learn more about different topics. Instead of painstakingly looking through various books and encyclopedias for researching, why not search the topic? Although the computer and internet shouldn't completely replace books, it is a valuable researching tool. Someone who has never been to the pyramids could easily just research the pyramids and see amazing pictures, ancient history about them, and learn so much. Computers can help you learn so much about the world without having to leave your house. Now is the time to make your decision on whether or not you think computers are having a positive effect on people. Considering the reasons of keeping in touch, acquiring skills, and learning new things, it's clear that computers bring many positive impacts to our lives.
1742	1746	1	3	"Computers can take up a significant amount of a person's time, but there are also numerous benefits to having one. You could gain an abundance of knowledge and make interaction with others a breeze with just a click of the cursor. The computer is truly an incredibly smart device. All the facts of life and the world are stored within it. Think of all the knowledge you would acquire from reading articles you find on google.com and all the other search engines. Wondering what is the best way to get somewhere? You can also look at detailed maps of the whole world and zoom all the way to a bird's - eye view. There's your personalized map with just a click of the cursor. Does your child have a question from school that even you can't answer? There are dedicated help sites that can show and explain how to do your homework. Or if your child doesn't know what the homework is and their friends are busy and can't tell them, most schools have comprehensive websites with information about everything in school. There's your child's grades with just a click of the cursor. You're late for a party and you don't have a cell phone, but your family has one computer and you know your friend will be on. You can just log on to your facebook, twitter, or myspace and quickly tell them you're running late. It's the digital age, no one writes letters anymore; there's e - mail and instant messaging. Letters take a long time to write and if you make a mistake, you have to start over. When you type, all you do is hit ""backspace"" and you can write over only your mistake. Letters also take a long time to receive, while instant messages come, well, instantly! Haven't seen your cousin or just want to see them? Computers are increasingly being made with webcams, or you can simply buy a detached one. You could be having a face - to - face conversation with your friend and seeing them right on your computer just with a click of the cursor. Don't think that's enough? If you explore the computer further, then you'll find it can help you with a lot more than just learning and interaction, making it an indispensable part of modern life."
1743	1747	1	3	Dear local Newspaper, I think computer technology is good. I believe there are many good effects of computers. I think the computer teaches us to work alone without anyone's help. Another good effect of the computer is that we can talk to friends online. Also, it gives us the ability to learn about it and surf the web. Additionally, it improves our hand - eye coordination. All of these are the reasons why I think the computer has good effects. My first point, why I think there are good effects of the computer, is that we can do work by ourselves without anyone's help. My first reason for this is that after looking up useful links on it and getting familiar with the process, doing homework would be easier. Also, it will help you gather more information for your homework and you can get a better grade. Another reason is that when you work alone on the web, you can get the work done faster. My second point about the good effects is that you can go online and talk to friends. My first reason for thinking this is that if you don't have a cell phone and you want to talk to friends, you can go online. Another reason it is good is that if you can't do something and are in a bind, you can tell the person that you can't. Also, it is good because you can talk to relatives you haven't seen. My last two points are that it gives good hand - eye coordination and we can learn to surf the web. It gives us good hand - eye coordination because we learn how to use our hands and fingers more dexterously and quickly. Also, it gets us away from the limitations of traditional typing. You can learn to surf the web because after a while, you will know where everything is and become quite proficient at it. Lastly, you will be able to find everything you look for. In conclusion, these are indeed good effects. The computer teaches us how to type, search on the web, and learn about it. As you can see, these are the reasons I firmly believe it has a good effect on us.
1744	1748	1	3	Dear local newspaper: I strongly feel that computer technology has a negative impact on the people of our society. People in our society are spending too much time on computers and not enough time exercising and interacting with family and friends. By starting now, we can make a difference in the lives of thousands. First off, I would like to say that it is extremely important that we exercise daily. If we don't fit exercise into our day - to - day schedule, we are potentially putting our health at risk. Activities such as taking a dog for a leisurely walk, riding a bike through the neighborhood, or taking a nice jog through the park are just a few ways to help improve your physical fitness. Also, taking part in extracurricular activities can play a major role in exercise. This not only helps physically, but it helps mentally too, as it can relieve stress and boost your mood. Finally, another method of exercising is to participate in your local community service projects, like cleaning up a park or helping at a food bank. Exercising every day is just one way to keep you active and off the computer. Lastly, interacting with family and friends can help you stay off the computer. Playing board games or card games is one way that can help you stay connected with your family. This can bring you closer to the people you love and help them get to know you a little better. Furthermore, you can play outdoor games with your friends, and in the process, develop important social skills. Who knows, developing social skills could open up new opportunities in the future. Plus, by interacting with family and friends, you can learn to relax and let your life take its natural course. This is another helpful technique that can improve the quality of your life and keep you from the temptation of being on the computer. In conclusion, techniques like exercising and interacting with family and friends can help you stay off the computer. By working together and trying these methods, the excessive use of the computer can be reduced from our daily routines, leading to a healthier and more fulfilling life.
1745	1749	1	3	Dear newspaper, I think that computers are great for researching things like for a car or searching for people, places, and things. Social media platforms are great because you can keep in touch with your family and friends. Like you can email them, have webcam chats, and instant message them. I think a lot of people should get involved with social media platforms because you can do a wide variety of things on them. You can save your pictures, download music, and play games. People say that some people spend too much time on the social media platforms. Well, I think they should because they can learn new and different things about different countries, cities, or even states. I don't think there is anything wrong with spending time on a social media platform. In fact, these platforms offer a wealth of knowledge and a means to stay connected, which are valuable in our modern world. So, we should embrace the opportunities they provide and make the most of them.
1746	1750	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, People all around the globe are using computers! Some people think this is a bad idea but I disagree. I firmly believe that computers do have a positive effect on a person's life style. Computers help people stay in touch, computers are only getting better and they help kids in many ways. Computers definitely help people keep in touch. There is Skype, myspace, twitter, facebook, email, and even video chat. For example, my cousin is in Australia and sometimes we will go on the computer and talk to him on video chat. Without this, we would have no communication with him. Many people around the world use computers to communicate. This is how people use computers to stay in touch. Also, computers are amazing now and they're only going to get better. If computers are so great now, just imagine what they will be like in 10 or 20 years. Plus, the more people buy and use computers the more companies are going to want to invent new ones. As you can see computers are only going to get better. The last reason I would like to share with you today is that computers help kids tremendously. On average, about 80% of kids in the U.S. use a computer every day. Kids use it to talk to friends, play games, do homework and to do many other things as well. Also, kids and adults just use computers if they need to know how to do something or even find places in their town. This is how kids are helped out by computers. As you can clearly see, computers are used all around the world for many different reasons. They help to stay in touch, they're only going to improve, and they help kids. Everyone is using computers, shouldn't you? In conclusion, computers have become an indispensable part of our lives, bringing numerous benefits that enhance our daily experiences.
1747	1751	1	3	Dear local newspaper, I strongly believe that computers don't benefit society as much as people think. I think that nature can provide all of the same qualities that any computer can. A computer can not provide fitness, real interactions with friends or family, or experience in the real world. Did you know that 30% of children in the United States are overweight because of a lack of exercising? According to Dr. Smith, a well - known pediatrician and member of the American Health Association, computer systems are the leading cause of a lack of exercise. So why would a system that leads to obesity be considered a benefit to society? Another thing on that topic is that overweight children that spend 4 hours a day put off healthy activities such as basketball or tennis which also leaves them socially behind and lacking the healthy experiences which leads me to my next point. People think that computers know everything, but the truth is that there are very few things you can experience on a computer. For example, you may read about World War II but can you really know what people were thinking or what the combat felt like? A computer can not teach you how to feel only a real - life experience can do so. Many if you were deployed to an army base in Iraq. You would know what it's like to be in war. but playing a game or reading an article don't provide experience. My final explanation for how computers are not the greatest affect on society is true - life interactions with your family and friends. There is only one true way to see family or friends and that is personally. People claim that they talk to their friends and family over the internet all the time but the only way to be satisfied is by seeing them for real for example a romantic relationship would fail if the only way they communicated was through the internet. Unlike most relationships that succeed. I hope my letter to your newspaper will get people's attention, I would appreciate it if you joined my cause and help protect society from dangerous computer technology that could cause, obesity, bad relations, and inexperience. In conclusion, we should be more cautious about the over - reliance on computers and seek more real - life experiences and interactions.
1748	1752	1	3	"Computers are great technology, but they have a terrible impact on people's lives! Computers cause children to fail and lose their exercise. The children also put themselves in danger by joining a few different websites. Don't waste your time in front of a boring computer screen! I am almost 90% positive that the students who are doing poorly in school, are the students who go home, throw their backpacks in the hallway, and start playing silly games online. My mom used to go on and on about how my dad spends too much time on Facebook, when he would only go on 15 minutes a day to talk to family members. Now, my mom created a Facebook account that she said she was only going to use to talk with the family, but she plays all the pointless applications, such as, ""cafe world."" She wastes her time on Facebook whenever she is home, when she could be going out and spending quality time with the family or out with friends. Something I haven't mentioned is, I used to be one of those students who come home, throw their stuff in the hallways, and turn on the computer, the only difference is I didn't go online to play games, I would go on to talk to my friends I just saw! I realized after I got my report card that my grades were horrifyingly terrible. My dad then disconnected my Wi - Fi, and I believe my grades have gone up. At first I hated my dad for disconnecting the Wi - Fi, but now I want to thank him for breaking a disappointing hobby of being online whenever I'm home. He also mentioned to my sister how much exercise she was losing all because she wanted to play online. In a lot of ways, computers are pointless! Do you know how dangerous some websites can be? I once watched a television show at my aunt's house, and an old creepy guy started a website where the teens had to video tape themselves choking themselves and whoever did it the longest won. About a hundred students died from playing the deadly game. There's also a website, ""blogtv.com."" where teens go online and go live on a webcam where anyone can watch them. I remember there was a week when my cousin, Denise, and her best friend wanted to see who can get more viewers. The two girls did inappropriate things on the web - shows such as, flashing, dirty dancing, and showing body parts. The two girls were then banned from the website, but this was after people had screen - shoted them and posted pictures of the girls. This should not be allowed for anyone to do, it's disturbing! Stop wasting your life people! Go out and have fun, don't let the computer keep you home. The computer is unsafe and pointless. In conclusion, we need to be more aware of the negative impacts of computers and make better choices about our time spent on them."
1749	1753	1	3	To whom it may concern, Have you ever thought about how many hours a day you spend on the computer? Too many is my guess! They are warping the minds of people all over, and in my opinion things should go back to the way they used to be. Some people may disagree, and say that computers help children who are in school. That may be true, but honestly only a couple of decades ago the average student didn't even own a computer, and schools were teaching the same materials without the usage of them. Also, some children use computers to cheat on homework assignments and essays, and I'm sure many people would agree that that is not helping education for schools. Another reason computers may not benefit society is because of the dangers of them. Sexual predators swarm the internet, and many people talk to strangers over the internet that may be harmful, without even realizing it. A third reason computers may not help society is that they can create a sense of isolation. As you can see, I feel very strongly about the negative effects that computers have on society, for many reasons. I hope you can agree with me. In conclusion, we should carefully evaluate the role of computers in our lives and take steps to mitigate their negative impacts.
1750	1754	1	3	"Dear Local Newspaper, As the men and women who write every day for a living, I would like you to write a reaction on computers. They teach us about faraway places, help build hand - eye coordination, and let us talk online. Computers are part of everyday life and need to be told about. First, computers let us learn about faraway places without leaving the rooms. One of my mom's friends, she decided to move to Japan. She didn't like computers so she didn't look at Japan's laws, saying, ""I'll find out when I get there."" Unfortunately, when she did find out the laws she didn't find enough because she was arrested multiple times in her first few years. A few months after her last arrest she came back to the United States where she could deal with the laws. Japan is a beautiful country and all of her arrests were accidents because she didn't know the laws. Ten minutes on a computer searching the laws in Japan could have kept her in a better situation. Next, computers improve hand - eye coordination. From a survey, 70% of children that spend more time on computers are better at tennis, and at baseball then others. Mr. Johnson, a gym teacher at the local high school says, ""A lot of these kids that spend time on the computer are weak and need to get some exercise."" Dear local newspaper: As you being the local newspaper, you have the power to say how you feel about the effects computers give to people. I believe that computers give great effects to people because it teaches hand - eye coordination, gives people the ability to learn about far away places, and it allows you to talk to people. In all, 85% of people agree with my idea about computers. Firstly, using computers teaches people about hand - eye coordination. For example, my grandmother told me that she knows how to use her hands and eyes well because of using the computer. This is because she types and researches information all day long. In all, computers are designed to help your eyes and hands to focus more. Secondly, computers have a lot of interesting information on faraway places. Dr. Brown from the International Research Institute quotes, ""I always use computers for my work because it helps me learn about many new things. Moreover, it lets my wife and I search details about a trip we want to go on."" Moreover, the people agree with what Dr. Brown stated. However, people may say that computers give the wrong information many times, but if you find a wonderful website, it will never lie to you. Thirdly, if you use computers it will let you talk online or video chat with friends or family all over the world. How this benefits you is because if you have not seen your relatives in ages and you cannot buy a ticket to visit them, then video chat. It has gotten people so much closer and you see the world in a whole different way. Moreover, instead of wasting all your cell phone minutes, go buy a laptop or computer with a camera on it so you can video chat. Lastly, taking to people and being active in other people's life is important. In conclusion, computers offer a wide range of benefits that enhance our knowledge, skills, and social connections, making them an essential part of modern life."
1751	1755	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper, Computers are used every single day by millions of people across the globe. I firmly believe that the technology of computers has a positive effect on people. I think computers have a positive effect on people because people use them for in - depth research. People can use computers to communicate with people far away in an instant. Computers are even used as a reliable news resource. In my opinion, computers make things a whole lot easier. Computers have a positive effect on people because they are extremely helpful. You can use computers to research different things thoroughly. If you have a computer, you can learn new and interesting things about places you never knew existed. For example, if you have a homework assignment, you don't have to painstakingly use a book to get information; you can just use your computer. So, for those reasons, I think computers have a positive effect on people. Computers are always being used for several useful things. However, I think people use computers the most for communication. On a computer, you can communicate with friends and family members that live in other states effortlessly. Instead of sending letters to people by mail, nowadays people use e - mails and instant messages. You can talk to people faster this way and it's much more convenient. Computers have a positive effect on people. It makes some things in life much more straightforward. I don't understand why they would have a negative effect on people. It's the year @DATE1, and computers are used for basically everything. Remember how we used to have to read the newspaper to find out about breaking news and important things? Well, since we have computers, a lot of people don't read newspapers. On the computer, you can read the whole newspaper, and even find out more detailed information about things that happen in our world. So what's the point of even reading the newspaper if you have a computer? I believe computers have a positive effect on people's lives because you can do almost anything on the computer. You can research information, communicate with people, and use it as a news resource. Doesn't that make life a lot easier? So why do some people think computers have a negative effect on people? In conclusion, the benefits of computers are evident, and they clearly bring positive changes to our lives.
1752	1756	1	3	"Dear Local Newspaper, Using your computer daily can be a real waste of your life. Your computer time can take away from your time spent exercising and truly enjoying nature. It can distract you from human - nature things such as face - to - face communicating, and can also waste tons of precious energy. Picture yourself, sitting at your desk, talking to some friends online. Take away your computer and all you're doing is sitting there, not burning one single calorie, or exercising one muscle, except your fingers of course. Don't you think you should be doing something more useful in your life? Such as taking a nice walk and enjoying the beauty of nature? That's what I thought. Nature is incredibly beautiful. So why enjoy it only through a window next to your desk? Obesity is a serious problem in @LOCATION1. @PERCENT1 of @CAPS3 are considered ""fat"". Why would you even think about spending your day simply sitting in a chair? Go to the gym and lose some of that extra body weight! Communicating through @CAPS5's is so over - rated. People can't fully express their emotions! All they can do is send a smiley face or a happy face. Communication with only your friends can cause you to miss out on important things. For example, let's say there is a cancelation at your work place on the news, but you don't see it because you were chatting with your friend. Chatting? @PERCENT2 of people don't even ""laugh out loud"" when they send that to their friends. Plus, you might even go to your friend's house and instead of really laughing, you'll just say LOL. Instead of gasping, you say, ""OMG!"" I mean come on people, get out and really ""communicate"". So, you bought one of those new energy - saving lights? Too bad you're not even saving any energy by using that computer of yours daily. Using that computer uses about the same amount of energy in as @NUM1 regular light bulbs in @NUM2 hours. Is that light really saving you that much money? Haven't you heard? The economy is bad, which means we don't have a lot of money. Which means YOU playing online games is wasting energy, which is wasting money. Somebody is going to have to work overtime this week, and it's not me. I don't think hair spray is the cause of the ozone layer being destroyed... Computers are bad, and don't have a good enough reason to be used. They take away the joy of enjoying nature, reduce your communication levels, and not to mention, waste a lot of energy. Therefore, it's clear that the negative impacts of computers far outweigh any potential benefits."
1753	1757	1	3	"I believe the reason why people use the computer so much is because most people might have to work on the computer for their jobs or maybe even finish an important project. But I understand the part when the article said ""Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising"". Mostly young teens start using the computer at an early age and quickly become hooked. This is because there are so many interesting things to do on the computer, like downloading games for free and playing with other players from all around the world. But you would think that anybody would play video games on the computer and still have free time? NO! Most adults don't play games on the computer. They use it to do work or research an article. After that, they'll continue with their daily routine. But a lot of teens are on the computer every single day and rarely get any exercise. The internet has opened up a lot of new and enhanced technology. Over the past few years, you could search up old friends from maybe an old school on the web or even chat with people who you don't know from all over the world. You could have an @NUM1 @CAPS1 and buy new songs or new albums instead of going to a local store. You can even shop online and have the clothes brought directly to you. Over the years, people would have never been able to do that. You can also rent movies or buy them to have on your @CAPS2. In conclusion, while computers offer many conveniences, the excessive use by teens and its impact on exercise is a concern that needs to be addressed."
1754	1758	1	3	"Dear local newspaper, On a beautiful sunny day, people are inside on their computers instead of going outside and enjoying the wonderful weather. This is what could happen if people are overly using them. I believe that computers have a bad effect on people because their communication skills will drop significantly, people won't get enough exercise, and their health can be impaired. As I mentioned, everyone who is using a computer on a daily basis will see a decline in their communication skills. People enter chat rooms not knowing who they are really talking to. For example, if I logged onto a chat room, someone might ask for personal information such as where you live, your phone number, and your name. This could lead to serious things such as kidnapping and even rape. Also, interactions with family members and friends will surely decrease. You can be playing a computer game, online, or going on YouTube to watch random videos of people. YouTube is said to be a dangerous site for younger children. Kids could go under history to go to a website they were recently on and click the wrong one, bringing them to an inappropriate website. Finally, teenagers and adults go onto Facebook and Twitter. Some might say these sites can change the social interactions, but it really isn't a positive change. Kids and adults are constantly getting addicted to it. Also, telling people what you are doing every single moment of your day every day is kind of unrealistic. People don't need to know when you do things in your day. If we don't keep up our communication skills, they are sure to decrease. Secondly, exercise is a big problem. Doctors say that @PERCENT1 of their patients are obese or overweight according to @ORGANIZATION1. Kids just sit at home and play computer games such as Sims @NUM1 and video - chat with their friends instead of hanging out with them in person. No one really goes for walks anymore either. Also, people don't go out and enjoy nature like they used to. @PERSON1, a state @LOCATION1 from @LOCATION1 in @LOCATION2 said, ""Each year the number of people going out to enjoy nature is getting fewer and fewer. Pretty soon all parks are going to have to get closed down."" Don't you want this to happen, do you? I know I would not. Our generations are just becoming more technology - enhanced. Finally, more and more people are becoming unhealthy. A person's eyesight is most likely to drop if they are on the computer every day. My aunt is required to use her computer every day at work. She went to her eye doctor because her vision was becoming weaker. One of the first questions he asked was, do you use a computer on a daily basis? She answered yes. He said she would need cataracts eye surgery. This was all in result of using a computer. Finally, you could get arthritis in your hands and fingers from typing and using the mouse all the time. Many people at the age of forty are probably going to need hand surgeries from all the work they do. As you can see, technology is harming your communication skills, exercise, and your health. I bet you don't want your future generations to be like this. So take a stand and contact your local newspaper today to raise awareness about these issues."
1755	1759	1	3	Dear @CAPS1, I believe that computers have a negative affect on people's lives. Computers occupy a large amount of people's time which could be used for other, more meaningful matters. The internet also contains a lot of inappropriate content that children should not be viewing. But above all, there are too many pedophiles online preying on young children. These are all ways that computers have a negative affect on people's lives. Computers occupy so much valuable time that could be used for other, more important matters. The childhood obesity rate in America is climbing steadily. There is no doubt that electronics, especially computers, play a huge role in this event. For example, my brother plays on the computer every single day, so he barely goes outside. He has allowed the computer and the internet to take over his life, leaving no room for anything else. Also, there is a lot of inappropriate content on the internet. Ranging from a song to websites containing pornography. Most sites don't even alert you that you need to be @NUM1 or older to view the content, and very little actually asks for proof. There are millions of sites containing such content. It really is a pressing matter and needs to be dealt with seriously. Above all else, there are millions of creeps on the internet, preying on children as young teens. It's truly disgusting. There are millions of chat sites in which people can meet and interact. Pedophiles go on these websites under an alias, pretending to be teens and children. Their motive is to lure young teens into meeting them in a so - called secure location, and to commit rape. Some victims are brave enough to speak up but sadly, most are too afraid or ashamed to do so. This is all made possible through the internet. For these reasons, I say that computers have a negative effect on people's lives. Although there are some positive aspects, sadly the cons outweigh the pros such as the occupation of time and the inappropriate content on the internet. I truly believe that the planet would be better without the over - use of computers. In conclusion, the negative impacts of computers on children's safety, health, and well - being are significant, and steps should be taken to mitigate these issues.
1756	1760	1	3	I think we can all agree that computer usage is a very controversial issue. In my opinion, I firmly believe that computers have a negative effect on people. For instance, it's not safe, and children can easily get into all sorts of inappropriate things on the internet. Also, nowadays, people spend an excessive amount of time in front of the computer. In fact, it's a major distraction and has a negative effect on kids' schoolwork. It's now or never! Do we decide that computers have a negative effect? You decide! Isn't every parent's biggest concern the safety of their children? When on the internet, kids are capable of accessing anything and everything. Sometimes kids don't even look for bad things, they just pop up unexpectedly. Would you want your child viewing things that you have no control over? Also, websites like @CAPS2.com are one of the greatest concerns when it comes to internet safety. Although you are supposed to be at least @NUM1 to have a @CAPS2, most kids lie about their age. Did you know that @NUM2 out of @NUM3 @CAPS2 users lie about their age? And it's not always a @NUM4 year - old saying they are @NUM1, it could be a @NUM6 year - old saying they're @NUM7! Not only do people lie about their age, they lie about who they are. Is this the kind of internet exposure you want for your children? Put a stop to this right now! More than @PERCENT1 of @CAPS3 are overweight and unhealthy. This is another negative effect computers have on people. It's a gorgeous @DATE1 day. Bright blue skies, cotton - candy clouds, the sun is shining brightly, and there's a nice warm breeze. Perfect day to go out and get active, right? Wrong! Most people would rather be inside on the computer. Instead of going for a walk, people would rather spend hours on Facebook. This is a serious concern for our health. People don't exercise enough as it is, and then when you add computers, people will never get active! Instead of playing video games online, people need to be reminded that turning off the computer and playing a fun neighborhood game of baseball is just as fun and much more beneficial. This is just one step @CAPS3 need to take to get a healthier lifestyle. Wouldn't you agree? Did you know that kids that spend more time on the computer are more likely to do poorly in school? Surely, if nothing else will convince you of the negative effects of a computer, this will. Instead of coming home and doing homework, more time is spent in front of the computer. As a student, I will admit that the computer is a very tempting distraction and can easily pull a student away from their studies. You can't expect a child to make the right decision and tell themselves they have to go because they need to study. So you do! Take action now, or your child will definitely suffer. The time has come to decide. Do you believe computers have a negative effect on people? It's clear that the computer is not safe. Not to mention, too much time is spent on the computer instead of being active. Most importantly, computers will negatively affect children's grades. Don't wait another minute! Let's agree and do something about this!
1757	1761	1	3	Dear @PERSON1, Computers are very helpful in daily activities, but computers have a bad side. Some users are addicted to their @CAPS1 or @CAPS2. They end up being away from friends and family, and they don't exercise. It's fun to use the @CAPS4, but you should not use it too much! Some people are almost completely addicted to their @CAPS4. I can't blame them. They can charge their iPod, tweet, listen to music, play games and do much more all at the same time! Computers are great, but using it too much can make you miss out on tons of real - life activities. People almost feel (some actually do) that they HAVE to go on Facebook to harvest their crops in Farmtown, or control their @LOCATION1 on @CAPS3. They get so wrapped up in it that they miss out on their important daily activities. It shouldn't be that way, but it has become an epidemic. Everybody is being sucked into their computers! People who are on their @CAPS4 for long hours are away from their friends and family. They might be like “Oh, I haven't talked to him since his surgery. I wonder how he is! Let's see!” They go on and... You can talk to someone in just a click! But talking to someone on Facebook or Twitter is not the same as talking to them in person! It's like people think computers are the only way. The @CAPS4 takes people away from their friends and family and makes them talk only on Facebook. When people are on the @CAPS4, they become lazy! A person who is a @CAPS4 addict will say “I'm supposed to go to the gym but let me check my Twitter first!” Two hours later, then they go to the gym! People don't exercise as often as they should! When people plan to be on the @CAPS4 for @NUM2 minutes, it ends up taking @NUM3 hours! They have to sign in, chat with their friends, check their mail, look at their tweets, look at their restaurant reviews, check out videos on YouTube and do all other kinds of things! Computers are good but have side - effects like getting addicted, being away from friends and family, and not exercising. @CAPS4 addicts should minimize their time on the @CAPS4 to lead a more balanced life.
1758	1762	1	3	Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 are worried that people are on the computer way too much and don't spend enough time outside enjoying nature or exercising. I wrote this letter to tell you that there are some good things about going on the computer. First, kids and even adults can talk to their friends online. You're probably thinking that the kids already see their friends at school, but what if their friends have moved. They could have moved to a different city, state or even country, and the only way to connect with them is by using the computer. They can't call each other because they're really far away, and that would result in a pretty high phone bill. Seventy - five percent of people talk to their friends through the computer. About half of the people are talking to friends who live in another state or country. Do you really want people to lose their friends? Next, people can actually make new friends on the computer, like pen - pals. Pen - pals are people you write to but they don't live in the same state as you or sometimes not even the same country. It could be an assignment at school, but you can do it on your @CAPS2. If your pen - pal doesn't live in the same country as you and doesn't speak fluent @CAPS3, you can teach them @CAPS3 and they can teach you their language. Finally, there's a way for kids to use the computer. You could set a limit on their computer time. If a child wants to play a game on the “@CAPS5” and plays on the computer one day, and the next day another child wants to go on the computer and throws a tantrum, the parent should take the computer away for the next day and so on. Once your child finally cooperates, they will get the chance to use the computer again. As you can see, there are many things to do on the computer, from talking to far - away friends to making new friends and setting up a computer schedule. Thank you for taking your time to read this letter.
1759	1763	1	3	Dear Local Newspaper: @CAPS1, did you know that over half our nation own home computers? Recently, though, some experts have been concerned whether or not computers benefit society. I have been asked to state my opinion and I believe computers have a positive effect because they are mandatory for work, allow online socialization, and expand traveling. After reading this, I am sure you will agree. Firstly, computers are mandatory to have for work and @ORGANIZATION1. Students keep their essays, study guides, and homework updates on files in the @CAPS5. Offices would not be able to function without computers; workers rely on the internet email system. An interview with a student from @ORGANIZATION1 says, “I use my @CAPS5 for everything; I would not survive the workload without @CAPS3.” When @CAPS2 asked why, he replied, “@CAPS3 keeps everything organized, and is an easier way to research topics.” A lawyer said, “You can not support a client if you don't have the right tools, and a @CAPS5 is one of those tools.” In fact, without computers, offices would crumble and students' grades would drop. Could you imagine writing a newspaper without a @CAPS5? Secondly, internet access allows people to meet new people. Many websites such as '@CAPS6' and '@CAPS7' allow people to reconnect with old friends, and make new ones. @PERCENT1 of the nation owns accounts on socializing websites, and @PERCENT2 of the nation says their friend groups have expanded (according to a poll taken). A psychologist explains, “Some people are too shy to meet new friends in person; they bloom online.” Without the internet, citizens in @LOCATION1 would know little about other countries' people. My next reason, however, is even greater. Lastly, without the internet, people would do far less traveling. The internet allows citizens to research places they would like to visit and buy transportation to their destination. @CAPS3 also is an easy and effective way of booking where the tourist shall stay. A poll taken by @ORGANIZATION2 airports shows that @PERCENT3 of the travelers book their flights online and without online ticketing, 'the wait to book your flights would be unbearably long; or stop travelers completely' (quote from a worker). My people and I went to various airports and train stations across the country and interviewed @NUM1 people each. We inquired about how they bought their tickets and @PERCENT4 of them said online. “What do you mean, how? On the internet, of course! No one could get anywhere if we stood in lines all day!” said a person interviewed. Airports make money for the @LOCATION2 government, and without the internet, less people would travel. Therefore, computers are mandatory. Computers have a positive effect on owners; since they allow easy organization and research, online socializing and better ways of booking transportation. Without computers and internet access, our business would crumble, then the economy would follow. I know you agree with me.
1760	1764	1	3	Dear @PERSON1, The advancing technology is showing a very negative affect on people. Because of computers, people are spending too much time on the computer and less time doing things that are better for them. First, spending too much time on the computer can be bad for your health in many ways. For example, looking at a bright computer screen for more than @NUM1 min at a time is extremely bad for your eyes. The intense brightness damages your eyes and can lead to severe loss of vision. Also, if you spend all of your time indoors and on the computer, you will not get the exercise you need. @PERSON1, were you aware that for every @NUM2 min you are on the computer, you should spend @NUM2 min outside. It is very important to get fresh air, sunlight, and exercise. Moreover, another problem with computers is that you don't get as much interaction with people. With online chatting, you can't know what the other person is feeling like, @PERSON1, or if you are even talking to the person you think you're talking to. It is much better to interact with people in person, face - to - face. To have good social health, you need to hang out with friends, laugh, and have a good time, not sit in a dark room and talk with online friends. @PERSON1, people need to interact with real people. Furthermore, computers can be very distracting to many people. For example, @PERSON1, say you needed to type up an article for the paper on the computer, but you decide to play a game for a minute, or look something up, or talk with a friend. You say that it will only take a minute and then you'll type the article. But when you stop, all of a sudden you've played for @NUM4 hours. Then you have to stay up later to finish. Computers are extremely distracting. People of all ages have this problem of being distracted by computers and not getting work done. In conclusion, computers, although an advance in technology, have very negative side effects. @PERSON1, I feel that it is our job to tell the people of the negative side effects of computers. It is our job to help people overcome the side effects of computers. Please @PERSON1, we need to help the people by writing an article in the paper to warn them of the terrible effects computers have, so that they can make more balanced choices in using technology.
1761	1765	1	3	Dear local Newspaper, I think that computers are good because you get to learn about other people, like famous people who died a long time ago. You can read about their lives, achievements, and the impact they had on the world. Computers are also great because you get to learn about other places like @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1, and Texas. Learning about different places is fun as you can explore their cultures, traditions, and landscapes. Having a computer is good because you get to surf the web. You could play games, see interesting videos, and have a lot of other experiences that you will like. You could talk to friends from far away. You can communicate through platforms like MySpace or Yahoo and other websites where you can talk to different people that you met through the web. In conclusion, computers offer a wealth of knowledge and entertainment, making them a valuable tool in our lives.
1762	1766	1	3	"Man has always been interested in technology. Computers are just one part of this technological fascination. I think that computers have a positive effect on people. They teach hand - eye coordination, save trees, and allow people to learn about everything. Hand - eye coordination is a key part in our everyday lives. Driving a car or writing all involve hand - eye coordination. I remember a few years ago I didn't have great hand - eye coordination; I had trouble catching a ball. Nowadays, I spend up to an hour and a half on the computers. I have noticed my handwriting getting neater and I can catch balls with ease now. Do you want to be the one to crash your car because you have bad hand - eye coordination? Computers not only increase your hand - eye coordination but they save trees too. Using a computer doesn't need any paper. You can read and write without using a single sheet of paper. Since the widespread use of computers, @PERCENT1 of tree cutting has stopped. Saving trees helps us stay alive. Trees put out the oxygen that we breathe in. Some say that computers are causing people to spend less time enjoying nature. I think that if it wasn't for computers, we wouldn't have much nature to enjoy anyway. Lastly, computers help people all around the world learn about almost anything. A science kid, the head scientist says that ""with the computer, we are able to tell the world of our discoveries much more quickly."" @CAPS1. @PERSON1 says ""@CAPS2 many people are learning a great deal thanks to the computer; they learn @CAPS2 many nutrition facts from the health sites"". Thanks to the computer, we found a doctor to help my dad get fixed. The average person can learn about non - average things any day. There are even dictionaries on the internet with many different translations that you would normally need about @NUM1 books to achieve. The computer is one of the greatest technological advances to this day. It has helped our world in @CAPS2 many different ways. Hand - eye coordination is @CAPS2 important, and it is also preserving our environment. If you don't have knowledge, you can't get anywhere in life. Our whole world depends on it. In conclusion, computers are truly a remarkable invention that brings numerous benefits to our lives."
1763	1767	1	3	Guaranteed, @NUM1 years from now we will still be using computers. People will probably be talking to friends, doing research on something, or typing up something for @ORGANIZATION1. Computers are wonderful and let us do so many things that we can't do by ourselves. Without computers, life as we know it would probably be way different. Firstly, computers let us talk to our friends and family. Allowing us to communicate with one another without leaving the safety of our homes. See, just recently a girl in @CAPS1 went over to her friend's home to do their homework together. When they were done, the girl tried to walk home, and she was never seen again. With computers, we can do homework with our friends without leaving our homes. Clearly, without computers, life as we know it would be way different. Secondly, computers let us do research about stuff we don't know about. Allowing us to do projects without having to look in old books that maybe don't have the info you're looking for. If it was to search for @ORGANIZATION1, it would give me a map pointing out its location and the school's website where I can find out my homework for that night. As you can see, the computer allows us to do things that would take us far more time to do regularly. Without a doubt, without computers, life as we know it would probably be way different. @CAPS2, computers allow us to do homework on them, whether it's research or just typing something up. It lets us do more capable things. Most of our daily homework is on the computer. Just @DATE1, we had to type a prompt up on vending machines in our @ORGANIZATION1. So far in @NUM2 grade, almost every night our homework is on the @CAPS3. If we were to forget to write down our homework, we would have another way to get this information. Obviously, without computers, life as we know it would be way different. Furthermore, computers are an advancement in technology that we use constantly. Computers let us look up valuable info on things around the world. They let us talk to friends and family around the world. They also help us achieve great things in @ORGANIZATION1, whether it be homework or classwork. Without them, it would take double to triple the amount of time to do something. Finally, I believe that people who are against them just haven't used them in the correct manner. In conclusion, computers have become an indispensable part of our lives, enhancing our communication, research, and learning capabilities.
1764	1768	1	3	I think the effects of the computer are bad. These are my three reasons why I think it's bad; @CAPS1, the computer could cause blindness to people when they spend too much time or hours on their computers. The bright light from the computer screen can be very harmful to our eyes. @CAPS2, people need to relax their vision and do something rather than being on their computers all the time. @CAPS3, people need to use computers for a less time. These are the three reasons why I think the effects of the computer are bad. The @CAPS1 reason why I think the effects of the computer are bad is that the computer could cause blindness to people when they spend too much time on their computers because the screen of the computer has too much light. People often find it hard to stop staring at the monitor, and even worse, they could probably lose their sight and end up with blindness. That's why you have to stay away from the screen. Being on your computer for too long is definitely bad. This is my @CAPS1 reason why I think the effects of the computer are bad because the computer could cause blindness to people when they spend too much time on their computers. The @CAPS2 reason why I think the effects of the computer are bad is that people need to relax their vision and do something rather than being on their computers. When people are on their computers for too much time, they just can't come downstairs to talk with their family or friends. They can't go outside and enjoy the beauty of nature and the pleasures of the outside world. Also, if they have nothing else to do, they can just read a book, draw, watch the @CAPS4, etc. They could do those things rather than wasting their time on their computers. This is my @CAPS2 reason why I think the effects of the computer are bad. The last reason why I think the effects of the computer are bad is that people need to use their computer for a less time. When people use their computer for a less time, it is good because now they can finally be with their family and friends and spend a lot of time with them. It is also good for saving energy and preventing you from paying a large electrical bill. Also, it is good to finally let your eyes relax. In conclusion, the three reasons; @CAPS1, the computer could cause blindness to people when they spend too much time on their computer. @CAPS2, people need to relax their vision and do something rather than on their computer, and @CAPS3, people need to use their computers for a less time clearly prove that the effects of the computer are very bad.
1765	1769	1	3	Dear editor, I think people are using computers too much and are not benefiting as much as they are losing from it. People are getting less exercise, not seeing nature, and not spending as much quality time with their family and friends. Read on to find out more. First of all, people are not getting enough exercise. Especially children, they spend too much time on computers and are becoming overweight. America is in a crisis with child obesity, and computers have contributed to that. Many adults are also overweight because they sit at computers and work or play games all day. I reason that computers are more unhealthy for us. Secondly, people are not going on hikes or trips to see the beauties of nature. Earth has many things to offer, new things to explore and discover. People could be discovering many great wonders. Finding new species, whether it's animals, fish, or plants, is something you need to explore nature for. There are many out there waiting to be discovered. This is reason @NUM1 why computers are not benefiting us. Thirdly, family and friends are not spending as much quality time together as they should. Relatives you talk to over computers, why not talk to them in real life? Friends chatting online on Facebook, AIM, and things like that, why not talk to each other in person and create fun memories together? More kids are spending time on the computer than sitting down eating a family meal together and experiencing what a family should talk about. This is reason @NUM2 on why computers are not benefiting us. In conclusion, computers are taking over our minds, and we're not getting enough exercise, seeing the beauty of nature, and spending enough time with our families. We should limit our computer use to regain a healthier and more balanced lifestyle.
1766	1770	1	3	Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3, experts have long been concerned that people are spending an excessive amount of time on their computers, which they believe is harmful to health. However, they are wrong. Computers offer numerous benefits, helping people communicate, learn, and enjoy entertainment.  Computers are excellent tools for communication. They enable people to stay connected with family and friends. Some might think that phones are better for communication, but computers have an edge, especially for long - distance communication. You'll never encounter a busy signal when using a computer. Additionally, some phone services can be quite costly, especially for long - distance calls. In contrast, you can send emails across the globe at no extra cost. With a computer, you simply send your message and can go about your business while waiting for a reply, without the hassle of being put on hold.  Computers also play a crucial role in education. Many individuals, especially those taking college - level classes, are turning to online learning. In fact, around half of the current college students aren't physically present in a school. This is a great option for those who work long hours as they can earn their degrees at their own pace. Moreover, computers can assist with everyday queries like finding the nearest @ORGANIZATION1 or checking the price of an item. They can even help in planning a vacation or learning about a distant country.  When it comes to entertainment, computers are a treasure trove. People in need of a pick - me - up can simply click a button to watch a funny video. Bored individuals can choose from countless games, ranging from simple and pointless ones to highly addictive and large - scale games. For music lovers, the computer is a great alternative as songs and music videos can often be accessed for free. And if portability is a concern, there's always the option of a laptop.  Based on what you've just read, it's clear that computers significantly improve people's lives by providing education, facilitating communication, and offering entertainment. They are an indispensable part of modern life.
1767	1771	1	3	"Computers, a controversial topic if you ask me. Sure, they aren't very good for you if misused, but that doesn't mean that when used correctly, they can't be a valuable part of life. Computers are helpful in many ways; they can serve as an information hub. The social networks available on computers can help your kids become more interactive with the world. During school, kids often have projects, and without computers, it would be a real challenge. Read on as I will explain in detail.  Computers are one of the world's greatest information sources. @NUM1 out of ten people surveyed said that computers are an essential part of everyday life. Take the earthquake in Haiti, for example. It's in the process of recovery now, but half the world wouldn't know about it without computers. So, have a heart and don't take away the most valuable source of information in the world.  Secondly, it's a sad fact that kids are more socially withdrawn than ever. Over @NUM2 of the world's population relies on interactive websites to communicate with each other. In fact, children have more online friends than ever before. You don't want to be the one in the middle of this, do you? Do you want to be known as the person who kept kids from having a fulfilling social life? I don't think so.  Lastly, all students in school use computers for projects. For instance, @PERSON2 had extremely poor handwriting, and this was the biggest project of the year. So, he turned to his computer to type it. But what if there was no computer? @PERSON2 would have gotten a @CAPS2 - for the project. In fact, teachers often tell kids to type their homework or projects. @PERSON1 says, ""@CAPS3 year, kids pass my class by typing, and if they couldn't, they would all flunk!"" @CAPS4 gets the point, but more importantly, do you?  To sum it all up for those of you who are too lazy to read the whole essay, computers are used for everyday needs such as finding information, making friends, or doing projects. So, are you going to be the person who sits back and lets the potential of computers go to waste, or are you going to take action and embrace this valuable tool? It's your choice, but think about the socially - awkward, under - achieving kids who might fail the grade @CAPS3 year because of a lack of access to computers."
1768	1772	1	3	Dear Newspaper Readers, have you ever thought about how many hours a day you spend on the computer? In this modern world, it seems hard for many of us to tear ourselves away from that trusty computer screen and face real life. Nearly everyone in @LOCATION1 has a computer, about @PERCENT1, but this widespread use is causing problems. With so many hours wasted in the virtual world, people are lacking in exercise, which is leading to a host of health issues. They are also avoiding the beauty of nature outside and losing touch with family and friends. I think that computers are causing far too many problems, and perhaps, after considering my evidence, you'll come to the same conclusion.  Statistically, @ORGANIZATION1 is one of the most overweight countries. One of the reasons? Hours spent sitting at the computer replace healthy exercise. We're all spending so much time on computers, and sitting and clicking isn't exercise. This lack of exercise is causing serious health problems. Not exercising can lead to obesity, which puts a great deal of stress on joints. Then, diabetes may develop, reducing the quality of your life. Finally, there's heart disease, a leading killer in our country. All this from spending too much time on the computer? You might ask, but the amount of time we spend on computers is even more damaging than this.  Every day has its own beauty, and sometimes what's beautiful to us in the outdoors is a clear sky and a pleasant temperature. These days come quite often, but what do we do? We glance out the window and then go back to texting on our laptops. Our bodies need sunlight and fresh air. We get vitamin D from the sun, and without going outside, we don't get enough of it. Not traveling outdoors deprives our bodies of an important nutrient.  The over - use of computers affects more than just our health. Staying inside on the computer keeps us from having real - life experiences. We learn things on the computer, but only in a virtual sense. What happens when we're forced out into the real world and can't really do anything? Everyone loves having friends and family, so it doesn't make sense why we'd rather email them with trivial things instead of having a face - to - face conversation. Instant messaging doesn't really strengthen our bonds as conversations are often pre - planned, and the person doesn't get to know the real us. This frays the relationships between people, and if we can't work together with our family and friends, our society can't function properly.  Computers take away too much when we spend so much time on them. Clearly, they are bad for people. They not only cause obesity but also make us think we can do things that we can only do virtually and drive a wedge between close people. It's ruining @LOCATION1. A country can't thrive with a population that is sick, unproductive, and isolated. It's time to step away from the computer and embrace real life before @LOCATION1 is further damaged by the negative effects of computer over - use.
1769	1773	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1 newspaper, I've recently read that some people don't agree with the widespread use of computers. They believe that people use them all the time. I disagree with them.  One of the reasons I disagree is that computers give us the ability to communicate with others. This is a wonderful feature! What if your friend moved a few states away? Wouldn't you still want to stay in touch? With high long - distance phone rates, many people can't afford frequent phone calls. And how would you see your friend anymore? Well, with the computer, you can send pictures or have a video chat. Also, if you just want to send a short message like ""see you at @NUM1"", it's free on the computer, unlike on the phone where you might have to pay extra.  Computers also teach hand - eye coordination, which is essential in the real world. You can play games, take quizzes and tests, attend online classes, and even listen to music, which is important for self - expression. There are also websites that teach you how to use a keyboard and operate electronics like a computer.  Lastly, the computer allows you to explore far - away places without actually being there. This is extremely helpful when doing a project on a place you've never visited, planning a family reunion or vacation, or finding a sunny spot for some fun. Many people think that too many people are staying in front of their computers instead of exercising and being outside. To address this, they should simply limit their computer and electronic device usage per day and then go out for some exercise or visit a new place.  So, the computer teaches hand - eye coordination, enables communication with others, and allows you to discover far - away places. Don't you think that's great? It's clear that computers have a lot to offer and are a valuable part of our lives. We should make the most of them while also maintaining a healthy balance."
1770	1774	1	3	"Dear @ORGANIZATION2 (our local newspaper), it has come to my attention that more and more people have begun to use computers. This is a great advancement in our society! Computers have a positive impact on people because they teach hand - eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. @ORGANIZATION1, computers are truly making a great impact!  Firstly, computers have a positive impact on people because they enhance hand - eye coordination. This skill is useful in daily life all the time! Statistics show that sports players who own computers are @PERCENT1 more proficient at activities requiring hand dexterity (like baseball or basketball) than those who do not own computers. Owning a computer also improves your hand - eye coordination in other activities. Something as simple as driving a car or doing the dishes becomes easier thanks to the improvement in hand - eye coordination that computers bring. This is a remarkable benefit that computers offer to people.  In addition to teaching hand - eye coordination, computers also help you learn about faraway places and people. The wealth of information available on computers is easier to access thanks to advanced technology. ""@CAPS2 I didn't use my laptop for my @CAPS3 @CAPS4 report,"" says @PERSON1, an @NUM1 - grade student, ""I would never have finished. Books take so long to search through, and I learned so much about my topic from my computer!"" If you're going on vacation, you can easily research your destination's location and culture using the computer's advanced search engine. Why wouldn't you use a computer when you can learn so much from it?  Finally, computers have a positive effect on people because they facilitate communication. They offer multiple ways to video chat, instant message, and even speak aloud to the person you want to communicate with. ""I had to move away from my best friend last @DATE1,"" says @PERSON3, a resident of @LOCATION1, ""With my computer, we can still talk to each other and stay friends."" Computers are definitely a great way to keep in touch with friends and family.  Computers have a positive impact on people because they teach hand - eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and allow people to talk online with each other. So, @PERSON2, the increasing number of computer users is a wonderful thing! Ask yourself this: how would computers have a positive effect in your life? They are an amazing tool that enriches our lives in many ways."
1771	1775	1	3	"Dear newspaper, In my opinion, computers truly do benefit society as they are like a large electronic dictionary, and they play a crucial role in helping our soldiers stay out of the line of fire. Computers are extremely beneficial to our society because they function as an electronic encyclopedia. Instead of tediously leafing through a dictionary page by page in search of a word, all you have to do is access the internet, go to @LOCATION1, and type the word into the search box. Instantly, all the relevant information pops up. When I'm tasked with writing a paper about someone, I typically turn to the internet. The other day, I had to write a paper on @PERSON1. So, I went online, found a reliable website, took detailed notes, rephrased them in my own words, and created a well - structured works - cited page. I found this method much easier than trying to find time to visit a library and then discovering that there are only children's books available on that person. Moreover, you can look up various places such as @CAPS1 @LOCATION2, or if you need to find the location of a place, you can use @ORGANIZATION1. Computers also benefit our society as they are like large cellphones with a huge keyboard. My big sister is constantly on the computer, using @CAPS2 to chat with her friends. This has significantly improved her typing skills. Additionally, there are new features like @CAPS3 where you can play games with your friends and have real - time conversations while playing. Lastly, computers are a great asset to our society as they help keep our soldiers safe from the line of fire. When I watch the show Futureweapons, I often see unnamed helicopters that can be controlled from hundreds of miles away. There is also a robot used for digging out mines, which has saved countless lives. When I interviewed @CAPS4 @CAPS5 from the military, he said, ""@CAPS6 use those helicopters all the time. @CAPS6 also love the fact that no one has to be in the helicopters, so @CAPS6 don't have to worry."" In conclusion, computers benefit our society because they are like big electronic encyclopedias, they are like big cellphones with huge keyboards, and they help keep our soldiers out of the line of fire. In school, @CAPS6 use computers all the time for writing papers and researching different things. Computers have become an indispensable part of our lives, enhancing our knowledge, communication, and safety."
1772	1776	1	3	"Technology, such as computers, is very significant in our lives. I believe that computers have a positive impact on people. People who use computers mainly utilize them to connect with family, conduct research, or present their work neatly instead of writing on paper. I firmly believe that those who think computers don't have a good effect on people shouldn't waste their time using one. @PERCENT1 of people use computers solely to connect with family. Usually, your family members either live far away or in another state, and you don't get to see them often. That's why I think video - chatting on the computer is a wonderful way to stay in touch. Also, if a family event comes up, you could @CAPS1 - mail @CAPS2 your family members instead of calling them because they might talk to you for a long time. Lastly, if you use social media platforms like MySpace, Facebook, or Twitter, you can connect not only with family but also with old friends. ""@CAPS2 my teachers appreciate it when I use the computer to do my work. They said it's a lot neater,"" said @CAPS3 Romano from Strong Middle School. Teachers prefer it when students use computers to complete their work. When you're writing a book report or a story, you'd want to use Microsoft Word or a similar program to write your paper, making it easier for teachers to read. Also, if you're in science class and need to create a chart, you'd use Excel to make the chart or graph look more professional. Lastly, if you want to give a presentation on topics like bloody @DATE1 or little @CAPS4 nine, you'd use PowerPoint instead of just reading from note cards. If people didn't have search engines like Google or Yahoo, they'd be at a loss. Computers are excellent for research. If a student has to do a presentation on something, they'd want to learn more about it and look up the topic. Also, if your family is having a discussion at dinner and you don't know what they're talking about, you can look it up online. And if you just want to find the lyrics to a song because you and a friend had a disagreement, the computer can help. Once again, I believe that computers have a positive effect on people. They are great for connecting with friends and family, for presenting work neatly, and for researching anything. Computers have truly revolutionized the way we live and learn."
1773	1777	1	3	Dear Newspaper, Computers have advanced significantly since their inception. Some people view computers as a means to rot one's brain, while others see them as a valuable learning device. Although computers have a negative impact when it comes to children, they have more positive aspects as they give people the ability to learn about far - off places and allow people to communicate online. To start with, computers can be misused as a babysitter for children. When a child is on the computer, they're just sitting there, staring at a screen filled with pictures and words. Some parents use the computer to keep their kids quiet instead of taking the time to take them outside. By growing up in such an environment, children only become accustomed to playing on the computer. Kids have a lot of energy and need to engage in activities that keep them fit and healthy, not just play games and talk to their friends all day. They talk to their friends at school, so they should spend time with family doing something productive. Using the computer as a babysitter can lead children to obesity because all they do is play games and don't take proper care of their bodies. On the other hand, computers give people the opportunity to learn about far - away places and people. If your teacher gives you a last - minute writing essay on @LOCATION2 that is due in a week, what can you do? You can't fly to @LOCATION2 and ask the @CAPS1 people what you want to know. That would be a waste of both time and money. And if you go to the library and they don't have any relevant books, you're in a difficult situation. But by using the computer, you can find an endless amount of information about @LOCATION2, and you could finish that essay in a day if you're efficient. Also, if you're planning to visit @LOCATION4 but know nothing about it, you wouldn't feel confident. You'd feel like a tourist. However, if you go online and search for @LOCATION4, you can find details about its traditions, clothing, and much more. Lastly, if you want to know more about a famous person who is no longer alive, you can go on the computer and find pictures, their achievements, and how they became famous. Finally, computers allow people to talk online with others. Say your grandma lives in @LOCATION3, and you can't call her often because your phone bill will be too high. What do you do? You talk online since both of you have computers, and it won't cost you anything to call. For example, my grandma and grandpa both live in @LOCATION1. When we call them, it costs a lot because they're so far away. When they got a computer, we each bought a webcam and started calling them every day on @ORGANIZATION1. Now, not only can we talk to them, but we can also see them. If your friend doesn't have a phone and you really need to ask them for the homework, you can go online or use platforms like AIM or Facebook to ask them. You know you can always get an answer because everyone is on the computer at some point during the day. Although computers have a negative effect when it comes to children, they have more of a positive effect because they give people the ability to learn about far - away people and places, and they allow you to talk online with other people. Overall, with proper usage and supervision, computers can greatly enhance our lives.
1774	1778	1	3	Dear Newspaper, I think that computers have a substantial impact on people. One of the negative aspects is that @CAPS1 people are not getting the exercise they need. Instead of engaging in physical activities, they are only exercising their fingers while using the computer. Moreover, when they are on the computer, they are constantly focused on the screen. Staring at a computer screen for long periods is not good for anyone's health, as it can cause eye strain and other related problems. Another reason why I think computers affect people negatively is that @CAPS1 people are not eating the right kind of food. They tend to grab something quick, like junk food, so they can get back to using the computer. All these factors have an adverse effect on @CAPS1 people. They may not go out as often as they should, and they might miss out on spending quality time with others. For instance, they could be missing family gatherings or outdoor activities that are essential for their well - being. These habits can lead to a sedentary lifestyle, which is associated with various health issues such as obesity, heart problems, and poor mental health. In conclusion, while computers have many useful features, we need to be aware of their negative impacts on our health and social lives. We should strive to find a balance between using computers and maintaining a healthy and active lifestyle.
1775	1779	1	3	"Dear @LOCATION1, *@CAPS1*. Now, I can effortlessly hear my favorite @CAPS2 tunes. With just a few clicks and by typing in a word, I am instantly watching a hilarious episode of ""@CAPS3 of @CAPS4 #@NUM1"". I navigate to my @CAPS5 page and enjoy the smooth feel of the cool keys under my fingertips as I send @CAPS7 to my friend in @LOCATION3. These are just a few of the countless things I can do on my computer. As you can clearly see, I rely on my computer for numerous tasks. I whole - heartedly support the use of computers and believe they are an incredibly useful resource. But the benefits don't stop here; I have many more reasons for using computers. They're not all that bad. Primarily, if you want to save money on gas, @CAPS6't Use @CAPS7 @CAPS8!! I can't emphasize enough that if you need to talk to a friend who is far away, @CAPS6't drive and waste gas, or even waste money on long - distance calls. You can go to @CAPS5, Facebook, Twitter, or other similar platforms that will save you both gas and money. Some people want to talk to their friends in @LOCATION2 but don't have access to these computer sites. You should persuade them to join! Another concern some people raise is, ""You need to get out and exercise."" I have a simple answer. Most people @CAPS6't know the correct ways to exercise. As a result, they often end up hurting themselves. If they just went online and discovered that they could do a painless, cost - free, and fun workout that is highly effective, they would avoid getting into so much physical and financial trouble. Also, others complain that people need to @CAPS10 more out in nature. Well, I say, what if you encounter a wild animal that you know nothing about, or say you were lost for days and didn't know what you could or could not eat? Like I @CAPS9 say, ""@CAPS9 @CAPS10 @CAPS11"" remember @ORGANIZATION1. Finally, if you're doing a report or something formal, you want @CAPS7 to look presentable, right? Well, @NUM2 out of @NUM3 people in the @LOCATION4 have messy handwriting, and 9/@NUM3 teachers often misinterpret words that are messily hand - written. This clearly shows that if you use a computer, @CAPS7 will not only display the word you wrote accurately but also correct any spelling mistakes. In conclusion, there are numerous benefits to using a computer. Let's recap: computers can save money, time, and gas. They can provide useful information in the real world. They can also correct spelling mistakes and prevent issues related to legibility. Act now!!! Show others that there are benefits to using computers, show them all the wonders of this amazing machine, which is not only a time - saver but also a life - enhancer."
1776	1780	1	3	"Dear Newspaper, I firmly believe that computers were one of the best things ever created. They offer a remarkable ability to talk to people in far - off places, whether they're across the globe or even in space. Moreover, they are invaluable tools that help you learn about career and education choices, presenting a wide array of options. You can also delve into many subjects, from the basics to in - depth knowledge. Computers are here to assist society, not harm it, so why shouldn't we use them? With computers, we can engage in seamless conversations with people around the world or in space, for that matter. You might not realize it, but all of the communications in the world rely on a computer. However, they're not the kind anyone could simply go out and buy. There are satellites that orbit the planet from space. Professor @PERSON1 at @ORGANIZATION1 told students at @ORGANIZATION3 that, ""A lot of everyday items, such as cars and phones, all use some kind of computer technology."" Modern computers let people communicate with each other effortlessly. In addition to facilitating communication, they help millions of people make well - informed educational and career choices. Most kids going to college have limited knowledge of the numerous colleges out there. When my sister was picking a college, she was at a loss. She sat down and looked up hundreds of schools. After narrowing it down, she made her decision and picked @ORGANIZATION4, a college she had never even heard of a couple of months ago. People often find themselves in this type of situation. At @ORGANIZATION2, a survey was taken among all the students to see what they wanted their career to be. For the rest of the week, students got to experience different career options. A significant percentage (@PERCENT1) of the students picked a different career after that one week. Have you ever heard the old adage ""Knowledge is power""? Well, it's true, and computers are a great source of knowledge. They cover many different subjects like math, science, history, language, and much more. People should be utilizing this knowledge, as @PERSON2 said at the @CAPS4 Francisco national debate, ""@CAPS5 are a great tool when used properly, which includes looking up new places, doing math, and even communicating. These are what computers should be used for, not unhealthy games."" You can learn about many new places with a computer. In @NUM1 grade, my teacher had everyone do a report on a country. My friend and I found a place we had both never heard of. With the computer, we found tons of information on it, such as its main income, exports, resorts, and fun activities. After reading all the facts, surely one would agree that a computer is a great tool that should be used. It allows people to communicate, aids in educational decisions, and helps you learn many subjects such as math, science, and language. I strongly believe that all people should use a computer."
1777	1781	1	3	Mom!!! Did you know that the human body has only one liver? Honestly, I didn't until I found out through the computer. I recently heard that some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising and enjoying nature. But I don't think they should be worried because computers leave people with an open mind and teach them new things. Computers can do a great deal for a person's life of knowledge. They give you a chance to chat with friends far away, expand your mind about travel, and offer a wealth of information. Just yesterday, I discovered that the human body cannot survive without its liver. The computer also came to my rescue in my struggles with math. Even though that's what the teacher is for, she's not always available, like when I'm home or away on vacation and I just want to remember some things in math. It also helps people who want to learn new languages such as @CAPS2, @CAPS3, and @CAPS4. So, you can clearly see that a computer has a big impact on a person's life. Two days ago, I had a wonderful video chat with my grandparents back in @LOCATION2. After six years of not seeing them, they really changed, and I was starting to forget what they looked like. I was truly surprised that a computer could do a video chat from such a long distance. I don't understand why you experts are so concerned about computers taking away people's lives. Look at what it has done for my family. I know that if one of you experts' family members went away for a long time, you would miss them and want to talk. Some people, like those in the army, love video chatting because they get the chance to see their loved ones. A two - way ticket to @LOCATION3, to see all those beautiful sights and taste their wonderful foods. Look at that waterfall! Where is that? In @LOCATION4, @LOCATION1. Now I'm determined to go there. The computer has shown me places that I've never seen before. The computer is a wonderful thing. So, don't be concerned about us and what we do on the computer. In conclusion, don't listen to the experts. They don't know what they're talking about. For all we know, they use the computer more than we do. The computer can teach you new things, give you the chance to chat with family and friends far away, and open your mind to travel. The computer is not a bad thing; it's just making life a little better, step by step.
1778	1782	1	3	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I wholeheartedly believe that computers are a good source of technology. There are several compelling reasons for my stance. First, kids are in school for more than half of the school day. During school hours, they are actively engaged in learning and physical activities. How could children stay glued to the computer when they're in school, constantly moving around and getting a lot of exercise? After school, kids usually have homework to do or they go out with friends. Clearly, computers don't have a negative effect on people; if anything, they make them smarter. Secondly, if children have a computer at home, their parents should take on the responsibility of limiting the time and what exactly their kids do on the computer. The people who support advances in technology are correct. Computers open up imagination and learning. Parents of children with computers should be more vigilant. If they're worried, they should simply take the computer away. Additionally, parents should take their kids to different places more often so that the children won't feel the need to go online all the time. Lastly, computers are an essential way of contacting others. If you don't have a phone, you can use a computer to access your email or personal websites. People also need computers for schoolwork and their jobs. Another crucial use is for research and reports. We need accurate information, and computers can provide it. To conclude, my thoughts are very important to consider. Many other people would be too shy to write this and get it published in their local newspaper. I firmly state that computers are not preventing interaction with family, friends, or nature. We, as a whole, need computers to carry out daily life things. Without the ability to go online or save files, we would be at a complete loss. So, I will say again, please consider my ideas. Thank you.
1779	1783	1	3	"Dear @CAPS1, there are several reasons why I believe that advances in technology are harmful to our society. Firstly, it opens doors to strangers in the outside world, especially for teens, adults, and others. The problem is that you never really know who's on the other side of that virtual door. In chat rooms, people can misguide you into thinking they're someone they're not. For example, there's a show called Dateline. This show reveals how young teens put themselves online. Grown or young men click on a picture of a teen, and that opens up a chat line, like opening a door. You have no idea who's on the other side. These men online make these teens trust them and feel safe. Then they might say, ""Hey, can I come over sometime?"" The young teen, thinking they're a friend, might say yes. Remember, they don't see the man's picture. When he comes over, most of these men have ulterior motives. This is what happens on the Dateline TV show. Just imagine how many other kids or teens are out there doing the same thing, and the difference is they don't get caught. Secondly, advanced technology is harmful to our society because it takes you away from your family and friends. It makes your family, especially your kids, feel as if you love the computer more than them. It also distances you from your friends. If they invite you to go to the mall or have a drink, you might say you need to check something online. Gradually, they will start to move away from you. You will start to lose the people most important to you, all because of a computer. My last reason why technology can harm society is that it takes you away from living your own life and doing things you want to do. Online, there's a lot of stuff that everyone else says is cool, but you should do what you think and feel is cool. For example, if someone posts saying that @NUM1 guys think London is so cool and you should go there, but you've always wanted to go to @LOCATION1. Another issue is that you don't get enough fresh air outside. Your skin will get pale and unhealthy. In conclusion, although some people might think that advanced technology is good, they're clearly wrong. It opens doors to danger, takes you away from friends and family, and also takes you away from what life has to offer."
1780	1784	1	3	Do adults and kids spend too much time on the computer? Well, I don't think they do. Sure, they use it a lot, but it's mainly for entertainment. Kids need to use the computer as it's another excellent way for them to communicate with each other. Texting costs money, and so does talking on the phone. If a kid doesn't have texting, they can use platforms like Facebook to make plans with friends. What if it's a rainy day outside and there's nothing to do? That's exactly what a computer is for. Kids use the computer for a great deal of entertainment. There are tons of games to play, ranging from MMORPGs to RPGs. These games are available on different websites, and they're like a kid's own virtual outside world. Computers are also essential for doing research for school projects. You can find a vast amount of information and get pictures. While there are books, they don't always have everything you're looking for, and you can't cut pictures out of them. To get a good grade on a project, you need the resources that a computer can provide. Therefore, computers need to be used frequently for communication, entertainment, and school projects. They are an integral part of modern - day life for both adults and kids, offering a wide range of benefits that enhance learning and social interaction.
1781	1785	1	3	My opinion is that people should have computers in their homes. Computers are incredibly useful and should be utilized for important tasks like searching for jobs and other essential activities. People can efficiently do their work on the computer, which offers a convenient and organized way to complete various tasks. Moreover, it is a great tool for education. Parents can teach their children how to use a computer properly or let their kids go on the internet to search for kids - friendly educational stuff.  However, people shouldn't spend all their time on the computers. Spending excessive time on computers means spending less time with their families and friends. I firmly believe that people should spend more quality time with their families and friends rather than just sitting in front of the computer. But unfortunately, a lot of people use computers almost every day. This might worry their families as they see their loved - ones spending so much time glued to the screen.  People can also share their computer skills with their friends. They can teach their friends how to type on the computer and some interesting facts about history available on the internet. We should ask ourselves if people should spend a lot more time with their families and be truly happy about this time spent together. For instance, when there is a visitor at home, people shouldn't use the computer because it might make the visitor think that they are more attracted to the computer than to the guest.  Computers should give people the ability to learn about faraway places and gain knowledge from the internet. But not everyone agrees that people should use computers. Some are concerned that people can get overly attracted to it. And families are indeed worried about a large number of people using computers so much. On the other hand, other people think that it is a great idea to use computers a lot and spend more time on them than with their families. So, we really need to think about whether people should spend more time with their families and friends instead of focusing all their attention on the computers. In conclusion, while computers offer numerous benefits, we must strike a balance between their use and our real - life relationships.
1782	1786	1	3	Dear readers, I think that it's good and bad to use the computer too much. On the one hand, computers bring a great deal of convenience to our lives. We can access a vast amount of information on the internet, which helps us learn new knowledge, keep up with the latest news, and even develop new skills. For students, computers are valuable learning tools that can assist in research and online courses. In the workplace, computers improve work efficiency, enabling us to complete tasks more quickly and accurately.  On the other hand, excessive computer use also has its drawbacks. Spending too much time in front of a computer screen can cause eye strain, back pain, and other health problems. It can also lead to social isolation as people may become so engrossed in the virtual world that they neglect real - life interactions with family and friends. Moreover, the easy access to various forms of entertainment on the computer can be addictive, distracting people from more important things.  In conclusion, we should recognize both the advantages and disadvantages of using the computer too much. We need to use computers in a reasonable way, making full use of their benefits while avoiding the negative impacts. This way, we can ensure that computers enhance our lives rather than cause harm.
1783	1787	1	3	Dear - Local Newspaper, I agree that computers are good for society. Without computers, a lot of things couldn't be done. In modern society, computers have become an indispensable part of various industries, from finance to healthcare, from education to entertainment. They have revolutionized the way we live and work.  Computers are sometimes the easy way out, and that's why I love them. They almost make anything possible. For example, if you're an elderly person and your body is in a bad condition, making it difficult for you to move around, all you need is a computer. You can pay your bills online, which saves you the trouble of going to the bank. You can also search for a job online, expanding your employment opportunities without leaving home. Even shopping online has become extremely convenient, allowing you to browse through a wide range of products and have them delivered to your doorstep.  Computers are also great if you're feeling lazy. You can just lie in bed all day and use the computer to work or to go to the virtual mall and order things. All you have to care about is personal hygiene. Sometimes, computers take a lot of stress off you. You don't have to deal with ignorant co - workers or an angry boss. Everything seems to be okay when you're working on a computer.  Computers are also wonderful because they are the easy way out. But you have to make sure you get a good computer. Not an old one because it can break down easily. That's one reason why computers aren't so good. However, as I said, computers are very good. They might be a little pesky at first, but once you get the hang of them, everything is going to be alright. Remember, you can do almost anything with a computer. In conclusion, despite their minor flaws, computers have had a profound and positive impact on society, and their importance will only continue to grow in the future.
